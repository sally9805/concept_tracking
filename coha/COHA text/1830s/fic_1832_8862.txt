PREFACE . This play was written twenty years ago , in the youthful days of the Author , and performed for the first time at Richmond Hill Theatre , in January last , without any revision or corrections , and is so published . Should another edition be called for , the author hopes to be enabled to correct many of the errors which must have crept into its hasty representation and publication . PROLOGUE . WRITTEN BY A. A. LOCKE , ESQ. , AND SPOKEN BY MR . CLARKE . Too long the Muse , attached to regal show , Denies the scene to tales of humbler woe ,  --  Such as were wont , while yet they charm 'd the ear , To steal the plaudit of a silent tear : When Otway gave domestic grief its part , And Rowe 's familiar sorrows touched the heart . A scepter 'd traitor , lash 'd by vengeful fate , A bleeding tyrant , or a falling state , Are themes ( thought nobly worth the classic song ) Which feebly claim your sighs , nor claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confest , The private pang , that rends the sufferer 's breast : When sorrow sits upon a " Daughter 's " brow , And fortune mocks the youthful lover 's vow , All feel the tale  --  for who so mean but knows What father 's sorrows are , what lovers ' woes ? On your decree , to fix her future fate , Depends " Eliza " for her whole estate : Rich in your smiles , she charms the admiring town : A very bankrupt  --  should you chance to frown : For practice , then , suppose  --  this brief will show it  --  Me , Clarke the lawyer , counsel for the poet : Us 'd to the ground  --  I know ' t is hard to deal With this dread Court , from whence lies no appeal : No trickling here , to blunt the edge of law , Or damn 'd in equity , escape by flow , My client 's faults wo n't hurt another 's case , His crime , at worst , a bad attempt to please : And this his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no modern arts are tried . Should partial cat-calls all his hopes confound , He bids no trumpet quell the fatal sound ; Should welcome sleep relieve the weary wit , He rolls no thunders o'er the drowsy pit ; No snares , to captivate the judgment , spreads , Nor bribes your eyes , to prejudice your heads : To present pleasure he contracts his view , And leaves his future fame to time and you . Yet when so kind you seem , ' t is past dispute , We gain some favor , if not costs of suit : No spleen is here ; I see no hoarded fury ; I think I never faced a milder jury . Sad else our plight ! whose frowns are transportation ; A hiss the gallows , and a groan  --  damnation ! But such the public candor , without fear , My client waves all right of challenge here !

Captain Sedgwick Was it not well done , Jack ? I counterfeited the young favorite to a tee , and we had rode a full quarter of a mile before she discovered her mistake . Rig . Rigby I wish you joy , Dick , of your good luck . Then you have really got her in safe custody ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Really and truly ; but my triumph is far yet from being complete : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to overcome her rigid virtue . Will you believe it , Jack , the whole of last night was spent in supplications , which only met with disdain and contempt ? Rig . Rigby A bad beginning , Dick ; but it is only what we anticipated . Persevere , and you are sure to succeed . Sed . Captain Sedgwick I am not quite so sanguine as I was ; for when I attempted to force her into compliance , her screams soon brought the landlord of the house to her assistance . " He is an insolent Irishman , and without any ceremony burst into the room , although the door was locked , and promised ' to protect the dear creature ' to the last drop of his blood if the jontleman treated her ill ; altho ' he was her husband and a Captain to boot , he would not see any pretty lady treated ill in his house . " Thus terminated my first night 's adventure , and my only hope of success is in the story I am to tell the old gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt but he will believe every word of it ; and should she slip through my fingers , it is very probable he may turn her neck and heels out of doors without a hearing , and she , in a fit of desperation , perhaps , or out of revenge , will allow me to conduct her to the hymeneal altar . " Rig . Rigby In the meantime , hasten to the old gentleman ; tell him you are married ; get possession of her papers , which settles her mother 's fortune on her ; and then , Dick , fly on the wings of love to your charmer . Devote the remainder of the time to fawning and flattery ; to-morrow morning , on awaking , you will find her in your arms ; she will then be glad to fly with you to church to cover her shame in the ceremony of marriage . Sed . Captain Sedgwick This is the course we agreed upon ; but , my dear fellow , it is easier to plan than to execute . The girl is most desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; hat adopted darling ! Women , Jack , are all rakes by nature ; and you may rely on it , were it not for sentiments of shame , there are very few who would give themselves much trouble about what is called their virtue for the sake of virtue . No , Jack , were it not for " the world 's dread laugh , " women would be as eager to throw themselves into our arms , as we are to have them there . Rig . Rigby But you were about to state some difficulty , " which , in your dissertation on women , seems quite to have escaped you . " " Sed . Captain Sedgwick The great difficulty will be to get possession of her papers . You know , Jack , what a passionate old dog Sir Gregory is ; I , myself , am rather irritable , as you also know . In the sudden burst of his passion , after I have broken the affair to him , I fear my patience will not hold out . Indeed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering him ; but I will do my best ; and if I fail on my first interview , I will try again . " Rig . Rigby I think the greatest , difficulty will be to persuade him of your marriage . That point accomplished , I make no doubt you will get the papers without any opposition . Sed . Captain Sedgwick At all events , it will not do to hazard matrimony without knowing on what footing I shall be with regard to fortune . It will therefore be necessary to gain possesion of these papers , and leave nothing to chance : but I must to business . Let me see you in the evening , and you shall hear the result . Rig . Rigby At the Dragon ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Yes ; it is an Inn of very good repute , tho ' not frequented by people of the first fashion ; I preferred it for this reason , thinking we were less liable to be discovered ; but I do not feel altogether easy even there , and shall look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first interview with Sir Gregory . Let me see you in the evening ; till when , adieu . Exit . Rigby Rigby solus . I envy Dick the possession of this girl ; still she must be his . I would not hazard what he is about to undertake , for her whole fortune . " It will be a downright felony if he gets her papers , and should not succeed with her . He is to seduce and then marry her ; his first attempt has proved abortive ; he must try again ; again he may fail ; she gives him the slip , relates the whole to her father , and then he arrests him . I have not yet appeared as an accomplice ; but the part I am to act , will necessarily bring me into the scrape should we fail ; " yet I am deeply interested ; I am to share in the spoil so far as it regards her money . " He has been for these three months dangling at her heels to no purpose ; she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Adderly is the object of her love , and her father 's choice ; my fortune is entirely dissipated , and I must replenish it somehow ; " and Sedgwich , as well as myself , is over head and ears in debt . If he does not succeed in this enterprise , we shall soon become inhabitants of one of those honorable establishments , the Kings Bench or Fleet ; and what is worse , should the deception be discovered , he will probably be snugly lodged in Newgate , and from thence transported to Botany Bay . Well , it is neck or nothing with us , and the prize in view is worth risking the danger . Exit . SCENE II .  --  A room in Sir Gregory Dunstable 's house . Enter Theodore . Theo . Theodore Adderly Eliza fled ! Is it possible ! " So much as she was beloved by her father , and so kindly as he doated on her , can she have left him voluntarily ? " Oh , God ! The thought distracts me . Fled , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion . " Does Sir Gregory know so little of me , whom he has reared as his own ; I who have been from childhood under his protection ; whom he has ever professed to love as his son , and has ever treated as such . What ? seduce the daughter of my guardian , my friend , my father ! S'death , it is an insult which I had little reason to expect from him ; but his officious steward has put him up to this , and his loquacious neighbor Brooks . O heavens ! what a mystery is this ! My Eliza disappeared ! " there is some villany in this ; she can not be false ! sure ' t is a dream  --  Eliza fled ! Just before she was missing she was locked in my embrace , and could she have flown from mine to another 's ? I left her but for a short time , and returning to resume my walk with her , she was gone . I thought it but a trick to teaze me , and paced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not return , I grew frantic .

Distracting thought  --  she can not be ! Where shall I fly ? What course pursue to find her ? Gone in a gig  --  gone where ? and with a man resembling me ? some villain has deceived her . " The shades of night were gathering thick around us when we parted . When I returned , oh , heaven ! she was not there . " Ah , should I be again restored to my Eliza , and a much loved child to a fond father 's arms , and by the man he has so grossly injured , it will be the happiest moment of my life . I will not despair . Rest shall be a stranger to me till I have succeeded in my undertaking . But here he comes . Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Where have you conveyed her ? Oh , tell me where ! Was this your love , to ruin my poor child ? for sure your object could be nothing else in tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure as she left me , and then for ever shun this house , thou miscreant . " Theo . Theodore Adderly Pray , sir , hear me ; let me convince you that your suspicions are unjust and unfounded . This unfortunate affair grieves me as much as it does yourself . Eliza was every thing to me ; I loved her to an excess beyond description ; but it was not sensual love ; it was the pure flame emanating from the heart . Do you think me a libertine ? " The worst of libertines , to glut my horrid propensities , if I'were such , on an object like Eliza ? Do you think me such a villain ? " Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable I do n't know what to think of it . Heaven grant you are innocent ! I hope , my Theodore , you are ; and if I have injured you , I am truly sorry . But you were with her  --  who took her away ? where did she go ? Theo . Theodore Adderly These are the very questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can answer them except Mr. Gray , who saw her driven off in a gig by some person resembling me . No exertions , on my part , shall be wanting to find her ; and I hope soon to restore her to you . Oh , fortune , love , and friendship guide me . Exit . Enter Lubin Gubbins Lub .

Sir Gregory Dunstable Blockhead !  --  Lub . Lubin Gubbins What do you say , zur ? Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable No trifling , sir ; who is that enquiring for me ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins Oh , I ax your pardon , zur , the gemman calls unself Captain Sedgwick . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Captain Sedgwick ? show him up . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , zur , I vool . Exit .

I have taken the liberty of calling to inform you of an affair peculiarly interesting to us both . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Indeed , sir , then I will thank you to be brief , as I am particularly engaged just now . Sed . Captain Sedgwick I wish to give you some information respecting your daughter . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Kind sir , how can I thank you ? Pray be quick , and let me hear it . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Well , sir , last evening , about sunset , as I was strolling through the lane which leads to the bottom of your garden , I beheld a gig at the garden gate , and your daughter in close conversation with a gentleman , who happened to be a particular friend of mine , and who had previously informed me that he was violently in love with her , and that he had made many fruitless attempts to gain her hand , which he had been refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the church , where they were married . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable O God , is it possible ! Who is the villain ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick O he 's a clever fellow , I can assure you , sir : one Captain Sedgwick . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Captain Sedgwick ! Are you , then , the villain ? O heavens ! Sed . Captain Sedgwick Nay , that 's going rather too far . Had you consented to our marriage , and given her to me honorably , I can assure you I should never have taken this measure . " But we were determined on having each other , and have been obliged to make use of foul means , when fair ones would otherwise have answered . We are comfortably settled , thank God , in decent lodgings , at a respectable Inn , called the Dragon , not far off . " Come , come , Sir Gregory , what is done ca n't be undone . I promise to make your daughter a good husband , and you a good son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , particularly those which settle her mother 's fortune on her , and am charged with a message from her , begging you to pardon our indiscretion , and receive us as your children . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Scoundrel ! villain ! puppy ! Leave me  --  away  --  begone  --  or I will send for all the footmen to horsewhip you out . Sed . Captain Sedgwick I will leave you to cool yourself , and the next time we meet , I hope to see you a little more collected ; I trust , then , upon mature reflection , you will see the propriety of giving me up what has now become my lawful right without any further prevarication . Exit . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Married to this wretch ! I 'll away to my attorney this instant ; I 'll cut her off to a shilling . Theodore shall now have all . I have injured him ,  --  I have wronged him ,  --  and this is the best recompense I can make him . I will away . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not set off yet . How shall I meet him after treating him as I have ? Exit SCENE IV .  --  The Dragon Inn . Enter O'Leary . O'Lea . O'Leary This poor lady that has taken up her lodgings here , is not very delicate to be sure , else she would have went dead before this . To be sure , that husband of her 's is the biggest baist I ever set my eyes on ; to be sure , it did'nt make my heart beat this morning to see how she strained her eyes a dear crature . Faith , here comes a jontleman of the gold lace order , I 'll be after cracking a joke or two with him . Enter Lubin Gubbins . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Be you Meister O'Leary ? O'Lea . O'Leary I know nothing to the contrary , my jewel . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Well , zur , there be one angel here , as I be informed as has run 'd away with one Capt . Sedgwick , and I be com 'd to zee about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see about her , my jewel . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Nothing , no more nor I heard as how she be in distress , and I wanted to zee what I could do for her , that 's all . You zee , I lives wi ' her daddy , his honor , Sir Gregory Dunstable , and I be his footman . O'Lea . O'Leary Well , my jewel , what has that to do with the matter ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins Well , no more nor as a body may say , that be a kind of recommendation . O'Lea . O'Leary And what might you call your name , my honey . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Lubin Gubbins . O'Lea . O'Leary Well , master Gubbins , and what has this self same recommendation to do with the fair crature in question . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Why , the question be , if you would let I zee her ; for as I heard as how she be in distress , I think , though I 's be poorish , I might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'Leary I 'll just tell you how it is , my jewel ; as you seem to be a pretty clever fellow , and think that you can do something to serve the lady , I 'll just take upon myself to let you see her just ; but mark me , master Gubbins ; if any donkey driver , or what not , dares cock an eye of affection upon this lady , I 'll be bound to say I 'll give him a nate drubbing . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Why , you beant fallen in love wi ' her yoursel ' , be ye ? O'Lea . O'Leary Arrah , my dear , I should advise you not to be after making such a judy of yourself . How in the name of St. Patrick , and that 's my own name , can I be in love with a lady that belongs to another man ? Och , by the powers , you put me in a passion . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Some volks calls it passion , I know , but they say as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , my jewel , be aisy ; I do n't want to affront you , upon my shoul . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Nor I you ; so you zee , if ye have no objection , I 'll go and zee the lady , and bide by what you told I. O'Lea . O'Leary Well , then , my jewel , I have no objection ; follow your nose till you come to a pair of stairs , and at the top of them stairs , my dear , you 'll see a door ; when you come to that door , just give a tap , my honey , and the lady will let you in , where you will be cheek by jowl together , as comfortable as two bugs in a rug ; and I do n't hesitate to think but that your own good manners will taich you not to misbehave yourself while you 're along with the lady . Lub . Lubin Gubbins That I sha n't , for certain ; zo I 'll bid you good bye till I zees you again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I did not come far from being in a passion once or twice , but I got off some how . Well , I shall just be after following Master Lubin Gubbins , to see what he 'll be after being about above with the lady . Och , if I catch him misbehaving , wo n't I give him the baiting ? Exit . SCENE V.  --  Sir Gregory 's house . Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable and Gray . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable You should be more cautious , Mr. Gray . I can not think how you could possibly mistake Capt . Sedgwick for Theodore . Gray . Gray There is no resemblance in their person , certainly , sir , but it being in the dusk of the evening , and having soon Miss Dunstable and Mr. Adderly a short time before , sauntering up and down the lane , I think , sir , you will allow that my mistake was a very natural one . " Had I not , I should have communicated the affair to you immediately . " " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brooks also should make the same mistake . Could I do otherwise than treat Theodore as I did , when I had such unequivocal proof ? Still I ought to have enquired further . " How shamefully I used him ! unfortunate young man ! this is a stab to his peace of mind which he will never recover : he loved her to distraction , and she , the dissembling , artful jade , appeared to love him with equal ardour . Intriguing huzzy , to conceal her intercourse with this scoundrel till the very moment of her marrying him . This is consummate art . Gray . Gray Perhaps , sir , you may even yet be deceived . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable How can I be deceived , when I have it from the the villain 's mouth ? Did he not demand her papers ? Would he have done this , had he not been her husband ? No , sir ! there is no deception here ; she is either his wife or his mistress ; and bad as she is , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray Perhaps , sir , she is neither . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Has she not left me ? Gray . Gray Yes sir ; but this Sedgwick may have told his tale to serve some artful purpose of his own . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable But how could he have known of her departure ? Gray . Gray Heaven only knows ; still I must think her innocent . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Innocent ! of what ? Is she here ? has she not eloped ?  --  clandestinely eloped , without one single cause of provocation ?  --  Fled from her father 's house , a kind , indulgent , tender , loving father ? Do you call this innocence ? But you would make her out worse than the wretch her husband has done , if he is her husband . It is idle , it is vain , Mr. Gray , to raise any doubts ; I have it from his own lips , and it is impossible it should be otherwise . Gray . Gray I feel a secret impulse , which assures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not belong before you find it so . ( Going . ) Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable If Theodore has not yet set off on his search request him to meet me in my study . Exit Gray Sir G. Solus . " Innocent ! yes , I trust she is innocent of pollution . But she is married to a libertine , a spendthrift , and a beggar . " Oh , wretched girl ! how have I been deceived in you . Could I have been so blinded by my love as not to see her cunning ? for I have ever thought her a model of her sex , and not her sex only , but for mankind at large Oh ! what deceptive , what bewitching arts she has used to deceive my honest , virtuous Theodore ; and he too , by love , must also have been blinded . Unhappy youth , unhappy parent ! But I will never see her more . I have discarded her . Exit . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  A room in Sir Gregory 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have escaped the villain ! But should my father think me guilty after what the artful wretch has told him , and discard me , " all my efforts will be useless ; I shall be in his power ; he will not surely be so rash ; yet his credulous disposition prompts him to place confidence in every thing he hears ; and he does believe it , so the wretch has told me . " The villain locked me in , thinking to make a prisoner of me till he returned ; but the good lrishman liberated me . What am I reduced to ! Oh , wretched Eliza ! What will be my condition should he spurn me from his presence without a hearing ? torn from my father 's house by a villain , I shall be a poor unfortunate wanderer , and the unhappy victim of perfidy . Oh , God ! the thought distracts me ! Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable What is your business with me ? Can you expect to find an asylum here when you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do you come on an errand from your husband . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable It is as I feared . My dear father , is it possible you can think me such a wretch , and can you be so cruel as to spurn me from you thus ? Have I ever given you cause to think me capable of such ingratitude  --  of such folly ? I have been vilely entrapped , and I have now just escaped from the fangs of a monster . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable I will not hear you , audacious huzzy . I have put you off . You are no more my child . If he is a monster , he is one of your own seeking ; but I have done with you  --  leave me . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable What ! will you banish me for my misfortune ? Consign me to the power of a wretch whose only object is to ruin me ? Am I deserving of this treatment ? And can you suppose that I left you voluntarily ?

I am innocent : " but if you choose to think me guilty , behold me on my knees a suppliant for mercy . Take again to your protection your only child . " Behold your offspring kneeling for pardon . ( Rising hastily . ) Ah , pardon did I say ? For what do I ask it , when I have committed no offence ? My brain is half turned , and I know not what I say . Sir G.

Never let me see your face again within these doors . Exit . Eliza Eliza Dunstable solus . Oh , hard hearted man ! what have I ever done to deserve this treatment ? Is it possible that my once kind and loving father can be thus cruel ? Have I not given him sufficient proofs of my affection to deserve a better return ? I will hasten immediately to the Inn  --  send her for some few clothes  --  and then fly from the world , and bury myself in the wilds of some remote place , where I shall be out of the reach of the prying eye of curiosity or the scoffs of an ungracious world .

When cupid in embrayo stands , With his dart pointed keen at the heart , The powers of love it commands , And infuses that pleasing dread smart . ' T is whiskey that melts down the soul , And to softest impressions refines ; Ah , who can its powers control ? For , with pleasure , sure love it combines . And potatoes for Pat are the fare , Which strengthen his body and mind ; This truth I will boldly declare  --  A weak Irishman where will you find ? And sure , then , potatoes and whiskey , To Pat are the sources of life ; They make him so brisk and so friskey , So fond of good cheer and his wife . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Thank ye .

That is her room , and when she is there , she is not out of it , but when she 's out of it she 's not there . Do you suppose I keep by the lady 's side all the time , so as to know every time she goes out and comes in ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins Well , well , we wo n't say no more about it , as that be the case .

Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  A street . Enter Sedgwick and Rigby meeting . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Ah , Jack , most propos . Where are you going ? Rig . Rigby I was just on my way to your lodgings . How is your fair incognita to-day ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Very well , as far as I know ; but , damn her , I have something else to talk about . Suppose , as we are both in town , we give a call on our pretty captives in Titchfield-street . Rig . Rigby With all my heart ; but what success did you meet with the old gentleman . Sed . Captain Sedgwick He believed every word of my story , and his rage was so great , that he threatened to have me tossed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when I mentioned the papers , you would have thought he was standing barefoot on a red hot iron ; he danced about like a Merry Andrew . Rig . Rigby And he really believed every word ? Bravo ! The most difficult part of the business is accomplished : and have you seen your fair one since ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Within these two hours . I rode immediately from the Dragon to town , and had just alighted from the horse , when I met you . Rig . Rigby Indeed ! and how did she receive the news ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick I'faith she had it from Sir Gregory himself ; for you must know that my back was no sooner turned , than off she was like a shot . The old gentleman has discarded her ; and , when she appeared prostrate before him , begging , in the most supplicating manner , that he would hear her story , fled from her in the utmost fury , and had her turned out of doors . Rig . Rigby And so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son and daughter ! Sed . Captain Sedgwick Yes ; but I took care to remind him that I should call again for the papers . You would have cracked your sides with laughter to see what a passion he was in . Rig . Rigby And you really made him think you were married ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Certainly ; for which , as I said , he has discarded his daughter . Rig . Rigby Is it possible that he put such confidence in what you said ? Why , he must be a fool , indeed ; if I were the girl , I 'd take up with some fellow out of revenge ; there rest your hopes . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Yes , revenge or desperation , or both , seem to promise almost certain success . She has no other resource at present . To-night , Jack , will be the time of trial ; and , if I succeed , to-morrow will see us man and wife . She has returned to the Dragon . Is this not a voluntary surrender ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy man . Rig . Rigby You see how truly I prophesied . It is just as I said . The moment you have secured her , away to the old gentleman , and if he still refuses you her papers , sue him ; the law will soon force them from him . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Our credit will soon be re-established , and our fortunes made : but come , jack , we will discuss the matter as we go along . Exeunt .

Thornton I received your letter just as I was setting off ; but may I enquire , sir , how you are ? your looks denote ill health . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable That is occasioned by the state of my mind , which , in consequence of some domestic misfortunes , is far from being an enviable one . Thor . Thornton Indeed , sir ! I hope Miss Dunstable and Mr. Adderly are well ; I hope , sir , that nothing has happened of a  --  Sir G.

Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Thornton ; I repeat it , I am ruined ; the wound has come from a quarter you little think of .

Sir Gregory Dunstable Yes , sir , that paragon of excellence , as she has always been considered  --  that idol of my heart , my only child , ( will you believe it ? ) she has run off with an abandoned profligate , and is now the wife of a beggar . Thor . Thornton Impossible ! at least incredible  --  do I hear you right , sir  --  married to a beggar ? Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable He is no better ; it is one Captain Sedgwick , a notorious libertine and gambler . He has squandered away a fortune at the gaming table .

Is not this enough to make me look ill , Mr. Thornton ? Yes , it will soon break my heart . Thor . Thornton And how , sir , is Mr. Adderly ? I hope he will make you some amends for your daughter 's misconduct . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable I hope he is well , but I fear not ; he was her intended husband ; " and bears this distressing event with less fortitude , I think , than even I do . " He loved her , sir , with the most enthusiastic devotion ; and who could have thought her undeserving of it ? Thor . Thornton Who , indeed , could have thought it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome a passion which he sees has been misplaced . " Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable I sent for you , Mr. Thornton , on his behalf ; he is now of age , and I wish to know the state of his affairs , since I am about giving them up into of his own hands . Thor . Thornton Very right , sir ; and I dare say you can account to him for your proceedings to his satisfaction ; I have laid out the money in my hands to the best advantage , in the improvement of his estates in Buckinghamshire , and the farms will now rent for double what they did when I first took charge of them : I have brought with me an account of what I have received , and receipts for what I have expended .

SCENE V.  --  Rigby 's lodgings . Captain Sedgwick and Rigby discovered at a table drinking wine . Sed . Captain Sedgwick I do n't half like our landlord at the Dragon ; I am fearful he will blow the whole affair to Sir Gregory . Rig . Rigby You say she has told him all the particulars ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Yes , but he does not believe her story . Rig . Rigby Then , notwithstanding all she says , he thinks her Mrs. Sedgwick ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick So it appears from the conversation I had with him this morning , and he had the assurance to forbid me his house unless I could treat the dear cratur better ; for , though I was her husband , he would not stand by and see a pretty lady like her imposed upon . Rig . Rigby Then your present business in town is to procure fresh lodgings ? Sed . Captain Sedgwick Certainly , and I must secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to-night ; for nothing can be done where that arrogant Irishman is . The house we were looking at in this street will answer the purpose . What say you ? shall we take it ? Rig . Rigby We have seen nothing that is likely to answer our purpose so well ; therefore , I think we had better secure it immediately . But our bottle is empty , we will replenish it with another and then be off . Enter a Porter drunk , with a pormanteau . Rig . Rigby Who have we here ? Por . Porter Can you tell me who this thing is for , ey ? ( hiccups , throws down the portmanteau . ) Rig . Rigby Why , you drunken rascal , do you know where you are ? Por .

Captain Sedgwick Yes , but you have left his portmanteau . Rig . Rigby That goes after him , then . What 's this ? ( Sees a letter on the floor , and picks it up , to Capt . O'Sedgwick . ) This is for you , I perceive . Sed . Captain Sedgwick For me ! Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of this ? But the letter , I suppose , will explain . ( Reads . ) " To Capt . O'Sedgwich . " Sir  --  If you have any value for yourself at all , at all , I would advise you to keep your beautiful face away from here , for I can assure , my dear , nobody wants to see it . You need not be after bothering yourself at all , at all , about your clothes , my jewel , for I have sent them all to you : and look'e here , Master Sedgwick ; your wife , or the jewel that you call so , has given you the slip , you see ; " she has taken a trip to Yorkshire , my honey . Och , by the powers , what the deuce am I talking about ? To Yorkshire , did I say ? Do n't you believe it , my jewel ; I was only making a mistake , just ; " I sha n't tell you , my dear , where she 's gone , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my honey , that she 's gone away , and you will never get her again ; so you need'nt think she 's gone to Yorkshire , " for that was a bit of a mistake of mine , just : " so you need not be after going to look for her there , for you wo n't find her ; so , with all due respect for your good qualities , and the like , I bid you good bye . PATRICK O'LEARY . Why , the Irish rascal , did you ever see impudence to equal this ? What had I best do ? Rig . Rigby Pursue her . It is plain from what the fellow says , that she has gone to Yorkshire . Set off immediately , and it is more than probable you will overtake her . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Let 's away , Jack , we have not a moment to lose ; but what shall I do with this fellow ? how shall I punish him for his insolence ? Rig . Rigby Leave him alone  --  pocket the affront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as for punishment , that 's out of the question . Sed . Captain Sedgwick But Yorkshire is a large country . How shall we find out what part she 's gone to ? Rig . Rigby Bribe the servants at the Dragon , and if they can not tell , we may trace her on the road by enquiring at the different Inns . Sed . Captain Sedgwick We will make immediate preparation , and set off , within half an hour . Exeunt . SCENE VI .  --  A room in Sir Gregory 's house . Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable and Gray . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable You say he 's gone ? Gray . Gray Yes , sir . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Unthinking young man ! why will he pursue an object that never can be his , and who is so unworthy of his notice . He is now the only comfort I have left . I lost my wife without repining , and my beloved Adeline , who was virtuous and good ; I have learnt to bear affliction ; but Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only child I have left  --  for such I shall ever consider him and if he leaves me too , it will indeed break my heart . Gray . Gray That he will never do ; and oh , sir , let me entreat you not to be too hasty with your daughter . I really do not believe a syllable of what the Captain has told you ; and till you have some more convincing proofs of the fact , do not wrong her , sir , by casting her off unheard . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable I have received stronger proofs than you think for ; Mr. Brooks , who is a man of great integrity , is well acquainted with the whole affair , and informs me that my daughter has had frequent conferences with this Sedgwick . You know his garden joins mine ; he has therefore had opportunities of seeing what passed . Gray . Gray But , sir , may he not have mistaken Mr. Adderly for this Sedgwick ? Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Impossible ! He knows Theodore as well as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , sir , for the innocence of Miss Dunstable , and never shall forgive myself for doubting it a moment . I will not stand by and see a man grossly imposed upon , and a female barbarously treated . Indeed , sir , it is next to impossible Miss Dunstable , should be the wife of Sedgwick  --  she detests the man  --  and if she would not be his wife , certainly she would not be his mistress . " Had it been Mr. Adderly , as I at first thought it was , the case would have been very different . I am sorry if the freedom of my speech has offended you , sir ; I would not have taken the liberty in any other case , but I must speak my mind when justice requires it . " Exit Sir G.

I have proofs that are too strong to the contrary ; proofs that convince me of her guilt .

" Oh , did she but know the effect it has on her injured father ; " but here comes my officious steward again  --  he haunts me like my evil genius . " Exit . Re-enter Gray . Gray . Gray There he goes with tears in his eyes  --  this is my opportunity . Now , if ever , is the time to convince him he is deceived ; now , if ever , is the time to turn his hard heart . How unlike the man he used to be , is he now ! But he is imposed upon . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artful tale he hears , and is the dupe of every plotting knave . I must and will think Eliza innocent , tho ' at first I implicated her , thinking she had gone with Theodore . I never , from the first , believed she had gone voluntarily with Sedgwick .

Can it be possible that she would yield to the embraces of such an abandoned wretch as Sedgwick , " and even without going through the ceremony of mar. riage ? Is this the character to captivate my Eliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Impossible ! it can not be . Yet , what glaring particulars have I not heard to confirm the fact , and certainly it is almost impossible it should be otherwise . While at the Dragon , they occupied but one apartment ; but it seems the scoundrel used her ill , and she has left him for it ; " not married , if that be the case  --  though she never can be mine . Happy shall I be in restoring her to her afflicted father ; thrice happy if it is not too late to recall her to a virtuous life ; and perhaps time and a perpetual change of scene may obliterate , in some degree , the deep-rooted impression of her charms ; if not , it will at least do one kind office for me , and that I care not how soon ; it will cancel the debt due to nature , by paying which I shall be eased of every burden .

Your servant , sir . ( aside . ) Now this spalpeen has overheard my conversation to myself ; I 'll up to him . Your servant , sir : might I make so bold as to ax you if you know one Goody Gubbins about here ? Theo .

Pray , my dear fellow , where is she ? O'Lea . O'Leary Fire an ' ouns , did'nt I but just tell you , my honey , that I was searching for her myself ? Theo . Theodore Adderly True ; but do you not know which is the most likely place to find her ? O'Lea . O'Leary To be sure , man , she 's gone with that spalpeen to his mother 's , old Goody Gubbins .

Theodore Adderly I am glad to see you so cautious , but you have nothing to fear from me ; I am as much a friend to Miss Dunstable as you are ; my name is Adderly ; her father was my guardian . O'Lea . O'Leary Well , now , I beg your honor 's pardon ; I took you to be some friend of that blackguard Captain . If your honor plaises , I 'll step and make a few enquiries , just . Theo .

If you wish to see him , I will send one to you who will carry the mossage . Exit . Venire Venire solus . I see something like promotion in this business . Captain Sedgwick having taken off this girl , the old fellow will certainly apprehend him ; lawyer 's advice must be obtained ; I shall be employed ; the point contested , brought into court ; and , in fact , it will make a man of me ; for I am as poor as any of the rats in my office , who can find nothing to feed upon but parchment and packthread  --  and devilish little of that . Enter a Servant . Ser . Servant What are your commands , sir ? Ven .

Servant Very well , sir . Exit , laughing . Ven . Venire O , Law ! Law ! thou art a starving profession with all the honor and dignity that is attached to thee , unless thy votaries are propped up by such pillars as the worthy Knight , with whom I am now about to ingratiate myself , under pretence of serving the cause of justice , but having at the same time an eye to my own interest . A better plea certainly never was pleaded in any cause , than the one which I am in fact about to plead for myself , though nominally on behalf his daughter . And though I am but an Attorney , I shall act the part of a Counsellor by artfully appealing to his feelings , and by arousing that latent spark of parental love which will overcome the resentment of the man in the affections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set myself down as his Attorney General . Oh , what a ravishing prospect is here opened to my view ! To have the management of the immense estates of Sir Gregory Dunstable , would , in itself , be a fortune ; but in addition to this , it would bring me a vast accession of business from other quarters . Let me see . How shall I introduce myself ? It is devilish awkward for a man to introduce himself . But  --  hem , hem  --  I hope your honor will pardon  --  Oh ! here he comes ; now for it . Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable . Ven . Venire I hope your honor will pardon this intrusion . My name is Ezekiel Venire , by profession an Attorney . Having lately established myself in this neighborhood , my person is not known to your honor , though my name may have reached you , as I have been concerned in important causes which were tried at the last assizes , in which Mr. Serjeant Browbeat appeared as Counsel for my elients . Sir G. Sir Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , and I believe there are but few in these parts to whom it is not known ; all that remains for you now to do is , to acquaint me with your present business , as I am not much disposed for trifling . Ven . Venire My business , as I have already told your Honor , is that of an Attorney ; but my business with you ( altho ' certainly connected with my profession , ) is of a very delicate nature : pardon me , Sir Gregory , if I am diffident in proposing a subject which must be very near your heart ; it is in the cause of justice that I am now before you . I stand here as the humble advocate of the violated laws of my country , and as the instrument by which they may be redressed . The offence I at present allude to , ought to be followed up with the utmost vengeance of the law ; for it is one of the most atrocious crimes known to the laws of our country . It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as regards the individual who suffers , and relative , as it regards the country whose laws are violated . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable This is all very fine , sir ; but I am not yet informed what your business with me is . I must beg you will trifle with me no longer , as I have some affairs of importance which will oblige me to leave you rather abruptly if you do not come to the point at once . Ven . Venire The point no doubt will be contested if it is brought into court , and perhaps the character of the young lady may be roughly handled by the opposite counsel , both in cross-examining the witnesses and in summing up . However , innocence never shrinks from an investigation ; and justice , as hath been well observed , though often slow , is sure . In this case , your Honor will , I trust , see the necessity of adopting the proceedings I am about to recommend . It is said that she is innocent , and that the act was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Gregory , surely nature will plead in your breast the cause of your injured daughter . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Impertinent , audacious , trifling puppy ! How dare you assume the part of a dictator and moralizer to me , so much your superior in rank and fortune , your senior in age , and a stranger to your person , though not to your foibles . Do you think that my feelings are to be worked upon by such a thing as you are , or that age has so far absorbed my faculties as to render me blind to your cunning . I well know what you are aiming at , and so I did before you had said ten words ; but I will hear you out ; only be on your guard ; for if you awaken my resentment , you may rely on it you will repent it . Ven . Venire I humbly ask your honor 's pardon , if , in an unguarded moment , I gave too full a vent to my feelings . But I can assure you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg leave to offer you , will be the means of restoring your daughter to you , and of punishing the villain who has dared to inveigle her from you ; for , if I am rightly informed , he is no more married to her than I am . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Sir , whatever your motives are , I now tell you plainly I do not intend to enter into legal proceedings , and if I did , you are the last man in your profession I should choose to employ . As regards the young lady in whose cause you have been so eloquent , I have discarded her ; and were I ever so much disposed to take your advice , I have no claim on her , for she is married , which I firmly believe to be the case , your insinuation to the contrary notwithstanding . Exit . Ven . Venire So much for you , old boy ; I see you are not to be diddled by me . My touching eloquence , my forcible appeals , all went for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resentment , and was fired at the montion I made of his daughter , it somewhat moved him . I noticed his countenance , he turned pale : this is the string I must touch upon , and I may yet succeed . If I can only accomplish this object , my fortune is made ; the reputation of being his Attorney will soon bring me into notice with the surrounding gentry ; the resentment he talked of seems to be pointed more at his daughter than me ; if I can only turn the edge of it against the Captain , my object is gained . Let me see ; there 's the young Squire Adderly ; what if I attack him ? Love is a powerful incitive to revenge . A lucky thought ! I 'll hunt him up , and if I can prevail with him , he will prevail with Sir Gregory , and success will crown my efforts . At present , fortune is at a cursed low ebb with me ; I have but few clients , and those few are too poor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment money enough to procure an original writ , or even a common latitat . Zooks , this will never do ! I must make a push ! One fat client , like Sir Gregory , would set me on my legs . But I will to the steward ; nunc aut nunquam is my maxim . Methinks I have some paltry verses which I scribbled over in one of my gloomy fits ; oh , here they are , I 'll hum them over before I start . SONG . The law is my profession , A noted one I trow ; And I am in possession Of clients high and low . But few they are in number , And lukewarm is their zeal ; The law they leave to slumber , And me to beg and steal . Exit . SCENE III .  --  Changes to a room in Goody Gubbins ' cottage  --  a spinning wheel and other implements of rusticity are discovered , and Eliza is seen seated at the spinning wheel . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable It will soon be in my power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She is poor , and though I am at present destitute and forlorn , it will not long be so ; I have an ample fortune which it is neither in the power of a cruel father nor vile persecutor to rob me of , and shall have a supply of money as soon as I can arrange my affairs so as to appoint an agent in town to make me remittances : I am delighted with this place ; and oh , if I were here under happier circumstances , it would be a perfect paradise to me ; the harp and the piano I would willingly exchange for the loom and the spinning wheel , and to the enlivening hum I would unite my voice , and make a sweeter melody , with a heart at ease , than all the instruments of music could do without it .

They may be yet within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a vale of bliss , a complete Elysium ! But should he too cast me off ! Should he believe me the vile wretch I am represented ? Oh , my soul ! it is insupportable ; the very thought ! He can not surely be so duped , oh , no ! he can not ! Here , then , while I am alone , will I indulge the pleasing hope that he will find me in this solitary retreat , and with all his native enthusiasm for the sweet charms of retirement , resolve to spend his days with me here . SONG . Retir 'd in this lone cot I 'd live , My Theodore , with love and thee ; ' T is in thy power alone to give Such heaven-born rapture  --  shall it be ?

( While Eliza is singing , Goody Gubbins enters unperceived through a door in the back scene ; Eliza begins spinning . ) Goody . Goody Gubbins ( Aside . ) Dear lady , I believe she ha ' lost her wits ; ' T is a hard case for such a sweet , pretty Miss , to be turned out of such a grand house into the wide world , and have to come to this poor hole . She be indeed an angel , as son Lubin told I ; I thought it were some chantment when I were in the dairy , and so I com 'd softly to hear , and it were her beautiful voice . She is most desperately in love , poor lady ; I ha ' found that out , though she never told I. Eliza . Eliza Dunstable ( Giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! my worthy good woman , are you there ? Goody . Goody Gubbins Yes , dear madam , I be grieved to zee your ladyship at that wheel . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable It is the only little comfort I have . You do not , I know , wish to rob me of any enjoyment . Goody . Goody Gubbins Indeed , indeed , dear lady , if it do give you any pleasure , it would make I very happy to zee you do it ; but I 's sorry to zee your ladyship take on so ; all may be well yet ; his honor , Sir Gregory , may repent ; but he ha ' treated you very cruel for nothing at all . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable He has , indeed , treated me very cruelly ; but he is my father and I love him still ; he has been the best of fathers , but oh , how changed ! Did he only know the real truth of the matter , ( as he will , perhaps , when I am laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he only know the truth , I should not long be suffered to remain an outcast . It is no matter  --  I will stay here as long as you will keep me , and though I shall always owe you a debt of gratitude , it will not be long before I can make you a pecuniary recompense . Goody . Goody Gubbins O dear lady , you owes me no gratitude ; it be I as owes the gratitude for such a great lady being so condescending as to take up with my homely fare . But I do think summut more troubles your ladyship ; there be some nice young gentleman in the case , methinks , for I heard Lubin tell about one squire Theodore , and how he did take on when your ladyship was gone . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Indeed ! Did he really  --  and did he think me innocent ? Goody . Goody Gubbins Yes , surely , ma'am ; I 'll be bound to say so , for who could think such a sweet lady otherwise . Eliza . Eliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so ? Goody . Goody Gubbins I did'nt speak out of assurance ; I 's only a simple country body , and if I ha ' gin offence , I beg pardon . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Offence ! Oh , no ! I love you as a mother ; you have been more than a mother to me , for you have sheltered me under your hospitable roof ; you have provided me with every necessary of life from motives of pure benevolence . You misunderstood me when I mentioned the word assurance ; it carries a very different meaning to what you thought . Goody . Goody Gubbins And the young gentleman will come to you for certain , and comfort you if so be as how that his honor do n't come himself . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Will he surely  --  and will my Theodore come to the poor outcast Eliza ? " When will he come ? Did your son tell you he was coming ? Goody . Goody Gubbins No , Mistress ; but he said as how the man at the Inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young gentleman where he could find un , or else , mayhap , he would send word if he did not go unsel . " Eliza . Eliza Dunstable It is strange he is so long ; surely he will not forsake me ; he must know me too well to believe the infamous tale  --  he can not wrong me so much . But appearances  --  oh , they are black against me ! Should be abandon me too ! Why does he keep me in this state of suspicion ? Why not fly to me on the wings of love , and vindicate my injured reputation and my honor ? Why not pursue the wretch who brought me to this state of misery , with all the vengeance of an injured lover ? Goody . Goody Gubbins Indeed , dear madam , he will do it all ; I knows he will from what son Lubin told I. Eliza . Eliza Dunstable What , my dear Goody , what did Lubin tell you ? Goody . Goody Gubbins As how he were the sweetest gentleman he ever seed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find un . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Then we may still be happy in each other , and bid defiance to a treacherous world . Such wrongs as mine , so unheard of and unjust , are worthy such a champion as Theodore . My mind is easier since I have heard this news , and I will take a solitary ramble , if you can spare me for a little while . Goody . Goody Gubbins I hardly know how I can spare you , ma'am , for I do find such pleasure in your company . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable I will soon return ; till then adieu . Exit Eliza ; Goody takes her seat at the spinning-wheel . SCENE IV .  --  An Inn . Enter Sedgwick and Rigby . Sed . Captain Sedgwick It must be her ; let 's see  --  what is the woman 's name ? Rig . Rigby I think he called her Goody Gubbins . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Her son is footman to Sir Gregory . How fortunate that we should trace her to the very spot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best plan will be to leave the postillion at this Inn , because we want no more witnesses of our transactions than we can help ; we must take the chaise , however , with us , and that we can drive ourselves . When we have got our fugitive , we will stop here and take up our driver . Rig . Rigby Every thing seems to favor our wishes ; for it was the general opinion wherever we stopped , that she was either running away from a husband , or after one ; her distressing appearance and the garb of her companion , the booby footman , all encourage this idea . Sep . Captain Sedgwick Egad , Jack , we are lucky dogs : the special license I have brought with me will gain me a passport to the altar of Hymen ; but if she continues obstinate , we must drive further north , and at some obsure Inn get admittance into a private room , by means of a golden key  --  you understand me ? Rig . Rigby In plain English , you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ? Rig . Rigby Yes , from the landlord and landlady down to the groom and scullion : this will make them all deaf to her cries , and I must succeed , Rig . Rigby That is conditionally , provided she will not go with you to church . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Conditionally , Jack ? Think you she will not come too , when she finds herself beyond the reach of aid ? Rig . Rigby She can have no alternative ; it will be the only salvo for her reputation . Sed . Captain Sedgwick If not , it is for ever blasted ; I will pronounce her shame to every individual in the house , and they will all be so many engines in her ruin . For this reason I have a particular place in view , where my gallantries are well known and approved of . It is such an Inn as I have mentioned , a few miles from hence ; and it will be some satisfaction , should our plans be ruined through her , that our ruin will be accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge . Rig . Rigby Never anticipate evil , Dick , we have now every thing to hope for , and very little to fear ; and unless we have the devil 's own luck , to-morrow will see all our plans fulfilled . This night I much doubt the propriety of proceeding any farther . It is now late in the day , and Goody 's cottage is a good two miles from here , as our landlord tells us . Suppose we conclude to suspend our operations till morning , and in the interval we will canvass the thing coolly and deliberately , and have a regular digested plan to act upon . Sed . Captain Sedgwick Agreed , Jack ; I think , on the whole , it will be the best ; we have had many difficulties to encounter ; and now , that we have got within sight of the port , we can safely anchor . I am , besides , half starved and nearly famished for the want of wine . Rig . Rigby We will see what our host 's cellar and larder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his kitchen too . I espied two buxom lasses just now , Jack ; they would greatly add to the repast . Rig . Rigby One a piece , eh , Jack ? Away , then , here 's at them . Sed . Captain Sedgwick We 'll to dinner first . Exeunt . ACT IV . SCENE I.  --  A distant view of Goody Gubbins ' cottage , surrounded by trees and partially visible. , Enter Theodore . Theo . Theodore Adderly Where does this Irishman linger ? There stands the hospitable receptacle of the wretched , the lost Eliza Dunstable . After a long and fatiguing search , I have at length found out her retreat . With what joy , under happier circumstances , should I have beheld this spot ? Oh , heavens ! what an interview have I to encounter ! How different from the last ! How impressive , how charming was the scene ! Innocence and simplicity was predominant in all she said and did . " The last time of our meeting  --  oh ! can I ever forget it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But never , never again will I be deceived by the spurious appearance of virtue ; never again will I be imposed upon by the deceitful sex . They are falsehood all ! vile , treacherous and inconstant . " But yet it can not be . By heavens ! they 've wronged her . She is , she must be true . ' T is the world , the degenerate world , is false  --  and my Eliza is all truth , all constancy and love . Fool ! to give ear to the tongue of slander . I have sucked it in , though rank poison to me . I 'll haste  --  I 'll seek her  --  I 'll fall at her feet  --  I 'll implore her pardon . But , ah ! if she is innocent , how could she voluntarily elope with such a wretch  --  and yet she did elope with him , and voluntarily too . This is a glaring truth , alas ! too true . Oh , wretched , wretched girl ! " Ah ! some one comes ! ( Retires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rig . Rigby I judge that hut to be the place where we were directed from the Inn . Sed . Captain Sedgwick It must be so , for there is no other . Now , my friend , take your stand in yonder thicket , where you may see without being seen , and at the signal agreed upon , fly to my assistance ; " we shall probably meet with no serious obstacles , as there are no male inhabitants in the house ; and even should there be , there are two of us , and I wear a sword  --  so that we have nothing to fear . " " Rig . Rigby This place is so very retired , surrounded on every side by woods , that , even if she screamed , there can be none within hearing to restore her . " Our post-chaise is but a few yards off ; and , as for my landlord at the neighbouring Inn , he is firmly persuaded she is your wife . " Sed . Captain Sedgwick But we are losing time , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage ; therefore , here we will part  --  you for yon thicket , and I to the arms of my fair one . Exeunt Sedgwick and Rigby different ways . Theodore peeps from behind the tree , and after looking cautiously around , advances forward . ) Theo . Theodore Adderly Villains ! have I caught you . Where is now my trusty Irishman ; your success is not so certain as you imagine . She is not married it seems ; so far I was right in my conjectures . " Then she may still be mine . This wretch is about to use violence in order to get her into his possession . Oh , my once virtuous and beloved Eliza ! how miserably did you deceive yourself , if you ever thought to be happy with this abandoned miscreant ! Did I not but now say that she might be mine . Perish the thought ! But I yet may save her  --  I may yet restore her to the arms of her much injured father . Though he spurned her from his presence when she humbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first ebulitions of his passion , when he considered her as the wife and not the mistress of her betrayer . Little did he think she had yielded to the embraces of an abandoned libertine , without giving him a lawful right to those embraces , Ah ! little did he think to what a scene of misery and infamy he was exposing her ! All this was occasioned by the wretch pronouncing himself her husband , when he had the audacity to demand possession of her papers . " Most fortunate  --  he comes ! " Enter O'Leary . O'Lea . O'Leary By me shoul , if I did'nt come near playing a neat tune with my shillelah about his his scull . Fire an ' ouns ! the sweet dear little cratur is no more his wife than I am . Did not I hear it from her own pretty lips ? Theo . Theodore Adderly You have come most propos . " May I enquire " what has ruffled you ? O'Lea . O'Leary I was only talking to myself , just , about that Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile ago . He stood me out to my face , that she was the wife of the Captain , running away from him , and that your honor was a bit of a sweetheart of the lady 's , running after her , in order to clap a pair of horns upon the head of the husband . Theo . Theodore Adderly Ah ! ah ! Never mind my friend , it is of little consequence what he , or any body else about here , thinks of the matter ; we know the purity of our own motives . And now you must know that we are likely to have something of a scuffling match .  --  As I stood here meditating and waiting your return , I heard the rattling of carriage wheels , and turning quickly round , glanced a post-chaise , which you may see with the horses ' heads tied to yonder tree . I fancy they left the postillion at the Inn , for none came with them here : most fortunately for me , I retired , unperceived , behind a friendly oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize Miss Dunstable by force , and carry her off . It is lucky they have not got their driver with them , as they might then be too strong for us ; but we are two sturdy lads , Pat , and with the help of your trusty shillelah , we have little to fear from such emaciated wretches . O'Lea . O'Leary Sure , now , and did'nt I see that same postillion ? Arrah , let him come , and a dozen more like him , and I 'll send them all away with the mulligrubs before they know it  --  master and man , friend and foe . By my shoul , we will taich them better manners than to insult a pretty lady in distress . Theo . Theodore Adderly I am impatient of this delay . Surely he can not force her from the house , " if she strenuously resist him : women are not easily conquered by violence ; and perhaps he may have recourse to some infernal measures which I shudder even to think of . I 'll slily steal round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly to her rescue . " In the mean time , you remain here ; should you see me enter the house , it will be your signal to follow . Exit Theodore . O'Lea . O'Leary A sweet young gentleman as ever the sun shone on ; and so is the young lady to take her by her looks ; and sure it 's strange , now , that she should run away from such a pretty fellow , and be taken with that spalpeen , the Captain ; but she has found out her error , now , since he treated her ill , and she will be glad to go back to her ould swateheart . By my shoul , it is'nt myself that would have harbored him a single night in my house , if I had known that he was not married to the lady ; and sure she is innocent , now , so far as it comes to the matter of sleeping ; for she told me so herself ; but it is very strange , sure , that she stopped all night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from a hug and a squeeze . ( Smacks his lips . ) Women are but flesh and blood , and sure it is hard to blame the dear craturs for what they ca n't help , when temptations fall in their way ; and sure its the men that are to blame , and they are not to blame neither once in a way , just , except they go out of the way , as this Captain did ; and then sure they are big rogues , and big blockheads , and big scoundrels to boot . ( A noise without , and screams from a female voice are heard . ) Oh , oh , you 're there , masters , two to one . By my shoul , they 've got her . Now , my little countryman , ( brandishes his stick ) I 'll see what you are good for ; they are coming this way . Och !

Enter Theodore and Rigby collaring each other , and Sedgwick dragging on Eliza in a state of insensibility . Theo . Theodore Adderly Detestable , insignificant coward , let go your hold this instant , or I 'll  --  ( they scuffle  --  enter softly , from behind the tree , O'Leary brandishing his stick . ) O'Lea . O'Leary I 'll make use of a knock-down argument , which will soon do the business . ( Gives Rigby a blow across the head with his stick and he staggers off the stage . ) Good luck to it , now for the other . ( Does the like to Sedgwick , who also staggers off the stage . Eliza falls into the arms of Theodore . ) Theo . Theodore Adderly My brave , noble fellow , you have bound me to you in a debt of eternal gratitude , " which I will never cease paying till the last moment of my life . I am unalterably yours . Here , help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , and while I support her with my trembling arms , and apply this invigorating scent to her nose , ( taking a smelling bottle from his pocket ) run you to the post-chaise , undo the horses , and we will take possession ere these villains recover ; and before they can give the alarm , we will drive with the utmost rapidity to the next town through this bye-road , where we will change chaise and horses , and continue our route until we arrive safely at our house . " O'Lar . O'Leary By my shoul , if it is'nt the best sport I ever had in my life . I 'll be postillion , and so neatly will smack it along to the tune of fid-re-I , which I will sing as I go along .

Exit with Eliza in his arms . SCENE II .  --  A room in Sir Gregory 's house . Enter Gray and Venire . Gray . Gray These accounts are all against Sir Gregory 's tenants ; make the best of them you can , and pay yourself without extortion . Be moderate in your demands , and you stand a chance of getting all Sir Gregory 's law affairs into your own hands . His present attorney has over-charged his bills , on which account he talks of employing another . Mind your P 's and Q 's , and you are the man . Ven . Venire If I did not think so , may I never issue another writ . I was sure that my merits would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great man ! You , Mr. Gray , must pardon me for the offence I took at your innocent raillery . Your hand , my friend  --  Ezekiel Venire . Gray . Gray Esquire , is a whimsical sort of compound , made up of drollery and good humor , with a little tincture of arrogance and self-conceit , a necessary ingredient indeed of his profession . But thou art a good-hearted fellow , I believe , on the whole . Ven . Venire Thou sayest right . But the heart has nothing to do with the head of a professional man . They are two distinct parts , and exercise very different functions . Necessitas non legem habent , is a favorite maxim with us . All professions must live . The advice which I gave to Sir Gregory , on behalf of his daughter , was correct , and I declare to you ( it is in secret , mind , as between friends , ) that I shall consider him highly culpable if he does not commence legal proceedings against Captain Sedgwick . Had he prosecuted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it again for the same offence ; for it is a maxim in law , meno debet bis vexari , pro eadem causua . Perhaps you may still prevail with Sir Gregory on this subject . Gray . Gray That will depend on circumstances . Should Mr. Adderly succeed in discovering Miss Dunstable and bring her back with him , I make no doubt but the old gentleman will be persuaded of her innocence . I think it probable he will punish him . But I must leave you . Let me hear how you succeed with these accounts , and perhaps in a day or two I may have some more for you . Exit . Ven . Venire I had hard work to restrain my joy before him ; and , egad ! I let one or two things slip , which , perhaps , I might as well have kept to myself . Well , Fortune has at length relented , and I am now one of her happy votaries . Oh , Venire ! Venire ! long hast thou suffered the pinching hand of poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of business , at length sitteth thyself down in the neighbourhood of London , under the patronage of the great Sir Gregory Dunstable . Though I was repulsed at first , I persevered , and perseverance always answers . Perseverentia vincit omnia ! Now I will haste to my business . To business haste away , No longer I 'll delay ; Oh , hold ! What do I say ? I some visits have to pay . I must around with my bills ; These indeed are bitter pills . If they say they can not pay , They must name an early day ; And when that day arrives , They had better loose their lives , Than to put me off again , For no longer I 'll refrain . Six and eight pence is my fee For every visit that I pay . I shall soon be full of cash , And then I 'll make a splash ; With my curricle and tandem , I will drive away at random ; Then sing fol , lol , de ray ; Now to business haste away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore and Eliza . Theo . Theodore Adderly Cruel Eliza ! When I first beheld you in sweet simplicity and blooming virtue , what joy  --  what rapture thrilled my every vein ! It was then the tyrant Love besieged my soul , where , ever since , he has reigned , and now consumes my vital powers , and drives me on to madness ! To see the object false , and yet to love , is misery indeed ! Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Sir , I will not brook this treatment from you . If you saved me from disgrace and ignominy , at the moment that the ruffians were about to drag me , I know not where , it was an action meriting my highest gratitude ; but I do not consider myself bound to listen to your insults . I beg you will leave me to my fate ; that fate which , although it will soon drive me to despair , will never drive me to shame and infamy . Theo . Theodore Adderly I came not to upbraid you but to serve you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while you stand upon the brink of ruin , ere you full headlong down the dread abyss , to snatch you from the impending danger ! Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Alas ! already am I fallen , indeed ! But not from virtue , sir . I am fallen in the estimation of a once kind father  --  fallen from the pinnacle of grandeur to the abyss of misery and woe ! ( Weeps . ) Theo . Theodore Adderly ( Aside . ) I went too far ; she weeps ! Wretch that I am ! She is , she must be innocent ; every action  --  every look  --  every syllable declares it . ( To her . ) I have wronged you , my Eliza . I feel , I am convinced that you are innocent . Pardon my indiscretion in thus wounding your feeling . Heaven knows your sufferings have been mine ! It was those sufferings which drove me here to seek you in your solitary retrant . Oh ! hear me , my Eliza ! Eliza . Eliza Dunstable No , sir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with infamy . You have rescued me from the hands of an abandoned libertine . For this I thank you ; and must now rescue myself from another scourge , and that is your insolent and presumptuous self . ( Going ) Theo . Theodore Adderly Call me what you please , but do not leave me . Ah ! have I become so indifferent to you . On my knees ( kneels ) I implore your pardon for giving too free a vent to the overflowings of my heart . Only say that you will hear my story , and I shall be happy . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Since there appears to be no alternative , and as you accompany your arguments with force , I must remain . Theo . Theodore Adderly Know , then , the villain Sedgwick has been to your father , and declared you his wife . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable That I knew before . Theo . Theodore Adderly That you have long been on terms of intimacy with him , planned the elopement , and met him according to appointment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch ! Did he go so far ? Theo . Theodore Adderly Yes , and further . He demanded your papers . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Consummate villain ! But sure he did not get them ? Theo . Theodore Adderly No . But it confirmed the story of your marriage in your father 's mind . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable And did he seek no other confirmation ? Did he make no further enquiries ? Theo . Theodore Adderly Yes ; at the Dragon . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Of whom ? Surely the honest-hearted O'Leary did me justice ? Theo . Theodore Adderly He did not see him . O'Leary was following you and Lubin to Yorkshire . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Of whom , then , did he enquire ? Theo . Theodore Adderly Of every individual in the house , and they all said you lived together as man and wife . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Merciful Father , is it possible ! This is the work of that monster of iniquity ! He has bribed them to this . They all know it to be false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquity , indeed . This unanimous testimony confirmed me in the fact as well as your father , coupled with the demand he made of your property ; and hearing since then that he treated you ill , and that the honest Irishman had provided you with the means of escaping from him , and also that the good hearted Lubin had offered you an asylum at his mother 's house , I flew , my Eliza , to your relief ; to save you , as I thought , from the fangs of a cruel husband ; to restore you to the protection of your father , and , having done that , to seek a refuge myself in some foreign country where you never more might see or hear from one whom I considered you had so much injured . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Then you did pity me ? Theo . Theodore Adderly Pity you ? I would give worlds if I could describe my feelings . But I learnt from O'Leary afterwards , that you had yourself told him you were not married , and likewise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the part they had acted . I was petrified with astonishment ! I was appalled ! I was overwhelmed with grief , and agitated with suspense and doubts . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable How came you to pursue a wretch so base as you must then have thought me ? Theo . Theodore Adderly Suspense is , of all others , the most dangerous canker-worm that can inhabit the human breast . To destroy it , I sought you , and you have destroyed it . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable I was well aware that a deep plan must have been laid for my ruin , tho ' I know not what it was ; but when my father turned me out of doors , he had received no confirmation of the story the villain told him . Theo . Theodore Adderly Yes ; Mr. Brook 's declared to him that he had frequently seen you in company with the Captain , that he saw you jump into the gig with seeming pleasure , and driven away without the least reluctance by him ; and , although I have received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you innocent . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable But had not my father ungenerously , and , I am bound to add , cruelly spurned me from his presence , while I , in the humblest and most supplicating posture , intreated him to hear me , the whole affair would long since have been clear 'd up . But , alas for me ! the only person , to whom I had a right to look for protection , denied it me . Theo . Theodore Adderly It was , indeed , ungenerous and cruel , particularly at a time when he had not received half the provocation he afterwards did . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable " The short time that I have spent in my solitary retreat , how often have I indulged the romantic wish that the shade of my departed mother might appear to my credulous and unkind father . Surely , thought I , the recollection of past endearments would soften his hard heart ; but oh ! how cutting is the thought that a child should be abandoned by a parent , an only child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boast and the pride of that parent during the whole course of her life , and for a supposed offence , which he must or ought to have known her incapable of committing , basely to discard her ! " Theo . Theodore Adderly Yet , much as he has injured you , he loves you , Miss Dunstable , with all the fond , the most ardent affection of the tenderest parent . Let me , therefore , conduct you to him . He will now hear you coolly , and make you all the amends in his power . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Yes , I will take your advice . I will fly to my father , and relate to him every particular . Theo . Theodore Adderly Pray , indulge me in one more request , and that is , that I may be allowed , as heretofore , to call you by the endoaring name of my beloved , my ever dear Eliza . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable What ! a false , ruined , lost , undone wretch like me ! One who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge headlong into the abyss of vice and infamy beloved by one who is all purity and all virtue , who seek but to save , who chides but to reform ! Sure , sir , you jest . Theo . Theodore Adderly O charming , cruel railer , forgive me ; but , my Eliza , in pity to my weakness , attribute all to the excess of love . Had I been a mere friend , I should not have presumed , neither should I have been , perhaps , so much blinded , as to harbour a momentary doubt ; but jealousy must be allowed to have some share in the composition of a lover . Forgive me , my Eliza , and let me ever call you by that endearing name . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Gratitude obliges me to forgive you , for you are my deliverer . Theo . Theodore Adderly And is there , my Eliza , no softer emotion still fluttering round your heart than that of gratitude ? Have I not once been honored with a tenderer regard ? And may I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eliza Dunstable Yes , you ; may live in hope , at any rate , if you die in despair at last . You look so very faithful , and seem so much in earnest , that I really believe you mean what you say . Theo . Theodore Adderly Ah ! my sensations at this moment are too exquisite for utterance . ( Kisses her . ) Come , my love , it is time for us to proceed on our journey . I must hunt up O'Leary while you are getting ready . Exeunt . ACT V. SCENE I.  --  A room in Sir Gregory 's house . Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable , followed by Lubin Gubbins . Sir . G. Sir Gregory Dunstable On condition that you will promise never again to absent yourself , I will retain you in my service . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , zir , I vool . Sir . G. Sir Gregory Dunstable and she is , you say , at your mother 's house in Yorkshire ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , zir . Sir G. Sir Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to receive from you , whom I have tenderly reared , whom I have doatingly loved ? Is this the reward for all my toil , my days and nights of anxious solicitude , my lavish bounty , my unceasing liberality , my never failing indulgence ? Ah ! little do they think , who wish for children , what they are wishing for ! Just as my fond heart was indulging its last grand hope of seeing her united to the amiable , virtuous Theodore , she sinks into the polluted arms of a base and an abandoned libertine ; a wretch who has squandered away an ample fortune in drinking and gambling ; and who is now , as I am told , reduced to a state of beggary , and , as his last resource , has married my unfortunate , wicked girl . But , tho ' her fortune will soon he in her own hands , I will never give up a single written instrument till I am compelled to do so by law . " Lub . Lubin Gubbins Begging your honor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I to speak , Miss be'nt married . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable How ! not married ! And who , pray , told you that she was not married ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins She told me so herself . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Then you , it seems , who are her prime confidant and protector , would insinuate that she is an abandoned prostitute . Lub . Lubin Gubbins I never heard , zir , whether she have abandoned the prosecution or not ; she never told I any thing about it ; but Mr. Venire said as how your honor would not consent to it . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Well , well , I see you either do not , or will not understand me . Leave me , I wish to be alone . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , zir I vool . Exit . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable " This fellow is a strange compound of simplicity and cunning ; yet there is something about him which very much pleases me . He possesses a feeling and manly heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displeasure to provide an asylum for my wretched , ruined girl . " Not married ! It can not be ! The villain 's ends would not have been answered in gaining her as his mistress . ' T was her money more than her person , that held out the ravishing bait . But she is unhappy ! He has treated her ill ! Ah ! I would again receive and protect her ; yes ! I would with joy receive my girl notwithstanding what is past , if she would consent never to see the villain more . Perhaps Theodore may prevail on her to return . But should it be as Lubin says ? not married ! It can not be ! I will retire to my study , and strive to ease this agony of doubt . Exit SCENE II .  --  Sir Gregory 's garden , with a bower . Enter Theodore and Eliza . Theo . Theodore Adderly From the moment that I first beheld you , my heart has incessantly told me that you must be mine Six years have , like a shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on which you disappeared was one of the happiest of my life . While in the garden , seated in a bower , sigh after sigh escaped from both our lips ; but they were sighs of joy , and not of guilt . Thy blushes , dearest girl , were those of sweet simplicity and truth ; they confirmed each word you spoke , and revealed more fully to my throbbing heart a mutual passion , than words or protestations ever could . But , my Eliza , when but a few hours after , I heard you had fled , and with a wretch like Sedgwick , judge what my feelings , must have been ! I can not describe them ! Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Neither will I attempt to describe how much I admire your constancy and virtue , which now display themselves more conspicuously than ever . When first I saw you , I only viewed your person , and even then  --  Theo . Theodore Adderly What then ? Do not cloak your words , my love . Even then you loved me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affected modesty , deny what well you know . Yes  --  even then I loved you ! And I am convinced , that what was then an artless passion , has now ripened into mature judgment . Every action of your life , but especially the last , confirmes me in this opinion . Theo . Theodore Adderly Angelic goodness ! I can not reply to such celestial language . Permit me thus to seal my frantic joy ! ( kisses her . ) And oh ! while I call to mind the first time that I heard thy heavenly voice pronounce me " thine , " while the melodious sound still trembled on thy lips , I kneeled , and pressing thy snowy hand to my heart , called Heaven to witness , that you should be mine . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable But my father has pronounced the dreadful words , " I discard you ! " Should he repeat them now ! Oh ! should he repeat them in defiance of all that may be said ! Theo . Theodore Adderly He will not . Resentment must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parental love . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Appearances have been much against me . But black as every thing appeared , it was ungenerous and unfeeling to cast me off unheard . ( A noise is heard at the garden gate . ) Theo . Theodore Adderly Who have we here ? We are interrupted . Let us retire to a more remote walk . ( They retire to the back part of the stage . ) Enter Venire . Ven . Venire I have gained admission here without knocking  --  the garden gate was not locked . Now , for my friend the steward , to report my success . This will make a very pretty item in my bill of costs : " Attending Mr. Gray , your steward . Informing him the result of my exertions , &c.; Thirteen and four pence . " If I could but see the young squire now , what a charming tete tete we might have by ourselves . I will enquire . Perhaps he may have returned by this time ; and he is such an obliging young gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore Adderly ( Apart to Eliza . ) Is not that the noted wag of a lawyer ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable I believe it is . Ven . Venire Ah ! voices . I have been overheard  --  there is somebody in the garden . I 'll retreat . Theo . Theodore Adderly We shall have occasion for this genius . I 'll detain him . ( To him . ) Nay , sir , do n't let us frighten you away ; we will leave you to your own meditations . The garden is large enough for us all to ramble in , without disturbing each other . Ven . Venire I ask your pardon , sir . Sir Gregory Dunstable has done me the honor to retain me as his professional adviser . My name and description are Ezekiel Venire Attorney at Law , at your service . Theo . Theodore Adderly I congratulate you , Mr. Venire , on your success This lady , Miss Dunstable , is the daughter of your patron , whom I have been so fortunate as to rescue from the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her father . Ven . Venire What ! Miss Dunstable returned ? Madam , forgive my rudeness . This will be a happy meeting to you honored father . Pardon me , Madam , when I inform you that you have been most vilely calumniated . It is a vulgar idea , though often entertained by the great , that the words , lawyer and knave , are synonimous , and it is the idea which leads people to brook insults and injuries rather than to trust their cause in the hands of a lawyer . " The Law , " as Sir William Blackstone hath defined it , " is a rule of conduct prescribing what is right , and prohibiting what is wrong , " and hence it is very clear that it is the best and surest source to which an injured party can repair for redress of grievances . Theo . Theodore Adderly You are right , sir , and I will take it upon myself to retain you on behalf of Miss Dunstable . There was a deep laid plan of villainy between this Sedgwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's fortune , and share it between them . Ven . Venire Among the catalogue of crimes , there are few known to our laws of a more heinous nature than that of conspiracy , and this action will lie . In addition to which , slander , assault and battery , and a number of others are open to her and her honored father , Sir Gregory These delinquents ought to be punished , and it is in your power to ruin them . Theo . Theodore Adderly What say you , my Eliza ? Shall we leave the management of this business to Mr. Venire ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable I am perfectly willing . Theo . Theodore Adderly Then , sir , take your own measures ; at least such as the law will allow you . Ven . Venire Your orders shall be punctually obeyed . Theo . Theodore Adderly We will leave you to indulge your own meditations . Come , my Eliza . Now for the dreaded interview . Exeunt Theodore and Eliza . Ven . Venire Blind fortune hath at length regained her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not only the Attorney of the great Sir Gregory Dunstable , but also of the great Mr. Adderly , who , I am informed , has noble blood in his veins , and though not a nobleman himself , is not far removed from one . He is now just of age , and if I have any sagacity will soon be the son-in-law of my patron . My fortune 's made . I shall soon be a man of consequence , and instead of footing it through thick and thin , wet and dry , I shall mount my coach , or take a turn in my curricle or tandem . " La ! " the country babies will cry , with their mounts gaping wide open , as I rattle by them ; " that be Squire Venire ! Great lawyer ! " But I must haste to my friend , the steward , and then to his important prosecution , which has so long been the idol of my hopes . Time is an important commodity with me now , and I must make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in Sir Gregory 's house . Enter Theodore , Eliza and Gray . Theo . Theodore Adderly My dear Gray , apologies are needless . If the scoundrel could counterfeit well enough to deceive Miss Dunstable , no wonder you were deceived . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable And did you , Mr. Gray , indeed , plead the cause of the unhappy Eliza Dunstable ? Did you really think her innocent , when every thing appeared so black against her ? Gray . Gray Indeed , Madam , I did . I should have been far less excusable than your father , to have allowed a momentary suspicion to cross my mind ; for love , of every description , engenders jealousy , and parental love is as much subject to that weakness as any other . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Indeed , sir , you have only done me justice . But I should be ungrateful indeed , not to thank you for your generous intercession with my father . Theo . Theodore Adderly That was spoken like my Eliza . And now give me leave to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect Sir Gregory home ? Gray . Gray I do not really know , sir . But here comes the Yorkshire footman , your humble friend , Madam , Perhaps Sir Gregory left word with him . Enter Lubin Gubbins . Lub . Lubin Gubbins There be Mr. Venire axing for un in the hall , zir , and sent I for to zee  --  eh  --  oh  --  what  --  no  --  yes  --  it be'nt tho ' , young mistress . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable But it is , though , my worthy Lubin , the very same . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ecod , zir , I do n't care where meister be , so long as mistress be got safe huom . Theo . Theodore Adderly Well , well , thou art an honest lad , and I admire thy fidelity . But answer my question . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , zir , I vool , be it never so many . Theo . Theodore Adderly When do you expect your master home ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins Why , zir , I believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell ring , and his honor mostly comes in this way . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , Heavens ! The thought of meeting my father , although I never injured him , almost overcomes me . Theo . Theodore Adderly Calm yourself , my love . Summon all your fortitude . You have nothing to fear . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Step and see whether it was him , Lubin ; I am desirous to know . Exit Lubin . Gray . Gray Venire the lawyer is waiting for me , and I will despatch him at the same time . Exit Gray . Theo . Theodore Adderly Cheer up , dear girl . Happiness and unbounded felicity await us both . These wretches will soon-be in the clutches of the law . Oh , how triumphant is the path of virtue ! Soon , my Eliza , this truth will be illustrated in the fall and degradation of vice , of which we shall behold an example in the miserable Sedgwick and his associate . Re-enter Lubin Gubbins . ( M. D. ) Lub . Lubin Gubbins I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told un as how Madam and Squire Adderly be com 'd , he put this in my hand , ( showing money ) and look 'd so pleas 'd as never were the like before since your Ladyship ha ' been gone . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable ( without . ) Where is she ! Where is my daughter ! My poor girl ! Enter Sir Gregory Dunstable . ( M. D. ) Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable My Eliza ! my dear Eliza ! ( Embracing her , she faints partially , but in a few moments revives . ) Is it thus we meet ? ( Tearing from her . ) Oh ! foolish fondness , I have pressed a viper to my breast , and , if report says true , a wanton ! Theo . Theodore Adderly Alas , Sir ! do not quite destroy your child . See how she weeps . In pity to her tender heart , have patience till you hear her sad recital . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable I will , dear boy . Thy hand , my more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Much affected . ) Theo . Theodore Adderly Dear , honored sir , listen to your child . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , sir ! do not look so sternly on me . I have never injured you in thought , word , or deed . I was basely entrapped by the vile Sedgwick , and my own credulity betrayed me . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Credulity , indeed ! Unhappy , wicked girl , you see the fruits of disobedience , but you are now of age ; I have no right to controul your actions . This day I will put you in possession of your fortune , provided you will promise never to share a farthing of it with your worthless husband . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable My husband ! Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Yes , your husband ! Is he not your husband ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , no ! my dearest father , he is not my husband ; indeed he is not . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable What ! this to my face ! Not your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pray , sir , let me speak . She is as innocent now as ever . The wretch is not her husband nor her lover . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable ( To Eliza . ) Speak . Did he not carry you off , and are you not now seeking my protection because he had withdrawn his ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , ungenerous thought ! You have been basely imposed upon . I allow appearances have been much against me ; still I am innocent and free . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Every word you utter carries conviction with it ; yet you can not deny the fact of your elopement . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable I will explain . The evening that he entrapped me , he succeeded , by counterfeiting the voice of Theodore , who but a few moments before had left me , and seeing the gig , I thought that he intended to take me by surprize , and treat me to a ride . I , therefore , without the least hositation , suffered Sedgwick to hand me into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake ; but , when I did discover it , the horror of my mind , and the velocity with which he drove , prevented my escape . I was wholly in his power . We soon arrived at the Dragon Inn , and need I add , that notwithstanding , I am still innocent . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable And are you indeed innocent ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , my dear father , how could you for moment think me otherwise . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Innocent ! Occupy but one room , and still innocent ! Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Is not virtue proof ? I was not in a barren wilderness , but in a thronged house , and my screams were my deliverers . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable And who protected you ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable The master of the house ; for , though he thought the wretch my husband , he would not suffer me to be abused . He kept watch over me that night . The next day I flew to you for protection , you denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrenzy , I returned to the Inn , not knowing where to go , and related the event to the benevolent landlord . Your faithful Lubin hearing of my distress , I know not how , offered me an asylum at his mother 's hovel , and risqued your displeasure to conduct me there . The good O'Leary lent us a Post-chaise , and even , unknown to me , followed us as an auxiliary in my defence , in case the captain should pursue us . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Come to my arms thou injured innocence , and let me once again embrace you . Where is the monster ? I mean the other monster ! I am one , and worse , if possible , than him ; but I will reek my vengeance on the wretch . He shall be punished . I have already suffered ; ' t is now his turn . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , happy day ! Now am I blest indeed ! But do not tarnish this propitious meeting by such unjust invectives on yourself . I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , have been the unhappy cause . But your question is not answered : the villain pursued me to Yorkshire ; how he found me , I know not ; and the very carriage in which I escaped was provided for my capture . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Explain , my child ! There are more mysteries to be unravelled , it seems . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , yes , sir . Behold my deliverer ! ( pointing to Theodore . ) You called him , not long since , your guardian angel , but surely he is mine . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable He is to both . The story of your deliverance I will hear at leisure . Oh , noble youth , you now are doubly dear to me . Thou injured innocence , my dear Eliza ! will you forgive your cruel father 's wrongs , stirred up by hasty passion without thought , and strengthened by the breath of calumny ? Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Pray , do not ask of me forgiveness ; I should be a wretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable ( Uniting the kinds of Theodore and Eliza . ) Take this from me , as a pledge of your constancy , and a solace for your mutual sufferings and exalted virtue . Enter Lubin Gubbins . Lub . Lubin Gubbins He 's got um ! He 's got um ! He 's got um ! He 's got um ! Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Got who , Lubin ? Lub . Lubin Gubbins The Captain , and the other what d'ye call um . Theo . Theodore Adderly Indeed , already ! I will explain . I gave orders to Mr. Venire to have the villains arrested and brought here . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , the bumbalies ah got um . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable This is joyful news . But who have we here ? Enter O'Leary . O'Lea . O'Leary My name , plaise your honor 's worship , is Mr. Patrick O'Leary , as his honor and her ladyship can tell , and this here bog-trotter of a footman , too , and a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , now , your honor , I mean no offence . Lub . Lubin Gubbins Ees , zir ! This be Mr. O'Leary as keeps the Dragon . Enter Gray and Venire . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Ah ! Have you got the villains ? Ven . Venire Yes , sir . The bailiffs , who are below , had the good fortune to seize them just as they were entering the town , on their return from Yorkshire . Sir G. Sir Gregory Dunstable Abandoned wretches ! Vengeance now is mine , and they shall suffer . Too long their crimes have escaped punishment ; away with them . Eliza . Eliza Dunstable Oh , happy , happy day ! Should any disconsolate love-sick maiden be ever crossed and harassed as I have been , let her not sink under her troubles , but remember the happy triumph of the " Discarded Daughter . " THE END .

Write moral plays  --  the blockhead !  --  why , good people , You 'll soon expect this house to wear a steeple ! For our fine piece , to let you into facts , Was quite a sermon  --  only preach 'd in acts . Still says our author , " Bards of the last age Hold up abandon 'd pictures on the stage ; Spread out their wit with fascinating art , And caught the fancy , to corrupt the heart ; But , happy change ! in these , our moral days , You can not sport with virtue , e'en in plays : On virtue 's side , his pen the poet draws , And boldly asks a hearing for his cause .

Yet , soft ! our author 's fate YOU must decree . Shall he come safe to port , or sink at sea ? Your sentence , sweet or bitter , soft or sore , Floats his frail bark , or runs it plump on shore .

Ye bucks above , restrain your awful thunder ; In his first cruise ' t were pity he should flounder : Safe from your shot , he fears no other foe ; Not e'en the gulf that horrid yawns below .

O could the muse one simple moral teach , From scenes like these , which all who heard might reach ! Thou child of sympathy  --  who'er thou art , That , with the " Outcast Child , " hast wept thy part , Go , search where keener woes demand relief ; Go , while the heart yet beats with fancied grief : Thy lip , still unconscious of the recent sigh , The graceful tear still ling'ring in thine eye  --  Go , and on real misery bestow The blest effusion of fictitious woe !
