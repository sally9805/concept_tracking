txt IN our number for October , 1831 , we reviewed the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution , ' the work of which that now under consideration is the Sequel . In that review we observed that , in obedience to the terms of the resolution of Congress of 1818 , ordering the publication of various portions of the contents of the Archives of the old Congress , the Diplomatic Correspondence , selected for the press , terminated abruptly at the close of the war , in 1783 . We expressed ourselves strongly in favor of the continuation of the work , down to the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 . We observed that a resolution had been reported to the House of Representatives at its preceding session , ( that of 1830-1831 , ) authorizing the Secretary of State to continue the work down to that period , under the editorship of Mr. Sparks . The committee , that reported this resolution , recommended that the proposed work should be entrusted to the editorship of Mr. Sparks , in consequence of the extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undertaking of this kind , and the success with which he had performed the duty of an editor toward the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution . He was known to have bestowed more attention upon the general subject , than any other individual living . In his laborious researches in the public offices of Great Britain and France , he had collected ample materials , // which enabled him to fill up numerous and important chasms , in the various parts of the Correspondence of our public agents , ireserved in the Department of State ; and of the liberality with which he was disposed to make use of these materials , for the advantage of the great national work confided to him , the volumes puhlished tinder his editorship hore ample testimony . In addition to this , there seemed an obvious propriety in confiding the continuance and completion of a work to the judgment and discretion , which had been exercised in cornmencing and carrying it on . It was of importance enough to require a unity of plan and execution : servetur ad imum Qualis ab incepto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and which was reported at the first session of the twenty-first Congress , was thrust aside by the multitude of matters of more urgent interest , and failed to pass . in the following year , a clause was introduced into the general appropriation bill , providing a sum of money to enable the Secretary of State to cause to he printed a selection from the Diplomatic Correspondence between the peace of 1783 and the 4th of March , 1789 , remaining un1 ) ublished in the department of State . ' The office of Secretary of State was , at that time , filled by Mr. Edward Livingston . This distinguished gentleman was well aware of the reasons , which existed , for confiding to Mr. Sparks the care of the continuation of the work , of which he had edited the commencement , in a manner equally creditable to himself and acceptable to the public . Had it been in his power to do so , uninfluenced by considerations foreign to the merits of the question , as one of a character purely historical and literary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proposed work into the same able hands . Unfortunately , the law making the appropriation , forbore to specify the name of the gentleman , who had so many claims to be selected as the editor . Reasons of State , if they may he dignified by that name , transformed the publication into a l ) rinter 's job , and compelled the Secretary to dispose of it on the principles , which usually govern the dispensation of public patronage . I* was necessary that the work should be printed at Washington . Fortunately , the Secretary of State was as well qualified for the general superintendence of such a selection , as any gentleman could possibly he , who // had not made that branch of our documentary history a particular study . He is understood to have directed himself the selection of the materials for a portion of the work , and probably gave to this task as much time , as could he spared from the other duties of his elevated and laborious station . It is , however , no disparagement of him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is notorious to all persons conversant with the subject , that it is beyond the physical ability of the most laborious and industrious Secretary of State , personally to superintend the editing , so to call it , even of some of the voluminous documents , pertaining to matters of current legislation , and frequently required to be prepared at the department , by calls of the two houses of Congress . It is in our power to name documents of the highest present importance , consisting of papers relative to immediate subjects of legislation , and containing not the Diplomatic Correspondence of times long past , and now become matters of literary an ( t historical curiosity , but that of our ministers at the present day , on topics of the most urgent interest , the publication of which has been delayed month after month , from the actual impossibility of finding time to make the requisite selection from the state * , crc is plainly nothing invipapers . In this of thinos th dious in the remark , that it was out of the question for Mr. Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the editorship of the work before us . By whom the selection and preparation of the papers contained in it were actually made , we are not informed . We presume that some of the gentlemen in the department of State were employed for that purpose and bestowed upon it the time and attention which could be spared from their other labors . We have not the slightest disposition to reflect unkindly on the manner , in which the duty was performed by them . We have no doubt they did all that could reasonably be expected , under the circumstances of the case . But no one , who has but walked through the rooms of an extensive public oWice ,  --  who has seen a department of government , beset with the crowd of idlers and visiters , who throng it from curiosity ,  --  harassed with the legion of office hunters , mousing about for holes where they can creep in ,  --  wearily trod by the long-suffering band of claimants , languishing with hopes deferred ,  --  bustling to meet the urgency of Congressional calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  alternating from the gratified officiousness of // new incumbents , eager to signalize their ministry , to the overplied assiduity of the departing , anxious to save the credit of their administration ,  --  we say no one , who has glanced at this scene , needs to be told that this is not the place where a literary labor is to he performed . There is no calmness or tranquillity in it . The air is hot and close . Hurry , and anxious expectation , and fear of change prevail . Pains-taking , laborious merit is a contemptible thing ; plodding , conscientious research , a quality , to say the least , as far removed from the daily walks of life , as the fossil remains of lost animals , which professor Buckland has detected in rocks of slate and limestone , are from the living race of quadrupeds . With respect to the typographical execution of the work before us , it is greatly deficient in correctness . The punctuation is neglected , so as to produce continual confusion ; and all the other imperfections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , disflgure the pages . Thus much we have said , not censoriously nor unkindly , hut with a strict regard to truth an ( 1 justice ; and as all concerned in the labor or expense of the publication have been amply remunerated by the government , the usual considerations of ten derness in alluding to the defects of costly works , of course , fail . But with these qualifications , the Diplomatic Correspondence from 1783 to 1789 , possesses its due share of the interest and value of that of the Revolution . It is , in fact , part and parcel of the same work . It records the continuance of the same ne6otiations , often by the same individuals . It covers a period of time less familiar in our political history , than that of the Revolution , and a larger portion of the seven volumes is new matter than of the twelve that preceded them . Many points in our bistory are illustrated , and as the former volumes showed , in the most convincing manner , the inadequacy of the Confederation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the utmost desirable effort , in time of war , the present work establishes the same fact , and still more conclusively , of a time of peace . There is one illustration of this , so signal and instructive , that it has been thoubht worthy by the writer of the introduction to the work ,  --  apparently Mr. Livingston ,  --  to be quoted at length in that paper . We allude to the letter of the Duke of Dorset to the commissioners appointed by the Congress to negotiate treaties of amity and commerce , with the various powers of Europe . These commissioners , ( Messrs . Adams , Jefferson , and Franklin , ) had apprized the British // Minister of their being furnished with full powers to negotiate such treaties , and their readiness to remove from Paris to London for the purpose of entering into such a negotiation with Great Britain . In reply to their communication , the Duke informs them , that he is directed to inquire , as to the real nature of the powers with which they are invested ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have received separate powers from the respective States . ' From this sentence , and the rest of the letter , it would appear , - what indeed other portions of the work render certain ,  --  that it would have been impossible , without an alteration in the character and an enlargement of the powers of the General Goveminent , to conclude a commercial treaty with Great Britain . The first volume opens with the Correspondence of Mr. Boudinot , then president of the Con tress , with the American minister in France , Dr. Franklin . Mr. Boudinot conducted the Correspondence with the foreign ministers , in the interval between Mr. R. R. Livingston 's retiring from the office of Secretary for foreign affairs , and the choice of his successor . Mr. Boudinot 's first despatches to Dr. Franklin contain an account of the mutiny of a part of the troops of the Pennsylvania line , stationed at Lancaster , their march to Philadelphia , and their audacious and insulting treatment of Congress . This incident is here related with more particularity than it appears in the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accompanied with original papers , which , we believe , have not been elsewhere preserved , nor previously published . The following interesting* summary of the ultimate views of the leaders , is extracted from Mr. Boudinot 's despatch to the ministers of the United States at Paris , of the 15th of July , 1783 . As soon as it was known that Congress was going , ( to Princeton ) the council were informed , that there was great reason to expect a serious attack on the bank , the night following ; on which the President of the State collected one hundred soldiers and kept guard all night . On Wednesday , it was reported that Congress had sent for the Commander-in-chief , with the whole Northern Army and the militia of New Jersey , who were to he joine ( I by the Pennsylvania militia , in order to quell the mutiny , which was no otherwise true , than ordering a detachinent of a few hundred men from the North River . The sergeants being alarmed , soon proposed a submission , and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , making a most submissive acknowledgment of their misconduct , and charging the whole on two of their officers , whom they had commissioned to represent grievances , a Captain Carbery and lieutenant Sullivan , who were to have headed them , as soon as they should have proceeded to violence . These officers immediately escaped to Chester , and there got on hoard of a vessel bound to London . The sergeants describe the plan laid by these officers as of the most irrational and diabolical nature , not only against Congress and the Council , but against the city and the bank . They were to he joined by straggling parties from the different parts of the country , and after executing their horrid purposes , were to have gone off with their plunder to the East Indies . However incredible this may appear , the letters from Sullivan to Colonel Moyland , his commanding officer , from Chester and the Capes , clearly shew that it was a deep-laid scheme . ' Among the documents appended to the despatch , is one of the letters of lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiable young officer , concerned in the praiseworthy attempt of hayonetting Congress and plundering the bank , had left his native land , ( the Emerald isle ) and engaged in the American service from the purest motives of patriotism and disinterestedness . ' This incident in our revolutionary history , however insignificant in itself and discreditable to those concerned in it , has seemed entitled to the space we have given to it , as the leading cause , which led to the adoption of the fixed purpose of establishing a permanent seat of Government , under an exclusively Federal jurisdiction . The tardiness with which , ( as it was thought ) , the authorities of Pennsylvania engaged in the defence of the Congress , against the violence with which they were threatened , seemed to demonstrate unanswerably the necessity of a seat of Government , where Congress might itself he clothed with all the authority , required for its own protection , without being in any measure dependent on the co-operation , or at the mercy of the discretion , of another power . In this view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exclusive jurisdiction over a seat of Government of narrow extent , as for instance , ten miles square , appears to furnish , but to a very partial degree , the means of defence against precisely the kind of outrage , which is supposed to have demonstrated the necessity of such a protection . The Continental Congress in 1783 wished the coun // cii of Pennsylvania to call out the militia , to defend them against a mutinous portion of the regular army . The militia of any ten miles square , in which the seat of Government was likely to be established , must be considered but an indifferent defence against a revolt in the regular army . Nor is it less noticeable , that the Constitution of the United States gives to the President , as the Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Government , all that power over the militia , in every part of the Union , which it was thought necessary to obtain , at a seat of Government , by placing it exclusively under Federal jurisdiction . If these remarks are correct , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not answer the original end of its erection , and that this end would he as effectually answered by the provisions of the Constitution without a seat of Government , exclusively under Federal jurisdiction , as it could he with it . That there are no other objects of convenience , in such an exclusive jurisdiction , we are not disposed to affirm , but whether they outweigh the great and hitherto unbalanced evils of the half Babylon and half desert , in which the Government at present is located , we shall not now discuss . But it is time to return to the work before us . The remainder of the first volume comprises chiefly the Correspondence of Mr. Jay , the Secretary for foreign affairs , with the French ministers and Charges d ' Affaires in the United States , in which the important subject of the Consular Convention fills a prominent place ; the Correspondence of General Lafayette with the French ministers and Mr. Jay , on the political and commercial interests of the United States , and the Correspondence of Mr. Barclay , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accounts of the servants of the United States in Europe . The contents of these letters are all interesting , many of them highly curious ; but we do not find , on our notes , any topic of sufficient importance to be detached froni the rest , and made the subject of particular remark . We can not however forbear a passing observation on the additional light thrown by them on the talent and skill of Mr. Jay , which shine in every page ; and on the restless activity , the unextinguishable zeal , the judgment and discretion , which marked the efforts of General Lafayette in the service of the country . In his conferences with the French ministry on the American trade , his instances with the other Continen // tal governments in behalf of our commerce , and in his Correspondence with Mr. Jay on these topics , he evinces a practical business talent , and a sober common sense , as remarkable and as admirable , as the chivalry , which led him to plunge into the more fascinating exposures and labors ofthe war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette are to be found in Mr. Sparks 's collection , and needed not to be repeated in the present work . One of the topics in Mr. Barclay 's Correspondence is the still mysterious claim of Beaumarchais . A very eloquent memorial to Congress from that extraordinary personage may be found at page 474 of the first volume . In our article on the former series of the Diplomatic Correspondence . we submitted to our readers a summary statement of this claim , which has so long haunted our legislation and diplomacy , and we expressed the opinion that delicacy and the self-respect , which the Government owes itself , requires its payment . Since that period , it has been included in Mr. Rives 's arrangement with the French Government . rrhe extraordinary refusal of the Chamber of Deputies to appropriate the funds necessary to enable the French Government to redeem the public faith , as pledged in that arrangement , gives new strength to the desire , which we then expressed , that the United States would refund to France the subsidies , which they received from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing less than essential to the cause ; and the liberality , with which it was aflbrded , is beyond all praise and entitled to our lasting gratitude . But the subsequent change in the relative position of the two powers , the unprecedented growth of this country and its ability to pay off this debt , and especially the long delay of France to indemnify our suffering merchants , and now the strange refusal of the Chamber , under pretences stranger than the act itself , to give effect to the Convention of indemnity , make it , as appears to us , of the highest concernment to the honor of the United States , to pay back these gratuities . We do not see how this country can creditably remain under an obligation of such a character to a foreign power , pursuing a policy like that of the legislature in France , in reference to these indemnities . The second volume of the work before us , opens with the Correspondence of Franklin . Tb is Correspondence , with the exception of a few letters between Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment of a son of the latter , as American Consul in France , and one or two letters , scattereri up aH ( i ( loWn in the series , is contained in Mr. Sparks 's . I ) iplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution . That it should be thus repeated in a work avowedly undertaken as the sequel of its predecessor , is an illustration of that want of an efficient editorship , to which we have already alluded . This is an inadvertence the more to he regretted , as , after all , the work before us ( does not contain the whole of the Franklin Correspondence br this peno ( l . Although it presents us with some letters of i ) r . Franklin , which we believe are not found in Mr. Sparks 's collection , there are others in the latter , which are not repeated in the present work . A similar inadvertence , hut still more out of taste , is the publication of the same ( loeninent twice in different ) arts of the l ) reseL*t work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Jay , of the 14th of August , 1785 which appears at page 371 of the second volut**e , is *i yen page 330 , as the eighth report of the Commissioners appointed , with general powers , to negotiate treaties of amity with the various European governments . In like manner , are given txvice in this volume , within the same distance of forty or fifty pages , the letter of Baron Thnlemeier to Mr. Jefferson of 19th July , 1785 , Mr. Jefferson 's reply , the instructions of Messrs . John Adams and Thomas Jefferson to IXIr . Short , and their instructions to Mr. Dumas , relative to the ratification of the Prussian treaty . There is rio possible interest in these documents , requiring their repetition , and it is ascribable to mere inadvertence . The correspondence of iVir . Adams , at the Hague , princi pally with the Baron do Thulemeier , relative to the treaty with Prussia ; that of Messrs . Adams , Franklin , and Jefferson , as Commissioners for negotiating treaties , with the various powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as minister of the United States at Paris , fill the residue of the second volume. - We extract from the latter the following letter of Paul Jones , who had been requested , by Mr. Jefferson , to inform himself , as far as possible , of the objects of the expedition of La Peyrouse , under the supposition that it might have been projected with a view to the establishment of a French colony , on the Western Coast of Arnerica . The eagerness with which Mr. Jefferson , at this early periods cast a glance toward that region , prepares us for the // zeal , with which , twenty years after , and under very diflcrciit circumstances , he labored so successfully for its acquisition by the United States . Paul Jones had been requested by Mr. Jefferson , in a letter of the 3d Aug. 1i85 , to make inquiry into all the circumstances , relative to La Peyrouse 's expedition , particularly what number of men and of what vocations , he had on hoard ? What animals , their species and numbers ? What trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inerchandise or other necessaries . ' His reply was in the folloxving terms PAIns , OuroswRS , 1785 . Sir , the following is the host information I am able to give you , in compliance with the letter dated at Paris , $d August , 1785 , which you did me the honor to address to me , at * The Boussole and Astrolabe , two Gaberts ( Gabarres ? ) of six hundred tons each , slicat hed with copper , an ( l equippe ( l in the best manner , sailed from Biest , the first of August , I*85 , under the command of Messieurs do Ia Peyrouse and the Viscount de Langlo , captains in the Royal Navy . They had on board a great variety of trees , plants , and seeds , that suit the climate of Fr nce , manufactures in linen , woollen au ( l cotton goods , and in iron ani ( l col ) l ) er , &amp;c. ; mechanical tools of all sorts , a great quantity of trinkets and toys ploughs and all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwrought iron . Each ship had on board a large shallop in frames , and a million of French hivres , in the coins of different nations . Each ship had also on board twenty-one soldiers , drafted from the two regiinciits at Brest ; all of whom were either mechanics or farmers . They had on board no women ; nor any animals , except such as appeare ( l destined for the refreshuient of the crews . rrhe crew of each ship is one hundred men , including officers and men of genius . The King himself l ) laIiiiorl the expedition , and made out all the details with his own hand , before lie spoke a word of it to any one . his Majesty defrays the expense out of his private coffer , and is his own minister in every thing , that regards the operation of his plan . There is no doubt but the perfecting the geography of the southern hemisphere is one of the objects , which his Majesty had in view ; and it is not difficult to perceive that lie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be to extend the commerce of his subjects , by establishing factories at a future ( lay for the fur trade , on the North-west coast of America ; and // another to establish colonies in New Holland , after having well explored the coast , and made experiments on the soil of that vast island , which is situated in so happy a climate , and so contiguous to the establishments of France in the East Indies . I am , Sir , with great respect , &amp;c. , J. PAUL JONES . ' The second volume contains interesting documents , relative to the commencement of our relations with Mordeco and the other Barbary poxvers . The schedule of presents by the Dutch to the Emperor of Morocco is misplaced on the 383d page , in the middle of a letter from the Count Florida Blanca , of which it furnishes a rather abrupt complement . The advertisement on the 501st page should have been suppressed from considerations of delicacy . Mr. Jefferson 's correspondence is continued through a third and a part of the fourth volume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private letter ; - as for instance some of those to Mr. Carmichael , and one at least to Mr. Madison . These letters , we suppose to have be taken from Mr. Jefferson 's Correspondence , as published by his grandson , and if that be the case , they can not be considered as properly introduced into the present work , under the act of May 5th , 1832 . Had any letter , before unpublished , although purely a private one , been thus introduced into the collection , we should not have considered it a matter of complaint . On the contrary , we should have regarded it as a favor done the public . We can not take this view of letters , simply transferred from volumes already accessihle in every part of the country . The letter of Mr. Jefferson to Count Montrnorin , to he found volume III , page 317 , is repeated in volume IV , page 13 ,  --  without any apparent occasion whatever for the repetition . This Correspondence places Mr. Jefferson 's character , as a man of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects referred to him , and to every thing which required his interference , was unremitted . His letters and conferences with the French ministry , on the commercial interests of the United States , show a minute acquaintance with the details of this branch of his duty , and a comprehensive regard to all the concerns of the country . The rice and tobacco of the South and the fisheries of the North are equally the subject of his laborious and faithful exposition . The reader will find in volume IV , page 10 , a memoir on the subject of the // Whale fishery , which will well repay a perusal . It may also be found in Jefferson 's Works , Vol II , 390 . It is strangely disfigured by the gallicism of Nantucicois for JV'antuclcct men . In all his negotiations on these subjects , Mr. Jefferson acknowledges , in the most emphatic terms , his obligations to General , Lafayette , whose powerful interest was exerted with the Ministry to procure the most favorable terms for the American commerce and navigation . This circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and gratifying illustration of the undoubted truth , that justice ,  --  full justice ,  - -  has not yet been done to the various excellencies of Lafayette . His solid merit , his business talent , his most useful services in matters of detail , would have given an enviable celebrity to any minister of state ; but have been overshadowed , in him . by the romantic boldness and dazzling vicissitudes of his political career . The Correspondence of Mr. Adams , as minister to England , succeeds that of Mr. Jefferson , commencing in the middle of the fourth volume . Time sweeps away the impressions made by great events on the imagination ; and the familiarity of a few years strips them of every thing but their intrinsic importance. - The position of the revolted colonies , in their foreign relations toward the established governments of the world , was novel , exciting , and critical . There was , in our diplomacy , upon the broad scale of a nation 's interests , the sensitive and feverish temperament ,  --  by turns assured and ( liffident ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the highspirited youth makes his entrance into the circle of men . We longed for foreign countenance , but disdained to court it . We were resolved to fulfil the great destinies of the republic , but at times the day-star of hope was scarcely to he discerned , by the tearful eyes of the patriot , through the stormy clouds that hung over Europe and America . But there were two points of more than common anxiety : - in which the entire interest of our forei n relations was concentrated ,  --  leaving to every thing else but a qualified and relative importance . These were , the alliance with France , in its connexion with the fate of the war , and the negotiation with England , which , after peace was concluded , was to ascertain the footing on which the new States were to stand with tho mother country . It fell to Dr. Franklin to be substantially the organ of his fellow citizens *  --  to feel , and think , and sp ) eak for them ,  --  in consummating // the alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment when he received from the cord of his kite the electric spark , which he had drawn from the clouds , no momat of his life could have been so full of intense and overmastering excitement , as that when he put his pen to the treaty of nuance . Armies , navies , gold , supplies , victory , independence followed in their train . But there was a scene of more moral and affecting interest in reserve . The contest was over ; the political yoke broken ;  --  the struggle of twenty years brought to its great close ; and a new State introduced into the family of nations . There was much in the necessity of the case to agitate men . A mighty republican Confederation was itself new in the world ; - an experiment , tried with doubtful success within the walls of ancient cities ,  --  in the recesses of the valleys and hills of Switzerland ,  --  and the narrow limits of the Netherlands , was now to be tried , over the wide expanse of a continent . A great convulsion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as England was concerned , a tremendous blow had been struck upon the solidity of the Colonial system . The peace of 1763 had laid France in the dust ; in that of 1783 , she waved the palm branch of victory over her prostrate rival . These fearful and perplexing chaoges ,  --  ominous of further revolution ,  --  had their natural efflict upon the imapinations of men ; and under their fall influence , the first minister of the United States of America ,  --  a born subject of the British King , - appears in his Court ,  --  the representative of the new sovereignty . Himself among the most prominent and efficient agents of the Revolution , he comes to stand before the monarch , whose crown he had contributed to rob of its brightest jewel . It was a scene of the highest interest to the King and to the minister , one in which all the excitement of mighty events , of achievements of vast magnitude , and consequences still more momentous , seqms crowded into a moment , claiming to be felt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations presents few such occasions . Their interest rarely recurs in the discharge of diplomatic duty . At the present day , a minister to France or England , presents his credentials , with as much sangfroid , as he feels in engaging his passage in the vessel which is to carry him to Europe . *The great excitement is over ,  --  the romance is worn away ,  --  the grand uncertainty of the future is cleared up , and all is quietly . arranged into a matter of business . // We have thought these reflections suitable , as an introduchon to the ( lespatch , in which Mr. Adams describes his presentation at court . The reader must recollect that it is from the man , who started in life the son of an humi ) le yeoman , in a remote province ,  --  who , twenty years before the Revolution began , so far penetrated the future , as to announce the necessity of a navy to the defence of the then colonics ,  --  who llear ( l the wor ( ls of fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otis in 1762 ,  --  and who stood forth in his strength in 1776 , in the Ian*ua*e of Jefferson , the Colossus of Independence . ' 6 * Its champion within the walls of the Con*re*s of * he was now its accre ( lite ( l Representative at the Court of St. . Jamcs . The ( lespatch is in the following terms From Jo/ut Adams to John Jay . BATH HOTEL , WESTMINSTER , JUNE 2 , 1785 . Dear Sir ,  --  During my interview with the Marquis of Carmarthen , he told mc it was customary for every foreign minister , at his first presentation to tile King , to make his Majesty some compliments , conformably to the spirit of his credentials , and when Sir Clement Cottrel Dormer , the master of the ceremonies , came to inform me , that he should accompany me to the Secretary of State and to Court , he said that every foreign minister , whom he had attended to the Queen , had always made an harangue to her Majesty , and he understood , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King . On Tuesday evening , the Baron de Lynden called upon me , and said he came from tile Baron de Nolken , and had been conversing upon the singular situation I was in , and agreed in opinion , that it was indispensable I should make a speech , and that it should be as complimentary as possible . All this was parallel to the advice lately given by the Count tIe Vergennes to Mr. Jefferson ; so that , finding it was a custom established at both these great courts , and that this Court and the foreign ministers expected it , I thought I could not avoid it , although my first thought and inclination had been , to deliver my credentials silently , and retire . At one , on Wednesday , the first of June , the master of ceremonies calleti at my house , and went with me to the Secretary of * office , in Cleveland Row , where the Marquis of Carmarthen received me , and introduced me to his under Secretary , Mr. Frazier , who has been , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes in administration , for thirty years , having first been appointed by the Earl of Ilolderness . After a short conversation upon the subject of importing my // effects from Holland and France free of duty , which Mr. Frazier himself introduced , Lord Carmarthen invited me to go with him in his coach to Court . When we arrived in the anti-chamber , the Oeil-de-Boeuf , of St. James 's , the master of the ceremonies met me and attended me , while the Secretary went to take the commands of the King . While I stood in this place , where it seems all ministers stand upon such occasions , always attended by the master of ceremonies , the room very full of ministers of State , Bishops , and all other sorts of courtiers , as well as the next room , which is the King*s bed-chamber , you may well suppose , I was the focus of all eyes . I was relieved , however , from the embarrassment of it , by the Swedish and Dutch miuisters , who came to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole time . Some other gentlemen whom I had seen before , came to make their compliments to me , until the Marquis of Carmarthen returned , and desired me to go with him to his Majesty . 1 went with his Lordship through the lev*e room into the King 's closet . The door was shut , and I was left with his Majesty and the Secretary of State alone . I made the three reverences , one at the door , another about half way , and the third before the presence , according to the usage established at this and all the northern courts of Europe , and then addressed myself to his Majesty , in the following words : " Sir-The United States of America have appointed me their Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty , and have directed me to deliver to your Majesty this letter , which contains the evidence of it . It is in obedience to their express command , that I have the honor to assure your Majesty of their unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the most friendly and liberal intercourse between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best wishes for your Majesty*s health and happiness , and that of your royal family . The appointment of a minister from the United States to your Majesty 's Court will form an epoch in the history of England and America . I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens , in having the distinguished honor to be the first , to stand in your Majesty 's royal presence in a diplomatic character , and shall esteem myself the happiest of men , if I can be instrumental in recommending my country more and more to your Majesty 's royal benevolence , and in restoring an entire esteem , confidence , and affection , or , in better words , the old good nature and the old good humor , between people , who , though separated by an ocean , and under different goverimments , have the same language , a similar religion , and kindred blood . I beg your Majesty 's permission to add , that although I have some time before been intrusted by my country , it was never9 in mywhole life , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The King listened to every word I said , with dignity , but with an apparent emotion . Whether it was the nature of the interview , or whether it was my visible agitation , ( for I felt more than I did or could express , ) that touched him , I can not say ; hut he was much affected , and answered me with more tremor than I had spoken with , and said " Sir ,  --  The circumstances of this audience are so extraordiary , the language you have now held is so extremely proper , and the feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion , that I must say , that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispositions of the United States , hut I am very glad the choice has fallen upon you to be their minister . I wish you , Sir , to believe , that it may he understood in America , that I have done nothing in the late contest , but what I thought myself mdi spensal ) ly bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will be very frank with you . I was the last to consent to the separation ; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable , I have always said , as I say now , that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States , as an independent power . The moment I see such sentiments and language as yours prevail , and a disposition to give to this country the preference , that moment I shall say , let the circumstances of language , religion , arid 1 ) 100 ( 1 have their natural an ( 1 full effect . " I dare not say that these were the King 's precise words , and it is even possible that I may have in some particular mistaken his meaning ; for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I ever heard , he hesitated some time between his periods and between the members of the same j ) eriod . Tie was much affected , and I was not less so , and therefore I can not be certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understood so perfectly , as to be confident of all his words or sense ; and I think that all that he said to me should at present be kept a secret in America , unless his Majesty or his Secretary of State should judge proper to report it . This I ( 10 say , that the foregoing is his Majesty 's meaning as I then nn ( lerstood it , and his own words , as nearly as I can recollect them . The King then asked me whether I came last from France ; and upon my answering in the affirmative , he put on an air of familiarity , and smiling , or rather laughing , said , there is an opinion among some people , that you are not the most attached of all your countrymen to the manners of France . I was surprised at this , because I thought it an indiscretion and a departure from the dignity . I was a little embarrassed ; but determined not to deny the truth , on one hand , nor leave him to infer // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I threw off as much gravity as I could , and assumed an air of gaiety and a tone of decision , as far as was decent , and said , " that opinion , Sir , is not mistaken ; I must avow to your Majesty I have no attachment but to my own country . " The King replied , as quick as lightning , " An honest man will never have any other . " The King then said a word or two to the Secretary of State , which being between them , I did not hear ; and then turned and bowed to me , as is customary with all kings and princes when they give the signal to retire . I retreated , stepping backward as is the etiquette , and making my last reverence at the door of the chamber , I went my way . The master of the ceremonies joined me , the moment of my coming out of the King 's closet , and accompanied me through the apartments to my carriage . I have been thus minute , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the King , Congress will form their own judgment of . I may expect from it a residence less painful than I once expected , as so marked an attention from the King will silence many grumblers . But we can infer nothing from all this concerning the success of my mission . There are a train of other ceremonies to go through , the audience of the Queen and visits to and from ministers and ambassadors , which will take up much time and interrupt me in my endeavors to obtain what I have at heart , the object of my instructions . It is thus the essence of things is lost in ceremony in every country in Europe . We must submit to what we can not alter ; patience is the only remedy . With great respect , &amp;c . JOHN ADAMs . ' It will abundantly appear from the perusal of the despatches of Mr. Adams , that it would be doing him a gross injustice , to infer from the manner of his expressing himself on his preseritation , that lie was a xvhit behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jealousy of British policy . Mr. Adams , it is true , at a period still earlier than this , entertained a distrust of the sincerity of Fiance ; a subject upon which we expressed ourselves , in our review of the Diplomatic Corres* pondence of the Revolution . But this distrust had not led , in the slightest degree , to the opposite feeling toward Great Britain . The Whig passion of 1776 burned with unabated ardor in his bosom . The King mistook the purport of the courteous expressions made use of by Mr. Adams , at his presentation . This is afterwards stated by Mr. Adams himself , in commenting on the King 's curious use of the word prefer // ence , ' in his speech as just cited . Besides this , whatever kind feelings Mr. Adams might have carried with him , to the Court of St. James , must have been in no small degree chilled by the fortune of his mission . Personally he was treated with kindness ; but no minister was accredited by Great Britain in return , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place ; and all his attempts to bring the British ministry to negotiation , on the great matters in controversy between the two countries , proved utterly abortive . We accordingly find him , throughout his despatches , expressing himself with considerable bitterness , on the subject of the ministers as men , and of the most decided denunciation of their policy toward America . It is evident that the British Government were somewhat at a loss , how to treat the United States . The first idea ,  - -  happy if it could have taken effect ,  --  was to seize the earliest opportunity of making the reconciliation hearty and entire ; and allowing the United States all the conminercial privileges , which they had enjoyed as British provinces . Mi ' . Pitt went so far as to introduce a bill to this effect into the House of Commons . But the evil genius of the Navigation Act was at once in motion : a clamor from several different sources arose ; the Canadhin influence ,  --  the refugee influence ,  --  the tory influence , were brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bud . Great Britain evidently felt an unaffected doubt , how far she could safely commit herself to a negotiation with a government constituted like ours ; and there is scarce a letter of Mr. Adams or Mr. Jay , which does not justify her hesitation . In the recency of the Revolution , and the unsettled state of European politics which succeeded , the idea of a speedy reconquest of America ,  --  of turning back the dark and ( lisastrous pages of the Revolution , and repeating the glorious chapters of the war of 1756 , did doubtless present itself to the Minister ' s mind . Who can wonder that the son of Chatham should think it no impossible thing to re-clutch the sceptre of America ? Mr. Adams , writing on the spot and under the impression produced by passing events , freely and confidently ascribes these views to the King and a portion of his ministers . But there was another cause , why Great Britain was slow to enter into a commercial arrangement with the United States , less creditable to the latter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the British government , on this point , by // the publication of the documents , contained in the present work . We allude to the acts of several of the States , in contravention of the provisions of the treaty . Mr. Jay , in his most masterly reports to Congress , is very full and explicit on this subject ; and admits that the governments of several States set the example , which was too diligently followed by the British , of those infractions of the treaty , which led to a controversy so long protracted and of a spirit so prejudicial . The obstruction thrown in the way of recovering debts due to British subjects was the first step , and was pleaded by the English ministry as the justification of the deportation of negroes from New York , contrary to the express provisions of the treaty , and the much more serious evil of detaining the Western posts . It is true , that Congress strove steadily and faithfully to obtain a remedy to these evils ; but not being possessed of power to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished hut too sufficient a justification to a foreign power , not merely to retaliate the infractions of the treaty , ( as , to be sure , they did with large interest ) but to decline all further negotiations with a Government , which thus showed itself incompetent to coerce from its constituents the observation of the treaty already made . This state of things naturally turned the minds of Mr. Adams and of Mr. Jay to the defects of the Confederation , and the necessity of a change in the Constitution . No topic is , proportionably , more the burden of their correspondence . Mr. Adams 's letters as well as Mr. Jay 's replies were regularly submitted to Congress , and as we know from tradition , were among the efficacious causes , which brought about a conviction of the absolute necessity of a change . The volumes before us are very full and very instructive on this subject , and throw much light even on recent discussions of constitutional law . Take for instance the following passage of a report of Mr. Jay to Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged to be in contravention of the treaty of 1783 . If this reasoning and these principles are right , as your Secretary thinks they are , it follows , of consequence , that no individual State has a right , by legislative acts , to decide and point out the sense , in which their particular citizens and courts shall understand this or that article of a treaty . A contrary doctrine would not only militate against the common and received principles and ideas , relative to this subject , but would prove as // ridiculous in practice , as it appears irrational in theory ; for in that case , the same article of the same treaty may by law mean one thing in New Hampshire , another in New York , and neither the one nor the other in Georgia . ' What would a logician like Jay have thought of the nullifier of that day , who should have attempted to escape the wholesome and direct common sense of this argument , by maintaining that , if the treaty was unconstitutional , the States might annul it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State to annul the acts of the Confederated Government were any the less ridiculous and irrational , ' because it was founded on a right first to pronounce them unconstitutional . So with the modern doctrine of nullification . The citizens of the States are bound to obey all constitutional laws of Congress ; their State governments can not absolve them from this obligation . It would be as ridiculous in practice as it would he irrational in theory , ' for a State to arrogate the power of annulling constitutional laws . But then , it has the power , at all times ,  --  amidst the heats of party and in the turmoil of elections , and under the influence of whatever , in a popular government , can disturb the calm empire of the understanding an ( l give force to the passions , to declare any law unconstitutional , and then pronounce it null , and release the citizens from obedience . The train of reflection , into which we have fallen , leads us to add , that numerous passages occur in the correspondence of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic of argument , in support of the system of protecting manufactures by law , drawn from the reasons urged , under the Confederation , in favor of a stronger Federal * , overnment . This topic of arguinent was brought into the discussion somewhat later than others . It has ever appeared to us to l ) O55*55 great force ; and deserves illustration by new researches into the documentary history of the period , between the peace of 1783 and the adoption of the Constitution . TI-ic present volumes therefore , as might have been expected , furnish several pertinent authorities , or rather show that it was taken for granted , that the encouragement and protection of the manufactures of the country , by duties and prohibitions , were among the specific objects to be accomplished , by the establishment of the new government . The following may serve as specimens . In a letter to Mr. Jay , of February 27th , 1786 , Mr. Adams writes // It remains with the States to determine what measures they will take , to discourage a commerce , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote a more beneficial intercourse with the rest of Europe ,  --  and to support their own manufactures and navigation ; for on such measures alone can they have any dependence in future . ' The measures alluded to were such a reorganization of the Government , as would enable Congress to pass laws to promote the ends alluded to . The following alludes to the proceedings of the Boston association of manufacturers and tradesmen ' in 1785 , and to their resolutions for the encouragement of domestic industry . It is from a letter of Mr. Adams , dated June 17th , 1785 . I forgot a circumstance of some consequence . His Lordship said he had seen , in the gazettes , some proceedings in Boston , which he was very sorry to see . I answered that I had seen them in the same gazettes , as I supposed , and had no more authentic account of them ; that I had no authority to say any thing officially about them ; but as an individual I might say , that the observations I had just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the commerce between the two countries , would be sufficient to explain to his Lordship the motives of those proceedings , and to convince his Lordship of the probability of such sentiments and proceedings becoming general throughout the United States , and alienating the commerce of that country from this , either by increasing manufactures in America , or opening new channels of commerce with other countries , which might easily be done , unless some arrangements were made which might facilitate remittances . ' But we have already exceeded the limits proposed to ourselves in this article , and can allude only with brevity to a few other points . Very valuable papers relative to the Northeastern boundary , are contained in the fourth volume of the work ; among them a deposition of Mitchel ,  --  the author of the map , which was used in drawing up the article on this subject , in the treaty of peace . Mr. Barclay 's memoir on the empire of Morocco , in the same volume , is excellent . The whole conduct of this gentleman in the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prudent and successful management with a barbarous prince ; if barbarous he ought to be called , who displayed , throughout the negotiations , a liberality and good faith , which might be studied to advantage by half the governments of Christendom . A separate treatise on the commencemerit // of our relations with the Barbary powers might be drawn up from the rich materials contained in these volumes . The negociations with Gardoqui , the Spanish Charge d ' Affaires , are full of interest . They were conducted by Mr. Jay , on the part of the United States , with the ability and discretion which characterized that great man , we had almost said , beyond all his contemporaries , it is certainly not too much to say , that with any thing less than his unerring sagacity and never surpassed perception of right , in the office which he filled ,  --  that of Secretary for foreign affairs to the Continental Congress ,  --  the efforts of our ministers abroad , to conduct our relations with foreign powers from 1783 to 1789 , with any tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes with very curious papers relative to the opening of the China trade . Our readers , we are sure , will think us warranted , in quoting the whole of the following letter . From Samuel Skaw to John Jay . NEW YORK , MAY 19th , 1785 . Sir ,  --  The first vessel , that has been fitted out by the inhabitants of the United States of America , for essaying a commerce with those of the empire of China , being , by the favor of Heaven , safe returned to this port , it becomes my duty to communicate to you , for the information of the fathers of the country , an account of the reception their subjects have met with , and the respect , with which their flag has been treated , in that distant region ; especially as some circumstances have occurred , which had a tendency to attract the attention of the Chinese towards a people , of whom they have hitherto had very confused ideas ; and which served , in a peculiar manner , to place the Americans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended the ntroduction of other nations , into that great and extensive empire . The ship employed on this occasion is about three hundred and sixty tons burthen , built in America , and equipped with forty-three persons , under the command of John Green , Esq . The subscriber had the honor of being appointed agent for their comnerce , - by the gentlemen , at whose risk this first experiment has been undertaken . On the 22d of February , 1784 , the ship sailed from New York , and arrived on the 21st of March at St. Jago , the principal of the Cape de Verd Islands . Having paid our respects to the Portuguese Vice Roy , and with his permission taken such // refreshments as were necessary , we left those islands on the 27th , and pursued our voyage . After a pleasant passage , in which nothing extraordinary occurred , we came , to anchor in the straits of Sunda , on the 18th July . It was no small addition to our happiness , on this occasion , to meet there two ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodore , Monsieur Dordelin , and his officers , welcomed us in the most affectionate manner ; and as his own ship was immediately bound to Canton , gave us an invitation to go iii company with him . This friendly offer we most cheerfully accepted ; and the commodore furnished us his signals by day and night , and added such instructions for our passage through the China seas , as would have been exceedingly beneficial , had any unfortunate accident occasioned our separation . Happily we pursued our route together . On our arrival at the island of Macao , the French consul for China , Monsieur Vieillard , with some other gentlemen of his nation , came on board to congratulate and welcome us to that part of the world , and kindly undertook the introduction of the Americans to the Portuguese Governor . The little time we were there , was entirely taken up by the good offices of the consul , the gentlemen of his nation , and those of the Swedes and Imperialists , who still remained at Macao . The other Europeans had repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound voyage . Previous to coming to anchor , we saluted the shipping on the river with thirteen guns , which were answered by the several commodores of the European nations , each of whom sent an officer to compliment us on our arrival . These visits were returned by the captain and supercargoes in the afternoon , who were again saluted by the respective ships , as they finished their visit . When the French sent their officers to congratulate us , they added to the obligations we were already under to them , by furnishing men , boats , and anchors , to assist us in coming to safe and convenient moorings . Nor did their good offices stop here . They furnished us with part of their own banksaIl , and insisted further , that until we were settled , we should take up our quarters with them at Canton . The day of our arrival at Canton , and the two following days , we were visited by the Chinese merchants , and the chiefs and gentlemen of the several European establishments , and treated by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As such , during our stay . we were universally considered . The Chinese themselves were very indulgent toward us , though ours being the first American ship that had ever visited China , it was some time before they could fully comprehend the distinction between Englishmen and us . They styled us the new people ; and // when by the map we conveyed to them an idea of the extent of our country , with its present and increasing population , they were highly pleased at the prospect of so considerable a market for the productions of theirs . The situation of the Europeans at Canton is so well known , as to render a detail unnecessary . The good understanding commonly subsisting between them and the Chinese was , in some degree , interrupted by two occurrences , of which , as they were extraordinary in themselves , and led to a more full investigation of the American character by both parties , than might otherwise have taken place , I will , with your permission , give a particular account . The police at Canton is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are circumscribed within very narrow limits . The latter had observed , with concern , some circumstaiices which they deemed an encroachment on their rights . On this consideration , they determined to apply for redress to the Hoppo , who is the head officer of the customs , the next time he should visit the shipping . Deputies accordingly attended from every nation and I was desired to represent ours . We met the Hoppo on board an English ship , and the causes of complaint were soon after removed . The other occurrence , of which I beg leave to take notice , gave rise to what was commonly called the Ganton war , which threatened to be productive of very serious consequences . On the 25th of November , an English ship , in saluting some company who had dined on board , killed a Chinese , and wounded two others , in the * boat along side . It is a maxim of the Chinese law , that blood must answer for blood ; in pursuance of which they demanded the unfortunate gunner . To give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Humanity pleaded powerfully against the measure . After repeated conferences between the English and the Chinese , the latter declared themselves satisfied , and the affair was supposed to be entirely settled . Notwithstanding this , on the morning after the last conference , ( the 27th , ) the supercargo of the ship was seized while attending his business , thrown into a sedan chair , hurried into the city , and committed to prison . Such an outrage on personal liberty spread a general alarm ; and the Europeans unanimously agreed to send for their boats , with armed men , from the shipping , for security of themselves and their property , until the matter should be brought to a conclusion . The boats accordingly came , and ours among the number ; one of which was fired on and a man wounded . All trade was stopped , and the Chinese men-of-war drawn up opposite the factories . The Eu // ropeans demanded the restoration of Mr Smith which the Chinese refused , until the gunner should be given up . In the mean while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood of Canton ; the Chinese servants were ordered by the magistrates to leave the factories ; the gates of the suburbs were shut ; all intercourse was at an end ; the naval force was increased ; many troops were embarked in boats ready for landing ; and every thing wore the appearanc* of war . To what extremities matters might have been carried , had not a negotiation taken place , no one can say . The Chinese asked a conference with all the nations , except the English . A deputation , in which I was included for America , met the Fuen , ( Fo-yuen , ) who is the head magistrate at Canton , with the principal officers of the province . After setting forth , by an interpreter , the power of the Emperor , and his own determination to support the laws , he demanded that the gunner should be given up , within three ( lays ; declaring that he should have an impartial examination before their tribunal , and if it appeared that the affair was accidental , he should be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade ; excepting that of the English , to go on as usual ; and dismissed us with a present of two pieces of silk to each , as a mark of his friendly disposition . The other nations , one after another , sent away their boats , under protection of a Chinese flag , and pursued their business as before . The English were obliged to submit ; the gunner was given up ; Mr. Smith was released ; arid the English , after being forced to ask pardon of the magistracy of Canton , in the preseiice of the other nations , had their commerce restored . On this occasion , 1 am happy that we were the last who sent off our boat , which was not disgraced by a Chinese flag ; nor did she go , until the English themselves thanked us for our concurrence with them , and advised to the sending her away . After peace was restored , the Chief and four English gentlemen visited the several nations , among whom we were included , and thanked them for their assistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  his fate undetermined . Notwithstanding the treatment we received from all parties was perfectly civil and respectful , yet , it was with peculiar satisfaction that we experienced , on every occasion , from our good allies the French , the most flattering and substantial proofs of their friendship . " If , " said they , " we have in any instance b*een serviceable to you , we are happy ; and we desire nothing more ardently , than further opportunities to convince you of our affection . " The harmony maintained between them and us was particularly noticed by the English , who more than once observed , that it was matter of astonishment to them , that the descendants of // Britons should so soon divest themselves of prejudices , which they had thought to be not only hereditary , but inherent in our nature . We left Canton the 27th December , and on our return refreshed at the Cape of Good Hope , where we found a most friendly reception . After remaining there five days , we sailed for America , and arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover of his country , as well as those more immediately concerned in commerce , it must be a pleasing reflection , that a communication is thus happily opened between us and the extremity of the globe ; and it adds very sensibly to the pleasure of this reflection , that the voyage has been performed in so short a space of time , and attended with the loss of only one man . To Captain Green and his officers every commendation is due , for their unwearied and successful endeavors in bringing it LO this most fortunate issue , which fully justifies the confidence reposed in them , by the gentlemen concerned in the enterprise . Permit me , Sir , to accompany this letter with the two pieces of silk , presented to me by the Fuen of Canton , as a ri*ark of his good disposition towards the American nation . In that view , I consider myself as peculiarly honored , in being chai*ged with this testimony of the friendship of the Chinese for a people , who may , in a few years , prosecute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , if not superior , to those enjoyed by any other nation whatever . I have the honor to be , &amp;c . SAMUEL SHAW . ' We take this opportunity , in passing , to notice an assertion of the British Quarterly Review , which we believe to be incorrect , relative to an unfortunate occurrence , on hoard an American ship at Canton . The following is the remark to which we allude : From the moment that our violation of the Chinese law is of such a nature , as to drive the Chinese government to the extreme measure of seizing the persons of the offending parties , the die is cast , and we fear that hostilities will become inevitable . The last instance of the kind , that occurred , was in 1784 , when one of the supercargoes of a private ship was seized to answer for homicide , and subsequently , after a good deal of blustering and preparations for commencing hostilities , was redeemed , by the surrender of another individual , equally innocent , though of an humbler station . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese , we fervently hope that we may never see it averted by such another disgraceful compromise , which has only for its parallel , one made by the Americans a very few years ago , when an innocent Italian was given up to be strangled , // to save the life , ( it has never been denied , ) of a guilty American . ' * How the learned writer knows that this statement has never been denied , ' we are unable to say . We suppose he means , that it has never been denied in his hearing . We will not undertake now positively to deny it , but we are informed , on what we deem the best authority , that the statement in the Quarterly Review is wholly incorrect ;  --  and that the Italian taken out of an American ship , fourteen or fifteen years ago , by the Chinese authorities , was unquestionably the author of the homicide , for which , ( under the law of China ) he suffered . Whether , as was stated on his behalf , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supposing it to have been so , Heaven forbid we should justify his execution under the Chinese Law . But as a question in the Law of Nations and casuistry , it would hear an argument , whether the United States could rigbtfully go to war against the Chinese , for administering their own laws on persons voluntarily coming within their jurisdiction . The Quarterly Reviewer seems to lean to the affirmative of that question . In the same volume , from which we quote the foregoing letter , may be found two or three other long letters from Mr. Shaw , written the following winter from Canton , on his return to that place , containing an admirable sketch of the condition of the trade with China at that time . We regret that we can only refer to them . The fifth and sixth volumes of this work exhibit the same marks of inadvertence , in preparing the materials , of which we have spoken in reference to the former volumes . Thus the letters of Mr. Barclay , contained in the third volume , pages 128 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 412 and 418 . In the sixth volume , Sir John Temple 's letter is repeated , page 7 , from volume IV , page 404 . In the same volume a letter of Count Florida Blanca is repeated , page 127. from a former volume . At page 183 , volume VI , a letter of General Lafavette is given , which is contained in the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution , volume X , page 30 . M. Rayneval 's memoir , relative to the Western boundary of the United States , which appears in the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution , volume VIII , page 156 , is repeated in the present work , volume VI , page 189 . The letter of R. H. Lee // to the King of Spain , and one of Mr. Jay to the Count Florida Blanca , are given twice in the sixth volume . The editorship of the seventh volume is decidedly superior to that of most of its predecessors . These imperfections are blemishes in the work ; but its substantial value , as a repository of important historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications made at the public expense , in pursuance of the joint Resolution of March 27th , 1818 . The preceding works , published under the same Resolution , are the Journal of the Convention which formed the Constitution , the Secret Journal of the old Congress for foreign affairs , their Secret Domestic Journal ; and the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution . The papers remaining in the archives of State yet unpublished , from this important period of our history , will find a place in the work of Messrs . Clarke and Force , just commencing under the auspices of Congress ; and those of the period since the adoption of the Constitution are contained in the great collection of Messrs . Gales and Seaton . Of this important and valuable work seven volumes in folio have already appeared , and to these , and the volumes which may succeed them in the same publication , we may perhaps , on a future occasion , invite the attention of our readers.                  @ @ @
