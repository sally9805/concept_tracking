txt DIED , at Dennysville , ( Me. ) twenty-sixth of February , 1835 , BEN3AMIN LINCOLN , M. D. , aged thirty-two years . When a man dies , whose character was ennobled by great virtues , and whose attainments were all that industry and talents of a high order could accomplish , but whose career , though an honorable one , was too short to extend his fame beyond a coruparltively narrow circle , we feel an interest in his life very different , and in its moral effects far better , from that with which we regard those who have made a place for themselves in the pages of history ; and the example comes home to us with peculiar force and efficacy . Need we offer any farther reason for dwelling a few moments on the mimemory of one who presented a rare combination of moral and intellectual excellence , and created in the minds of his acquaintance some new conceptions of the worth and dignity of oar nature . Dr. Lincoln was born at 1 ) ennysville , ( Me. ) in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theodore Lincoln , of that place , and grandson of Major-General Benjamin Lincoln , of the Revolution . He was graduated respectably , at Bowdoin College , in 1822 , and soon afterwards commenced the study of medicine . Having studied the requisite time with Dr. Shattuck , and received his medical degree at Brunswick , be entered upon the practice of his profession in this city , in the autumn of 1827 . During the summer of the ensuing year , he was invited to deliver the course on astronomy and physiolo*y , in the College at Burlington , ( Vt . ) The manner in which he succeeded in this duty , - for which he had probably as little special preparation as any man who ever undertook it , - may be inferred from the fact , that the next year he was elected to the professorship - an office which he coatinued to hold , with increasing satisfaction , until the last year of his life . At Burlington , which he immediately made his place of residence , he again , about three years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and reputation . The failing health of the late Dr. Wells , in 1830 , compelling him to abandon his duties as lecturer on anatomy , at Bowdoin College , Dr. Lincoln consented to supply his place for the season , and also succeeded this gentleman the next year , in the same office in the University of Maryland , at Baltimore . Though strongly urged to stand as candidate for the professorship , to which he would undoubtedly have been elected , considerations , not necessary to mention here , led him to decline , and he returned to Burlington , to pursue his studies with renewed spirit , and to mature plans for future action . In the spring of last year , ho took a violent cold , which rapidly reduced a constitution , already enfeebled by disease and over-exertion , to a state of debility , from which he never recovered , and it was soon followed by the too evident symptoms of pulmonary consumption . He succeeded , however , in reaching the residence of his family ; and there , amid the attentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , and the haven of eternal rest before him , he spent some of the happiest moments of his existence . The events of his life were few indeed , and of no extraordinary kind ; but what they especially impress upon our notice , is the ardor of disposition and severity of industry , seldom if ever equaled , that enabled him to triumph over every obstacle in his course , and carried him through , with credit to himself and satisfaction to all with whom he was connected . Until a few months before his first course of lectures , anatomy was far from having been a prominent object of his attention , and he was by no means a skilful dissector ; ( chemistry and music were his familiar pursuits , ) yet , within six years , he became second to few men in the country in the accuracy and extent of his anatomical attainments . He found the college destitute of preparations and other means of illustrating lectures ; and with a little assistance from his // 146 pupils , he enriched it with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of which , in the accuracy and minuteness of dissection , have not been often surpassed , - besides a great number of moulds and drawings , chiefly the work of his own bands . All this was done to while away his time , much of which was occupied in the business of private instruction , private practice , in lecturing at other institutions , and in visits to his friends at a distance . An idle moment was a thing unknown to the last eight years of his life ; every minute had its duties , and he was never happier than while he was engaged in the severest labor of body and mind . Even while visiting his friends , which was ostensibly for the purpose of relaxation , his industry never ceased ; and no sooner wern the greetings of his acquaintances over , than his head and hands found something to do . During one of these visits , of a few weeks , he delivered two courses of lectures , on anatomy and physiology , to popular audiences - the preparation for each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied one or more hours , besides engaging in some anatomical labors , and expending considerable time in reading and writing . If such industry constrains our admiration , what shall we think of it , when told that he , of whom we are speaking , was a martyr to rheumatism and neuralgia ? - that , from his twentieth year , he scarcely knew what it was to be an hour without pain ? and very often it was excruciating . From the time we mention , his back became so bent that he never afterwards was able to assume the erect position ; and frequently , for weeks together , it was two or three minutes ' works for him to rise from his bed in the morning . The distinguishing trait in Dr. Lincoln 's character - that which endeared him to as large a circle of warm , personal friends as a man of his age could leave behind him - was active benevolence . Its spirit was manifested in every thought and action ; it pervaded and animated his whole being . It was witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles were presented to his attention , they were viewed through the medium of an all-embracing philanthropy . In his relations with his friends , this disposition , of course , was particularly active . For them , it is incredible how much he was in the habit of doing . rheir concerns were , to a certain extent , bis concerns ; their happiness was identical with his own ; and no exertions , on his part , were too great to promote their interests . With a sacrifice of time and convenience , no one but himself could adequately appreciate , we once saw him quitting his studies , duriub his pupilage , to accornpany a friend on a voyage to a distant part of the country , for the purpose of affording him counsel and aid , through a long and harrassing sickness . lie was no more attached to this person than to many others ; but he saw him about to depart into a land of strangers , unable to help himself and poorly provided with the attendance his condition required , and it was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materially conducive to his comfort . Even in his last sickness , when , if at any time , a man will be engrossed with his own concerns , it was impossible to discover any diminution of his usual solicitude for the happiness of those around him . But his philanthropy was by no means of that narrow kind , which finds its objects exclusively at home ; it embraced the whole range of human affairs , and was the strong and abiding incentive to action . When satisfied that a measure was calculated to do good , his best efforts were always ready to further its success ; for it was not a habit with him to wish well to a cause without giving it the benefit of his own assistance . No man ever lived more for others and less for himself ; had it been otherwise , we should not now be mourning his loss . To this disposition , must be attributed the fatal error of overtasking his powers - the only error , of any consequence , he ever committed . Selfishness , in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sight of others ' happiness kindled a warmer glow of delight in his bosom than any mere personal considerations ever could . Like other men , he was sensible to the favor of the world ; but his ambition was a lofty and an honorable one , and completely subjected to the supremacy of the higher sentiments . The essential condition of every measure that engaged his service . was its tendency to do good ; and just in proportion to this tendency did he estimate its importance , and the degree of consideration it deserved . In the practice of his profession , his benevolent spirit found ample scope for its exercise ; and here it was displayed in some of its noblest and most engaging forms . His time and counsel were at the service of whoever chose to ask for // 147 them ; while the idea of remuneration was , of all others , the most remote from his thoughts . The poor and friendless found in him an unfailing friend , who not only applied his skill to the cure of their diseases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , and cheered their spirits with words of consolation and encouragement . The more destitute and helpless they were , the more strongly did they seem entitled to his personal attentions and to all the resources of his art . Many a time , when he found such an one suffering from the want of suitable attendance , has he hid adieu to professional dignity for a while , and cheerfully employed himself in the humbler duties of nursing . On one occasion , after riding several miles to visit a patient of this description , and with whom he had passed the whole previous night , we saw him spend an hour in repairing the windows , putting fastenings on the doors , and performing other little services , in order to make him warm and comfortable . The relations between physician and patient , were always on his part of the highest and most interesting kind . His intercourse with those who came under his care , was characterized hy the utmost urbanity and kindness of manner , which was prompted by no view to popularity , hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in all that concerned their welfare . From that besetting disposition , which long-continued practice engenders in the mind of almost every physician , to view his patients as furnishing cases of physiological investigation merely , he was remarkably free . In him , the philanthropist and physician were beautifully combined ; he never forgot that his patient was also a member of the human family ; and after he had prescribed for the former , he always found occasion for the exercise of the best feelings of his heart upon the latter . Little as he had of that repulsive hauteur , which seems to grudge an extra word or look in the sick room , he had still less , if possible , of that silly or swaggering affectation of good-humor assumed by vulgar minds ; but ever preserved his native dignity of manner , gracefully tempered by an air of ease and mildness , which won the affections as well as the respect of his patients . Though benevolence was a prominent , it was by no means the sole characteristic of a nature in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . Every one , much acquainted with Dr. Lincoln , must have been struck with a certain purity and elevation of character , and a strict , unwavering conscientiousness displayed in all his dealings with mankind . Perfectly upright and honorable himself , he was little inclined to look with indulgence on the absence of these qualities in others . With him , right and wrong were positive terms , the force and signification of which never varied with changes of circumstances or persons . He was unable to gloss over the slightest deviation from the straight forward path of fair and honorable conduct , with any of those palliative excuses and forms of phraseology , that pass current with the possessors of an easier virtue . He called things by their right names , and was determined , wherever he was concerned , that they should go by no other . This integrity of principle and purpose was admirably supported by an unflinching , unaffected independence of character , that added tenfold to the force and prominence of his example . He made no compromise with vice , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough reprobation , and no human power could deter him from the faithful expression of his opinions . There was a moral atmosphere around him , the salutary effect of which was clearly perceptible on those who came within its influence . Even in his younger days , he was never guilty of that confusion of moral distinctions which looks on the perpetration of mischief for the sake of amusement , as a species merely of innocent amusement . Yet no one was more beloved by his associates , and no one was freer from the suspicion of meanness and duplicity . With the indulgence of a warm-hearted philanthropist , towards the follies and weaknesses of his fellow-men , no scruple of delicacy ever induced him to spare the voice of censure and admonition , whenever it was likely to do good . True , his plainness of speech sometimes gave offence , and made him the only enemies he had ; but , accompanied as it was by his peculiar ingenuousness of manner , and an irresistible air of sincerity , it generally left an impression , both salutary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was guided by the same spirit of conscientiousnessever acting with the utmost fidelity to his trust , and coming up to the very spirit and letter of his engagements . Whatever might be his duties , he devoted all the powers of his mind and body to their performance , till the superabundance of his // zeal and exertion became a matter of astonishment and admiration . To spend and be spent , ja the most literal si*nification of the terms , seemed to be the principle on which he always acted . Another very important trait in his character , which , as we are writing for the living , it would he unpardonable not to notice here , was a fixedness of resolution and an indomitable perseverance , under every form of difficulty and discouragement . Whatever he undertook , he accomplished ; and obstacles which would have effectually deterred most other men , served only to increase his energies and stren*then his resolution . Animated by high hopes and noble purposes , with his object distinctly in view , and confident in his ample resources , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty nor disaster could make him swerve from his path . Charged with a trust of the highest responsibility , for which he had received the slightest possible preparation , and suffering constantly from a harrassing disease , nothing , indeed , but the most remarkable firmness , could have carried him through to the successful and brilliant result of his exertions . No task seamed too great fur his powers , no object too distant for his comprehension , when the voice of duty called , or the prospect of doing good was before him . All who were intimately acquainted with Dr. Lincoln , must have observed the buoyancy of his spirits , the unclouded happiness he seemed to enjoy , and that content of disposition , which neither pain nor disappointment could disturb . The goods of life he enjoyed with a keen relish ; its ills he considered as matters of course , and bore them without fretfulness or repining , as if , apparently , they were unworthy of a thon*ht . Nothing , in short , seemed to render him conscious of their pressence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause to which he was devoted . While suffering an attack of his disease , which affected his neck and back with unusual severity , though it appeared to be scarcely noticed by him ; engrossed in comparative anatomy , he replied to the commiserations of friends , that , so long as it left him hands to work and eyes to see , he should have no reason to complain . ' His mind was seldom clouded by disquietude and anxiety ; and the numerous annoyances of life , which seriously affect the temper of most men , and , for the time , incapacitate them from exertion , were never permitted by him to diminish , in the slightest degree , his accustomed activity and cheerfulness . Calumny even , while it excited a momentary indignation , could not plant a thorn in his bosom , or scarcely ruffle the ordinary tranquillity of his character . How essential this equanimity was to his happiness , he was well aware ; and , unless urged by a sense of duty , was careful to abstain from participating in party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would he liable to be sacrificed . Peace and independence of mind , he prized above all earthly treasures . The world had nothing of honor or profit , for Vhich he would give up one particle of his natural portion . This disposition was particularly manifested during his last sickness ; and dull must he have been to one of the noblest exhibitions of human fortitude , who could observe him then without being filled with emotions of pleasing yet melancholy interest He was just beginning to reap the fruits of his labors , when he was snatched at once and forever from their fruition . He had attained an elevation , from which he could perceive as bright a prospect before him as his most sanguine wishes could desire ; his attainments in science , great as they were , served chiefly to acquaint him with the still greater that remained for him to make ; the vigor of his mind , once so fresh and elastic , was decaying ; pain was harrassing many of his hours , and the extinction of his earthly career , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repining or discontent was ever heard to escape his lips . Everything relative to his profession interested him to the last , and his conversation was as animated and intellectual as ever . You have no idea , ' he said repeatedly to the writer , how many happy hours I enjoy . ' Dr. LincQln 's talents were naturally of the highest order , and their power was greatly increased by a rigid system of mental discipline . His reading was comparatively limited - though no man made more of what he did read , for he never finished a book without making himself master of its ideas ; but , to his penetrating intellect and keen observation , he was indebted for the most valuable part of his knowledge . The most striking characteristic of his mind , was the strength and clearness of his conceptions , accompanied with remarkable precision of language in conveying his // 149 ideas to others . Hence , there was nothing vague or indefinite in his notions ; what he knew , he knew thorou*hly ; it was always distinctly in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning . His knowledge was positive in its nature and such was the caution with which it was received , and the admirable arrangement giveii to it , that seldom were any reductions to be made from it , on the score of mistake or misapprehension . Not only was his intellect clear , but it had a strong and comprehensive grasp , which could rise from the study of the minutest detail , till it reached and embraced the highest and most important relations . Though exceedingly minute and faithful in his inquiries , he never forgot that their results were almost valueless without those enlar*ed general views , which mark the investigations of the philosophical mind . He was a deep thinker , and his mind was one of that farreaching kind that shuns the beaten routes , and find their proper element only when contemplatin* the most profound and original truths . His observation was uncommonly acute and extensive ; everythin , , that came before him , he viewed in all its lights , and carefully marked its bearings upon the various subjects of his inquiries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnoticed by less scrutinizing observers , came to him pre , , nant with important results . The consequence was , that his knowledge was exceedingly practical in its nature ; and it is wonderful how much he would make out of the simplest and fewest data , and that , too , by the powers of a sound induction . Indeed , it was rare for him to advance any prominent idea which he could not substantiate by facts and observations of his own . No one could see much of Dr. Lincoln , and not he struck with his ardent , unwavering , scrupulous lovc of truth . It was the animating principle of his intellectual nature ; and the end and aim of all his inquiries , was to obtain it unsophisticated by the carelessness or additions of men . He was willing to take facts for what they were worth ; but he wanted to receive them pure from the hands of nature and if he once suspected a writer of giving them a false coloring , for the purpose of favoring his peculiar notions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing incurred his heartiest reprobation so much as that tampering with nature 's truths , to which some people are addicted , with the design of establishing their own views , or magnifying their importance . He was cautious in the admission of new facts , and it was not till after they had been subjected to repeated examination , that he considered them entitled to belief ; and when thus tested , it was his habit to receive them , whatever bearing they might have on his previous notions . lie often declared , that false facts were more to be dreaded than false theories . Like everybody else , he was liable to errors ; but no one more cheerfully abandoned them , on the production of satisfactory evidence . rhe strong perception and love of the beautiful , as well as the true , was a no less striking trait in his intellectual character . The contemplation of the for is of natural objects , and the operations of their glorious mechanism , always exerted in him feelings of intense delight , and filled his soul with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover ever gazed with more rapture on the charms of his mistress , than be did on each new form and structure , that his studies in comparative anatomy and natural history , constantly brought to view . To this trait , we may attribute much of his well-known enthusiasm in the pursuit of natural science , and the elevating , purifying influence on his character . As an anatomist , Dr. Lincoln 's attainments were profound and extensive . From the time of his appointment at Burlington , he devoted his best energies to the vocation to which he was called , and a few more years would have given him a rel ) utation second to that of no other man in the country . The labors of the dissectingroom were always pleasing to him ; and he had the mechanical skill requisite to give his dissections a air of unusual finish and neatness . Ho studied anatomy like a philosopher , not as a surgeon ; and never measured the degree of attention to be devoted to a part , by the importance of its surgical relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organized being , he felt convinced , that , to be studied understandingly , human anatomy must be studied in connection with the structure of the inferior animals - and that , by itself , and for itself alone , it is entitled to but a low rank in the natural sciences . The study of comparative anatomy , therefore , he considered as essential to the anatomical scholar , without which , all other attainments were of inferior worth ; and he pursued it with an ardor and diligence , which showed that his whole soul was in the subject . He introduced much // of it into his 1ecture* , with the satisfaction of seeing it awaken fresh interest in the minds of his pupils , and impress them with the conviction , that anatomy , instead of being a lifeless collection of insulated facts , is a science of the most comprehensive , numerous , and wonderful relations . Natural history , in all its departments , received much of his attention and his love of botany , in the last year or two of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a lecturer , he had all the qualities necessary to confer on him great and undisputed excellence . The clearness and order of his views enabled him to present them clearly to others ; while his fine elocution , and command of simple and precise language , invested them with a degree of interest , that enchained the attention of the most indifferent hearer , and impressed them strongly and deeply on the mind . He had the faculty , so essential to a good lecturer , of knowing exactly how far to presume on the understandinas of his hearers , without rendering himself tedious by falling helow their range , nor unintelligihle hy rising above it ; and , hayirig once used the words best suited to express his meaning , he never sought to simplify by repetition . His style of lecturing was plain and forcible , without being coarse or boisterous , and had the rare merit of being equally satisfactory to the least , as well as the most nuphilosophical minds . He believed that nearly all the difficulties , experienced by medical students in understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of over-explanation , to which writers and lecurers are too much addicted . Accordingly , it was always a great point with him to disahuse his pupils of impressions on such subjects derived from hooks ; and , having unlearned all they had waded through so much obscurity to learn , they came away , surprised and delighted to find how things , before so dark , could be simplified and cleared up by his lucid instructions . In proof of the success of his manner , it may be mentioned , that , after his lectures on the nervous system , in his course at Baltimore , his class , in full meeting , paid him the unusual compliment of presenting him a vote of thanks , for the clearness and general ability with which he bad treated that subject . In his popular courses , which he was frequently in the habit of delivering , he was equally happy ; and certainly , no man , within our knowledge , ever discoursed on scientific subjects , to a miscellaneous audience , with more acceptance than did Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were his ideas , that he made no use of manuscripts in his lectures , for he complained that they embarrassed him . After what has been said , need we add that , as a physician , Dr. Lincoln enjoyed , in a very hi , *h degree , the confidence of his employers ; that he was indefatigable mu the investi , , ation of his cases , and met with a corresponding success in their treatment . He very early began to distrust the efficacy so largely attributed to remedial agents in modern practice , and to rely , with increasing confidence , on the powers of nature . If he erred , in following the expectant method too closely , he avoided the still greater and more fashionable error of lavishing medicines on the sickly , without the authority of rule or reason . He was a judicious and skilful operator ; and , guided by the strong liaht of anatomy , he saw his way clearly through a path of which he had , comparatively , small experience . The cause of medical education he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own sense of duty all the weight of his talents and influence , to effect a reform in the medical schools of our country , which should place it on a higher and firmer basis than it has ever yet possessed . Two years since , he published an able pamphlet on the subject , and was engaged in preparing another at the time of the attack of his last sickness . His familiar intercourse with pupils , and his habit of conversing with them freely on the subject of his instructions , made him intimately acquainted with the kind and degree of deficiency under which they labored , and convinced him of the necessity of applying the only remedy of which the case admints . It was idle , to use his own strong expression , to try to teach people a science , the very language of which they are incapable of understanding , from a want of previous education . It is this preliminary education that he was anxious to raise and the low state of which , be , in common with most intelligent members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respectability of the healing art . // with among well-educated men . * Of music , Dr. Lincoln was , all his life , a passionate admirer . Until he entered on the active labors of his profession , he studied it more than anything else ; and probably no person in the country was better acquainted with its principles . t Here we must close this article , which has * reatly exceeded the limits we had desi* ned . But , when one will think of the circumstances of the case , the surprise will be . not that we have occupied so much space , hut , that we could have answered our purpose with so little . XVe have endeavored to give no false coloring to what we mean for a plain , unvarnished statement ; but , on the contrary , have been careful to keep far within the limits of strict truth - for the whole trutie would have sounded more like the language of overweening , indiscriminate admiration . CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL Turs great and good man expired at Phitadetphia on the thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We subjoin an obituary notice , from the cotni us of the Boston Daily Advertiser - as better than any we could prepare in suds a short space - and as expressive of the sentiments which pervade the hearts of all lovers of their country , in contemplating the departure of so illustrious a patriot . THE eminent public services of this great man , the deep and universal confidence reposed in his ability and worth , and the sentiment of veneration entertained for his private virtues , render this loss one of the most afflicting that our country could sustain . His health had been for some time declining , and there was little hope that the term of his existence could be extended for a much longer period ; but , no period could occur , when the loss would not have been felt , thoughout the country , as tlsat of one of its greatest benefactors . qwq // 152 Miss Ambler , a daughter of the Treas rer of State . This lady , after a long term of sickness and suffering , descended a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place at the executive board , and resumed his professional pursuits but , immediately afterwards , and again in 1787 , he was re-elected to the Legislature , and took nn active and efficient part in the momentous controversies of the time . He was also a member of the Convention , called together in Virginia , for the ratification of the Federal Constitution . In this remarkable assembly , in which the most commanding eloquence and talent were displayed , no man exhibited greater power of reasoning , or patriotic ardor , than Mr. Marshall . Mr. Marshall continued in public life , as a member of the Legislature of Virginia , till the close of its session , in 1791 . He then retired for three years , hot was returned again in 1795 , aod ? tinguished himself by an argument , of remarkable ability , on the power of the Federal Executive to conclude a commercial treaty . This was at the time when the country was agitated by the controversies growing out of the treaty negotiated with Great Britain , by Mr. Jay . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the office of Attorney-General , but declined it , on the ground , that it would interfere with his extensive practice in Virginia . When Mr. Monroe was recalled from France , Mr. Marshall was urged , by Washington , to accept an appointment as his successor . This , also , he was compelled , by urgent private considerations , to decline . But , when Mr. Adams , who had , in the meantime , sueceeded to the presidency , appointed him an envoy to that country , in connexion with Mr. Gerry and General Pinckney , he accepted the appointmont . The envoys were , however , not accredited by the French government ; and , in the summer of 1798 , Mr. Marshall returned to this country . On his return , he was solicited , by General Washington , to become a candidate for a seat in Congress . He yielded with reluctance ; and being elected , after a severe contest , took his seat in December , 1799 . While he was a candidate for this station , he declined a seat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which became vacant by the death of Judge Iredell , and was offered him by President Adams . The session of Congress , in the winter of 1799-1800 , was a very memorable one . In the debate on the resolutions offered by Mr. Livin*ston , relative to the case of Thomas Nash , alias Jonathan Robbins - a case too long to be here detailed , and doubtless fresh in the recollection of many readers - Mr. Marshall spoke , in opposition to them , with admirable force and talent . His speech on that occasion , is preserved ; it is regarded as one of the most remarkable argunients of its author ; and a higher estimate of its merit could not easily be made . In May , 1800 , Mr. Marshall was nominated , by President Adams , to the office of Secretary of War . lie desired that the nomination moight be withdrawn ; but , his request was disregarded , and it was confirmed by the Senate . Shortly afterwards , he was called to succeed Mr. Pickering , as Secretary of State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised with Mr. Marshall respecting the appointment of his successor , who at once recommended Judge Patterson .. This was an appointment which the President was reluctant to make , from an unwillingness to wound the feelinas of Judge Cushing , who was the senior of Mr. Patterson on the bench . The office was then offered to Mr. Jay , who declined it ; and the President irrimediately nominated Mr. Marshall , who , on the thirty-first day of January , 1801 , accordingly became Chief Justice of the United States . It were equally vain and needless to attempt to convey an adequate idea of the extent and value of the official labors of Judge Marshall . For a period of nearly thirty-five years , his matchless intellect and admirable virtues have constituted the mnagnetic and beni*nant power , which has bound the orbs of our magnificent system of government together , while the disturbing forces of party , rivalry , and suffering , have often tempted them to rush asunder . The qualities of his mind were such as led him instinctively into the paths of truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of profound sagacity and resistless reasoning , that men were led to distrust the judgment , whose conclusions were not in unison with his . No man had ever a stronger influence upon the minds of others . That influence was not founded only on his intellectual superiority ; it was sustained and elevated by that perfect purity of purpose , that true simplicity and kindness of heart , that deep reverence for virtue and religion , which will cause his memory to tie honored so long as true patriotism shall be venerated by the sons of men.
