txt NOTWITHSTANDING the degree of attention , which , of late years , has been given to the details of American History , no adequate estimate has yet been formed of the importance of the subject . It is known and felt , that the men and the events of our early annals are worthy of our notice and study ; but the share which they bore in determining and promoting the political and social progress of the world is not yet appreciated . Philosophers , in all times , have attempted to resolve the forms and institutions of society into their original elements , and to trace the powers of government back into a social compact entered into by the fathers of the race , as they passed from a state of individual independence into a political organization of mutual subjection . But , as the infancy of the world is shrouded in impenetrable darkness , and no records or express indications of such primitive compacts can be found , it has not been possible to give to the speculations , founded upon the supposition of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they do , upon shadows , a breath has ever been sufficient to blow them down . Such was the irremediable defect of all scientific political disquisitions previous to the colonization of America . The sources of reasoning on the subject were enveloped in absolute uncertainty , and the fundamental principles of the powers of government and the rights of the governed , howsoever put forth and maintained , could claim no better character than of fanciful conjecture and imaginary probability . // America was reserved to be the theatre on which , in the broad view of the civilized world and in an advanced and enlightened age , the entire process of the formation of civil society and political institutions , out of a state of purely natural independence , might be distinctly exhibited . The political forms and customs of this country can be followed back , by unquestionable and recent historical records , to their origin , and can be shown to have sprung from precisely such voluntary compacts and deliberate concessions on the part of the communities governed by them , as liberal reasoners have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , as if for the very purpose of rendering the example , thus , for the first time , here presented of the forma* tion of the social structure , as complete and instructive as possible , it was ordered by Providence that the experiment should take place in every conceivable variety of form , and method of procedure , in the different sections of the North American coast where settlements were established . The Pilgrim passengers of the .11/lay Flower , before they left their weary and storm-worn vessel , gathering themselves on her deck , in a state more destitute of fixed political rela tions than can be imagined of the earliest infancy of mankind , floating on the ocean , outcasts from the Old World and not yet assured of a landing in the New ,  --  disconnected* as it were , from the earth itself , without a home on its surface , not able to call an acre of its soil their own ,  --  in this more than prnni* tive condition of unorganized social existence , deliberately conferred together respecting the grounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their original compact ; and when they stepped upon the Rock of Plymouth , the great republican principle , that the will of the ' people is the rule of government , began its operation on the ' earth . When Winthrop and the other associated founders of Massachusetts determined , and after a strenuous struggle succeeded in the effort , to bring their charter over with them , then the doctrine of independence of foreign dominion was really established and permanently secured . When the pious and enlightened founders of the settlement at Salem assembled to erect the institutions of religion , they met together in what has been understood as the state of nature , by those who have written and argued on this subject ; they recogVOL .

In the exercise of their original and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms as they thought proper , and thus started into action the great principle of the absolute independence of particular churches and congregations , of all other bodies of men , both ecclesiastical and political . So too , wherever the emigrants from the Old World planted themselves in the New , feeling their substantial independence of foreign power , regarding the Atlantic as literally a wall of separation from all existing established forms and fashions and customs , they went to work , in the exercise of their own free choice , and by the use of their own wisdom and judgment , to contrive and originate their social and political institutions ; and the American student , who wishes to explore the formation , and compare the operations and results , of any of the practices or principles , which enter into the fabric of our society and government , will find them all clearly delineated in the various communities , which have sprung from the different European settlements on the American continent . The materials , which are already provided for illustration and instruction to this end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more and more value as the progress of knowledge and civilization renders the world more sensible of the importance of sound and just and liberal political institutions . These remarks have been drawn from us by the interesting and valuable Discourse whose title is at the head of this paper . Among the numerous productions of its class , there are few which bring forward a larger amount of information and useful suggestion for the philosophical historian and scientific politician . Professor Kingsley was well selected to prepare and present the contribution , which the ancient Colony of New Haven supplies to the fund of our national historical literature , and he has well discharged his office . All who take pleasure in contemplating the elements of beauty , virtue , patriotism , science , and learning , find themselves readily and spontaneously attracted by the name of New Haven . Itself one of the most delightful spots in America , in its natural and cultivated aspect , it is adorned and // dignified by as many cherished associations as can often be gathered around any one scene . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some respects is generally acknowledged to take the lead of all the institutions of the sort with which our country is blessed , numbering among its present instructers names identified with science and learning , and showing , on the list of its presidents , a Dwight and a Stiles . New Haven is memorable as the residence of Hilihouse , Sherman , Whitney , Whiting , and Wooster , within the last century ; and Professor Kingsley has carried us back to the beginning , and made us feel acquainted with Theophilus Eaton , John Davenport , Edward Hopkins , and the other wise and good men , who there laid the foundations of learning , religion , and liberty . Immediately after the fathers of New Haven had obtained titles to their lands , and had built houses to shelter themselves from the approaching winter , and thrown up fortifications to keep off the savages , they proceeded to form their social compact and organize their political institutions . For this purpose they met in a " new barn , built by Mr. Newman , one of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England colonies had done , without reference to the mother country , or any authority but that of their own reason and consciences . The ground they took was , " that the Scriptures do hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and government of all men , in all duties , which they are to perform to God and men , as well in families and commonwealth , as in matters of the church . " They then ordained , that none but church members should exercise the right of voting , or be capable of holding public office . Professor Kingsley discusses this peculiarity of the early New England institutions with great candor , fairness , and intelli. * gence . In order to take a just view of this subject , the scheme or plan on which those institutions were projected must not be overlooked . The first settlers of New England , having exiled themselves from Christendom , intended to keep heretics and scoffers from following them into the American wilderness , and were sanguine in the belief , that , by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be able to rear their children and descendants in so thorough a knowledge , and complete a reception , of their own faith and // principles , that they would become , as a matter of course , members of the church . In that event , there would have been no exclusiveness in the operation and effect of the qualification they adopted , as the test of fitness for the exer* cise of political rights . But this was more than any system of education could be made to accomplish . Time has shown how delusive were their expectations in this particular . There is one point in the experience of the infant colony of New Haven , of great value in political science . Instead of having a fixed body of laws , they submitted all questions and causes , as they rose , to their best men , to be determined by them , without the intervention of a jury , or any technical observances , in accordance with what they deemed equity and justice in each particular case . Jn no circumstances could this experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the judges , that as much reliance could be placed upon their integrity and Christian wisdom , as can ever be placed in any body of magistrates that may be found . But in a few years it became necessary to frame a system of fixed and authoritative laws , and to bring the New Haven courts into a conformity with the practice of the other colonies . Professor Kingsley has found , what , perhaps , will surprise some , that the popular notion of the existence in Connecticut of a code of sumptuary legislation , commonly spoken of as the Blue Laws , is utterly without foundation . There never was such a code of laws in the colony , either printed or unprinted. *o far as the belief to this effect did not originate in a spirit of malice or sarcasm , on the part of those who wished to vilify or ridicule the good people of New Haven , it may , in part , be accounted for by supposing , that some of the particular decisions of the judges , in the infancy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , questions of a more private and minute and domestic nature than could be entertained in the tribunals of an advanced and numerous population , came before them , were mistaken for standing laws , enacted by legislative authority . On this , as on other points , Professor Kingsley writes with the enthusiastic zeal of one who is justly sensible of the honor due to a worthy and excellent community , and with the talent and eloquence to be expected of him.
