txt In any general survey of letters , the eye is arrested by certain points or epochs , at which some revolution seems to have been consummated , that wholly changes the face of things , and imparts a new character to the succeeding period , which it retains until again effaced by some similar convulsion . Such revolutions are of rarest occurrence , and most gradual development , in nations least distinguished by sensibility or imagination . Thus the Latin literature experienced scarcely any other modification , than the regular transition from primitive rudeness to its augustan polish , and thence by natural lapses to the different stages of decrepitude and decay . Nations , on // the other hand , of more mercurial temper or deeper sensibility , reflect in their productions the shifting spirit of the times , with a facility and abruptness , that make the most important transition frequently appear to be the result of some temporary or fortuitous impulse , and not of a train of circumstances , dependent on each other and remote in their origin . This is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English . The former may be distributed into cycles of not more than fifty years ' duration each , distinguished from each other by very decided peculiarities ; and is frequently grouped by historians into centuries . The English , in the last two centuries and a half , during which it has maintained its healthful constitution unimpaired , readily supplies us with several of these epochs , the most conspicuous of which are the ages of Elizabeth and Anne , and the present century . We shall endeavor , in the present article , to seize some of the characteristic features of elegant literature in the latter period , although the subject , like the idea in Wouter Van Twiller 's cranium , may seem somewhat too capacious for our contracted limits . As a preliminary step , it will be necessary to take a brief review of the ground occupied by the writers of the preceding century . The whole , or at least by far the greater part of that period , bore the impression which had been stamped upon it by the wits of the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the character of this latter school and that of the writers of the Elizabethan age . The revolution effected under the former , although imputed , and doubtless to a certain extent with justice , to foreign influence , seems to have been conformable to the regular course of things . It was natural that , as the nation advanced in literary civilization , it should become sensible to the numerous blemishes , the puerilities , meretricious conceits , vulgarities , and manifold violations of decorum , that disfigure the productions of inexperienced and comparatively uninstructed writers ; and that , in its anxiety to discard these besetting sins , it should lose much of the free and fearless expression which accompanied them , in the same manner as the conventional breeding of polished society effaces all the eccentric peculiarities of the individual , or at least interdicts the exhibition of them . Taste became paramount to every other consideration . The rules , although professing to be founded on nature , were consulted instead of her . They were more studiously consulted by the writers of that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins of the old school , to which long habit so naturally inclined them . A character of timidity , sobriety , an artificial and somewhat monotonous elegance , was thus gradually substituted for the bold , irregular , but spontaneous movements of the age of Shakspeare . We will not revive for the thousandth time the verbal discussion , whether Pope , the Corypha*us of the new school , and whose genius , far more than any other , contributed to naturalize the exotic beauties of the French , was or was not a poet . If sensibility , fancy , wit , an uncorrupted taste , and an exquisite ear for verbal melody , make a poet , he was one indisputably . But his poetry , however , was not that either of sensibility or fancy ; with the exception of the Rape of the Lock , and two or three other subordinate pieces , it was devoted to philosophy , criticism , and satire . These were its aim , while the stores of fancy and feeling were rifled only for subsidiary illustration . He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least of man as far as he is the subject of philosophical analysis ; and his poetry had far greater influence on his age , than if it had been what some consider the higher sort , like that of Milton , for exampe . Pope 's track was on the earth , while Milton 's was in the upper air , where none might venture , who did not like him inherit The pride and ample pinion Which the Theban eagle bare . ' Pope 's poetry , and indeed it holds true of most of what may be called the poetry of common sense , was addressed to the reason , which , as far as- is essential for this purpose , is found to be much more equally distributed among men , than sensibility or imagination . Writers like Milton and Dante strike a key , which , far from being felt equally in every bosom , is by some , even men of undoubted genius , not responded to at all . Witness Dr. Johnson 's criticism on the latter poet 's Lycidas , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art has been comparatively small . Their full influence , moreover , is not felt till long after they have passed away . No one generation furnishes kindred spirits of sufficient number and authority to settle their relative rank , which is at length determined by the gradually accumulated criticism of posterity . The personal situation of the writers of Queen Anne 's day was such , as greatly enforced the authority of their literary opinions . Many of them , as Dorset , Montagu , Somers , Bolingbroke , were among the brightest ornaments of the peerage , while // pensions , and political and church preferment were lavished on every literary aspirant of celebrity , without much reference to principle or party , from Swift and Addison to wicked Mat . Prior and pastoral Phillips . The correspondence of the littera*teurs of that day shows abundantly enough the terms of familiarity on which they stood with persons of the highest rank . Swift 's journal was filled with little else than his feasts , and his rides , and his closetings with Harley and Bohingbroke . Pope 's Essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are dedicated to persons of quality , some of whom had little else to boast of than their titles . Congreve gave a still greater proof of his veneration for the great , by throwing away ten thousand pounds on the Dutchess of Marlborough , and leavmg his poor relations to starve . This devotion to rank was repaid by personal intimacy and more substantial patronage . The consequence of this was a degree of fashionable *clat , which authors had rarely before enjoyed ; while their writings became impregnated with the spirit of modish society , which , however fatal to enthusiasm , subhin*ty , or powerful emotion of any sort , is extremely propitious to shrewd social observation , polished raillery , classical correctness , and all the minor elegances of expression . A glance at the criticism of Temple , Shaftsbury , Rymer , the best critic of his day , ' according to Pope , will shew into what a deep shade the Elizabethan writers had been thrown , amid the general splendor of William Ill , and Queen Anne 's reign . A striking proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rowe could successfully impose as his own on the public , for more than half a century , a rifacimento of one of Massinger 's most delightful pieces , and that of all Shakspeare 's plays , not more than half a dozen kept the stage , and some of these mainly by dint of being improved by a metamorphosis into operas , garnished with suitable scenes , flyings for witches , singing , and dances , as was the case with Macbeth and the Tempest . While Shakspeare was thus dishonored , so artificial had the popular taste become , that Addison 's Cato was welcomed with a greater number of representations , than had probably ever been vouchsafed to a British play before ; a tragedy , which , whatever merit it may possess , notwithstanding Pope 's deprecation of French translation ' and his panegyric on native rage , ' is as completely un-english in its whole conception and conduct , as Aaron Hill 's Merope , or Alzire , or any other avowed translation from the French theatre . // The Hanover accession brought with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong to warp the direction already given to letters . More liberal principles were introduced into politics , and religious toleration , which had been menaced more than once under the preceding reign , was placed on a surer basis . The periodical press , including newspapers as well as essays , both of which obtained extensive currency before the conclusion of the seventeenth century , now exhibited a degree of freedom , or rather licence , that provoked the ' animadversion of the Whigs themselves . The inferior classes of society also now rose gradually in the scale , and attained a degree of independence and personal consideration , that made them an interesting subject of study . The romance of real life was introduced , and Fielding , Richardson , Smollett , threw off their spirited sketches of character , taken chiefly from situations in middle and lower life . The munificent and courtly patronage , however , which had shone out with such warmth under Queen Anne , became cold under her successors . Walpole 's politics cost him too much to leave any thing for letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to be ignorant of the French language . His master , George I. , was equally ignorant of English ; and it is well known , that the correspondence between the king and his minister was obliged to be carried on in mongrel Latin . English literature , therefore , had little to expect from the new dynasty . It was not much better under George II. , who , when Ilogarth presented him with a proof copy of his March to Finchley , which the artist esteemed his masterpiece , requesting leave to dedicate it to his majesty , exclaimed , What ! a painter burlesque a soldier ; the fellow deserves to be picketed for his insolence ! ' The wellknown exclamation of the great duke of Cumberland to Gibbon , is equally indicative of the refinement of the reigning fainiy . What , Mr. Gibbon , scribble , scribble , scribble still ! ' Never was the position of a man of letters in England less enviable , than at the middle of the eighteenth century . His biography was made np of the vexations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scholar , ignorant of life , and improvident as it were by nature , whose lot is cast in a society , which takes too little interest in literary achievements , however brilliant , to keep their author from starving . Hogarth 's familiar sketch of the Distressed Poet was no cancature of the times . The drama had ceased to open a roa // to emolument or reputation , as in Elizabeth 's day , for people turned away in disgust from the abortive imitations of the French school , whose best models could never have satisfied the claims of a British public . The splendid aristocratic patronage of Queen Anne 's time had faded away ; and that extensive reading public was not yet created , which in our day confers that species of gratuity , most honorable and far most welcome to the author , as exempting him from the onerous obligations of individual patronage . During the first half of George ILL 's reign , a bright illumination was shed over English literature by a body of wits , who , had they possessed sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might possibly have eclipsed the glories of the preceding period . Johnson furnishes perhaps the best key to the literary character of the time . He was the aristarch of his age . No despot ever ruled with more lordly sway the courts of criticism , though none in the province of ornamental literature had less real pretension . He was strangely insensible to the beauties of sentiment , as well as those of external nature ; for which last , indeed , his physical defects furnish an apology . He was equally destitute of imagination and taste , as is shown by his habitually cumbrous and pedantic style , and by the perversity of his criticisms on some of the higher specimens of English poetry . His stiff reverence for authority and his Tory prejudices , equally intolerant and illiberal , made him high gravel blind , to borrow Launcelot Gobbo 's phrase , not merely on political or religious topics , but on the most abstract questions of literature . Our remarks , we think , can scarcely be perverted into any disparagement of Johnson 's acknowledged abilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of science and virtue . We have intended to confine them exclusively to his poetical talent , and his principles of criticism as applied to elegant literature . These principles , established on the authority of the preceding age , had great weight , no doubt , in discouraging the efforts of more delicate spirits , who give sufficient evidence that their genius , unrebuked , would have flowed in the ancient channels of nature and English feeling . The sluggish calm in which the minds of men seemed to repose during the greater part of the eighteenth century , was at length dispelled by one of those tempests , which are occa5ionally sent to clear the moral atmosphere , and renovate the // face of society . We allude to the American Revolution , an event of similar importance in the political , with the Reformation in the religious world , and which opened that contest between the principles of freedom and arbitrary power , that still continues , and is probably to form the history of the present century . The French Revolution soon followed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the immediate theatre of operation , but in the contiguous countries , especially Great Britain , was visible in the most important consequences . Men pushed their inquiries with reckless hardihood into the regions of science and speculation . Deep-rooted prejudices were torn up . Systems , which had been piled up by the diligence of ages , were brought to the ground , as it were , in a moment . The ancient schemes of education began now to be assailed , and more popular ones devised . It came to be understood , that knowledge was not intended for a few initiated alone , but for the mass of mankind . Utility was the avowed principle of action , and the sciences , especially those susceptible of most familiar practical application , were diligently cultivated . In the improved civilization of the lower ranks , a wide market was opened for literary products , and such substantial encouragement afforded , as brought the highest talent into the field of competition . The popular tribunal , thus erected , decided less on any principles of factitious taste , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more justly delineated , human feelings to be more deeply sounded . The cold precepts of the preceding age were trampled down under the spontaneous movements of passion . The extraordinary character of passing events seemed to beget , indeed , an inordinate passion for novelty and excitement . Instead of the tameness of ordinary life , the poet carried his reader back to the stirring days of chivalry and romance , animating his verse with thrilling patriotic recollections , or agitating the depths of the soul with wild emotion . Indeed , the disjointed character of the times led to the most conflicting results ; the cynical sneer of infidelity , and the steady assurance of religious trust . And one may recognize the influence of the present revolutionary age , no less in the devout poetry of Wordsworth , as any one who has read the Excursion will readily admit , than in the skepticism of Byron 's . But without dwelling longer on the general characteristics // of the literature of the present age , it may be well to examine the several varieties which have been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of doing this will be by a brief survey of the writers , who have impressed them with their peculiar genius . It is unnecessary to expatiate on the merits of Cowper , the morning star of our modern poetry , which shed a tranquil light over the stormy period that closed the eighteenth century . We shall probably not err in selecting Scott , Wordsworth and Byron , as the most fitting representatives of contemporary poetry , on account of their positive rank , or their success in the introduction of their respective systems . Some others , especially Crabbe , might be adduced as instinct with the spirit of the age , but none will be found on the whole so decidedly to have stamped , in a greater or less degree , their own features upon it . Scott 's verse is a prolific shoot from the ancient and longneglected stock of English minstrelsy , which Percy attempted to bring into favorable notice about the middle of the last century . The attempt was stifled in its birth by Dr. Johnson , who found nothing attractive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a ridiculous parody on the style , succeeded , according to his admiring biographer , in rendering Bishop Percy contemptible . ' It indeed brought some contempt on bis performance , for , although nothing is so easy to make as a sneer , nothing is more difficmdt to answer . But , although the seed fell nn stony ground in that day , it found soil in which to take deep root in our own . I well remember , ' says Scott , in his agreeable auto-biography , the tree under which I lay when I first entered on the enchanting perusal of Percy 's Reliques of Ancient Poetry . ' With a congenial antiquarian spirit , he compiled the remains and imitations of Border minstrelsy , and sent them into the world , in order to ascertain the direction of the popular current . Finding that it set in his favor , he speedily launched forth his more formidable epics , which were drawn from similar sources , as the ballads of primitive English feeling and feudal exploit . All who lived in that day will recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monotonous common places of later times , welcomed these delightful works , whose pages glowed with such vivid portraiture of character as had not been seen since the time of Shakspeare , or indeed in the narrative form , since that of Chaucer , while fancy shed over // the whole the rich coloring of a romantic age , hitherto faintly seen through the dim veil of tradition . The first of all the bards was he , That sung of Border chivalry . ' The dialect adopted by Scott was in extremely good taste ; not so obsolete as to require a glossary , like Chatterton 's , and thus to give his pieces the fantastic appearance of a modern antique , but just antiquated enough to throw over them a picturesque costume , in perfect keeping with the age . The octosyllabic measure , borrowed from the old ballad , moreover , was admirably suited by its facile flexibility to the various , yet always simple , expression of his animated narrative , into which he seems to have transplanted all those natural wild flowers of poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shade . All this was manifestly in violation of the rules . The critics stared , shook their heads , and as Rochester somewhat irreverently observed of Cowley 's poetry , that not being of God , it could not stand , ' so they predicted that Scott 's , not being of the rules , ' could not . The poet , however , felt the strength of his hand , and so went on writing , while the public went on buying . More than thirty thousand copies of the first work , an amount altogether unprecedented , were readily disposed of , and succeeding efforts maintained the author 's reputation . This blaze of popularity of course could not last long . The very peculiarities of the poet , at first so attractive , made him obnox* ious to easy imitation , and the public became surfeited ad nauseam with spiritless copies of an original , whose mannerism , moreover , laid him open to ridiculous parody . The humblest mimic , by seizing on eccentricities of tone or gesture , may throw some degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some other causes , especially the increasing appetite for stimulating and passionate poetry , Scott 's declined somewhat below the level , which in all probability it will hold with posterity ; for no one surely at this time of day , who is sensible to the vigorous touches of character and nature which it exhibits , independently of its literary finish , can doubt , that it contains within itself the principle of immortality . A poet , with little of the active and worldly temperament of Scott , appeared in Wordsworth , whose naturally grave and contemplative mood was nourished amid the romantic recesses // of his native hills . But although by his position standing aloof , as it were , from man , he had nothing in him foreign to humanity . His contemplative habits led him to scrutinize his species with a philosophic eye , and by levelling in his own mind the artificial distinctions of society , extended his sympathies to the humblest of his fellow-creatures . A holy calm is shed over his writings , whose general purpose seems to be to reconcile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a key to the mysteries of his present condition . Wordsworth 's soul is instinct with such a pure love of nature , so much simplicity , or as the French call it , loyalty of purpose , that had he not entangled himself in an unlucky theory , he might have shared the popularity of Cowper , whom he must be admitted to surpass in the general elevation , as well as the benevolence of his sentiments . As it is , there are few who read , and fewer still who relish him . It may not be amiss to notice in passing , some points of the theory on which Mr. Wordsworth 's muse , has been shipwrecked . According to him , low rustic life affords the best subjects for poetry , because the elementary feelings and essential passions of our nature are least under restraint , and best developed in it ; while its language , purified indeed from acknowledged vulgarities , is best suited to the poet , as more simple and unelaborated than any other . These in brief are nearly his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the feelings growing out of those situations are quite as natural and fully developed by men in society , as in the retirement of rustic life . Even in this last , it is difficult to understand why the poet 's eye should be closed on all but the humbler orders , and not find fitting subjects of contemplation in persons of superior mental culture , and it may be , moral sensibility . In regard to diction , Mr. Wordsworth 's practice is by no means conformable to his theory . I-us language , so far from being that of rustic simplicity , is not to be compared in this respect with that of some other writers , as Burns , for example . Indeed , the elevated and frequently recondite character of his topics necessarily precludes this ; while the perpetual struggle to accommodate himself to his theory frequently involves him in a dialect belonging neither to poetry nor common life , and which the intercalation now and then of a homely epithet or name , serves only , ( we say it with all deference ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be natural in an early age , become affected in a later one . Wordsworth 's writings show , moreover , that simple words do not necessarily constitute simplicity of expression ; for there is scarcely any writer whose meaning is involved in greater mysticism , a circumstance apparently owing to his not accurately distinguishing between the results of his reason and his feelings . The best proof of Wordsworth 's failure is his want of popularity . The true tendency of his theory , is to level poetry to the comprehension and relish of the most untutored minds . Had he succeeded , he might have expected an almost unlimited currency ,  --  the tavern-parlor popularity , which Cowper , and Burns , and Scott , et tutti quanti , are in possession of . Instead of this , the perusal of him is confined to the few , and those few the most cultivated persons , and not unfrequently of similar reserved tastes with his own . Perhaps , however , he may find some amends for the paucity of his admirers* in the sincerity of their admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology for a sickly race of versifiers , branded as the cockney school , from the scene of their principal haunts , as well as the pert city air of their productions . These persons have aggravated Wordsworth 's poetical defects into absolute vices , converting his homeliness into vulgarity , and his simplicity into the most infantine inanity . Indeed the chief characteristic of their manner may be found in what Scriblerus denominates the infantine style ; wherein a poet grows so very simple , as to think and talk like a child . ' Had they flourished in the time of this sagacious critic , their writings would have been invaluable to him , for the illustrations which they afford of every variety of the bathos . With these puerilities of style are combined a much more reprehensible laxity , or rather licentiousness of thought , on almost every topic . It would seem that the cheer* ing warmth of popular patronage , which ripens so many of the nobler productions of nature , is apt to call into being also , swarms of pestilent insects , who defile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who , if some avenging Pope or Gifford do not arise to break them on the wheel , ' are sure to he blown away sooner or later by the breath of public opinion . The third great poet , whom we have selected as the repre sentative of the times , is Byron , who may be considered to have struck into a more original path , even than either of hi* // predecessors . his poetry may be characterized , in one word , as the poetry of passion . His soul revels in scenes of perpetual excitement , and he startles his readers by turning up to their gaze the most hidden depths of his tumultuous spirit , or plunging them in the deepest glooms of misanthropy or skepticism , and anon soothing their troubled souls with the sweetest strains of tenderness and love . Byron was a paradox in every thing . He was at once a cold-blooded satirist and a man of sentiment ; an aristocrat and a radical ; a Platonist and an Epicurean ; the most sublime and the most sensual of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow his own phrase ; but the most barefaced paradox , was his ostentatious defence in prose of Pope 's poetical system , which , in his poetry , he had been all his life endeavoring to subvert . The key to Byron 's eccentricities is to be found in his total want of principle , and his uncontrollable passions . To the last is to be referred , moreover , much of what is grand and striking in his poetry . Many were led to charge him with affectation . The history of his life , however , which may be called passion put into action , shows how uniformly he sacrificed to his passions all his worldly interests and better hopes . His poetry gains somewhat in effect by our conviction of this , for sincerity is essential to the full success of the poet as of the orator ; and , in this point of view , the exhibition of actual vice is less detrimental to his interest than the affectation of it . Much stress has been laid on the mischievous tendency of Byron 's philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings to deserve that name . He had no principles to build on , and seems to have been incapable of forming any settled system , or even a systematic attack on any thing . He levelled his shafts pretty indiscriminately at whatever men prize most in this life , or look forward to with hope in the next . This sort of random aim was little better than shooting in the dark . The following sarcastic lines show the miscellaneous range of his hostilities . I do believe , Though I have found them not , that there may be Words which are things ,  --  hopes which will not deceive , And virtues which are merciful , nor weave Snares for the failing ; I would also deem , O'er other 's griefs that some sincerely grieve ; // That two , or one , are almost what they seem ,  - -  That goodness is no name , and happiness no dream . ' Byron 's poetry is much more to be dreaded , for the morbid appetite for stimulants which it has a tendency to nourish , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it touches the most serious topics , and the seductive coloring which it too often throws over the grossest pleasures of the senses . He must have sat to himself for his portrait of Rousseau . Here the self-torturing sophist , wild Rousseau , The apostle of affliction , he who threw Enchantment over passion , and from woe Wrung overwhelming eloquence , first drew The breath which made him wretched ; yet he knew How to make madness beautiful , and cast O'er erring deeds and thoughts , a heavenly hue Of words , like sunbeams , dazzling as they past The eyes , which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast . ' Byron 's poetry is eminently characteristic of the present age . It is essentially undramatic , and altogether repugnant to the social spirit of the age of Shakspeare . It is no less so to the placid tenor and perspicuity of Queen Anne 's . It is purely egotistical , devoted in some form or other to self-analysis , the most melancholy , in its influence on the soul , of all occupations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theorems . It is written entirely for the closet , and pre-supposes a more deeply thinking and deeply read community , than has existed in any preceding period . His attempts in the drama have signally failed , and it may be doubted even , whether he could ever have established his present reputation . in other walks , in any other than the present age , so mutually well adapted to each other were his own character and that of the times . Some persons at this day , especially those wedded to the discipline of the preceding school of poetry , contest Byron 's pretensions to high rank in his art . These critics are too much annoyed by his defects , by his hyperbolical passion , by the shadowy mists which hang over many of his fine thoughts , by the startling abruptions , and even dislocations of his periods , in short , by his perpetual lapses , in every way , from what they have been taught to venerate as classical decorum . // 178 English Literature It is remarkable , that Mr. Gifford , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , should have been among the first to detect the existence of the celestial spark in the young poet 's breast , and confidently to predict his future triumphs ; a prediction abundantly verified by the event , for there certainly has been no poet in our time , who , notwithstanding some discrepancy of judgment , has produced so general and deep a sensation . There is , probably , no poet in the language indeed , who has touched with a bolder hand the various chords of passion , who has shown more of the sadness of remorse , the bitterness of hatred , the deep tenderness of love , or any other expression of an agonized and overexcited sensibility ; no one who has shed such enchanting colors over the shadowy past , or sketched with more delicate hand the features of the various races with whom he has mingled , or incorporated his own soul , as it were , with such grand and beautiful forms of nature . He is , indeed , emphatically the poet of passion . We must not omit his extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of greater compass , on the whole , than any writer since the time of Milton ; not for the utterance of a monotonous melody , which depends chiefly on the accurate measurement of feet and syllables , and belongs rather to the eye than the ear , but that various harmony , which , adapting the expression , as far as possible , to the various movements of the spirit , can proceed only from thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers . ' Byron 's poetical career proved uncommonly fascinating , especially to the young . There was something that struck the imagination , in the spectacle of one placed on the heights of fortune turning a cold eye on all those illusions of rank and reputation , which the world prize most dearly , and seeking relief for his wearied spirit in the wild solitudes of nature . In a similar vein , quantities of young gentlemen might be seen , who , as Prince Arthur says , Would be as sad as night Fromvery wantonness ; ' and minstrels i to Byron , a good deal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their laments from every nook of town and country . The public at first extended its sympathy to these unfortunate bards , till it began at length to suspect that it was thrown away in being bestowed on persons , // who , surrounded by every luxury under heaven , could stretch themselves at ease in their elbow-chairs , with a kind of pre-determination to be miserable , and indite Spenserian stanzas on the vanities and nothingness of life . In short , this sort of whining was found much easier to write than to read . It consequently fell gradually into disrepute , as in bad taste , and has now , we believe , grown pretty much out of fashion* During this season of general poetic fecundity , the drama has , on the whole , been less prolific of excellence than in any preceding age . Few of the great contemporary poets have ventured on this field at all , still fewer have reaped any laurels from it . Miss Baillie is , perhaps , the only writer who has made the attempt on an extended scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . She has unfortunately written on a theory ; for every body works on a theory in this philosophic age . The principal purpose of her 's , was to make each play subservient to the development of some one particular passion . In this way , she excluded herself from the legitimate range of character , which belongs to the drama ; nor , indeed , was it possible , with any degree of skill , to adhere to her plan , since the r.6tes of the subordinate agents must often be at variance , and obviously require a different play of passion from that of the principal character . Various causes have been suggested for the poverty of the drama in the present age . One , among others , is the perfection to which the histrionic art , together with the subsidiary accompaniments of costume and theatrical decoration , has been gradually raised , the effect of which is to divert the attention from the play to the player ; while , in Shakspeare s day , the audience , pent up within the narrow limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards and immovable scenery , went more to study the poet than the players . The chief cause , however , of the depression of the drama , may be traced to the more extended cultivation and reading habits of the public. , which led them to seek intellectual recreation by their own fire-sides , rather than in the heat and pesti* lent atmosphere of a crowded assembly . This augmentation of the number of readers , moreover , induced the author to turn such dramatic talent as he possessed into some other channel for its development , more in conformity than the theatre with the popular taste ; as novel-writing , for example , // Whatever may be the reasons , however , there can be no doubt , that dramatic writing was never at a lower ebb in Great Britain , than at present . Indeed its revival , to any considerable extent , would seem to contradict all past experience in literature , which appears incapable of being stimulated by any industry to re-production , in a department which has once been successfully cultivated . And where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in England , under Elizabeth and James ? Poetry in our own country , during the present century , has felt a similar impulse with that communicated to it on the other side of the water . Indeed , nourished as we are , from similar sources , and subjected to a common discipline with English writers , our literature can only be a new variety of theirs . It may appear at first view , that poetic talent has been somewhat tardy in unfolding itself among us . But when did art or science ever first take root under a dependent colonial Government , as was ours till the latter part of the last century ? Or , in a season of political agitation , which was our situation during the remainder of the age ? They may , indeed , continue to flourish through such periods , from the impulse given at a preceding one . We do not mean , however , that the Muse was absolutely and invariably dumb during all this time , but she certainly never raised her voice to a lofty key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of that mediocre sort , which , in honest Dogberry 's phrase , is very tolerable and altogether not to be endured . ' Since the establishment , however , of political independence and tranquillity , poetic talent has been developed among us in a considerable variety of beautiful forms , though in none of them , perhaps , on a very extended or elaborate scale . NewEngland has been hitherto the quarter of the country where it has been most successfully cultivated , whether owing to the severer character of the climate , or the more sedate and thougbt* ful temper of the people , or a more careful education than is to be found in other parts of the Union ; circumstances which have all of them been found more or less favorable to the nurture of poetic sensibility . The general complexion of this poetry is serious and contemplative , with a pretty uniform tinge of religious sentiment , austere sometimes and even gloomy , with many delicate touches of natural tenderness and a strong relish for the beauties of // external nature . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and might be relieved by a larger infusion of the sportive sallies of wit and fancy . Bryant is , by very general consent , placed at the bead of our poetic department . His writings , are distinguished by those graces which belong to naturally fine perceptions and a chastised taste . A deep moral feeling , serious hut not sad , tinctures most of his views of man and nature , and insensibly raises thought from the contemplation of these lower objects , to that of the Mind who formed them . Bryant has proved* beyond any other writer , the fruitfulness of our country in poetic topics and illustrations . This is indeed the proper theatre for the American artist , the only one on which he can aspire to the praise of originality . Our inferiority to the old world , England , for example , in poetic material , has been often insisted on . It is true we have none of the stirring associations belonging to an illustrious body of ancient annals , and our soil is not strewed with the lingering monuments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present race with the age of feudal heroism ; but then we have nature unfolded around us under a new aspect , and one every way as grand and as lovely as any in the old world ; and we have man also , as exhibited under the influence of new institutions , and those better suited to the free expansion of his intellectual and moral faculties , than any hitherto known . If all this be not sufficient to warm the poet* s visions , the fault must lie with him . From poets we naturally pass to criticism , which , in the presQnt age , has experienced a modification , that may be almost reckoned an invention . The old-fashioned periodical essays , the legitimate progeny of the Tattler and Spectator , had been gradually supplanted , after a run of nearly a century , by critical journals , devoted to the analysis of modern publications , but on the most frigid and spiritless principle , unenlivened by a single spark of philosophy or liberal speculation . In order to supply these manifold defects , an association was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of gentlemen , among whom were Messrs . Jeffrey , Brougham , Smith , and some others , whose names , then just rising into notoriety , have since shed so bright an illumination over the various walks of politics and letters . This , as is well known , was the origin of the celebrated Edinburgh Review . The entirely novel prin* // ciple on which the work was conducted , made the experiment a bold one . The public scarcely knew what to think of reviews , that seemed to have as little relation to the work reviewed , as Mr. Bayes 's tragedy to his prologue , which might stand for any other play as well as his . ' They stood aghast , moreover , at the intrepidity with which the new adventurers , fighting under their sanguinary motto , judex damnatur curn nocens absolvitur , waged indiscriminate hostility , not merely against the smaller craft that infest the seas of literature , but those of the heaviest metal . There was some lack of closet erudition in the confederacy , but this was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact as to the management of their resources , and a happy confidence , which converted the reviewer into a sort of Dr. Pancrace , homrne de suffisance , homme de capacit* , homme consomm* dans toutes les sciences naturelles , morales , et politiqiles ; homme savant , savantissime per omnes modos et casus , &amp;c , &amp;c . ' The public in short was fairly taken by surprise . The journal spread at once into an unprecedented circulation , and men seemed xvilhing for a time to resign their judg* ments , even their old established prcjudices , to these invisible self-constituted aristarchs . In the mean time , the tories of the south saw with dismay this powerful engine in the hands of their adversaries , scattering doctrines savoring of little less than heresy in their estimation , whether in politics , religion , or letters . They accord* ingly provided an antidote in the London Quarterly , for the purpose of neutralizing the revolutionary principles of the whigs , both in politics and religion ; understanding by the latter term , much the same with parson Thwackum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian religion , and not only the Christian religion , but the Protestant religion , and not only the Protestant religion , but the church of England . ' The conduct of the war was intrusted to Mr. Gifford , a gentleman of indjsputa* ble erudition , and who , if less vivacious and less cunning of fence than his northern rival , had given sufficient proofs of his powers of flagellation. , on the backs of the hickless Della Cruscans . Between these opposite forces , collision soon occurred on all topics of general interest or Importance , and the public , bewib dered with the conflicting pretensions to infallibility , seemed now , for the first time , to comprehend that there might be two // sides to every question . The deference to the primitive journal of course gradually subsided , and this decline of favor was accelerated by the evidence which every day unfolded of the inaccuracy of its predictions , not merely in the doubtful element of politics , but in literature , where more than one individual , whom the northern critics would have stifled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which entirely overshadowed their own comparatively puny dimensions . Witness , for example , Byron , Wordsworth , Madame de Sta*l , and the like , whose genius might well have been chilled by the early criticism they experienced , if genius like theirs could be chilled by criticism , or , as Byron somewhere expresses it , if The sublime etherial particle Could be extinguished by an article . ' These egregious blunders occasioned no slight distrust of the capacity of the critics , while the spirit of faction , which swayed the opinions , more or less , of both journals , brought equal discredit on their integrity ; and thus the despotic authority , which in their corporate capacity and incognito condition they at first assumed over public sentiment , and which might have been perpetuated much longer by a discreet management , fell to the ground , or at least faded away into that degree of influence , which fairly attaches to a clever writer , according to the more or less skilful execution of his work . What , on the whole , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a question too prolific of discussion for us to take up here . It may be generally affirmed of the two leading reviexvs , that they have shown the usual ductility which naturally belongs to such as depend on popular favor for their support , and that they have consequently more frequently followed than guided public opinion . It is also true , that the appetite for the short-lived notoriety , which is all that any article in a periodical work can promise itself , has stimulated the writer to aim too much at striking points , to say what is new , rather than what is true ; and has more than once encouraged a flippant temerity of criticism , which proves its author to be utterly incapable of raising himself to the level of the work he depreciates . With every defect , however , necessarily incident to so miscellaneous a concoction , both one and the other review may // claim the credit of being the depositories of much valuable speculation on subjects of greatest interest and moment . The Edinburgh , notwithstanding the imputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laxity of principle , has furnished many examples of a liberal philosophy in its disquisitions on government , and has discussed many questions of taste and general literature with singular ingenuity , eloquence , and richness of illustration . The Quarterly , with all its bigotry and dogmatism , has large claims on our consideration for the soundness of its erudition , and in particular the activity of its geographical researches , while the tone of literary criticism , although less dashing and presumptuous than its rival 's , has been , on the whole , more conscientious and of a more uniformly healthful character . It is singular that these two great journals , after having run along for so many years , the one as the supporter , the other as the constant impugner of administration , should have completely changed position . The position , not the principles , are changed , however , and the Quarterly still maintains the same resolute front as of yore , against revolutionary movement , reminding us of some gallant frigate , which , getting stranded in the action , still keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns at the enemy , one after another , a spirit worthy of a better fate . Review-writing , in the form we have been examining , has been pursued to a considerable extent in England , and to still greater in the modified form of magazines , whose existence indeed dates from a much earlier period . The most conspicuous of these , perhaps , is Blackwood 's , a work whose bigotted toryism of principle presents a whimsical contrast with the dashing dandyism of its manner . In our own country , we may be allowed to consider the introduction of reviews , on the whole , as salutary . As they have been hitherto conducted , they have served to invigorate the patriotic principle within our bosoms , and they have afforded a shelter , long demanded , against the blasts of foreign criticism , which swept too rudely over our young nurseries of literature . They have done some service to the State , also , by affording a gymnasium , as it were , in which the literary tyro might try the strength of his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be considered as better suited to the intellectual condition of this country than of any country // in Europe , because , although up to a certain point there ? s a more diffused and equal civilization here , yet there does . not exist , as there , the depth of scholarship which leads men to take an interest in more laborious and erudite researches . One thing may be observed in commendation of the course pursued by our periodicals , that it has generally , we may say indeed uniformly , been decorous and dignified , unstained by the vulgar party squabbles and brutal personalities , that disfigure the best of those in the mother country . Our literature furnishes some agreeable specimens of magazine and the other subordinate varieties of periodical writing , which seem less intended for a didactic purpose , than as the mere jouissances of fancy . But our society as yet hardly affords material for any great success in this way . The Newspaper opens another most prolific chapter in the literary history of our time . No machinery can be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society . It may be said to have done for mind , what the invention of rail-roads has done for body , by opening a rapid communication between the most distant points , so that thought has been made to travel , or rather to flash like an electric spark , from one extremity of this vast community to the other . It is above all important in a Republic , and especially one of the immense ierritorial extent of ours , where the ready transmission of knowledge connected with public affairs , so essential to every individual , is greatly impeded by local distance . The free States of antiquity were so circumscribed in extent , that every citizen , that is , every one who took part in the conduct of affairs , could be brought at once within reach of the orator 's voice ; and something like a similar result may be said to have been effected in our extended community , by means of the gossamer machinery of the press . At the present moment , there are probably three times as many newspapers published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than in all the States of Christendom united . Many . who have assumed the duties of editorship , are doubtless incompetent to it , and do a sensible mischief by inundating the public with crude and intemperate opinions . But these contradictory crudities serve in some degree to neutralize each other ; and perhaps the advantage gained by the more active circulation of facts may be thought , in our practical common-sense community , to more than counterbalance any // mischief resulting from opinions . It were much to be desired , however , that public patronage were sufficient to enable the editors of our newspapers to command the same extent of talent and accomplishment , with that which is put in requisition by the principal journalists of Europe . The greatest evil resulting from the swarm of newspapers in this country , is the jeopardy to which , from the personal necessities of many of the editors , it exposes the independence of the press . The control of so potent an engine becomes a matter of such consequence in a government like ours , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain possession of it . But the independence of the press is so vital a principle in a Republic , that when once it has been impaired to any considerable extent , the first blow to public liberty has been given . Another class of composition , worthy of distinct notice , is the modern novel , which has assumed so imposing a form in our time , that it may be taken as the significant feature of the literature of the age , in the same manner as the drama was of that of Queen Elizabeth . Indeed the novel of character is only a development of the drama in a more expanded form . In its prose dress , it is better suited to the practical , business-like spirit of the times , than in its poetical . Its length is far more favorable to an accurate and philosophic analysis of character , while , in this shape , it is accommodated to those habits of reading , which , as we have before noticed , belong to our age , as much as the professed drama was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier stages of a nation . Moral portraiture , or the delineation of character , has been a favorite study with the English from the time of Shakspeare . They have enjoyed facilities for this study in consequence of the freedom of their institutions , which has permitted the unchecked development of the natural disposition , in all its vigor and eccentricity . They have had no inquisition , no lettre de cachet , no courtly etiquette , to control the freedom of their natural movements ; and , as a familiarity with the naked models of manly beauty carried the Greek sculptor to the highest excellence , so the free exhibition of character furnished models for the dramatist , which have enabled him to reach a similar perfection in his art . The practical matter-of-fact habits of the English have led them , moreover , both in philosophy and in fiction , to prefer // correct views of human nature , to those ideal ones suggested by the exalted imaginations of the South . Hence , they have been led to ctjprofondir ( to borrow the French phrase ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be made is , that the English have generally felt too little respect for the rules , or in other words , too little solicitude for mere external form , to sacrifice to it in any degree the main purpose of characterization , as is constantly done in France and Italy , where the chief object seems to be to produce a fine work of art , rather than a just transcript of nature . The English have scarcely any other regard for plot or intrigue , than as it affords fine points of view for the display of character ; as Mr. Bayes says , What the deuce is a plot good for , except to bring in fine things ? ' Keeping this one object , therefore , constantly in view , which has only formed a subordinate , or at least collateral one with other nations , the English have certainly exhibited a skilful and searching anatomy of man , such as we shall look for in vain in the literature of any dther people . There is no novelist of our time , whose works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  being all in one way or another directed to utility , that main-spring of the movements of the present age . The weighty moral with which they are loaded , indeed , frequently presses heavily on the light vehicle of fiction , giving it a coarse business air ; while the perpetual accommodation of the intrigue to the moral often produces an appearance of violence in the piece , that impairs its value as a work of art . With these and other obvious defects as an artist , however , Miss Edgeworth may claim the rare praise of having perfectly succeeded in the great purpose which she proposed , of enlightening and improving the age , by imparting to it new ideas on the subject of education , taken in its most extended sense . Thus , by means of the deep interest attaching to her sagacious and vivid portraiture of character , she has wrought greater results with fiction , than could have been accomplished by the most profound philosophical treatise . The Waverley novels effected an entire revolution in this branch of literature , both by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher finish of execution . Scott 's genius would seem , on the whole , even better suited for prose fiction than for poetry . It may be thought somewhat wanting in the ideal , for the hi*hest* excellence in the latter ; it is social , worldly // even , never risiu0 above the popular tone , or to speak more accurately , capability of feeling . In his own account of himself , we find him constantly estimatin * his success by his popularity . His rank as a poet he seems willing to rest on the sale of his poetry . These , however , sometimes happen to be in an inverse ratio to each other among contemporaries . We find him watching every shifting of the popular breeze , and ready to put himself on another tack , with the easy dexterity of an old navigator . We can hardly imagine him , like Wordsworth , steadily pursuing his own course in defiance of contemporary criticism , and looking with calm coufide* ce ( is it conceit ? ) on the final verdict of posterity . Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual excellences of his craft . They are all , moreover , blended in such exquisite harmony together , that , as in some beautiful model of architecture , we are struck rather with the effect of the whole , than with the prominence of any particular part . We hear of Smollett 's sea-pieces , Fieldiub 's English humor , Richardson 's domestic , Miss Burney 's fashionable life . and the like , but never find Scott 's Muse limited to this or that walk . On the contrary , she moves with equal freedom over them all , the throng and bustle of the city , as well as the solitudes of her native hills ; taking in at a glance , not merely the glaring extremes of character and situation , but the thousand delicate gradations that lie between . Her eye , moreover , wandering beyond the limits of present *xistence , seeks for new subjects in the depths of time , and invests them with the appropriate costume , which may be said to convert the past into the present . All this implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same mind , altogether unprecedented , since they are so dissimilar in their natures , that one has generally been found to stifle the other . Scott 's style is as various and comprehensive as his subject . Fielding and Smollett have no great merit , except in direct narrative or dialogue . Miss Burney 's style is intolerable out of dialogue . Miss Edgeworth would scarcely venture into the region of the picturesque , and Mrs. Radcliffe is good for nothing out of it , except , indeed , when she is in her horrors . But Scott 's natural eloquence illumines with equal felicity every portion of his subject , throwing it into the lights most suitable to poetical effect . Scott 's greatest glory , however , arises from the superior dignity // to which he has rcLised the novel not by its historic , but its moral character , so that instead of being obliged , as with Fielding 's and Srnollett 's , to devour it , like Sancho Panza 's cheese-cakes , in a corner as it were , it is now made to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembled family . 1n all his multifarious fictions , we remember no line , which in a moral point of view he might wish to blot . Fortunate man , 4vho , possessed of power sufficient to affect the moral destinies of his age , has possessed also the inclination to nive that power a uniformly beneficent direction ! Who beside him , amid the brilliant display of benius , or the wildest frolics of wit and fancy , has never been led to compromise for a moment the interests of virtue ? The splendid illumination thrown by Scott over the new path , naturally drew a throng of adventurers into it . Novels of fashionable life were followed by novels of low life , the froth and the dregs of society , which seemed through its whole extent to be literally turned inside out , by these charactermongers , for the inspection of the curious . Even the most solid unpromising topics were imposed on the novel , as being the most convenient vehicle for fact as well as fiction , and the public were deluged with romances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey or Persia , or some out of the way country , whose distance might seem to settle it in the realms of imagination . The tendency of all this to vitiate the palate , and indispose it to more healthful but less dainty diet , has been more insisted on , we imagine , than it deserves . Our readers will readily excuse us from a discussion far beyond our limits , and we will only remal , that the peculiar talents developed in novel-writing would probably , if this channel had not been opened , have been turned into some similar one best suited to their peculiar constitution . In this view , society would have gained little , for it will hardly be pretended that the novel is a more pernicious form for the exhibition of fancy or sentiment , than any other . It seems , therefore , to stand on the same ground with other varieties of merely ornamental literature , which are capable of being defended ,  --  to assume the very lowest ground ,  - -  as an intellectual relaxation , whose abuse , not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , arrayed in all the proprieties of historic costume , it assumes a much higher rank , scarcely inferior in its practical importance to that of history // itself ; for , after all , what is history , but grouping together in masses what the novelist analyzes as individuals ? Our own countryman , Mr. Cooper , is admitted by very general consent to have distanced every other competitor in the route struck out by the author of Waverley . We would not be understood by this language , to imply any thing like a servile imitation , in the detracting spirit of some English journals for Cooper is no more an imitator of Scott , than Milton is of Shakspeare , because they both wrote in blank verse , or than Scott himself is of this latter , whom he resembles in the fond , though not the form of his writings . If this be imitation , it is more glorious than most originality . Cooper complains , in his ' Notions of the Americans , ' that our country is deficient in the materials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This topic , like some others which we have run our heads against in the course of this article , is much too large for our limits , and we must refer the inquisitive reader to Mr. Cooper 's own remarks . He seems to attest his conviction of their justice , by escaping as often as his plan will permit into the back-xvood settlements , or still further into the wilderness , or , more than all , to his favorite element of the ocean . In flying thus from the social haunts of men to these regions , which lay as it were on the confines of fancy , the novelist , we suspect , has consulted his own capacity , quite as much as that of his subject . These are comparatively the regions of poetry , and any one whose eye has wandered over Mr. Cooper 's pictures of them , will confess how deeply his soul is filled with the poetic feeling . This is particularly apparent in his representations of his own element , the ocean , which he seems , like Byron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who would feel the superiority of his manner , contrast it with the no less accurate , hut comparatively vulgar sketches of another poet sailor , Smollett . Cooper 's great defect is his incapacity to seize the tone of good society ; we say incapacity , for his repeated failures , we think , put it beyond a doubt . Nothing can be more lamentable than the compound of affectation , primness , and pedantry , a sort of hack-woods gentility , which makes up with him the greater part of its dialogue and its manners . Defects like these would seem to be the natural result of an imperfect education , as *ve1l as a want of familiarity with well-bred society- . But this last can scarcely he imputed to Mr. Cooper , and his experience // of late years must have abundantly enlarged the sphere of his social observation , for all practical purposes . Has he shown a corresponding improvement ? We must not omit , in a survey of the prose fiction of our age , our ingenious countryman , Mr. Irving , whose compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and luxurious state of society ; singular , indeed , that they should have emanated from the bosom of a plain , commonsense community , like our own . That they are addressed to such an Epicurean society , as we have adverted to , is evident , both from the seductive and somewhat effeminate character of their topics , and their brilliant literary finish . Far from being directed to the business principle of utility , they seem to be chiefly intended as a sort of intellectual jouissance , conveying the most attractive sentiment under the most attractive forms of expression . Constant appeal is made to the sensibility , whether by means of comedy or pathos , and , as if natural passion were not sufficiently stimulant , the comic is often carried into the grotesque , and the pathetic sometimes into the bathos of sentiment . We may remark , that Mr. Irving 's disposition occasionally to overcharbe his pictures , runs less risk with the comic than with the pathetic , since the caricature of the former is by no means so fatal to its effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded , both in relation to his subjects , especially when Anierican , and his mode of treating them , as in every respect an original writer . With all this originality , however , he occasionally repeats himself , and becomes somewhat monotonous . Perhaps a conviction of the truth of this may have been an additional motive with him for abandoning , for a time , fiction for history . Some churlish spirits have censured our amiable countryman , for employing his pencil too largely on English subjects , as if there were something like treason , or at least want of patriotism , in it . But surely there can be few sensations more interesting to an American possessed of genius and sensibility , than those excited by the contemplation of the land of his ancestors , thronged with so many glorious historic recollections , and embellished by all the arts of modem civilization . Nor is it easy to see , how he can disparage his own country by a manly homage to the virtues of another . The candor with which the English have recognized Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , while his genius has experienced a still more unequivocal homage , in the countless imitations to which he has given rise ; imitations , whose uniform failure , notwithstanding all the appliances of accomplishment and talent , proves their model to be inimitable . History can not fall within a survey of elegant literature , except so far as relates to its rhetorical execution . In this particular , some writers of the age , as Mitford and Turner , for example , bave been so abominably perverse , that it would seem as if they were willing to try what degree of bad writing the public would tolerate , for the sake of the valuable matter it may contain . Others again , as Southey and Scott , blessed with a style at once perspicuous and picturesque , seem bent on counteracting these advantages , by a rapidity of composition , which sets at defiance every thing like arrangement , conciseness , or proportion . But as if no speed of an individual , however great , could keep pace with the public appetite , associations have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , through all its thousand channels . Every thing now-a-days is done by association . The principle of concentrating a large mass on a given point , is found no less effective in civil than military matters , and an association is made the great lever by which most of the problems , whether in science or letters , are to be moved . Societies are organized for the diffusion of useful knowledge , of entertaining knowledge , and the like . The great object appears to be the civilization of the lower classes of society , up to the level , or near the level of the higher . It is found , that in proportion as government becomes more democratic in its form ,  --  which is the regular progress of the age ,  --  the necessity becomes stronger for rendering the people more intelligent . The failure of France , and the success of our own country , leave no room for skepticism on this head . Joint stock co *panies in literature are , therefore , instituted to enlighten the public by wholesale , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like , pour forth in monthly , nay , weekly prodigality , from the indefatigable press , afforded at a price so low , as to secure them a place on every man 's sbelf . Thi. , it must be admitted , as the worthy alderman *aid , is most excellent soup for the poor ; quite good enough . indeed , much of it , for the most cultivated epicurean palate . What the tendency of opening so many royal roads to // knowledge may be , is a formidable question . It doubtless must contribute largely to the intellectual advancement of the middling orders in England . But it is highly probable that it involves , to a certain extent , the sacrifice of the highest order of talent and erudition ; for the most highly gifted minds are largely enlisted in these enterprises ; and if writers like Mackintosh or Sisinondi can obtain a larger premium and a more ready popularity for these comparatively superficial productions , they will scarcely waste their hours in hiving curious learning , or embodying it in the results of patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way , the cause of society may be thought to gain more . If fewer great works are produced , there are likely to he more good ones , good enough for ordinary practical uses . Works like these , shot up in a day , must expect indeed to die with the day . But the present age may be the gainer , although posterity should be the loser . We can hardly close these remarks without adverting to the l ) i*esent literary prospects of our country , although we have too much consideration for the reader , to do more than glance at them . At first view , these prospects might appear unpromising , for nothing would seem more repugnant to success in the lighter and i-nore elegant productions of literature , than the engrossing business habits of our community . The attention might he naturally turned from them by the brilliant career opened to talent in public and professional life , by the seductions of commercial adventure , by the large encouragement given to those sciences , which have the most obvious application to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows little scope for that munificent individual patronage , which fosters the liberal arts in other countries ; while this subdivision , moreover , reduces the number of such as can afford leisure for their cultivation . And , lastly , the ready importation of the most elegant articles of literary luxury , of every variety and of the highest finish , from England , leaves little encourabement for domestic industry ; while our most enterprising publishers can hardly be expected to advance liberal prices on doubtful native productions , when they can import those , whose popularity has been already ascertained , free of cost , from abroad . But with all these discouraging circumstances , a much more comfortable augury may be gathered , both from the internal // consciousness of our own strength , and the results of past ex-* perience . Amidst every difficulty of situation , there is scarcely any path of active or contemplative life , in which we have not pushed our way , whether for purposes of profit or of pleasure , with more or less success . We are placed within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , whether in relation to government , society , or the aspect of external nature . Some of these influences may be considered eminently favorable to intellectual action , and the bold and unchecked display of nature in all its eccentricity . Although a young people , moreover , we are furnished with an old and highly finished language , capable of conveying , in all its fleshness , every variety of impression produced on us by the novelties of our situation . With regard to the disastrous operation of foreign competition on our domestic industry , such are our natural buoyancy and enterprise , that it has hitherto been found to stimulate rather than depress it , in every department , whether physical or moral , to which it has been directed . Our popular patronage , too , though not on the same scale with that of the old world , has hitherto proved perfectly competent to the protection of works of real excellence . We may add , that our capacity for such productions in the highest kinds of ornamental literature , and in the collateral pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be to our habitual direction , is well illustrated by the fact , that we claim as our countrymen two of the most eminent writers of fiction of the present day , by the admission of the English themselves , Irving and Cooper , and three of the most distinguished artists , Allston , Leslie , and Newton . We will only remark in conclusion , what can not be repeated too often , that the American writer , if he would aspire to the credit of originality , must devote his days and nights to the study of the models around him . Not that he should relinquish the rich inheritance which English genius has bequeathed to him , in common with his brethren across the water . But , however enriched the mould may be by foreign culture , the product of his fancy should he no exotic , but spring from native seed , if it would come to healthy maturity . The English writer may copy from books with less harm than the American , because he has the original models of these books around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amencan drawing from the same sources will , at best , produce but a // second-hand imitation of nature . If lie would he original , he must study the volume which nature herself has unrolled before him.
