Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : THE BLIND MAN 'S LAY . from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath ( 1837 ) " At times Allan felt as if his blindness were a blessing  --  for it forced him to trust to his own soul  --  to turn for comfort to the best and purest human affections  --  and to see God always . Fanny could almost have wept to see the earth and the sky so beautiful , now that Allan 's eyes were dark ; but he whispered to her , that the smell of the budding trees and of the primroses , that he knew were near his feet , was pleasant indeed , and that the singing of all the little birds made his heart dance within him . "  --  Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life . He sat beside the fountain , on whose brink A troop of blue-eyed violets oped their lids To the first breezy call of early spring  --  And there , from the grey dawn till twilight 's gloom , Where the soft , springing moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch , Telling the nightfall near ,  --  he mused away Long hours of silent happiness , save when The soft and pitying words of love would call His spell-bound spirit from its blissful thrall ; Then , in a voice of sweetest melody , He breathed his unrepining , meek reply : Though I hear thee gaily tell Of the tulip 's shaded bell , Of the wall-flower 's varied hue , And the violet " darkly blue , " And the crimson blush that glows On the rich , voluptuous rose  --  These no longer bloom for me , These I never more may see . But this gentle season still Can my heart with gladness fill  --  I can hear the spring-winds blow , And the gurgling fountains flow . Hark ! e'en now a zephyr breathes , Through the balmy hawthorn wreaths , Unfelt , unheard by all but me , It swells so soft , so silently ! I can hear the humming-bee Flitting o'er the sunny lea , Wooing every bashful flower , From morn till evening 's dewy hour . All around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of merry childhood , greet my ear , With power the saddest heart to cheer . When o'er earth night 's shadow lies , I hear thee tell of cloudless skies , And countless stars that twinkle through Heaven 's broad and boundless arch of blue ; Of snow white spires and turrets fair Soft gleaming in the moonlit air , Whose dusky depths of shadow lie Heightening the brilliant scenery . Then beneath the pine trees tall , Near yonder foaming waterfall , I listen to the stock dove 's wail , Far floating through the quiet vale ; Soft sighing breezes waft to me The fragrance of the birchen tree  --  And the " brawling burnie " wimples by With a gush of soothing melody . E'en all sweet sense of these will fade At times  --  as though impervious shade Like that which hides me from the day , O'er each external image lay  --  Then many a form thou canst not see , Unfolds its sun-bright wings to me , And deep within my silent soul High thoughts and holiest visions roll . Full many an angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around my sylvan throne There seems to wake a dreamy tone Of solemn music through the air , So wildly sweet  --  so silvery clear  --  So full of heaven  --  no tongue can tell The raptures that my bosom swell . Not all the joys that have their birth In the vain pageantries of earth , Are half so fraught with power to bless , So rich in pensive happiness . Wrapt in these lonely reveries , Serene and holy transports rise , Such as we deem pure spirits know , Such as from God 's felt presence flow . Thus , when affliction 's friendly screen Shuts out life 's vain illusive scene  --  When thus she seals our weary eyes To all its glittering vanities , A gleam of heavenly light will pour Our dark despairing spirits o'er , And Faith , with meek and steadfast eye , Far glancing through eternity , Sees where the heavenly mansions rise , Of her bright home beyond the skies , Whose golden fanes sublimely tower High o'er the clouds that round us lower . Then welcome sorrow 's shrouding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And leave me to that dawning ray That brightens till the " perfect day . " Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : RETROSPECTION. from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath ( 1837 ) My heart is in my childhood 's home , And by the far-off sunny braes , Where , musing , once I loved to roam , In early youth 's romantic days . The past  --  the past  --  the dreamy past , Called up by memory 's magic wand , Gleams through the halo round it cast , Bright as e'en hope 's own phantom land . Oh never more in after life Can hope itself such dreams impart As then , with breathing beauty rife , Wreathed their soft spells around my heart . The skies were brighter then , than now , More bland the wandering breezes blew , The birds sang sweeter on the bough , The wild flowers wore a richer hue . Ideal forms of classic lore , By moss-grown grot and crystal well , Seemed still to linger as of yore , And fairies danced in every dell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green and laughing earth ; While wooded cliff and wild ravine , Were echoing to my bosom 's mirth . For care had never dimm 'd my brow , Nor friends proved heartless and untrue ; I ne'er had wept love 's broken vow , Nor aught of life 's dark changes knew . Farewell , sweet scenes of past delight ! Slowly ye sink from memory 's gaze , Still beaming with reflected light , As bathed in twilight 's parting rays . I wander on my weary way , Unmindful where my lot is cast , Since wheresoe'er my footsteps stray , They can not lead me to the past . Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : TO THE SPIRIT OF POETRY . from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath ( 1837 ) Hail ! queen of high and holy thought ; Of dreams , with fairy beauty fraught ; Sweet memories of the days gone by ; Glimpses of immortality . Visions of grandeur , glory , power , All that in inspiration 's hour , Like sunset 's changing glories roll Within the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold , Around the setting day-star rolled  --  Thou walkest through the sapphire sky , When the bright moon is sailing high , Touching the stars with purer light , And lending holier charms to night : The clouds a deeper glory wear , The winds a softer music bear , And earth is heaven , when thou art there . There 's not a murmur on the breeze , Nor ripple on the dark , blue seas , Nor breath of violets , faintly sweet , Nor glittering dewdrop at our feet , Nor tinge of mellow radiance , where Soft moon-beams melt along the air ; Nor shade , nor tint , on flower or tree , But takes a softer grace from thee . And love itself  --  the brightest gem In all creation 's diadem  --  Oh ! what were mortal love , didst thou Not lend a glory to his brow ? Degraded , though of heavenly birth , And sullied with the cares of earth  --  Wasted and worn , by doubts and fears , Its youthful smiles soon change to tears : But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death ; And , robed in heavenly charms by thee , It puts on immortality .
