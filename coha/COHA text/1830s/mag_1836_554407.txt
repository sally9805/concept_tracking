txt WE hardly know of a more important service that can be rendered to the cause of useful knowledge in this country , than the collecting and reprinting of scarce documents relating to its early history . Of these the number is vast , far exceeding what any one whose attention has not been particularly drawn to the subject , would be led to suppose . No nation , indeed , ancient or modern , possesses such abundant materials as ours , for an authentic and minute account of its origin and growtb . From the very first planting of Virginia and New England , manyof the leading colonists were accustomed to keep journals of the daily occurrences and trausactions , that attended their hard and perilous enterprise . Individuals too , who , from curiosity , or for purposes of traffic and gain , occasionally visited these parts , drew up narratives of the condition and progress of the new settlements ; and both of these classes of papers were , from time to time , sent home , and printed in small p* mphlets in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which remained in the country , and was preserved to lie in manuscript , we would now simply refer to the document which passes under the name ( for what reason , is at this time unknown , ) of " Mourt 's Relation , " and to Edward Winslow 's " Good News from New England " ; which two papers present a detailed aud most interesting narrative of the affairs of Plymouth Colony , for the first three years after the landing of the Fathers . These and similar documents relating to the discovery and colonization of the New World , it is well known , were collected , at the time they were printed , by the indefatigable Purchas , and published by him in an abridged form , in that invaluable storehouse of historical knowledge which he entitles , his " Pilgrimes . " The number of these tracts and pamphlets , however , was so great , that even that immense repository could contain but a small part of them . After Purchas 's day , what with the settlement of new colonies , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial relations and interests , the works relatin0 to this country accumulated to such a degree , that in the year 1713 , a bare catalogue of their titles , published by Bishop Kennett , under the name of J3ibliotheccs Americanco Primordia , filled a quarto volume of 275 pages . // Having , for the most part , been printed in England , these early tracts have always been exceedingly rare in this country , very few of them probably having been imported ; and of some of them , even to this day , not a single copy is known to exist on this side of the Atlantic . Who among us , for instance , has ever seen John Brereton 's " Brief and true Relation of the Discoverie of the North Part of Virginia , ( i. e . New England , ) made this present year 1602 , by Captain Bartholomew Gosnold , " which contains a particular account of Gosnold 's discovery and naming of Cape Cod , and of his attempt to effect the first settlement in New England by establishing a colony upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the euphonious appellation of Cuttyhunk ? Who has ever seen John Clarke 's ( physician of Rhode Island , ) " Ill News from New England , or a Narrative of New England Persecution , wherein it is declared , that while Old England is becoming new , New England is becoming old , "  --  a work which the learned editor of Winthrop 's " Journal " tells us he has sought for in vain in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , and fears it is irrecoverably lost ; though we happen to know that this , as well as the other work just mentioned , is perfectly safe in London , in Colonel Aspinwall 's valuable collection of books relating to America ? Who in this country has ever seen the Apostle Eliot 's " Christian Commonwealth , " a book which the General Court of Massachusetts , in their prudence , ordered him to retract , and took effectual measures to suppress , but one copy of which , however , escaped , and is preserved in the same collection * Who has ever seen William Pinchon 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Court ordered to be burnt on Boston Common ? Who has ever seen the notorious Sam . Gorton 's book , with the quaint , lengthy , and , to us , somewhat unintelligikle title , " Saltinarsh returned from the dead in Amico Philalethe , or the Resurrection of James the Apostle , out of the grave of carnal glosses , the correction of the universal apostate , which cruelly buried him who yet liveth , appearing in the comely ornaments of his fifth chapter , in an exercise , June 4th , 1654 . Having laid by his grave clothes , in * This collection , comprising 771 distinct works , ought , in some way or other , to be obtained for the Library of Harvard College . That institution is indebted to the munificence of two of the citizens of Boston , for securing for its use , the valuable historical libraries of Ebeling and Warden . Is there no one among us , equally enlightened and patriotic , who will complete that almost perfect department of the Library , and fill up its few reinainino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those just mentioned , and at the same time enroll his own name , with those of Israel Thorndike and Samuel A. Eliot , among the principal benefactors of the University ? // a despised village , remote from England , but wisbing well , and heartily desiring the true prosperity thereof ' ? A hundred similar books , of great interest and rarity , might be mentioned , the possession of which is indispensable to one who would undertake to write the history of the country , or would understand thoroughly the character and spirit of our forefathers . Yet where will he go to find them ? The only depositories in this country where he could look for them with any reasonable prospect of success , ( and for many of them , we know by experience , that he would there search in vain , ) are the libraries of Harvard University , the Boston Athen*eurn , and the Massachusetts Historical Society . It is to the Society just named , that we are indebted for the first attempt to multiply copies of these early papers . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published , down to the present day , when their twenty-fifth volume is just ready to appear , the members of that Society , amidst their other judicious and praiseworthy labors , have kept this object steadily in view ; and their Collections , accordingly , contain reprints of many rare and curious historical documents , which persons in general can have access to in no other form . In this useful work , they have had faithful and industrious followers , in the Historical Societies of New York , Pennsylvania , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Maine . Although we are of opinion , that such publications can be conducted with more judgment , and with a much greater prospect of continuance , by a body of men , associated from their common interest in historical inquiries , yet , at the same time , we are not unmindful of what has been done in this department by individuals , nor are we insensible to the value of the papers collected by Governor Hutchinson , Hazard , and more recently by Messrs . Farmer and Moore of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering into this wide field of historical investigation ; and we therefore welcome the appearance of the volume , which is named at the head of this article , and which has just issued from the press under the direction of Mr. Peter Force , a gentleman well known for his love of antiquarian research , and his extensive and familiar acquaintance with the sources of American history . It appears to be the first of a proposed series of volumes , that shall embrace pamphlets and smaller tracts , relating to the origin , settlement , and progress of the North American Colonies . The present volume contains thirteen distinct papers . The first five , occupying more than half the volume , relate to the planting and growth of the colony of Georgia , and , with a single exception , are reprints from tracts // published in London , from 1717 to 1742 . Of the eight remain ing papers , six relate to the settlement of Virginia , and detail the affairs and troubles of that colony from 1609 to 1676 . Two of the thirteen documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscripts ; they are , however , brief , one containing only four pages , and are , comparatively , of little value . Considering that the materials for a volume of this sort are so abundant , as we have already shown , we deem it a subject of regret that the editor should have thought fit to insert any document which had previously been reprinted in this country . This , however , he has done in three instances , and in two of them without informing his readers of the fact . In regard to the Narrative of Bacon 's and Ingram 's Rebellion in Virginia , ( a tract of forty-eight pages , originally published in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society , ) he may , indeed , plead as an apology , that the reprint was necessary from its connexion with the new matter , on the same subject , which he has now , for the first time , brought together in a volume . We are , however , inclined to the belief , that a simple reference to the volume where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all useful purposes . At any rate , we can see no good reason for reprinting " The New Life of Virginea , " and Francis Higgeson 's " New England 's Plantation , " both of which are included in the Collections of the abovenamed Society . if reprinted at all , they ought certainly to be reprinted entire . Yet in the former of these tracts , the letter of Graves , the Engineer , appended at the close , is omitted ; and four pages , appended in like manner to the latter tract , share the same fate ; so that the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society furnish not only the prior , but the more accurate copy of these two papers . With these slight abatements , we regard the volume before us as a very valuable contribution to the materials of our early history , and as highly creditable to the capacity and diligence of the editor . We are not unacquainted with the difficulties and vexations that attend the publication of works of this kind , and we therefore the more cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has so generously undertaken and so faithfully executed . We sincerely hope , that he will meet with sufficent encouragement to induce him to go on with this laudable , though not lucrative , enterprise ; and all that we would request is , that in his future volumes he would go a little further back for his materials , and reprint nothing that is already accessible in other forms . We intended , had the limits of this article permitted , to // give some account of another work projected by Mr. Force , in connexion with Matthew St. Clair Clarke , under a contract with the Government of the United States , to be entitled , " The Documentary History of the Revolution , " a work , the plan of which is gigantic , and the execution of which would be a task truly Herculean . The plan contemplates the publishing of every document relating to the history of the United States , whether printed or manuscript , from the origin of the colonies down to the adoption of the Federal Constitution . The work will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifteen hundred copies is estimated at four hundred and eight thousand dollars . We hope that the work , in some modified form , will go on ; although we very much fear that this large historical drag-net will sweep up some rubbish , as well as much valuable material . Should the first volume ever appear , we shall take an opportunity to go more at large into the subject.
