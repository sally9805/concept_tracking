txt The community are in our opinion deeply indebted to the proprietors and trustees of the Athenarnm , and especially to the public-spirited and intelligent gentlemen composing the committee employed for this purpose , for their unwearied and very successful exertions to organise an annual exhibition of paintings in this city . A spectacle of this kind , continued for a series of years , and afforded at a price , which places it within the reach of almost every citizen ,  --  whule it furnishes a cheap , rational and elegant entertainment ,  --  serves at the same time to refine and exalt the character of the people . Painting-like eloquence , poetry , and the other fine arts-is one of the developments and exhibitions of the higher and better principles of our nature . The cultivation of the art , and the habit of seeing and admiring its products , tend in connexion with other causes to raise the mind above the sordid interests of a merely material life . It has often been said  --  and probably with truth-that the peculiar grace and softness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been derived in part from the effect of a frequent contemplation of the treasures of art contained in the Gallery of the Louvre . The poet Goethe mentions as one of the means which he employed for maintaining his taste and talent in a progressive state , that he had crowded his study with the finest specimens of sculpture and painting , which he could procure . Nor is the advantage confined to an amelioration of the mere external forms of social life or a heightening of the aptitude for excellence in other branches of art . The taste for Beauty in art and nature is nearly allied to the love of Good-so nearly indeed , that it has often been doubted whether Beauty be any thing more than a visible manifestation of those amiable moral qualities of which the mere idea fills the heart with delightful emotions , and confers a charm on every person or thing with which they appear to be associated . However this may be , it is certain from experience , that a familiar observation of the beautiful forms of nature and the imitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of cherishing the benevolent affections , repress .. ing evil passions , and improving the general tone of moral feel // ing . In a community like ours , where the disposition to active pursuits , and the selfish views and angry controversies that are naturally connected with them , is perhaps too strong-where the form of the government keeps up an almost uninterrupted war of political parties-it is highly important that every prmciple of a soothing and civilising tendency should b* brought as much as possible into vigorous action . The cultivation of the arts , if not the most effectual of these priociples ,  --  and we are not disposed to exaggerate its influence ,  --  neverthe-. less has its value . It comes in aid of the great and essential elements of civilisation , which are found in a judicious system of political and religious institutions , and gives the last polish to the character of men and nations . Nor is it any objection to the encouragement and cultivation of the arts , that they may be and have been made subservient to the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to abstain from the use and enjoyment of all the good gifts of nature . It may also be re** marked , that in a young and progressive community like ours there is very little danger of such a result . The abuse of art for the purpose of flattering licentious passions is always a symptom of its decline , and indicates rather than produces a corrupt state of moral feeling .. While the condition of society is healthy , and the arts are flourishing , the artist is in general found to be endowed with a pure and excellent spirit . ' Art is then like the Archangel in Milton 's Poemk*evere in youthful beauty . She draws her inspirations from the high and holy sources of religion , and dwells in preference on subjects connected with serious contemplations . The artists of the age of Leo X. rarely employed their pencils upon any other than scriptural scenes ; and this very circumstance is doubtless one among the causes of their extraordinary success . They rejected with unerring instinct , rather than on fixed principles or from any calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train of their habitual studies , and such must ever be the case with those who have actually attained or are capable of rising to real excellence . We may add , that experience fully confirms the opinion , that in this country there is very little danger of the abuse of art . In painting  --  and the same may be said of the sister arts of eloquence and poetrythe prevailing style and the only one which meets with any // public favor is of the severest cast . This circumstance , independently of its other beneficial effects , may be looked upon as one of the most flattering prognostics of the progress which the arts will probably make among us . The only important exception to the uniformly pure and correct character of all the products of art in this country is to be found in our theatrical entertainments , which have hitherto been merely copies of the worst models that are furnished by the corrupt societies of the old world . If the managers of these entertainments would try the experiment of making them-as they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vice , they would soon find in the increased patronage bestowed upon them , the difference between obeying the just demands of the public sentiment , and treating them-as they now do. - with continual and systematic outrage . The exhibition of this year was not perhaps quite equal to some of the preceding ones . It contained , however , a considerable number of first-rate works of the old masters , several beautiful copies of originals in Europe , and a variety of excellent native productions in the different walks of this enchanting art . We propose to offer a few remarks upon some of the pieces which more particularly attracted our attention . It is impossible in a single article of this kind to exhaust the subject , and we shall not be understood to intimate that other pieces may not be equally or perhaps better entitled to notice . In making a selection , we must of course prefer those in which we felt the deepest interest , although this interest may have been in some cases the effect of accidental and local causes . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most remarkable was the . Martyrdam af St. Lawrence , by Titian . This large picture , belonging to Mrs. Meade of Philadelphia , is an undoubted original , in the best manner of that great artist , and in a state of complete preservation . It exhibits in full perfection the beauty , mellowness , and perfect truth of coloring , which formed the characteristic excellences of Titian , and in which he has never been surpassed . In the moral expression of his personages  --  the highest effect of the art-his superiority in this , as in his other works , is less denided . It is even somewhat difficult to determine precisely what expression 1:e intended to give to his principal figure . St. Lawrence-*- ' - as our readers will of course recollect-suf .. fered martyrdom in the not very poetical form of being broiled // to death upon a large gridiron . In the picture of which we are speaking , the Saint is stretched at his length on this instrument of torture over a blazing fire , which two or three executioners are engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gridiron is said to have been heated red hot before he was placed upon it . In the painting , there is , however , no effect of fire observable , either on the person or drapery of the martyr , and his face is turned upward with a perfectly serene and tranquil expression . It was probably the design of the artist to intimate by this expression , the triumph of religious faith and hope over bodily anguish ; but it is hard to conceive that the effect should extend so far as to guarantee the limbs and even the drapery from the action of fire . It would be therefore more natural to imagine that Titian meant to indicate a supernatural interposition in favor of the Saint , like that which is represented as having taken place at the martyrdom of St. Polycarp , when the flames that were kindled at the foot of the stake to which he was attached , retired as they rose from the person of the holy man , and formed a sort of hollow sphere around him , refusing even to singe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Titian would have varied from the legend , which states that St. Lawrence actually suffered death in this form ; and we may therefore conjecture that he probably sacrificed the truth of his painting , in order to avoid the exhibition of the disgusting image of mere physical suffering . In other respects , the image of nature is admirably preserved . The ferocious countenances of the executioners contrast finely with the sweet expression of the suffering Saint . The figures are well drawn and grouped , and the painting wears in every part the appearance of a carefully wrought and highly finished production . This fine picture was purchased in Spain by Mr. Meade , formerly our Consul at Cadiz , and was no doubt painted at Madrid , where Titian resided for several years . Although the subject is in some.respects not a very seducing one , he appears to have painted it a n4mber of times . We have had the pleasure of seeing another picture of his on the same subject , though varying a little from this in the details , in the ChapterHouse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are two or three more in existence . The first was probably executed for the purpose of being placed in the Es .. curial , the subject having been selected with a view to this // destination . This convent , as our readers are probably aware , was erected in honor of St. Lawrence. - Its proper style and title is the Convent of the Royal St. Lawrence-San Lorenzo ci Real  --  the name Escurial or Escorial , as it is written in Spain , being that of a neighboring village , and , as is generally supposed , a corruption or modification of the word scoriac , which expresses the cinders and rubbish proceeding from a mine that was formerly wrought on this spot . It is well known that Philip II . before going into the battle of St. Quentinwhich was fought on St. Lawrence 's day-made a vow that if he gained the victory , he would erect a convent in honor of the Saint , and in the shape of the instrument on which he suffered martyrdom . Having in fact won the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect Herrera , whom he employed , not only executed this vow to the letter , but contrived at the same time to produce a building , which is justly considered as one of the finest specimens of modern architecture . It would be hard to imagine beforehand how so handsome an edifice could possibly be built upon a model apparently so ill adapted to the purpose ; but the architect by a happy exertion of ingenuity , similar to that by which Columbus succeeded in setting his egg upright upon its smaller end , removed at once the principal dimculty , by turning the gridiron upon its back with its legs upwards . The achievement was now comparatively easy , and the building to be erected susceptible of a high degree of architectural beauty . It is constructed of a handsome reddish freestone , in the form of a hollow square , the four sides of which are connected together by several lines of buildings crossing each other at right angles , and enclosing a number of small courts . The four sides represent the frame , and the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points where they intersect each other , and at the four corners of the main edifice are placed towers , which represent the legs . From the side opposite the main entrance projects a wing , which forms the handle . This wing with a part of the side of the main edifice adjoining it , is occupied by the Court when they take up their residence at the Escurial . The remainder of the building consists of the large and truly magnificent church , two libraries , and the public and private apartments appropriated to the use of the monks who inhabit the convent . One of the libraries contains the collection of Arabic Manuscripts , which is considered the richest in Europe . // We found on inquiry , that there is at present no person in the Convent who reads that language . The exterior of the building is decorated with great taste , and the general appearancC is simple , imposing , and on the whole highly satisfactory . It stands on the declivity of a mountain ; and at a considerable height above is a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the gridiron principle of the plan becomes apparent in all its beauty . On this seat the gloomy despot who ordered the construction of the building was accustomed to repose in his solitary walks , and contemplate , no doubt with great satisfaction , the complete success with which he had executed his pious and somewhat singular design . The interior of the convent is adorned throughout with the choicest productions of the pen6ls of the first artists . The principal stair-case was decorated by Jordaens , and is considered his finest work . The cloisters were painted in fresco by a celebrated Spanish artist , called from hIs having been dumb , El JIiIiudo . The public apartments are hung with the master. * pieces of Raphael , Titian , Ruhens , Murillo , Velasquez , and the other principal painters of the Spanish and Italian schools . In the sacristy is to be seen among other beautiful pieces a celebrated Holy Family , by Raphael , which on accotmt of its singular perfection , is commonly called the Pearl , and which was purchased for the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the paintings of Charles I. In the ChapterHouse is the . Madonna de la Pez , or Virgin with the Fish , by the same great artist , which is reckoned in like manner one of his capital pieces . The subject is singular , and if taken literally involves a good deal of anachronism . The young Tobias of the Apocrypha , holding a fish in his hand by a line , is presented to the Virgin . She is seated as usual with the infant Jesus in her arms , who is eagerly extending one of his hands to grasp the fish , and with the other is playing with the leaves of an open bible , which St. Jerome is perusing on the left . The painting is commonly supposed to be an allegorical representation of the admission of the Apocryphal books into the Canon of Scripture by the Council of Trent . This piece , with the Pearl  --  the Pasmo di Sicilia , now in the museum at Madrid , by the same artist , which was painted as a companionpiece to the Transfiguration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a number of other pictures , was transported to Paris during the period of the French ascend. * // ency in Spain , and exhibited for several years in the Gallery of the Louvre . They returned after the abdication of Bona**. purte , varnished and restored in a way , which has not bean thought by competent judges to increase their value . In the same apartment with the Madonna de la Fez is the Martyrdom of St. Lawrence , by Titian , which has ' led us into this little digression . It is not in so line a state of preservation as the one which was exhibited at the Athen*um , having suffered a good deal of late , in common with many of the other pictures in the Escurial , from want of attention . It still , however , produces great effect . Among the other paintings of Titian preserved at the Escu .. rial , is a remarkable piece commonly called Titian 's Glory , which did not obtain the dangerous honor of a transportation to Paris , and consequently exhibits at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater purity than it would have done if it had undergone a reparation by a modern French painter . The hint of this superb picture seems to have been borrowed from the Transfiguration of Raphael , and the general aspect of it is somewhat similar although its sub .. ject is wholly diflirrent . The painting exhibits the various orders of the heavenly host in the act of adoring the Supreme Being . The three persons of the Holy Trinity , drawn with their usual attributes , dressed in sky*.bIue drapery and sur** rounded by a Glory , which gives its name to the painting , occupy the upper part of the canvass . They are nearly in the attitudes of the three principal figures in the Transfiguration . Below are the saints and angels- ' Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ' . - .. - gazing upwards with adoring looks at the object of their worship . The subject of this picture is con* ceived in a loftier tone of thought and feeling than that of any other piece of Titian 's , which we have seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , does not seem to have been fully appreciated by its present possessors . It now hangs without a frame in a small room , which serves as a sort of passage from one part of the convent to another , but which contains , it is true , some other very fine pieces . It was probably owing to its being kept in this comparatively obscure place that it was not carried to Paris . In the same room is an exquisite St. Catherine by the same artist*- .. *a single figure in a green drapery , discovering one leg and foot , which have often been cited as models of perfection for this part of the // female form . There is a repetition of this charming piece in the museum at Madrid , where there are also a number of other fruits of the labor of the same indefatigable and prolific genius while in Spain . We may mention particularly the portrait of Charles V. on horseback , the Dana* , the . Iriadne and the two full length portraits of the Princess of Eboli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapery . This celebrated favorite of Philip II . figures to more advantage under the pencil of Titian than she does under the pen of Schiller , who has introduced her as one of the characters in his tragedy of Don Carlos . It is rather a singular circumstance , that with no recommendation but mere beauty she should have had the fortune to be handed down to immortality by the separate labors of these two masters in their respective arts . In all these pieces the art of coloringespecially in its application to the human body-is carried to the highest perfection which it has ever attained or is probably capable of attaining . We well remember the air of satisfaction with which the distinguished Scotch artist Wilkie , with whom we had the pleasure of going through the museum at Madrid , pointed to the figure of Ariadne , and pronounced it a piece of real flesh and blood . For this reason the works of Titian are excellent studies , more especially at a time when the example of the modern French school has a tendency to diffuse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are highly gratified that so fine a work of this great colorist as the one we have been considering should have been obtained for the Exhibition , and only regret that the funds of the Nthenieum were not in such a state as to allow of its purchase . It is true , that the subject is not so attractive as might be wished ; but it is rare that a first-rate painting by this great master is for sale even in Europe , and a century may probably elapse before another opportunity will occur for procuring one in this country . Having had occasion to advert to the collections of paintings that are found in Spain , we proceed in this connexion to mention , as one of the principal ornaments of the Exhibition at the Athenieum Gallery , the fine picture , by Murillo , of the Meeting of Rebecca and dbraham 's Servant . This we are happy to say belongs to the institution , and has of course appeared at the preceding exhibitions , but is well worthy of continued notice and attention . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of Murillo as the Martyrdom of St. Lawrence is of that of Titian ; and it also appears to have suffered some injury , but it is nevertheless an undoubted original , and has much of the sweetness , grace and truth to nature that characterise the best of the author 's works . Under the head of this picture we find in the Catalogue the fob. lowing remarks . Bartolomeo Esteban Murillo was born in 1613 , and died in 1685 . He showed a very early inclination for painting , and received instruction from his uncle , Juan del Castello , and afterwards from Velasquez . He was employed by the King of Spain to paint several historical pictures , but his favorite subjects were beggar boys in various exercises and amusements . His coloring is mellow , his tints clear and skilfully opposed by proper shad* ows . His pictures are in great esteem throughout Europe , but few of them have reached this country . This picture has been much injured . Its great merit is , however , apparent , and has been appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main correct , and perhaps as complete as it could be made consistently with the limits of a Catalogue , hardly does justice to the extraordinary merit of the great artist in question . Although his works are , as is remarked in the Catalogue , in great esteem throughout Europe , they are nevertheless not so generally known and valued even there as they would be were they more favorably situated for the observation of artists and travellers of taste . They were all painted in Spain . Very few of them have found their way into the other parts of Europe ; and as Spain has been for a century past entirely out of the regular line of travel , whether for business or pleasure , the treasures of art , which are contained in the Spanish collections , have been sequestered , as it were , from public view . Hence the names of Murillo , and his master Velasquez , are much less familiar to the European public than those of many Italian and Flemish artists of inferior merit . Several fine works were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late political movements , and the engravings that have recently been published at Madrid of the paintings in the museum have made them better known abroad than they were formerly . We were informed by Wilkie that the Spanish painters Murillo and Velasquez were very inadequately appreciated in England , and that he bad himself no idea of the extent and value of their productions until he // met at Rome with the collections of engravings to which we have just alluded , and which afforded him so much satisfaction that he immediately determined on a visit to Spain for the express purpose of seeing the originals . The high expectations he had formed of them were entirely equalled , if not surpassed , and his correspondence on the subject with the late President of the Academy will have contributed much to rectify the opinions of the British artists on this subject , and to give a new idea of the merit and richness of the Spanish school . From the tenor of the above extract it would be natural to conclude that low life was the favorite walk of Murillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance with the wishes of the king , hut that his success in this branch had been less remarkable than in the other . This idea of the nature of his talent is , however , incorrect . Like all the artists of his time , he painted principally for churches and convents , and of course on scriptural subjects , from which every allusion to low life is necessarily excluded . His ac* knowledged master-piece is a large picture in one of the convents at Seville , on the subject of Moses striking the Rock . This grand work has been thought by many competent judges to bear away the palm from the Trai*sfiguration , and is admitted by all to be one of the noblest efforts of genius in existence . His taste was , however , undoubtedly for grace and sweetness rather than sublimity , and he accordingly excelled in his Holy Families  --  a favorite subject with him , as with all the painters of the day . There is one in particular in the museum at Madrid of pre-eminent beauty , in which the Virgin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . foot resting on the crescent moon , With eyes upraised , as one inspired , ' robed in a flowing blue and white drapery and surrounded by a glory that fills the back ground of the picture . For truth of drawing , spirit and felicity of composition , and a peculiar brllliancy and charm of coloring , the manner of Murillo in this and his other best pieces could not well be surpassed . His figures have been thought to want in some degree the high intellectual expression that distinguishes those of the great masters of the Italian school , and which is no doubt the loftiest attainment to which genius in the art can aspire . Had he combined this with his other excellences he would // probably have excelled most other modern painters . The faces of his Virgins are said to have been copied from that of his daughter . They have a charming simplicity and sweetness of expression , inclining , however , to childish weak .. ness rather than to the poetical elevation , which must natur. ally be supposed to form the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineations of boys , but they were byno means always placed , as might perhaps be imagined from the above extract , in situations connected with common life . His two separate pictures of the Infant Saviour and the Infant Baptist , in the museum at Madrid , are among the most exquisite productions of his pencil , and su.rpass perhaps any other work on a similar subject , unless we except the Ycnsng Samuel of Sir Joshua Reynolds , which seems to_the realise the idea of absolute perfection . But though the talent of Murillo was not confined to the delineation of common life , it is nevertheless true that he greatly excelled in this as well as in the higher walks of his art . The Pet Kitten of the Exhibition is a specimen of his manner in this line , but , if an originai* isnot one of his best pieces . In a large picture , in the Academy of the Fine Arts at " Madrid , irepresenting the exercise by Isabella , Queen of Castile , of the faculty formerly supposed to be inherent in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases , the artist has combined , injudiciously perhaps , the expressions peculiav ' respectively to high and vulgar life . The Queen , surrounded by bet court , and with the air of dignified solemnity and deep interest , which would naturally accompany the use of her miraculous gift , is washing the head of one little urchin , while another , who stands by the side of the basin waiting for his turn , affords himself a temporary relief by scratching with both hands , and displays an irresistibly comic expression of countenance . This piece , though , as we have intimated above , defective in its plan , is in point of execution one of the most successful and perfect of Murillo 's works . It is remarked in the Catalogue that but few of the works of this artist have reached our country . There are some in the collection of the Academy of the Arts at New York ; but the best on this side of the Atlantic is probably ' the Roman Charity , in the collection of the Academy of the Arts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ' - man Mr. Rich , formerly our Consul at Valencia . While inhis // possession it had suffered some alteration from the effects of the rather exaggerated delicacy of a contemporary Spanish artist of considerable merit , named Lopez , now chief painter to the King of Spain . In the picture , as it came from the hands of the artist , and into those of Mr. Rich , the neck and breast of the female figure , who , agreeably to the well-known anecdote , is represented nursing her father in prison , were discovered . There seems to be little in such an exhibition at which the purest mind need to be alarmed . The scrupulous Spaniard , however , took it amiss , and resorted to a very summary process for abating the nuisance . He had prevailed on Mr. Rich to lend him the picture for the purpose of studying it at home , and while he had it in his possession , without consulting the owner , very kindly supplied the fair Roman with a handkerchief from his own pallet . In plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bust of the female figure with a sort of shawl or mantle , apparently without reflecting whether something were not due to his neighbor 's right of property as well as to what he doubtless considered a just delicacy . We have not had much opportunity to examine this picture in detail , but have been informed by Mr. Rich that it is in the best manner of the artist . Its actual value is perhaps a little diminished by the injudicious reform to which we have alluded ; but it will probably attract hereafter more rather than less attention from having been the subject of so curious an anecdote . Velasquez , the master of Murillo , is less known beyond the limits of his own country , than his great pupil , but is generally regarded by the Spaniards , and by such other persons as have had the opportunity to appreciate his merit , as being , in some respects at least , the superior artist . For truth to nature in drawing and coloring , his works may be considered as approaching the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study for such proficients in the art as were in danger of being seduced by the false brilliancy of the modern French school . We must confess , however , that in our judgment Velasquez errs a little on the other side , and that his coloring , though admirably fresh , distinct and true , is rather cold . In the Catalogue of the Paintings in the museum at Madrid the manner of this great artist is described in the following terms . Velasquez possessed a genius for painting of the very first // order . He united a brilliant imagination and a singularly correct judgment with great industry . The beauty and felicity of his drawing are admirable ; and his coloring , while it is perfectly true to nature , has a peculiarly seductive grace . What harmony and correctness in his landscapes ! The illusion is there so perfect that we can hardly realise , at a little distance , that we are viewing a picture and not the thing itself . No artist ever understood better the effect of light and that aerial perspective which regulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , he had improved his strong natural talent for the art by the most careful and judicious course of study and practised it with complete success in all its parts . It may be said with safety , that there was more truth in his coloring and more firmness in his drawing than in tbose of even Titian . The means employed are seen more distinctly on a near examination without the least diminution of the general effect at the proper distance . ' The museum at Madrid is rich in the works of this great artist , which consist principally of historical pieces and portraits . Among the latter may be noticed particularly those of Philip IV . and his Queen Doha Mariana of Austria , under whom he flourished , and those of their son the Infaute Don Baltazar Carlos , and of the celebrated Count-Duke Olivaresthe two last on horsehack . A portrait of one of the Princesses of the royal family , daughter of Philip IV. , is even more remarkable , and is thus described in the Catalogue . This is a portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Philip IV. , receiving a glass of water from one of her ladies . In the list of the spectators is the artist himself with his pallet in his hand taking the portrait of the Princess , and on the right are the two dwarfs Nicolas Pertusano and Maria Barbola , who are endeavoring to amuse her and are playing with a favorite dog . This picture is admirable for the correct drawing and ingenious composition , but especially for the wonderful effect of light . The apartment seems to be filled with a kind of vapor , which surrounds and removes all the objects that require to be represented as more distant . It is a singular proof of the talent of Velasquez , that he succeeded in placing in the middle of the piece an open door , admitting a light so strong that it brightens the door , the staircase behind it , and the person who is going out ,  --  the whole executed with perfect truth and yet without injuring the general // effect . This picture is a sort of miracle in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by Giordano the Painter 's Bible , ( La Teologia de la Pintura . ) ' Among the history pieces of Velasquez in the same collection may be mentioned the Surrender of Breda to the Marquesses of Spinola and Leganes in presence of the armies of Spain and the Netherlands . This , ' says the Catalogue , is one of the capital pieces of this artist . The plan is well conceived , the composition skilful , the drawing correct , the expression spirited and noble , the coloring rich and true , and at the same time so bold , that we may safely say that Velasquez alone could have ventured , as is done here , to introduce a mass of strong light between the Spanish army and the escort of the Flemish general . We admire the art with which he groups together the figures thus separated by the friendly attitude of the Spanish General throwing his arm over the shoulder of the Governor of the fort . The horse of Spinola is painted with extraordinary truth . In the back ground is a vast plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist country , corres .. ponding with the real character of the scene of the action , and covered with burning castles and villages , which show toQ well the fata consequences of war . ' A fancy-piece by the same artist , representing the interior of a carpet-manufactory , and commonly called The Spinners , ( Las Hilanderas , ) is considered one of his happiest efforts , and is thus described . In the back ground are some ladies looking at carpets . On the front of the picture is a woman spinning and talking with another , who is drawing a scarlet curtain . At a litUe distance is a girl carding wool . Qn the right of the spectators i5 a young woman winding yarn , whose features are not visible , although we may be sure that they are handsome from the beauty of her shoulder , and another , who has in her hand a sort of basket . This picture , ' says the cominenta*or , was painted off-hand , with a bold , free , and playful pencil . The skill with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has introduced into it , is truly marvellous . ' We have been led to make these brief remarks on the peneral manner of Murillo and Velasquez for the purpose of turning the attention of the public to the merit of two great artists , who are not sufficiently known beyond the limits of their native land , and in the hope that opportunities may occur for // 1830. *thena*um Gallery . acquiring a greater number of their works in this country . We must now proceed , a little more rapidly than we have thus far done , in our survey of the paintings exhibited at the Athen*um Gallery . Of the other original pieces of the old masters , may be mentioned particularly The Laughing Boy , by Gerardo delle Notti , which , as a mere specimen of effect iii the disposition of light and shade , was undoubtedly by far the most powerful picture in the Exhibition . The artist , whose real name was Gerard Honthorst , obtained the one above quoted , by which he is usually known and which means literally Gerard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gerard JV'ight .. Piece , from his extraordinary talent for producing the effect of lamp-light . The two large paintings , representing respectively the fish of the Bay of Tarentum and of the Bay of Naples , from the collection of Joseph Bonaparte , though the subjects are not attractive , nevertheless afforded great pleasure from the spirit and truth to nature , which distinguish the execution . The Jacob wrestling with the . **ngel , by Domenichino , belonging to Mrs. Meade , is a valuable production of one of the most distinguished Italian masters . Domenichino , or little Dominic , as he has been affectionately denominated by the dilettanti of his country , was less prolific than some of his great predecessors and contemporaries . The extreme correctness and high finish of his pictures account in part for the comparative slowness with which he appears to have wrought . A Seaport , by Claude Lorraine , a View of the Lake of Thrasymene , by Vernet , and several landscapes with figures , by Salvator Rosa , furnished interesting specimens of the manner of their respective authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful landscape . We may also mention among the most remarkable old pictures , the Joseph and Ins Brethren , by an unknown master , the St. Francis , by Tintoretto , and the St. . *1nthony , by Luca Giordano , all large pieces , from the collection of Mrs. Meade ; the Lady drinking , by Terbourg ; the Dying Seneca , by Vandyck ; the Views of Venice , by Canaletti , and the head of a Madonna , by Sasso-Ferrato . These , with a number of others , to which we can not now advert , are well entitled to a more detailed notice ; but the space we have already occupied reminds us that we must leave this branch of the subject and proceed to make some remarks on a few very highly finished copies of originals in Europe , which formed a part of the Exhibition . // The most interesting of these was a copy of the celebrated Descent from the Cross of Rubens , by F. de Brackelaer , a Flemish artist of great merit . It has recently been imported from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athena*um , whose continued exertions and liberal contributions for the promotion of learning and the arts have justly entitled him to the gratitude of the community . The work was executed under very favorable circumstances , the original having been placed in the hands of the artist , on its return from Paris , for the purpose of being prepared for its new position in the Cathedral at Antwerp . The size of the copy is greatly reduced from that of the original , but it gives in other respects a most exact and faithful representation of it , and is itself a very superior picture . It includes the two companion-pieces , which were placed on the right and left of the Descent from the Cross , when it occupied its original place as the altar-piece of the Cathedral , and which represent respectively the Salutation of Mary and Elizabeth and Simeon bearing Christ in his arms . The Descent from the Cross of Rubens is , as is well known to every lover of the art , the master-piece and pride of the Flemish school , as the Transfiguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking the Rock , by Murillo , of the Spanish . In this noble production the characteristic beanties of the great author , and of the school which he adorned , are exhibited in their highest perfection , and with the least mixture of the defects by which they were accompanied . The richness and beauty of the coloring , the skill displayed in the grouping of the figures , and the truth , with which they exhibit the passions and affections belonging to their respective characters , are really admirable , and we scarcely notice in the midst of so many excellences the slight defects in taste-vestigia runs-that linger even here round the pencil of the illustrious Fleming and depress his work a little helow the complete perfection of the unrivalled Italians . It is remarkable that Sir Joshua Reynolds , who appears from his Lectures to have been hardly satisfied , at k*ast on a first inspection , with the manner of Raphael , bestows the most unqualified commendation on this production of Rubens . The Christ ' - he remarks , as quoted in the Catalogue- ' is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most correctly drawn , and in an attitude of the utmost difficulty to exe // cute . The hanging of the head on the shoulder , and the falling of the body on one side give such an appearance of the heaviness of death , that nothing can exceed it . ' On the companion-piece representing Simeon bearing Christ in his drms , Sir Joshua remarks that it is admirable indeed ; the head of the priest more especially , which nothing can exceed ; the expression , drawing , coloring , are beyond all description , and as fresh as if the piece were just painted . ' This superb picture was transferred to Paris by the French when they took possession of the Netherlands , and remained for several years in the Gallery of the Louvre , where we had the pleasure of seeing it in 1812 . It appeared to advantage in immediate comparison with the finest works of the greatest painters of all countries , among which it was then placed , and was regarded by all as one of the two or three first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It approaches in fact more nearly to perfection in its way , than perhaps any other picture that could be named , and if it be inferior to some , it is only because the artist habitually exhibits in his most successful efforts somewhat less purity of taste and intellectual , or , as it is often called , ideal expression , than would be required for the attainment of the highest degree of excellence . In many of his pieces his deficiency in these respects is very remarkable , and forms a singular contrast with his extraordinary success in others . It is particularly conspicuous in his female figures , which were evidently copied directly from nature in a climate where the sex is distinguished for freshness and beauty of complexion , rather than delicate proportions or graceflul symmetry of form . It is wonderful that Rubens who travelled much , and visited all parts of Europe , did not learn from his acquaintance with the fair of other regions , to correct his original notions of female beauty . His imagination appears to have dwelled with unabated fondness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were probably endeared to him by the recollections of his youthful loves . His Three Graces in the museum at Madrid exhibit under a transparent delicacy of complexion , a largeness of bone and firmness of muscle , that would do honor to the champion of England . They form a strange contrast with the slender and symmetrical brunettes of Titian , that figure in their neighborhood . Complete perfection is , however , not to be expected in any human production ; and notwithstanding some very obvious faults , the works of Rubens // 326 Oct. will always be viewed as among the master-pieces of the art . For brilliancy and richness of coloring and fertility of invention , they perhaps excel all others , and if they want the ideal expression of the Italians , they are animated by an admirable spirit and vivacity , which are the best substitutes that could be found for that still superior quality . As a series of paintings on the same subject we are ticquainted with none in the whole compass of the art to be compared with the twelve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now exhibited in the Gallery of the Louvre . These splendid pieces compose a sort of grand epic poem , not inferior in fire , nature , variety of character , wide range of supernatural machinery , and harmonious disposition of the various parts of a great and crowded action , to the immortal master-piece of heroic song . If one of the works of Velasquez alluded to above has been called the Painter 's Bible , this seiies might be described with equal justice as an iliad on Canvass ; and the analogy is not the less striking because the artist conceived and executed his plan without the slightest reminisccnce of Homer , nor because the action represented is in every particular wholly differenj from the celebrated wars of Troy . In works of art direct imitation never produces a real resemblance . This can only take place when minds of equal power and kindred genius , working perhaps , as in this case , in different lines , but under the influence of the same inspiration , and with the materials supplied by the same common nature , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished by the same general characteristics and produce the same effects on the imagination and the heart . There is no resemblance-for example-between the charming Allegro and Penseroso of Milton , and the Pacifico and Belhicoso of Mason , or twenty other parallels in the same form , that have been written in imitation of them ; but we can easily find one in the delightful painting where the Muses of Tragedy and Comedy-each with hcr appropriate expression and costume-are struggling for the exclusive possession of their common favorite Garrick , although the idea of Milton and his poem probably never once occurred to the mind of Sir Joshua Reynolds while he was planning and executing the work . The superiority of the works of Rubens is not more extraor dinary than the facility with which he appears to have produced them . The collections of Europe are crowded with his paintings , frequently of large size , and when we consider the length // of time which is employed by many artists of great merit upon a single piece , we are disposed to wonder that he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter part of his life he availed himself to a considerable extent of the labor of assistants and pupils ; hut it is well known that he xvro*ight with great facility and threw off many of his admirable woxks at a single heat . Th* same was the case with some of the other great roasters who lived in the best days of the art , and it seems to be chiefly at a later and less brilliant period that we find their successors adopting a different method , and substituting the slow results of patient and reiterated toil for the first glowing effusions of genius . There is no doubt aa aptitude in different minds to proceed by different methods , and a man of merit can commonly work better in the way to which he feels himself naturally disposed than in any other ; but it may be doubted whether much is gained in painting , poetry , or any other art , by the long delay and repeated revision by which some persons are accustomed to ripen their productions . An artist who has cultivated his taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his judgment , has acquired all the talent he will ever possess , and the more freely and fearlessly he exercises it , the better in general will be the product . We mean not of course to recommend an inconsiderate precipitancy or to exclude the process of revision and correction within its proper limits ; we only mean to say that a work which a man of genius , whether poet , painter , or orator , throws off in a happy moment , and at the height of his talent , is suh. * stantially as good when it first comes from his mind , as the nature of his subject , and the extent of his powers will allow him to make it . By reviewing it in a cooler moment , he may remove blemishes-improve the disposition of details-introduce additions of minQr importance , and thus give the whole a finished air , which will considerably augment the general effect  --  but he can not possibly by any revision or correction change the substance of it for the better . To change the substance of a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the same subject , and this new one must , in general , in the case supposed , be inferior to the former , because it is produced under circumstances much less favorable to excellence . The want of facility which is experienced by some artists might , we fear , in many cases be more correctly described as a want of the moral courage and generous self-confidence , which are as ne // cessary to success in art as in every other department of action . When we find a poet who was capable at twenty years of age of writing the Pleasures of Hope  --  the most elegant of all juvenile productions-bringing out nothing else in the course of a long life devoted to poetry , but a few short fragments , we see at once , that for fear of hazarding the reputation he had acquired , he has not exhibited the maturity of his talent , and that his works give us no indication of what he might have done if he had not been prevented by indolence or constitutional timidity from doing his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott at thirty  --  but the latter by manfully doing as well as he could without fear of criticism , gradually improved his powers by exercise , and in the end has completely overshadowed the other , though possessing a talent originally much superior to his own . The moral is the same with the common proverb-that faint heart never won fair lady  --  and that a man will never get the credit of doing what he has too little confidence in himself to undertake . Trust yourself , says Goethe , and others will trust you . Wenn du deiner selbst vertrau'st Vertrauen dir die andere Seele . Our readers will perhaps think that there is little danger of an error on the score of excessive diffidence in a community where most of the citizens are ready enough to push their pretensions of all kinds , as far as they ought in reason to be carried , but we have in our view some cases connected with the subject of this article , in which the hints we have given might , we think , be turned to account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gallery . The copies , by Meyer of a large and beautiful landscape by Ruisdael with figures by Berghem , and by our countryman Fisher of the portraits of Rembrandt and Vandyck by themselves now in the Gallery of the Louvre , were highly interesting , but we have only room to notice that of the Shepherdess Jliiadonna of Raphael , by Subba . This picture represents the Virgin at full length , in a standing position with a crook in her hand ; the two infants Jesus and John Baptist standing beside her with their faces turned upwards to hers ; the scene an open country , with hills and woods in the back ground . ' The artist appears to have repeated this subject several times . We have ourselves seen two originals at Paris , and it is stated in // the Catalogue that there is one at Naples . Of the two which we have seen , one is in the Gallery of the Louvre , and the other in the possession of our countryman , Samuel Williams , Esq . formerly our Consul at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter has been supposed by some of the British connoisseurs to be a copy by another artist , and for that reason commanded a comparatively low price at a public sale a few years ago . Its genuineness is , however , perfectly apparent on its face to all who are acquainted with the style of the great author , and its history is so well known that there can be no reasonable doubt upon the subject . It is traced back with certainty for about two centuries , to the time of Cardinal Mazarm , who employed it as the altar-piece of his private oratory ; and in his various capacities of Italian , Prince of the Church , and Viceroy over the Queen of France , was not likely to be cheated in a painting by Raphael . It remained in the possession of his representatives till the commencement of the French revolution , when the property of the family was confiscated , and the paintings sold at auction . The one in question was purchased by Colonel TrumbulJ , who happened to be at Paris at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred it to Mr. Williams . At the sale of Mr. Williams 's effects , it was offered with the rest , but brought so low a price that it was bought in for the owner . From the peculiar circumstances under which it is now placed , it might probably be obtained for a sum considerably below its real value , and would form a most important and interesting addition to any of our collections . The drawing and coloring are in the best manner of the author , and although the principal figure is rather deficient in expression , the picture has always been regarded as a capital work . So far as we are informed , there is no original painting by Raphael in this country , and we should be highly gratified if it could be found practicable to improve the present opportunity for placing a very fine one in the Gallery of the Athenamm . We come now to that part of the Exhibition which consisted of the works of our native artists , and we regret that their number and importance were not such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger portion of the present article . The splendid Sortie from Gibraltar by Trumbull , which belongs to the Athenaeum , still retains its place , but it is too well known to the public to require or admit of a de // tailed notice . There were also , beside the . /llot her and Child , which is the property of the institution , two very beautiful landscapes by Aliston , belonging respectively to Mr. Weeks of New York , and Mr. S. A. Eliot of this city , a number of vabnable works from the pencils of Sully , Doughty , Fisher , and Salmon , and several interesting portraits , particularly that of tb*e Chief Justice of the United States by Harding . Without intending to undervalue the merit or importance of these productions , we can not but remark , that they give a very imperfect notion of the richness nad abundance of the recent labors of our native artists . Few countries have in fact done more within the last half .. centvry in the way of painting than this . We know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have flourished within that period , than is composed by the names of West , Copley , Trum. bull , Ajlston , Newtor* , Leslie , Stuart , and Sully , to which might be added those of many other younger aspirants of undoubte4 merit . Several cmf these distinguished artists have been and still are the principal ornaments of the British school , which , for the time in question , belongs at least as much to the United States as to the mother-country . England has in fact only three names of equal pretensions and of native origin to add to the above list-we mean those of Reynolds , Wilkie , and Lawrence . The first of these , had he devoted himself exclusively to the higher walks of his art , would have probably placed himself at the head of modern painters , by which we mean those of the last century  --  and even as it is-*although he gave up his pencil almost wholly to portraits-he is perhaps very fairly enim4pd to that high eminence . Wilkie and Lawrence are excellent , each in his line-which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but the combined merit of the three , with that of their inferior fellow-laborers-does not authorise the mother-country to claim more than an equal share of the glory of the common school . The style of painting in France during the same period has been decidedly vicious , and although it has obtained a temporary popularity in that country is not approved hy competent judges from any other . In the rest of Europe there has been little or no activity in this branch of art ; so that the United States-as we remarked above-have done at least as much for painting during the last half-century , as any other country . We hope that efforts will be made to procure for the future Exhibitions a larger number of the choice products of // the native pencil . In themeantime without confining ourselves to those which were brought forward on this occasion , we propose to conclude the article with a few general remarks upon the style and works of some of the eminent American artists , whose names are recapitulated above . That of West is commonly and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The length of his career-hih conspicuous position at the head of the British Academy and the indefatigable perseverance with which he pursued his labors up to the very close of his protracted life-all these circumstances placed him in full relief before the public , and perhaps raised his reputation a little higher than it will be maintained by the impartial judgment of posterity . Perceiving or supposing that his *merit was e*raggerated , a certain number of persons were induced , as always happens in similar cases by a sort of re*action , to depreciate the value of his works , and even to deny altogether his pretensions to excellence . Without speaking of Peter Pindar , who attacked him merely because he was patronised by the King , we may find the feeling to which we allude exhibited in a quarter where we had a right to look for oood taste and pdlltical impartiality . Lord Byron , *in one df his poems describes our illustrious countryman as - the dotard West , Europe 's woi*st dauber and poor England 's best . ' But even here the noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has borne a sort of involuntary testimony to the high deserts of the painter . The British school , which in his wayward humor he represents as the worst in Europe , was undoubtedly at that time and still is the best , and by putting West at the head of it he rendered him in fact all the justice which his warmest friends could possibly have claimed for him . His real merit was very considerable , although he may not have risen precisely to the level of the greatest masters of other times . It was sufficiently evinced by the great popularity and success of his last and best pieces the Christ Rejected , and the grand composition of Death on the Pale Horse . We had the pleasure of seeing these noble paintings when they were first brought out at London , and witnessed the enthusiasm which they excited among the lovers of the arts and the public at large . The sum of ten thousand pounds was offered for the latter work  --  a higher price probably than // was ever commanded by any other picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the public of a city like London is not often very widely mistaken in matters wholly unconnected with any accidental or temporary interest , it is impossible to account for this extraordinary vogue without allowing to the artist a talent of a very high order . His works exhibit in reality almost all the qualities that designate a firstvate painting . His walk lay in the highest department of the art . His subjects were always of a poetical cast , and he treated them all in a large , free and generous spirit ; and while he possessed the principal requisites of a great painter his manner was almost wholly free from faults . He had in particular the great merit of . avoiding the unnatural style of coloring which prevailed in the neighboring kingdom and seemed likely at one time to corrupt the taste of the rest of Europe . His excellent moral character contributed much to his talent and still more to his fortune . It kept him steady to his profession during a period of violent political convulsions , which swept away from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It recommended him to the favor of the King , and *ough that to the Presidency of the Academy , and it preserved his health and capacity for constant employment to the last moment of a very long life . He enjoyed the rare happiness of realising in his lifetime his full deserts on the score of reputation-perhaps something more  --  and of laboring with undiminished activity and a constant increase of fame beyond the ordinary term of human existence . We had the satisfaction of seeing him frequently in his last days , and have seldom known a more striking example of a serene and happy old age . He was then at nearly eighty a healthy , handsome man , busily occupied upon his last and greatest works , and enjoying the vogue which they successively obtained on their first exhibition . The natural simplicity and modesty of his manner were mingled with a slight air of self-importance and conscious satisfaction with his recent success , which appeared rather graceful than otherwise in one so much respected and so far advanced in years . The freshness and vigor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every means of improving himself , and when the Athenian marbles were received in England , he addressed a printed letter to Lord Elgin , in which he spoke of this event as forming a sort of epoch in his life , and anticipated the great advantage which he should derive from the study of these admirable // remains of antiquity in the further prosecution of his labors , which , however , were very soon after brought to a close . We have said above that the manner of West was almost wholly free from faults . His conceptions are noble , his drawing correct , his coloring true , and his composition skilful and spirited . If we miss any thing in his paintings it is , perhaps , the secret indescribable charm of coloring , which , like the curious felicity of language in some writers , seems to be a sort of natural grace , beyond the reach of art , ' but affording , at the same time , a higher delight than any of those beauties , which can be more distinctly analysed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share ihan West , and will probably on that account be always ranked above him in the general scale of merit . The paintings of West , which remained in his possession at his death , were offered for sale soon after , and we have anxiously desired , that the whole or a portion of them should have taken the direction of this country . They would have formed a most interesting and valuable addition to our collections , and would then have reached what may fairly be considered their natural destination , the birth-place and original home of their author . We are not exactly informed what disposition has been made of them , and venture to hope that the expectation we have expressed may still , in part at least , he realized . The general reputation of Trumbull is hardly equal to that of West , although the Sortie from Gibraltar is perhaps superior in effect to any single production of the latter artist . This noble picture may justly be ranked with the finest productions of the pencil , and would forever secure to its author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest masters of the art . If his success has been on the whole inferior to that of his illustrious contemporary , it is probably because his devotion to his profession has not been so exclusive . The important military and political occupations , in which he was engaged during a considerable portion of the most active part of his life , diverted his attention for the time from painting , and when he afterwards resumed the pencil he seemed to have lost in some degree the vigor and freshness of his youthful talent . Hence his reputation has not continued to increase with his years , and his last works have not , like those of West , been regarded as his best . The four great paintings , on subjects connected // with the revolutionary war , which he executed for Congress , have , on the whole , hardly satisfied the public expectation , and for that reason have perhaps been depreciated below their real worth . They are all valuable pieces , and the Declaration of Independence , which we look upon as the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They derive a great additional interest from exhibiting portraits , as far as they could be obtained , of the Signers of the Declaration , and of the other patriots and warriors , who took a part in the memorable action of the Revolution . We incline to believe that these paintings , should the liberality of Congress allow the appropriation necessary for keeping them in existence , will gradually gain upon the public opinion , both as works of art and as historical memorials , and be viewed by the next generation with more interest than they are by the present one . Of our living native artists , Mr. Allston is the one , to whose future productions the country looks with reason for the most brilliant exhibitions of talent , and the most valuable accessions to our public and private collections . Few painters have ever possessed at his age a higher reputation , or one acquired by nobler means ; and from his character and habits there is room to suppose that his fame will continue to increase , like that of West , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passionate love for his profession , which is the sure characteristic of a real genius for it , and by a lofty and generous disinterestedness , which has prevented him from consecrating his pencil to its lower and more lucrative departments , he has , under some discouragements , steadily confined himself to his*-torical , scriptural and poetical subjects , and has ftrmed his manner upon the highest standard of excellence . His conceptions are uniformly happy , and , when the subject requires it , sublime ; his taste and skill in the mechanical details of his art complete ; and he knows how to give his works the secret charm to which we alluded before , and which adds the last finish to every other beauty . If there he any thing to complain of in him , it is that he is not satisfted himself with the degree of merit , which would satisfy every one else , and employs in correcting , maturing and repainting a single piece , not always perhaps with any real accession of effect , the time and labor which would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been at an earlier period of life a virtue , and is probably one of the qualities , which // have enabled the artist to realize the high idea of excellence , which originally warmed his young fancy . But , if we might venture to express an opinion on the subject , we should say that the time has now arrived when he might throw it off with advantage , and allow himself a greater rapidity of execution . His manner is formed . He possesses his talent , whatever it is , and , as we remarked above , when we treated the same question in general terms , the more freely and fearlessly he exercises it , the more natural and spirited , and , on the whole , the better will be the product . We trust that he will not permit another year to pass over without putting the last hand to the grand heroic composition , upon which he has been employed so many , and that this will be followed by a series of others of equal merit and of a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working we believe that he would gain in ease and spirit without sacrificing any real beauty , and would labor , on the whole , with infinitely more satisfaction and profit to himself and the public than he does now . We offer these remarks , however , with all the deference that is due from mere amateurs to an artist of consummate genius , who is after all the only true judge of effect in his art and of the best means of producing it . The two landscapes by Mr. Allston , which were exhibited this year , were both very beautiful in different ways . The one belonging to Mr. Eliot is , we think , in the happiest manner . It has the warmth and softness of coloring of Claude , and is , as far as we are able to judge , in no way inferior to the fine produc .. tions of that artist . The Mother and Child , which belongs to the institution , is a highly interesting little piece , upon the merit of which there has been , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer our sentiments , we should say that the piece is beautifully finished and quite perfect in every thing that belongs to the mechanical details of the art . The coloring of the body of the infant in particular is as true to nature as it could possibly be made , and is fully equal to any that we have seen from the pencil of Titian . The artist does not seem to have been so fortunate in the drawing of the infant , who has too little fulness , as well as too much meaning in his face , for so young a child . The expression of the countenance of the mother is rather uncertain , and her face is thrown into a sort of mysterious shade , for which the spectator is not very well able to account . The piece , however , // taken as a whole , is a first-rate work , and forms one of the choicest ornaments of the Athen*um Gallery . We regret that a larger number of the paintings of Mr. Allston were not exhibited on this occasion . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ticknor , the Miriam of Mr. Sears , the Jeremiah of Miss Gibbs , and the other fine productions of the same artist , belonging to other gentlemen in this country . These paintings , while they are kept in the houses of their owners , are seen by a very limited number of persons , and it is much to be desired , as well for the improvement of the public taste , as for the mere gratification of the curious , that they should be displayed from time to time in a place where they can be freely examined at leisure by the whole community . The advantage and satisfaction , which the public would derive from such an exhibition , would afford , we are sure , an ample compensation to the liberal proprietors for any trifling sacrifice of their own convenience , that might be required by such an arrangement . We had intended to offer a few remarks on the style and works of our distinguished countrymen , Newton and Leslie , and also on the landscapes of Doughty , Fisher and Salmon , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have already passed the just limits of an article , and must reserve them for a future one . The most remarkable portrait was undoubtedly that of Chief-Justice Marshall , painted by Harding for the Athenteum . It has been pronounced by those , who are most familiar with the appearance of the illustrious original , to be a striking likeness , and it certainly does great credit to the painter , who must , however , make some further advances in his art before he can aspire to rival the mature fame of Stuart . The landscapes of Fisher as well as his copies from Rembrandt and Vandyck were very beautiful . Those of Doughty were hardly less so , and we regret that the sale of them at the present moment of depression in business has not afforded the artist the compensation for his labor , which he had a right to expect from the Fberality and good taste of the citizens of this metropolis . The works of Salmon have a more decidedly characteristic manner than those of Doughty or Fisher , and are , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three artists are all capable of rising by a proper course of study and practice to a high degree of excellence , and we trust that they will receive from their countrymen that // encouragement , which is absolutely necessary to enable them . to proceed in their labors with spirit and success . A copy , by Sully , of a female head by Guido , and of a Gipsy from a French artist , attracted some attention . The Bridal Eve of Miss Sully , if not in the purest style of coloring , was curious as a specimen of the French manner , in itself essentially vicious . The most valuable effort of female genius exhibited on this occasion was a landscape by Miss Scollay . It is time , however , to close these remarks . Before we quit the Gallery we can not refrain from expressing the pleasure with which we have viewed the busts in marble of John Quincy Adams and Mr. Quincy by Greenough , who is also , we are informed , the inventor of the plan of the Bunker-Hill Monument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumption in favor of the taste and talent of the author . He is now , we believe , pursuing his studies at Florence , and we can not but form very high expectations from the future progress of a career that opens with so fine a promise.
