txt It was one of the richest days of autumn ; a warm haze filled the air , mitigating and diffusing the splendor of the sun , tinting every object with new colors , and yet appearing rather to dim the very beauty it bestowed* As the sun declined on such a day , a Spanish maiden left her father 's castle among the mountains . As she turned from the gate , she looked down on the valley from which came up distant sounds of the reheck , and saw gay groups of dancers twirling the castanets , and bounding along in the mazes of the bolero . She paused a moment ,  --  not with a wish to join in their merriment , but to think of one with whom she had often partaken in the same sports ,  - -  and then slowly sought the higher defiles of the Sierra . The way would have fatigued any hut a mountaineer ; but her frame , though delicate by nature , had been expanded by exercise into the full proportions of womanly strength . She trod upwards with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border of a little lake , that lay deeply embosomed among the higher peaks of the mountains . It seemed a familiar place . She stopped , as if she had gained the object of her pursuit , // threw her beaver on the grass , and shook her long dark tresses in the faint breeze . It was a spot of mingled beauty and grandeur . One red splintered pinnacle of granite soared into the deep blue sky , almost beyond sight ; from which forms of gentler undulation led the eye gradually down to the quiet depths of the lake , distinguished from its banks only by the darker reflex of their broken colors . A slender stream , hardly seen , fell into it on the further side , through a chasm which showed it was sometimes a torrent . Trees of fantastic forms , but of stinted proportion , covered its borders in tangled masses , diminishing to shrubs , tufted the higher points of rock , and crept like mere berbage up the clefts of the distant mountain . Over the whole hung a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left nothing but masses of color , light and shade . Regardless of all around her , the maiden sat , looking up with eyes fixed on vacancy , in an attitude between repose and action , plucking the grass with unconscious fingers , with an expression neither of joy nor of sorrow , neither of hope nor of fear , and yet with traces of all these feelings in her flushed and yet tranquil face . It was the spot where she had parted from her lover , when he joined the chivalry of Spain to drive the Moors from Grenada . She was to meet him here on his return ; but that return had been long delayed , and the hope of it had become distant and indefinite . Who that had seen her in this reverie of mingled thought , would not have wished for the pencil of Allston to endow her with immortal youth ? ' Who that sees the picture of that accomplished artist , which suggested this description , does not wish that he could have seen the living original ? It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undiscovered region of beauty , such a scene and such a being . To be more plainly critical , the Spanish Girl in Reverie is , in our judgment , one of Allston 's very best paintings , both as to composition and execution . In atmospheric effect , we do not believe it has ever been surpassed . To give a much better idea of the subject than can be gathered from our prose , we subjoin a beautiful ballad , which has just been handed to us , written in illustration of it by the artist himself . TIlE SPANISH MAID . Five weary months sweet Inez number 'd From that unfading bitter day Wben last she heard the trumpet bray // That call 'd her Isidor awayThat never to her heart has slumber'd* She hears it now , and sees , far bending Along the mountain 's misty side , His plumed troop , that , waving wide , Seems like a rippling feathery tide , Now bright , now with the dim shore blending , the hears the cannon 's deadly rattleAnd fancy hurries on to strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last sad cry of life . Oh , should he-should he fall in battle ! . Yet still his name would live in story , And every gallant bard in Spain Would fight his battles o'er again . And would not she for such a strain Resign him to his country 's glory ? Thus Inez thought , and pluck 'd the flower That grew upon the very bank Where first her ear bewilder 'd drank The plighted vow-where last she sank In that too bitter parting hour . But now the sun is westward sinking ; And soon amid the purple haze , That showers from his slanting rays , A thousand Loves there meet her gaze , To change her high heroic thinking . Then hope , with all its crowd of fancies , Before her flits and fills the air ; And , deck 'd in Vict'ry 's glorious gear , In vision Isidor is there . Then how her heart mid sadness dances . Yet little thought she , thus forestalling The coming joy , that in that hour The Future , like the coior 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living Present falling . The Foe is slain . His sable charger All fleck 'd with foam comes bounding on The wild Morena rings anon , And on its brow the gallant Don And gallant steed grow larger , larger ; And now he nears the mountain-hollow The flow'ry bank and little lake // 1831. at the .7/thencewn Gallery . Now on his startled vision breakAnd Inez there. - He 's not awakeYet how he 'll love this dream to-morrow ! But no-he surely is not dreaming . Another minute makes it clear . A scream , a rush , *a burning tear From Inez ' cheek , dispel the fear That bliss like his is only seeming. - wA . ALL5TON . The pleasure of copying these lines tempts us to trespass a little beyond the subject of this notice , and add another poem by the same hand , on a smaller , but still more highly finished picture ,  --  tbe most highly and beautifully finished of Allston 's heads . It is a little Tuscan girl sitting by a fountain . We regret that this gem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the artist . The poem and the picture are twin sisters , and we pretend not to guess which was intended as an illustration of the other . TIlE TUSCAN GIRL . How pleasant and how sad the turning tide Of Human Life , when side by side The Child and Youth begin to glide Along the vale of years ; The pure twin-being for a little space , With lightsome heart , and yet a graver face , Too young for wo , though not for tears . This turning tide is Ursulina s now , The time is mark 'd upon her brow ; Now every thought and feeling throw Their shadows on her face ; And , so are every thought and feeling join 'd , T were hard to answer whether heart or mind Of either were the native place . The things that once she lov 'd are still the same ; Yet now there needs another name To give the feeling which they claim , While she the feeling gives ; She can not call it gladness or delight ; And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that lives . She sees the mottled moth come twinkling by , And sees it sip the flowret nigh ; Yet not , as once , with eager cry She grasps the pretty thing ; Tier thoughts now mingle with its tranquil mood-. * // Oct . Exhi6jtio* of Pictures So pois 'd in air , as if on air it stood To shew its gold and purple wing . She hears the bird without a wish to snare , But rather on the azure air To mount , and with it wander there To some untrodden land ; As if it told her in its happy song Of pleasures strange that never can belong To aught of sight or touch of hand . Now the young Soul her mighty power shall prove , And outward things around her move , Pure ministers of purer love , And make the heart her home Or to the meaner Senses sink a slave , To do their bidding , though they madly crave Through hateful scenes of vice to roam . But , Ursulina , thine the better choice ; Thine eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still in Earth rejoice And all its beauty love ; But no , not all this fair enchanting Earth , With all its spells , can give the rapture birth That waits thy conscious soul above. - wA . ALLSTON . Of the Roman Lady reading Tasso , we say less than of the Spanish Girl , only because the subject admits of less description , and not because it is at all inferior . It has a charm of expression and of perfect reality , that might make it in time even a greater favorite . Such pictures soon become to us something more than mere forms of inanimate beauty . The mind of the artist has endowed them with a portion of his own existence ; and the places in which they have been familiar objects , seem , in their absence , as if deserted by an accustomed friend . This emanation of mind is the true and only lasting criterion of greatness in the mtrts . It is all that elevates them above mere mechanical employments . No beauty of design , no splendor or delicacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect between the artist and those who look on his works ; and where these adscititious excellencies seem to be the characteristics of greatness , they are sd only because they are united with a higher power . We admire Titian as the greatest of colorists ; but who ever gave to portrait , and even to landscape , such fascination of expression ? We read and write about the cliiar'oscuro of Correggio as the wonder of his works ; but he was , more than all other painters , // a poet in his art ; and the magic of his light and shade is but the appropriate , we had almost said the necessary vehicle of the conceptions of a mind of the highest order . Neither color , design , grace , clziar'oscuro , nor even expression gave to Raphael the rank of the first of painters ; in each he was surpassed by some one of those who yet were all his inferiors in that dramatic power , by which he communicates immediately with the mind of the spectator . And this exercise of mental power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be put forth in a great degree in landscape and even in portrait-painting , if we would raise them to the dignity of liberal arts . The mere taking of likenesses , whether of persons or places , is a good and useful trade , and , diligently pursued , deserves success like any other honest industry . But let not those who follow it flatter themselves that they are pursuing the Fine Arts , or complain of the want of taste in the public if they are not patronized . A certain quantity of that labor will always be wanted and paid for ; but to purchase such works is no proof of taste , and greatly to admire them shows a sad want of it . An artist of genuine power may and often must do much drudgery of that kind for bread ; and to do it is no disgrace . But let him rememher that the money he gets for it , and the wonder of the ignorant , are all the rewards he is to expect . If he claim a higher recompense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be thought to undervalue portrait or landscape painting as branches of the art , nor , least of all , to speak disrespectfully of those who practise them . We merely wish , that a distinction may he made between the different modes of practice ; and particularly to call the attention of artists in all departments of educating and exercising the mind as well as the hand , if they would attain any desirable rank in their profession . We ardently desire to see the Arts flourish in our country . We think much of their influence on the character of those who are merely taught to enjoy their productions , and by that knowledge are led to a closer observation and new perception of the beauties of nature . But the fact that they furnish another object of intellectual labor to those who practise them is , in our minds , a consideration of at least equal importance . We suffer in this country for the want of such employment , and the want is daily becoming more urgent , as the number of // educated men increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who desires that his children may gain a livelihood by the labor of the mind , finds it more and more difficult to select for them a vocation which promises both bread , and the consideration in society which such occupations secure . The difficulty of getting an education sufficient for any of the present pursuits of life , is much less than that of finding what to do with it when obtained . We want objects on which to expend the mental energy we can create ; we want places to be filled by those who would devote themselves to the cultivation of the mind ; something of a liberal cast besides law , physic , theology and politics . If employments for the welleducated are not multiplied , education will be neglected ; because , cheap as it is , it will cost too much if no money can be made of it . Literature and the Arts will in time supply this want here as they have elsewhere . The sooner this can be done the better , and the greater the number that can be supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligence in the community . In this view , as means of increasing the number of educated men , we look on all the liberal Arts as matters of vast importance . To open a new or extend an old field of profitable intellectual industry , is one of the greatest benefits that can be conferred on mankind . But , much as we rejoice in the progress of the Fine Arts , we confess we care comparatively little about the merely mechanical labor that is sometimes called by that name . We do not think the country would be much benefited or its character much elevated , if our artists could paint brass-kettles as well as Ostade , or dead game as well as Snyders . The painter who copies such things , is indeed likely to be somewhat more refined than the tinker or cook who handles the originals ; but he is still further removed in an opposite direction from the artist , who endows with form and color the beautiful objects of his own invention , or embodies in portrait the intellect and character as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely denounce what is called still-life painting , but we value it very lightly ; and we protest against admitting among productions of the Fine Arts , those works , of which the whole supposed merit consists in an imitation of what is in itself entirely insignificant , and the highest aim of which is to produce a momentary deception . The other branches of painting , landscape and portrait as // well as composition of figures , are properly ranked among liberal arts , because in all of them the success of the artist depends mainly on mental cultivation . We do not mean that it will give him the necessary delicacy of organization , if nature has denied it ; for in nothing has she more plainly distinguished between men from their birth , than in their different capacities to acquire the imitative arts . But we mean that all her liberality is thrown away when it falls on the ignorant and uncultivated . As to historical composition , the truth is so obvious , that nothing more need be said. ; it depends on education for all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In landscape it may not appear quite so clear at first , for it may seem that the most uneducated are capable of truly observing and imitating inanimate nature . But even if that were all the art of the landscape painter , the mere manner of execution , and still more the selection of objects , would distinguish at once the rude from the cultivated mind . But when we consider the various sources to which composition in landscape is indebted for its charms , how it must combine , vary and contrast the forms and colors of nature , what wonderful effects may be produced by the mere distribution of light and shade , and , more than all , how it is elevated by historical and poetical associations , we see the immense distance that must separate the educated artist in this department , from the mere observer and copyist of natural scenery . Perhaps this aid of association has become more necessary to give value to this kind of painting , than it was formerly . There is undoubtedly some truth in the remark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value old pictures partly because they are old . Probably the same things , produced in our own times , would not excite the same enthusiasm , though we think the experiment has not yet been tried . If this be so , the remedy for the artist is , not to complain , but to take advantage of it . Let him , if he thinks the public unduly admire old paintings , contrive to recall them in his own works , not by servile imitation , but by resorting to similar sources in nature . Let him learn to revive in new combinations , forms which have become consecrated objects of taste . All invention consists in new arrange* ment ; and when certain classes of objects have become by association peculiarly agreeable to cultivated minds , as much originality may be displayed and more pleasure imparted // by using them as the elements of composition , than by adopting others in which the same interest is yet to be created . It is for this reason , that the most beautiful composition of American scenery is inferior in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mere natural beauty , while the other combines a high degree of that with objects of other and more intellectual pleasure . We know that some of our artists and of those who love the Arts , entertain a different opinion on this point , and cherish a patriotic predilection for their native scenery ; and we have seen them sometimes a little fretful at the preference given to that of other countries . But the best landscape painters of England and France have gone to Italy for the subjects of their best pictures ; and we can not believe that our own artists are to gain any thing hut a very temporary popularity , by discarding the aid of associations which add their greatest charm to the works of established reputation . In portrait painting , there is the same distinction between the artist and the mere mechanic , though there is not the same choice of subject . When a face is to be portrayed that displays intellect and character , the Art rises to a level with the highest . He can have little notion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the necessity of a high degree of mind in one who undertakes to do justice to the originals of some of the portraits in this Exhibition . We have made these remarks , not because we think them new , but because the Exhibition shows that our artists need to be reminded of them . It shows more skill than knowledge ; more care to execute well , than to conceive what is worth executing . Of the new pictures , among a very few better specimens , there are abundance of portraits that look as if their originals were wholly taken up with the thought of having their likenesses painted ; and of landscapes , of which the forms and colors seem chosen for no reason but to fill a canvass . The Exhibition taken together is better than several of the preceding , but that is owing to a judicious selection from the pictures exhibited before , and not to the improvements apparent in the new ones . We should , however , do injustice to Alexander , not to mention his portrait of Captain Morgan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Osgood , a young artist , to overlook one of his , which is remarkably happy in exhibiting the character and expression of the original , though defective in color . // Two premiums were offered by the Committee , for the best compositions in landscape and in figures . The prominent candidates in landscape , are Fisher and Birch . Doughty has sent nothing to the Exhibition . Fisher 's picture represents what we call by a strange misuse of the word , a freshet , . - that is , an inundation from the sudden swelling of a river . Birch 's is a storm on the sea-coast . On their comparative merits , it is the province of the Committee , and not ours , to decide . We think we have seen better pictures by both the artists . For the other premium , Mr. Weir is the only aspirant ; and he too is unfortunate in not being able to enter his best works for it . If earlier notice had been given of the intention of the Committee to offer these premiums , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
