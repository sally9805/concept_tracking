txt The American revolution was incomplete . It left one sixth part of the population the victims of a servitude immeasurably more debasing , than that from which it delivered the rest . While this nation held up its declaration of independence  --  its noble bill of human rights , before an admiring world , in one hand ; it mortified the friends of humanity , by oppressing the poor and defenceless with the other . The progress of time has not lessened the evil . There are now held in involuntary and perpetual slavery , in the southern half of this republic , more " than 2,000,000 of men , women , and children , guarded with a vigilance , which strives , and with success appalling as it is complete , to shut out every ray of knowledge , human and divine , and reduce them as nearly as possible to a level with the brutes . These miserable slaves are not only compelled to labor without choice and without hire , but they are subjected to the cruelty and lust of their masters to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally a sympathy with the slave-holders , and a prejudice against the slaves , which shows itself in palliating the crime of slave-holding , and in most unrighteously disregarding the rights , and vilifying the characters of the free colored men . At the same lime , slavery , as a system , is ( in a certain sense ) condemned . It is confessed to be a great evil , " a moral evil , " and , when the point is urged , a sin . The slaves , it is admitted , have rights  --  every principle of honesty , justice , and humanity , " i7i the abstract , ' ' calls aloud that they should be made free . The word of God is in their favour . Indeed , there is no ground claimed by the abettors of slavery , on which they pretend to justify it for a moment , but a supposed  --  a begged  --  expediency , baseless as the driven clouds . I say baseless , for while not a single fact has ever been produced , going to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the protection of law , and employing them as free laborers , there have been produced , on the other side , varied and fair experiments showing , that it is altogether safe and profitable . In this state of things where has the American church stood ? Has she too sympathized with the hearts of the Pharaohs ? Or has she , in the spirit of the martyrs of former times , borne an unflinching testimony against this sin ? Alas ! the painful truth stares us in the face . She has come dg.wn from the high and firm foundation of scripture truth , and is professedly at work upon a floating expediency , doing against slavery what can be done upon the unchecked current of popular prejudice . Speaking through the organ of the Colonization Society , she has admitted all that the most determined slave- holder could ask , and she is doing just that , and no more , which so far as he understands the subject , he hails with pleasure as a safeguard to his property in human bodies and souls . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is further evidence needed ? When the American Colonization Society , as a remedy for slavery , has been called in question , as well it might be for its tardiness , if for no other reason , there has been manifested a determination to hush inquiry . There has been a most pusillanimous shivering and shrinking from the probe . Nay , the few men who , in the uncompromising spirit of Christian benevolence , have urged this inquiry , have been slandered as disturbers of the public peace ,  --  have been assailed with abusive epithets , not by slave-holders only , but by their brethren in the bosom of the church . A most singular spectacle is presented in this enlightened and Christian age ; a handful of philanthropists , dare to denounce a system of legalized oppression , and to charge guilt upon all who uphold it ; upon this , not only do the principals in crime , as might be expected , ascribe the whole to sheer malice , but the leaders of the Christian church , as ought not to be expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw the whole weight of their cold and crushing influence to smother in its cradle this attempt at a gospel reformation . What does all this mean ? Are Christians in these northern states interested in upholding slavery ? Are they unwilling to be convinced that their colored brethren are better than the slanders of their oppressors would make them ? Are they sure , beyond a doubt , that the colonization scheme will relieve our country of the mighty evil which is crushing it ? that it is the Christicui way to relieve it ? Are the ' on good evidence convinced that it is not expedient to say to the wicked , " O wicked man , thou shalt surely die ? " Must they have PEACE at any rate  --  peace , though the groans of millions should ascend and mingle with the muttering thunders of coming wrath ? Will they have it , that if a word is said against a mere experiment , to test the practicability of rescuing the victim by flattering the oppressor , the whole cause of Christian benevolence is attacked ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a looking on both sides , would surely do no harm . Those defenders of truth who have shunned such inquiry , have always proved themselves shortsighted . The cause of God courts scrutiny  --  its advocates are thrown into no unseemly agitation when they are most rigorously silted . The subject cries aloud for more earnest consideration than it has yet received . More than two millions of outraged , down-trodden men cry out , shall we die in this sore bondage that white Christians may have the pleasure of attempting to shun God 's wrath without repenting of sin ? Half a million of free colored men cry out  - -  America is our country  --  the land for which our fathers bled as well as yours . Why will you seek to banish us ? The wrongs of the poor Indian cry aloud . There is no safety in league with transgressors ! The present political aspect of the South cries out , that tyjraiits do not regard law ! Six hundred millions of idolaters cry oul ; 10 the American church , " Why pluckest thou the mote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam is in thine own ! " Let us , Christian brethren , for I will not waste an appeal upon those who do not acknowledge the authority of the Gospel , dispassionately , and in the fear of God , look this inquiry in the face  --  Is the Colonization Society dovag what the Gospel requires to be done for the removal of slavery and its concomitant sins ? /z/ We must first take a view of the evil to be remedied . A very material inquiry meets us at the outset . Is slavery , in all circumstances , or at least in all the circumstances in which it exists in this country , a sin ?  --  a violation of the divine prohibition . Thou shalt /z/ In regard to the wretch who steals a man on the coast of Africa , and sells him into bondage , there is no longer any doubt . The curses of all parties meet upon his devoted head . Neither is the slave-merchant exculpated , nor does he deserve to be . His guilt is probably still greater than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys a man , knowing him to be stolen , and subjects him to the nameless horrors of the " middle passage . " The nations have pronounced his doom , along with that of the pirate and the murderer ; and this notwithstanding any palliating circumstances . Should he plead , when taken on the high seas , that he acknowledged the reception of those slaves to be wrong , but he had received them , and what could he do ?  --  should he liberate them in the midst of the ocean ?  --  he would plead in vain . Let us follow up this course of sin , to see , if possible , where it meets those modifying circumstances which take away its guilt . At the next step we see the stolen African standing on the shore of a Christian country . Within sight of Christian temples it is cried , " What will you bid for a man ? " Is that man guiltless who bids and buys an immortal being , and subjects him to his own use , as he would a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take upon his own shoulders , the sin of the slave-merchant ? Nay , does he not stand in the relation of a principal to all the accessary agents who have been concerned in the wicked transaction before him ? If the government allows , it surely does not compel him to buy . He liim.seK , in his own voluntary act , is the introducer of slavery ; and his guilt loo has been pronounced by the public voice , uttered through the American Colonization Societ3 That Society has said repeatedly that the guilt of slavery " rests not on the present s-lave-holder.s , but upon those who introdvced the system . " But let us proceed . Let us suppose , for the sake of simplicity , that the poor African , whom we have been contemplating ' , and his familj ' - , were the only slaves in the land . He cas bought  --  it was the consummation of his wrongs . No matter whether his master be kind or cruel , in regard to the justice of the thing ; the African is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty and the safe government of law . What ! will a man claim the right to buy and use his fellow man , at the caprice of his own will , as he would a brute , because , forsooth , he is Jdnd and benevolent 1 Or , will he claim a right to the slave because , contrary to right , he paid for him ? But we go forward . The poor slave submits to his hard lot . He bows his neck to the yoke . He renounces , along with the independence , all the responsibilities of a man ; and learns , for his second nature , to anticipate every wish of his master , of whatever kind . He sees his children treated as brutes , and he learns to consider himself and them as belonging to an inferior race . In the meantime his master , having grown old in his transgression , dies . He had no . claim to be considered a Christian , " for if a man say that he loves I/ ' God , and hateLh his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a land of Bibles ' he dies amidst the terrors of unrepented sin . His children stand around his dying bed and see the agony of his sinking spirit as hope takes her returnless flight . Where now are the circumstances which justify the children in going forward in the same course ? With their father 's damning guilt before them , blazing in the light of God 's curse , can they divide among themselves that wretched family of slaves as an inheritance ? If they do , they may well be said to inherit their father 's sin  --  they commence the business of sinning not like their father , upon their own resources , but with an accumulated and fearfully productive capital . Why they steal afresh , beneath the gallows , that very thing for which their father paid the Jast penalty of the violated law ! they dare heaven and earth , between which he was suspended , to do their worst ! ! The slaves increase . They furnish now both the excitement and the gratification to their masters ' lusts . Industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the master ; in their place are nurtured sloth , pride , cruelty , and ungovernable passion . The hand of tyranny becomes so heavy that the poor , crushed slave can no longer bear it ; he now gives occasional but terrific proof that he is a man . Henceforward fear and trembling , by day and by night , are the jirice paid for the indulgence of arbitrary power . As generation after generation passes away , the curse of ( lod grows heavier , and the thunders of his coming wrath swell to a louder tone . Now , I ask agam , where are the circumstances which go to justify slave-holding ? Are they to be found in the consequences ?  --  consequences fraught with blasting and mildew to the fields , and deep damnation to the souls of the slave-holders ? Are they to be found in the human law , which , we may suppose , has by this time forbidden the liberation of slaves ? The very question regards the righteousness of the law . Can an unrighteous law justify an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conscience against God , or does God speak to the conscience against the law ? With what face can these slave-holders , with all their Bibles , and their lucid facts , and their repeated warnings , and the groans of the prisonhouse sounding in their ears , lay back the entire guilt upon the introducer of slavery  --  the mere originator of an experiment which they have brought to result in a hell upon earth  --  and still persevere in the same course ? With what face can a slave-holding judge , fed , and clothed , and charioted in splendor by the forced action of bought and sold human muscles , pronounce sentence of death upon the kidnapper who has , it may be , stolen a single African from his barbarous home ? Can sin be multiplied into righteousness ? Again , are the transforming circumstances to be found in the character of the slave-holders ? Multitudes of slave-holders are said to be Christians  --  ornaments to the church of God  --  forward in every benevolent work . But in estimating their character , what weight has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements of their character ? Would it not materially affect our estimate of the piety of the Apostle Paul , if we were to learn that he retained , till the day of his death , in the city of Tarsus , a patrimony of slaves , whom , so long as they remained there , he might not liberate , nor teach to read a syllable of his epistles , on pain of death ? Could he have claimed sincerity for his exhortation , " Masters , give unto servants that which is just and equal , " if he kept men in involuntary and perpetual servitude without wages ? " But many slave-holders are kind , and generous , and hospitable ! " Must every tyrant of course put on the demeanor of a tiger ? Must every sinner 's brow , at all times , be ruffled with the malice of a demon ? AVhy , the very tiger is playful with his mates . The very demon knows how to flatter and caress , and put on all the attractiveness of an angel . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to justify it on the ground of character , is to beg the question . God has made our state of affection towards our fellow men , embracing the vilest and poorest , a test of our love to him . This lest must be applied , whomsoever it may offend , and whatsoever pretensions it may demolish . Moreoveij it is abundantly confirmed by the history of the past , that the most flagrant transgressors may show much respect to God , and be sufficiently just to their equals . God said to his ancient prophet , " Cry aloud , spare not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and show my people their transgressions , and the house of Jacob their sins . Yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways , as a nation that dicl righteousness , and forsook not the ordinances of their God ; they ask of me the ordinances oi justice ; they take delight in approEiching to God . " We must then look beyond apparent piety to God , to find a justification for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessities of the case ? Can a man liberate his slaves at the south if he would ? What is there to hinder ? Is there any command of God against it ? Is public opinion necessity ? Are human laws necessities ? So thought not the Christian martyrs . They braved death for doctrines ; would they have done less for practice ? If slave-holding be a sin , it can not be necessary ; God never places his creatures under a necessity of sinning . It is necessary to obey God  --  to live is not always necessary . This , even in the worst possible case ; but bad as American slavery is , it has not yet come to this . The slave-holder may yet remove with his slaves and emancipate them  --  the sacrifice of ill-gotten wealth is the sole necessity which can now exist . Hitherto we have not come up with any of those potent , but fugitive circumstances , which can transmute an abstract sin into a " sa-cred duty . " Whither have they fled ? Have they betaken themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , ai length , in the shadowy limbo of supposed consequences ? So I am constrained to think . It is heard from the south , and re-echoed from the remotest north , that instant emancipation " would be but an act of dreamy madness "  --  the fatal match to produce a most appalling and destructive explosion . A reformation so sudden , it is said , would be worse than the sin . But where are the facts ? In the name of sacred verity , where are the facts ? We must have evidence , the same in kind , and not less in degree , than that which convinces us that the sun will rise to-morrow , before we believe that God has so constituted his creatures , that they must continue in one sin to avoid another , or that there is danger in being just and merciful . In the entire absence of facts which prove them , and in the face of facts which disprove them , I must believe that the evil consequences of immediate emancipation , are confined to the fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt any where , it rests in full weight upon the present slave-holder . In vain he looks around him for those modifying circumstances which may change his crime to a misfortune . Out of his own mouth he is condemned . He admits the guilt of the kidnapper , the slave-merchant , the original purchaser  --  and why ? Not simply because their transient agency was marked with cruelty , but because the consequence was the perpetual slavery of a race , and the entail upon fv fair country of a blighting curse  --  a consequence for which he , in his place , is responsible . Guilt , however , is not measured by the consequences of action , but by some known rule . To say nothing of the voice of conscience , the Word of God is plain ; " Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself " Who would put himself under the arbitrary control of an individual , rather than under the mild and steady government of law ? Who would , himself , be willing to labor without wages , and have his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of any man , however good ? " Thou shalt not steal , " says the supreme law ; but the slave-holder is a ferfelual thief . He steals , not " to satisfy his soul when hungry , " but to feast on dainties , to pamper every lust . There can not be made out a clearer case of violation of divine law , tlan slaveholding . The very permission given to the Israelites to make servants of the heathen who dwelt about them , is a proof against the slave-holder . Did God giant an express permission to his people to buy and use oxen ' I An express permission implies that a thing would be wrong without it . But the Bible contains positive instruction on this subject which is applicable to all ,  --  fair expositions of the general law in regard to this very thing . " Is not this the fast that 1 have chosen ? To loose the bands of wickedness , to undo the heavy burdens , and to let the oppressed go free , and that ye break every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also , have a Master in heaven . "  --  Col. iv . 1 . In the first epistle to Timothy , first chapter , tenth verse , the Apostle classes mai-stealers with whoremongers , liars , perjured persons , and the like ; on this passage there stood in the standard of the Presbyterian Church , till 1818 , this very appropriate comment : " Men-stealers among the Jews were exposed to capital punishment ; and the Apostle Paul classes them with sinners of the first rank . Stealers of men are all those who bring off slaves or free men , and keep , sell , or buy them ; comprehending all those who are concerned in bringing any of the human race into slavery , or detaining them in it . " But m 1818 this note was struck out . That is , when the Gene " ral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church saw that the " thieves " were respectable , " then , it consented with them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed a church in the world to say that his law is too severe ? Do - his redeemed people tarry in this wilderness on their way to glory , to keep sin in countenance by sympathizing with shameless rebels ? If God asks the transgressor , what will you do when I shall deal with you ? What will you answer when I shall make inquisition for blood ? Is the church t'o rise up and cry , this is not a religious but apolitical question  --  it will exasperate sinners , it will divide Christians , it will grieve the blessed spirit , it will put an end to revivals . Well might God say of such a church , " They draw near to me with their moutksr " But we hope better things , though we thus speak . " The church , as a body , ( I speak without respect to denominations , ) has taken her view of slavery , not from the word of God , but from a supposed expediency . She has considered it a political question , settled by an authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the statement of one party only ; the slave-holder has told his story , but the poor slave has not been heard . Let the doctrines of scripture be now at length preached ; let the facts , the woful , blood-stained facts , be spread out ; let the tale of a slave 's wrongs enter the ear , and the church , as a body , will rise in the might of truth . Her testimony will be uttered , and heard , and feh . She will speak out , and trust , God for the consequences . Again , the guilt of slave-holding may be clearly seen from the relation It holds to acknowledged sins . I have already hinted at this ; but let us look it more fully in the face . Why has it come to be a settled point , ( in the abstract , the slavery apologists would say , ) that man is unfit to be intrusted with despotic power 1 Why , but that /z/ this very power stands m the relation of a fruitful parent to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural affection , exciting anger , lust , extortion , falsehood , and cruel covetousness 1 What is the testimony of facts in regard to slavery in republican America ? Look at the prodigality and shameless profligacy of southern youth . How many a son has been sent to the distant University , surrounded with whatever advantages wealth could procure , and after having been subjected to all that is reformatory in discipline , and stimulating in the love of praise , has returned to his house a ruined debauchee , made so by the vices that he carried from his father 's roof ? Did the parent 's heart break ? No : it was the heart of a slave-holder  --  it was too hard ! It thrust away the undutiful child from the scene of his first lessons in guilt , to the riper instruction of hoary-headcd gamblers , profligates , and duellists . Look again at the shameless violation of the seventh commandment . Read the proof in the thousands of mulattos born of black mothers every year  --  born to be treated like brutes by their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily I might , but the task is needless . The abomination is open , the cry has gone up to heaven , the very sun turns pale ! " Shall I not be avenged on such a nation as this , saith the Lord ? " But is there no reproving , reforming spirit among them ? Does not the Christian pulpit thunder forth the penalties of the insulted law ? Is there not a'n intrepid remnant of God 's elect , whose lives are a standing rebuke to the general corruption ? No , the pulpit is spell-bound . The message of God is clothed in pointless generalities . The righteous are tamer than Lot in Sodom . The prophet dares not to take forth the precious from the vile ; I speak of the general fact . If there are men , and I rejoice to believe there are few , who dare openly to attack slavery on Bible ground , they are regarded as insane by their brethren . Their most celebrated philanthropists , in view of all the sins of the system , think they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well enough before , the pecuniary waste which attends it . They hope that a clear demonstration of the pecuniary unprofitableness of slavery will supersede the necessity of any more direct and hazardous aggression . Vain hope ! Will the loss of property stop the drunkard , or the gambler , or the debauchee ? The slaves are held by the lust of power and the lust of pleasure . Are these passions  --  cherished , fortified , enthroned in the heart as they are , to be weakened and expelled by the love of money ? Let those cherish such hopes who can shut out the glorious sun at noon-day , and illuminate themselves with rushlights . For one I disclaim all respect for such childish absurdity , and cowardly good nature . If man is not a soulless brute , the whole system of slavery , in all its parts , by whatsoever circumstances surrounded , and by whomsoever upheld , is a monstrous sin , a most comprehensive and damning iniquity , for which it is downright treason against God to offer the shadow of an apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncompromising truth of the Gospel . /z/ Such is the slavery which cleaves to our republio , and holds in its rist , defying heaven 's wrath , one sixtii part of our population . Who shall gauge the current of its wo ? Who shall calculate the amount of sighs , and tears , and wailings , and of unspoken anguish , that have flowed through it during one hundred and fifty years ? Who shall sum up the bitter complaints which it has poured into the ear of an avenging God ? Who shall despise the coming retribution ? Let those do so , if they will , who represent slavery as a curse which we innocently inherit from our fathers  --  which we can not throw off , however much we may desire to . I must be permitted to " tremble for my country , " while I regard it as a crime which has polluted this whole nation from the lakes to the gulf , and from the river to the sea . While I claim the right , nay , while I avow the imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not on the ground of my own innocence . The consciousness of past guilt sometimes impels a man to speak the terrors of the law in the ear of a fellow sinner . Slavery is not the exclusive sin of the South . Northern ships and northern capital helped to introduce It ; and northern capital and northern morality throw the strongest shield around the system at this moment . And is this a reason why northern men , washing their own hands of the guilt , should not raise their voices against it 1 Is it not rather a reason why thej ' should do it the iiiore earnestly ? If slavery has polluted the moral atmosphere of the nation ; if it has stupified the conscience , and paralized the energy , of the church of God  --  if it has written " hyfocrisy ' ' ' upon the portals of the sanctuary , and thrown doubt upon the very existence of love for souls , ( and who will say that it has not ? ) shall those who see , and know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for what ? Or should such language seem too harsh , ( for I would not be guilty of uttering truth in words which are too true , ) if there is any apparent inconsistency in professing to love God , while we do so little for 2,000,000 of our fellow men , who are laboring under the peculiar disadvantages of domestic servitude , and while , indeed , as a . community , we hardly express so much sympathy with them as with their masters , will it not be expedient for those who can do it conscientiously , to say that slavery is always wrong  --  or even viicked  - -  as a sort of foundation for their efforts towards its removal ? I ask those sober men , who have sharpened their vision by looking after consequences and circumstances in the dim field of political expediency , was any great triumph ever won in favor of truth , by concealing truth ? /z/ C H A P T E K f I /z/ ix needs not be said to any wakeful observer of things as they are , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forbidden shore , burns the ship , drav/s the sword , throws awa ' the scabbard , and proclaims itself under a necessity of rushing forward . The thief is careful , as soon as may be , to transtniue the stolen goods , so as to put restoration out of the question . The drunkard has so Jnodified his constitution , that he tnnst in his own apprehension , persevere in his course , or , at least , not break ofi ' suddenlj , which amounts to exactly the same thing . The liar has so involved himself in a web of falsehood , that to burst away at once , would , in his view , be worse than to add a little more of the same sin . The prodigal , amidst his riotous excess , fuids moments to think of repentance ; but the sneers of the wicked , and the mocker ' of the fools , whom his wasteful expenditure has drawn around him , rise as mighty obstacles in the way of his return . Now , of how much atail would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to secure repentance . Do any , or all of them amount to a necessity ? Does the wicked heart , which first broke away from duty of its own accord , grow weary of its course , and would it return but for the insuperable barriers which it has left behind it ? . Are the most high-handed tyrants the unfortunate prisoners of circumstances , who would gladly avail themselves of the opportunity to escape , if some friendly hand without , would unbar the gate ? Somethinif very much like this is involved in the proposition , that the American Colonization Society is adapted to remove the sin of slavery . That Society justifies slavery , on the plea of a present rieeessity ;  --  the tyrants own plea . It finds this necessity in the laws which forbid manumission , or , perhaps , in the reason for such laws , namely , the alleged fact , that the free blacks in the slave-holding states , are more wretched than the slaves , and that they are dangerous as excitements to rebellion . Just what it pretends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this necessity , by removing the free blacks and the slaves as fast as they are made free . Now the question is , has this any tendency to secure the abolition , however gradual , of slavery ? I answer just as much as the following proclamation would have to recover stolen property . /z/ The person who stole a watch from Y. Z. is hereby informed , that he is considered guilty in the abstract ; but , now that he has stolen it , a necessity prevents the restitution , inasmuch as he is known to belong to a gang of thieves , who have bound themselves not to restore any thing , and as it would be attended with a loss of character  --  a far greater evil than the retention of the watch :  --  Therefore , I will carefully abstain from all measures which might occasion /z/ such an unhappy developnipnt . But I am chargel to recover the watch : and that the necessUy of retaining it may be removed , I promise to ask no questions of the person who shall leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . A. B , Agent for the owner . Have not the slave-holders themselves , for more than one hundred and fifty years , been making this necessity stronger ? And does this argue any general willingness to manumit the slaves , if the necessity were removed ? What has created and augmented this necessity , but the determination to retain the slaTes in bondage ? Do the " laws against the instruction of slaves , show any willingness to profit by the removal of this pretended necessiiy ? The very reasons assigned for the laws against manumission without removal , are direct proofs of the unwillingness of the great body of slave-holders to manumit their slaves if they could . What is the cause of the extreme " wretchedness " of the free blacks at the South ? We have it from the mouth of a slave-holder  --  want nf employment . Here is the whole secret . If a few negros , from their own industry , or the conscientiousness of their master. ? , gain their freedom , the whole community of slave-holders turn round and trample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without which poor men can not live honestly , and then complain of them for being thieves ! and point at them as being in worse condition than the slaves ! Does this show any disposition to substitute free for slave labor ? Again , the slave-holders fear the free blacks as incitements to servile rebellions . Would they , if they were sincerely desirous to rid themselves of their slaves ? The slaves would rebel , simply to get their freedom . It is unsafe to keep them in bondage . Send away the free  --  make slavery more safe , and will the ma.ster be more disposed to give up the slave ? Will Pharaoh relent when the plague is withdrawn ? Why does he not send his slaves to Liberia ? There would be no danger of the free exciting insurrection among the slaves , if there were no slaves . Again . southern colonizationists can not be serious in proposing the removal of the vholc colored population , for they well enough know that this can not be effected without the substitution of a class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of the blacks , and yet their plan takes no cognizance of any replacement . Indeed , in their own expressive language , they contemplate nothing more than " a drain for the excessive increase "  --  an artificial antidote to nature 's cure for slavery . There needs no further proof that the main body of slave-holders , who create the laws , and give tone to public sentiment , would not be moved a hair toicards the manumission of their slaves by the removal of the so called necessity for retaining them . This action of the Society , then , if it takes effect at all , must do so upon the few scattered individuals , too few to form a measurable minority , who do not assent to the laws . From these few , those must be subtracted whose consciences are thoroughly awakened , for the removal of this necessity from their way would be plainly a work of superero- /z/ gation There would then remain to be acted on , a class of yiuner : - who are in the condition of slightly preferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their " burden , " and one consequence will certainly follow  --  they will feel less personal interest in the laws with regard to slavery , so that the formation of a minority , even in the legislatures , in opposition to the laws , and in favor of abolition , will be effectually prevented . But I will weary my obliging reader no longer by seriously examining an argument , which owes to a prevalent and wicked prejudice against the Africans , its salvation from overwhelming contempt . Transfer the scene to the empire of Morocco . How far would it go towards the liberation of a large body of American slaves supposed to be there , to ofler to transport them , not to the land of their fathers , but to their own native land , for which they were pining in despair ? Is the parallel denied 1 How can it be accounted for , if it is indeed a fact , that Christian slave-holders , after having broken through all the holy restraints of Christianity , are a more tender-hearted , sjwntaneously repentant race than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Society exerts a moral in/luencc against slavery . Does it , indeed 1 And where is the moral machinery which it has set at work ? Is it found in the authorized publications of the Society ? We are taught by them that slavery is a great evil , and that there was great guili somewhere . But the bolts of its direct rebuke  --  how harmless !  --  shorn smooth of every thing that could hurt the proverbial sensitiveness of a tyrant ! The following passages are extracted from a very elaborate " development of the true principles and character of the Society , " marked No. 3 , in the Appendix to the Fourteenth Annual Report . They embrace all the passages in that paper , in which the Society speaks with any distinctness on the moral character of slavery , along with some of the neutralizing matter which is thrown in quite profusely . The opinions of the founders of the Society are appealed to .

" Mr. Mercer had said , " Many thousand individuals in our native state , you well know , Mr. President , are restrained , asj'ou and 1 are , by the melancholy conviction that they can not yield to the suggestions of humanity , without manifest injury to their country . The laws of Virginia now discourage , and very wisely , perhaps , the emancipation of slaves . But the very policy on which they are founded will afford every facility to emancipation , when the colonization of the slave will be the consequence of his liberation . " ' Mr. Clay had said , " Let the colony once be successfully planted , and legislative bodies , who have been grieved at the necessity of passing those prohibitory laws , which , at a distance , might appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impediments to the exercise of benevolence and humanity . " General Harper , in his letter , had said , " It tends , and may powerfully tend , to rid us gradually and entirely , in the United States , of slaves and slavery , a great moral and political evil , of increasing virulence and extent , from which much mischief is now felt , and very great calamity in future is justly apprehended . * * * * This great end is to be attained in no other way than by a plan of Universal Colonization , founded on the consent of the slave-holders , and of the colonists themselves . " From the Society 's Memorial to Congress . " It is now reduced to be a maxim , equally approved in philosophy and practice , that the existence of distinct and separate castes or classes , forming exceptions to the general system of policy adapted to the community , is inherent vice in the composition of society , pregnant with baneful consequences , both moral and political , and demanding the utmost exertion of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same memorial speaks thus , after speaking of the " unfortunate condition of the free people of color , and the consequent to the public welfare "  --  " The evil has become so apparent , and the necessity for a remedy so palpable , that some of the most considerable of the slave-holding states , have been induced to impose restraints upon the practice of emancipation , by annexing conditions which have no effect but to transfer the evil from one state to another , or by inducing other states to adopt countervailing regulations , and in the total abrogation of a right , which benevolent or conscientious proprietors had long enjoyed under the sanction of positive law , and of ancient usage . " Mark how the abrogation of the rights of the conscientious , is palliated by the tyrant 's plea  --  necessity ! But , good reader , let us restrain our indignation for the present  --  we may have further use for it . From the second Report , " a formal and official declaration of the sentiments of the Society . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention of the southern proprietor , to rivet the claims of servitude upon his slaves , as if the circumstances which accompanied the origin of the Society , the character of its members , and their solemn and reiterated declarations , did not forbid so unfounded an imputation . It would not be more uncandid to ascribe to them a design to invade the rights of private property , secured by the constitution and laws of the several slave-holding states , and to proclaim Universal Emancipation  --  What is this but to say , that proclaiming universal emancipation is invading rights ? What is it but to say , that the right of property in man must not be questioned ? Those who established the Society , " had no desire or intention of interfering , in any way , with the rights or the interests of the proprietors of slaves . " /z/ " They considered slavery a great moral and political evil , and cherished the hope and belief that the successful prosecution of their object would offer powerfid motives , and exert a jrersuasive influence , in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undeniable , that the Society , in the prosecution of this work , has never interfered , or evinced even a disposition to interfere , in any loay , with the rights of proprietors of slaves . " " But it may bo said that the Society has expressed the opinion that slavery is a moral and political evil , and that it has regarded the scheme of colonization as presenting motives , and exerting a moral influence at the South , favorable to gradual and vohmtary emancipation . This is true , and it is this , beyond all question , which has secured to it the countenance and patronage of our most profound and sagacious statesmen , and given to this scheme a peculiar attractiveness and gloiy in the view of the enlightened friends of their country and mankind .

Is jiot this a truth inscribed , as it were , upon the firmament of heaven , and the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would not a denial of It be a denial of the fundamental principle of all free government ? And is the Society to be condemned for assuming as truth , what even the Soutkcrn Review does not hesitate unequivocally and repeatedly to avow , while arguing , very ingeniously , in defence of southern rights and southern policy ? " Look at this , reader : ponder it well . The Society , on its own confession , goes no farther in reprobating slavery , than do the advo cates of slavery themselves ! By demonstrating this , it has at length " converted " the South . Shall it any longer hold " the friends of their country and mankind " deluded by the vain show of such a moral influence as Saian is willing to exert against himself ? But let us look once more at this famous paper . " A true son of Virginia has said , ' / ? ) iay be jtrrmiited to declare that I WOULD BE A SLAVE-HOLDER TO DAY WITHOUT SCRUPLE . But I hold it due to candor to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I believe there are two or three such , who is content that we shall always hold them in servitude , and would advise us to rest contented with them , us , and our posterity , without seeking or accepting means of liberating ourselves and them , he deserves a heavier vengeance than the orator 's bile , the curse of God ? No. the curses of America counselled to her ruin , and of outraged Africa . Let me not be considered harsh ; for inasmuch as the piratical trader for human beings on the African coast , the master of the slave ship , is the most detestable of monsters in action  --  so , I must say , is the advocate , by cool argument , of slavery in the abstract , odious in thought ? ' " r , - The two or three theoretic slave-holders must look out for this thunderbolt  --  Mfi thousands V " practical ones are quite safe . Bulwhat docs all this mean ? What does the Society mean by /z/ talking about a " moral evil , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " when " we siiall have honestly exerted all the means which we possess for Us extinction ? " Does it mean that we can not cease to do wrong when we please ? What means this extreme solicitude about the rights of slave-proprietors ? What , the apologetic style of all this moral influence ? Is the Society made up of such tenderness of persuasion , such very milk of charity , that it wbuld do violence to its lamb-like nature , by uttering harsh rebuke , even where such rebuke is deserved ? See how it treats the foreign slave traders !  --  " the most detestable monsters in action / " It leaves no corner of the horrible , unransacked-for epithets , and similes , and thunderbolts , to be poured upon their forfeited heads . Its agonts take care to exhibit chains wherever they go , to awaken the indignation of old and young against those miscreants who drive their fellow beings from the interior of Africa to the coast , and at the same time to demonstrate the triumphs of the colony in opposing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of those chains that clink under the windows of the capitol ? Why does it not take them fresh from the victims of the domestic trade , and show the cruel ingenuity of the rings for the wrists , and ankles , and necks  --  brightened on the inside by rubbing against the bone , and foul and black on the outside with dusty gore ? Is it not simply because these chains can not be spared ? Why then not tell us the sad story ? Are there , indeed , throngs of chained and driven wretches in our own Christian land , who are so thoroughly given over to despair , that their case must not be mentioned in the ear of Charity ? Must our sympathies and pity be borne away from the cries of distress that mingle around us , and stun our ears , to the mere accessory , trans-ocean traffic ? No , no ! no matter how sincere , the Colonization Society is too pusillanimous to deserve the high station which it has assumed . It is afraid to speak the whole truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any thing to do in setting free two millions of oppressed men , the American Colonization Society must be given up , or it must retire into the comparative insignificance , I might say cringing sycophancy , of the object proposed in its constitution ; it must leave the ground of operation against slavery clear to a society which shall use a more aggressive moral influence . What ! Is that to be dignified with the name of a moral influence , which abstains from a correct representation of its object , lesi the equanimity of those whom it would persuade should be disturbed ?  --  lest passion should be excited , and the ground of hostility should be taken ? Here is a most singular phenomenon ; a society professing to exert a moral influence against slavery , and yet afraid to state facts , and when compelled to state facts , afraid to use language appropriate to them . A society which , when speaking of the most odious system of oppression , takes special care to avoid the words sin , crime , guilt , and speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore " ci'iZ . " Is such a " moral " remedy for sin likely to effect a cure ? Arc the slave-holders in reality not slave-holders , but virtuous men , keeping their slaves merely under that name , from necessity , till it /z/ shall be practicable lo enlarge them ? - Can this be proved of a single individual ? But the Society , instead of exerting any efficient moral influence HI favor of emancipation , is exerting a most pernicious influence against it , by the doctrines of its authorized publications . It is understood by the slave-holders , so far as it gains their confidence , to admit the right of property in men , as fully as it admits any right whatever . It is of no avail for the secretary to say , when questioned by northern philanthropists , that it merely admits the legal right . It is careful not to tell the planters so . To question the legal right , would be sheer ignorance or idiocy . It was the moral question which the ) lanters feared , and on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have obtained beyond this a full admission . What right they have to the supposition , such passages as the following will show . " It was proper again and again to repeat , that it was far from the indention of the Society to aftect , in any manner , the tenure by which a certain species of property is held . He was himself a slave-holder , and he considered that kind of property as inviolable , as any other in the country . He would resist as soon , and with as much firmness , encroachments upon it , as he would encroachments upon any other property which he held . Nor was he disposed even to go so far as the gentleman , ( Mr. Mercer , ) who had just spoken , in saying that he would emancipate his slaves , if the means were provided for sending them from the country . " Speech of Henry Clay , one of the founders , and published by the managers in their first Annual Report . Quotations of the same import might be multiplied without end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required , that these traitorous admissions do respect the moral right , look at the treatment received l ) y abolitionists . They have never called in question the legal right , much less have they used force , or threatened it , or coimselled the slaves to use it . And yet they are clamorously accused of interference with rights , and by none more bitterly , or vehemently than the Amierican Colonization Society , through its accredited pubhcations . Take the following specimen . " But we have not , we do not , and we will not , interfere with this delicate , this important subject . There are rights to be respected , prejudices to be conciliated , fears lo be quelled , and safety to be observed , in all our operations . And we protest , most solemnly protest , against the adoption of your views , as alike destructive of the ends of justice , of folicy , and of humanity Af Kcp . Vol. vii . page 101 . Abolitionists then , plainly , do that which the Colonization Society does not ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny the moral right of slavery : therefore the Society does not deny the moral right  --  yea , the moral right is the subject of its reiterated admission . Can any moral influence be more adverse to repentance , than thus to tell the sinner he has a right to sin ? But , says the worthy secretary , " the Society calls the attention oi /z/ ihe south , to the subject of the whole colored population , " that is to say , it may prove the occasion of bringing them to reflection ;  - -  it constitutes a good point of suggestion . So might a fawning hypocrite be a good point of suggestion to remind the dissolute of religion ! Alas ! what abominable mockery of sacred rights  --  the rights of the poor and defenceless ! Truly , in the language of the prophet , " the right of the needy do they not judge . " The fact that the Society advocates gradual emancipation , is proof that it exerts no efficient influence m favor of emancipation at all . " But , what will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do they not prove that the Societ has persuaded some slaveholders to give up their slaves ? " No , most surel ' - they do not ; and for this plain reason , the Society has used no persuasives . Its friends are challenged now , as they have been challenged long , in vain , to point out with the finger , in all the authorized and approved publications of the Society , a sftigle paragraph which urges a persuasive to manumit slaves , at any definite time , or which condemns slavery as a sin , without excuse . For the sake of keeping peace with the slave-holders , it has brought no charge against slavery , which they have not always , of themselves , readily admitted . How , in the name of common sense , can it have persuaded any man of his error when , in immaculate good faith , it has never meddled with the question of slavery at all ? Just as well might a man take to himself credit for pleading the missionary cause with success , who should slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the fate of catching a handful of coppers . The plain matter of fact is , that this is a land of Bibles . The principles of immediate abolition stand out on the face of all the law , and the prophets , and the Gospel ; and in spite of the apathy of the church , and the silence of its ministers , they must needs make here and there a convert . Moreover slavery is a blighting curse , hostile to agricultural thrift and domestic economy . So strong is the light shed from the condition of the free labor states , on this point , that it would be strange if some holders , without any movings of humanit ' - , should not become willing to emancipate their slaves . The Society oflfering its services to remove the emancipated , the emancipators whatever their motives , avail themselves of its aid . Among all the tenders of liberated slaves for the colon ' - , which are published with so much care in the African Repository , is there to be found a single note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves in question , owed their liberty to a conviction wrought in the mind of the liberator , by the Society 's moral influence 1 If there is , let it be pointed out . It will be precious to the Society 's cause . It will present the singular anomaly of a sinner convicted of his guilt , by the concealment or absence of truth . Of conversions , so called , there is no lack ; but they are conversions without change . A man supposes the Society to interfere with the " rights " of the masters , or to " meddle " with the delicate question of slavery ; he finds himself mistaken , and is said to be converted ! By making such conversions , the Society is becoming quite popular at the south . The appre- /z/ hension of the Society 's , moral influence , sensitive ns are the tyranfii ' , never amounted to a fear  --  it never called forth legislative rewards for the heads of the managers  --  now , it only calls forth contempt . But emancipation is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded by the Colonization Society . In 1782 , Virginia passed a law , authorizing the manumission of slaves ,  --  that is , authorizing its citizens , to use one of their " inalienable " rights , and , we are told , on the testimony of Judge Tucker , that 10,000 slaves gained their freedom , in this state alone , between this j'car and 1791 See Holmes ' Annals , vol. ii . page 342.  --  Without any elaborate jinvestigation , for which I have not the means at hand , it may be concluded , with cejtainty , from the number of free blacks in the country , ( from 3 to 400,000 ) that emancipations were formerl ' far more frequent than now . It is equally obvious , that these emancipations have been beneficial to the emancipated . . More than 70,000 colored persons are members of the Methodist Church alone . I quote this fact , because it happens at the present moment , to fall under my eye . These colored members , are either bond or free ; if bond , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to die ; if free , their freedom can not have ruined them . Again , of the 300,000 colored persons in the land , only a small fraction have been convicted under law of crime ; the law , of course , judges the majority of them innocent  --  fit for freedom . He who would discourage emancipation , then , on the ground of the criminality of the free , would reverse the maxim of the law , that " it is better to let ten guilty escape , than to punish one innocent man . " The American Colonization Society , must have the credit of originating the doctrine that emancipation , to be proper , must be on the condition of exile . Since this noble and magnanimous discovery , emancipation has received a notorious check . If there is any thing plain in the world , it is that the Colonization Society , is exactly adapted to , and actually does , shield from public odium , the laws against emancipation without exile ? And then , with marvellous assurance , it turns round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should seek to expatriate all the colored people ip the land , so fast as they become free But , of the emancipations , which have taken place since the origin of the Colonization Society , few and far between , that Society has not the right to take credit . What child does not know , that it is because the Gospel gives a now to all its requisitions , that it succeeds at all ? Say to the sinner , this course of sin in which yon have so long indulged is an "  --  vi/ , " a great ' - misfortune , ' ' and can be justified on no plea but that of " necessity ; " you must therefore get rid of it as soon as you can " safely ; " and , think you , he will set about and execute a plan of gradual reformation ? If he does , other arguments than yours must have moved him . It is a truth , obvious as the sun at cloudless noon , that all the gradual reformation in practice , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediatism in doctrine . What , then , can the fruit of gradualism itself be , but everlasting procrastination ? What can better please Satan and his minions , than to preach under the authority and vestments /z/ of Christian philanthropy , the gradual abolition oj sin . Wh ' ! that arch deceiver would blush to ask more of us ! On these grounds , then , I am forced to conclude , that the Colonization Society , whatever may be its motives , or its hopes , in regard to slavery , either has not courage enough to state facts as they are , or , it has made the unwarrantable assumption that auch a statement is not necessary , and consequently can claim no relationship with that wise and effectual remedy for sin revealed in the Scriptures . Now , shall the Society , embodying , as it does , an overwhelming weight of character , justify itself by saying that it does the best the case will admit ?  --  ' that it finds slavery grown into the very substance , the " frame-work " of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , childishly absurd , to hope for any success by direct aggressive action ? So have other sins grown into the " frame-work " of society . So are other sins fortified by all that is redoubtable in earth and hell . Idolatry has formed the character , and given shape to the customs , of more than three fourths of the race . But those who would act on the part of the living God have no option . They are not to choose their own mode of operating against idolatry . They are not at liberty to propose a system of amelioration or of gradual renunciation . Nor are they at liberty to despair . They must not , on pain of their Master 's fierce displeasure , shun to declare the full truth , though it may exasperate . " Is not my word like a fire , saith the Lord ? and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces 1 Take forth the precious from the vile , and thou shalt be as my mouth "  --  is the command and the promise of Jehovah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines of the Society , to the tendency of its actual practice . The question is simply this . What effect must it have upon slavery , to remove far off the free blacks and the slaves so fast as they become free ? To consider this apart from the doctrines of the Society , let us suppose that the removal is effected by some unseen hand , some invisible agency , by which the subjects of it are known to be ( as in reality they are not ) transferred to comparative happiness . Is it not obvious that this agency would remove that class of freemen who would most naturally sympathize with the slaves , and excite in their breasts a feeling adverse to the authority of their masters ? If so , the removal would tend to allay the fears of the masters , and thus destroy a motive which almost always stands first in the order of feelings which lead to repentance and reformation . And would not the masters be ready on such terms to part with the " excessive increase " of their slaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent and the most idle  --  the dangerous and the unprofitable ? If so , not only fear would be allayed , but interest would be subserved . Slavery would be rendered profitable , so far as the system is capable of yielding profit . The natural tendency of the increase of population , is to advance be3 ' ond the means of support . In regard to American slavery , this tendency will soon produce a redundancy of slaves , and a consequent depreciation of their value . To maintain their value , deportation must be resorted to . But is this the observed tendency of the Society 's action ? Heve /z/ we must rely on testimony . It is the only evidence which the nature of the case admits . The Society itself has furnished this evidence in publishing the speeches of its slave-holding friends , delivered at its anniversaries .  --  See extract from Mr. Archeis speech at the end of this pamphlet . Whatever may be said of the motives of Mr. Archer , or of the Society 's not being responsible for his sentiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , must be received . And the conclusion is , not that the Society desifi-ns to perpetuate slavery , but that nothing could be more wisely adapted to that very end , than its present and contemplated actions . Let any mtelligent man , without regard to this controversy , set himself at work to devise a plan for the perpetuation and security of slavery ; could he , with all the wisdom that was ever allied to rectitude , arrange a more effectual train of means , to gain his nefarious end , than just such a scheme of colonization to Africa ? ( Not to Hayti , nor Texas , nor Canada , for the too near proxnnity of black freedom might be dangerous to slavery ! ) And in the execution of such a plan , could the man abstain from any moral interference with the claims of the masters more completely than the Society ' has done ? He must necessarily speak of slavery as an ei-il  --  must show , in stubborn arithmetic , the rapid and dangerous increase of the slaves  --  must depict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do every thing short of charging downright guilt upon the infatuated masters , in order to awaken them to a prudent regard for their own safety . If then the American Colonization Soeiely does not design ( and I should have to confess my own guilt before I could charge its non-slave-holding members with au such design ) to perpetuate slavery , its friends must reflect , that its plan , as to all its practical features , so exactly comports with such a design , and , as to all its collateral results , is so little inconsistent with it , that its motives are fairly exposed to impeachment by those who are prone to judge of the tree b ' ' its fruit  --  greenish though it may be . Shall the Society defend itself triumphantly against this argument , by showing the opposition it meets with from the great majority of slave-holders ? This opposition is exactly what might be expected . Why do slave-holders oppose the Society ? Not , surely , because the action of the Society affects injuriously any of their claims , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive to be benevolent . They well know that the Society ought to be hostile to slavery , and they fear that at some time or other it may be  --  tim.ent Danaos etiam dona ferentes  --  they fear that the Society , when it sees the utter inefficiency  --  rather the mischievous reaction  - -  of its plan , will abandon it , and resort to aggressive measures  --  and there ought to be sufficient reason for this fear . Therefore , the opposition of slave-holders , on account of the motive , no more proves ( by the rule of contraries ) the tendency to be good ; than the opposition of some good men , on account of the tendency proves the motive to be bad . If good men advocate " plans of bad tendency , how can they fail to place themselves between two ranks of opponents ? Can they plead persecution for righteousness sake on both /z/ sides ? Manifestly unsubstantial as this defence is thus found to be , it must be said , in truth , that the colonizationists have rallied behind it as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of it , 1 would fain spare them a rock or two from the fortifications of abolitionism , just to save them the mortiticaliou of being taken behind a breast-work , which proves itself too weak to stand alone . Glory is not to be found in routing an enemy from such a fort of straw . Again , colonization , as a remedial plan , is subject to no slight objection , in regard to its action upon the character of those who apply it . I speak now , more especially , of the Colonization Society , as composed of non-slave-holding men . There pervades the whole community , a strong prejudice against the colored race . ( If there were any doubt of this , it would only change my argument to the " ad homineni foim . ) The Societj ' , not only acknowledges the existence of such a prejudice , but it pronounces it unconquerable . It asserts , without reserve , that this prejudice is sufficient forever to prevent the blacks from rising to . an equality with the whites , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never can do for them here , " in this land of Bibles , " what it can do on a heathen shore . " Now this could not be true , if there were left exempt from this prejudice a body of men so powerful as the Colonization Society . Moreover , the prejudice is certainly wicked , for it counteracts the Gospel . Therefore the Colonization Society , in applying its remedy for slavery , himors its own tcicked jirejudicc . In what light is a remedy to be regarded , which , while it has no chance of curing the evil for which it was intended , absolutely poisons the person who administers it 1 How useless the charge , " be ye clean tha t bear the vessels of the Lord , " if reformers may leave their own breasts polluted with an unholy prejudice  --  a palpable unwillingness to obey the fundamental law of Christian brotherhood ? Is this " the best that can be done in the case ? " Wo , then , to the world , in . spite of infinite wisdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Calvary was wasted , and hell is triumphant ! ! In view of this subject I must be permitted solemnly to say , that I do confess my own guilt , in the cold and cruel prejudice with which I have suttered myself , in time past , to advocate the unchristian principles and the mischievous plans , of the American Colonization Society . If there are men of pure benevolence , who have in the sincerity of their hearts sought to do good , and made this Society the channel of their liberality , let them be aware that such night-born as theirs can prove its genuineness only by welcoming the light that now begins to shine , and shrinking with horror from the unholy company with which the morning finds it unconsciously proceeding . I have all along taken it for granted that the motive of the Society is good . I have not questioned the benevolence of its officers , nor the sincerity of their expressed wish to remove slavery . But 1 might have taken stronger ground . A majority of the Society , at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special care to have it understood that they did not renounce /z/ the sin  --  thai they considered the right of the master sacrtd ! At6 , from year to year , they have assured their southern friends that the Society has not chanjed its character . Now the character of any Society  --  its motive  --  is to be judged of , so far as man can judge of motive , from the majority , the ruhng influence of its board of managers . This majority has been , and is slave-holding ; it is therefore impossible for us to concede to them purity of motive in this thing . Their own practice condemns them . Are thei/ holding on , and waiting for the growth of Liberia ? Then the right of a man to his liberty , depends upon the contingency of a foot-hold for him 4000 miles off !  --  a doctrine as damnable as it is absurd . What ! does the Society apply to itself , as " the best the case admits , " the same remedy , which , on the plea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large ? Verily this must be a new and improved kind of repentance . The recipe for it might run thus . First , fortify yourself in sin , so that there shall be no hope of your yielding to the demands of God 's law ; then make your own terms  --  repent and repair to suit your own convenience , and all will be well ! We protest against making a combination of such men , the almoners of our charity to Africa , and much more , to the Africo Americans  - -  our own countrymen . We hold their professions of philanthropy , as cheap as we do those of the Grand Turk . The saying is no less true than trite , that a good cause is not to blame , because some patronise it with bad motives . Nor is it less true , that a bad causecannot be justified because many patronise it with good motives . No scheme arising out of that miscalled morality , which apologizes for slavery , can ekher be right of itself , or be made so by the patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven . It is ranifest from the condurA of the members , that the molive of the Society , in its operative and responsible capacity , can be nothing better than to escape the righteous curse of God , in some other way than by a direct repentance , confession , and reparation of injury  --  the only way which he has appointed . How can the Church of God withhold Its protest against this palpable subversion of the first principles of the Gospel ? /z/ In the former chapter I have spoken of the colonization scheme in its relation to the crime of slave-holding . In this I propose , very briefly , to consider its bearing on the free people of color , the ostensible objects of its charity . This is necessary , because some who acknowledge that the Society is worse than useless in regard to slavery , contend that it confers invaluable blessings upon the free /z/ people of color . They would balance the Society 's benefits against Its " defects , " as they are pleased to call them . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing the fallacy of this pretension , and also of that which is maintained in regard to Africa . These United States have been boasted of as the asylum of the oppressed of all nations . And , in many points of view , there is not a more desirable retreat on the globe for the victims of poverty or persecution . The population is yet sparse , the soil is fruitful , the rivers , and forests , and mines , present infinite resources for the acquisition of wealth , the climate is salubrious , the means of education are widely diffused , the laws are mild and equitably administered , property is secure , both from private and public spoliation , the rights of conscience are most fully guaranteed , and most eflfcctually guarded by the jealousy of rival sects ; in short , there is no country on earth , where a man can reap more fruit of his own honest labor , nor where he can enjoy it with less interference on the part of others . Even if a man were to possess none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of its laws with more security than he could feel in any other nation under the sun . It would seem , from the very nature of our government , that it must always be peculiarly the friend of the poor , for by all its usages and laws it frowns on aristocracy . It would seem , then , that there must be some very strong reason , when it is proposed to colonize back to the old world , over a thousand weary leagues of ocean , 400,000 of our fellow citizens  --  aye , more than 2,000,000 who " of right ought to be " so . Are they poor 1 Here is the place of all the world to enrich them . Are they ignorant ? Here is the place to enlighten them . Are they vicious ? Here is the place to reform them . Are they unrighteously despised ? Here is the place , if any where , to bring popular prejudice into subjection to the dictates of humanity and religion . The reason why all these things can not be done here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are despised and ridiculed , because they are black . They are in most states denied every civil franchise because they are black . They are told , ( by a Society embodying the benevolence of the land , ) that they can never rise here , and must be colonized to Africa , because they are black . That is to say , on account of the single circumstance of dissirnilarity in. external appearance , which marks them as brethren of the slaves , the slave-holding spirit in our land holds them at a distance , refuses to communicate to them any of the privileges and responsibilities of our free society , and denies them those means of instruction which are requisite to bring them upon the same moral and intellectual level with ourselves . Now it is undeniable that the color of the negroes does distinguish them from the pale race of Europe . But the distinction , so far as divine Providence is concerned , is merely one of externals . It ought to stop here ; The negroes are none the less men , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If their right to a residence here , and to all the sympathies and aids which their condition demands , is abridged by their blackness , then /z/ ours depends upon our whiteness  --  that is to say , our boasted , inalienable , indefeasible rights , lie skin-deep  --  they reside in the coloring matter of the external integuments !  --  they are just as inalienable and indefeasible as our hides , and no more . Wo to them , if our bare backs were once exposed to a nine-lashed slave whip ! Intolerable as is thb doctrine , which leads so directly to these contemptible inferences , it is , nevertheless , held by a large portion of our citizens . There are plenty of respectable persons who will not blush to say , that Providence never designed black and white men to live together on equal terms in the same republic . And what is remarkable , the voice of humanity has hardly ventured to speak against such wickedness . Why , one would think that the man who , in this land , should utter such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to avail himself of his own littleness , to escape the commingled hisses of scorn which such a doctrine would certainly call forth . But so it is not . iVIen who would have us think their worth lies more than skin deep , deliver this paltry nonsense with the most oracular gravity . And the consequence is , that the poor blacks are degraded and down-trodden . They are robbed and wounded , and thrown out to welter , and fester , and rot in the public highway  - -  and the priests and levites pass by on the other side . Yes , among all our benevolent efforts , for the Indian upon our frontier , and the far-olF Hindoo  --  for the sailor of the ocean , and the boatman of the river  --  efforts worthy to be increased a thousand fold  --  we have forgotten the stranger , who , having fallen among thieves in the midst of us , has at length iDeen left stripped and helpless , a present and urgent provocation to our charity . We have not engaged in any general and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , in spite of our prejudice and apathy , they have generally demeaned themselves among us , as quiet , industrious and useful citizens . With more motives to hate us , and less to submit to our laws , they have , beyond all question , been guilty of fewer crimes , than an equal number of the most ignorant of the whites . They have attached themselves to our country , with a patriotism , as ardent as it is unquestionably genuine . Just now a Society comes forward , and says to these wronged and insulted , but patient men , There is a prejudice against you in this land , which can never be overcome . If you re.main here , you must ever remain a distinct and degraded class . Even religion can not help you here . But emigrate to the coast of Africa , and you may form a nation by yourselves ; there , you may , enjoy the rights which are denied you here ; there , you will be rid of that sense of inferiority , which binds you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and have strong motives to exert yourselves in the pursuit of wealth and honor , which you can never have here . And the whole community of whites , with all their wisdom , and piety , and disinterested benevolence , so called , second the proposal ; and exhort the Society to go forward and aim at the removal of the entire black population  --  loiih their free conxent , to be sure  --  while not a finger is raised to help them here  --  not even a syllable is lisped against the unrighteous laws which are grinding them in the dust , /z/ or banishing them from their homes  --  hunting them from state to state ! Patrons of the Colonization Society ! you form a body sufficiently powerful to wage a successful war with this popular prejudice . You may procure the repeal of every oppressive law , if you please ; you may open the door to fair competition in all the arts of life before the colored race , and persuade them to enter it , if you please ; you may bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please . Do that ; at least , attempt it , before you claim benevolence as the motive of your colonizing scheme . Till you have made the attempt , whatever may be said of the African skin , it has never been used to conceal hypocrisy , so loathsome and putrifying as yours , if , haply , you yourselves are not the victims of a miserable delusion . It grieves me to the heart to bring charges of this kind , which I have reason to believe will be appropriated to themselves  - -  and too justly  --  by many , whom , in other things , I respect and love . But facts are stubborn , and the principles of God 's word , are unbending . Even if an angel from heaven were to embark on the principles which the Colonization Society has avowed , in regard to the free blacks , he would sink . Let us not be told that the colored men go voluntarily to Liberia . There is not Jesuitism enough in the world to conceal such a lie from any , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every colored man , at least , knows it very well , the white community , under the name of " The Colonization Society , " merely receive the volunteer emigrants  --  no compulsion  --  all fair ; but mark , the same community , without this 7iame , sanction the oppressive laws , utter the public sentiment , and point the finger of scorn , which , together , amount to a bitter persecution , and covifd the poor blacks to voluw teer . Wliat a convenient thing is a name , which can be put on and off at pleasure . Here is my poor neighbor , a simple , good-natured man , dwelling securely by me . I heartily despise him , and would gladly have him out of the way ; but how to do it , is the thing . The problem may be thus solved . In every-day life , I am Mr. Prejudice . Under this name , I tell lies about my neighbor , and make sport of him at the taverns and grog-shops ; 1 abuse and mortify him on all occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle , and refuse redress , till his life is a burden to him . But , on the Fourth of July , and some other great occasions , I am Mr. Generosity . I go to my neighbor with ray new name , and my best Sunday suit , and say to him , " You know Mr. Prejudice is very powerful in these parts ; he can not be resisted ; you had better emigrate , and if you will do so , I will generoushj bear the expense . If , in the simplicity of his heart , my neighbor mistakes me for a different man from his old enemy , my success is almost certain . If he does not , perseverance in this double dealing will wear out the most mulish pertinacity . That similar duplicity is justly chargeable upon the Colonization Society , is evident from the fact , that it not only does not condemn , but ithails with pleasure , those oppressive enactments which aredesign- /z/ ed to banish the colored race. * Is the conckisiveness of iliis.argumeut doubted ? Take an illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a spacious room , hung round with nameless furniture , into which curiosity is not permitted to pry . By the light of a single ta2ier , you may see the pale , half naked prisoner ; the monkish executioner , fiendishly busy ; the instruments of torture  --  the trickling blood  --  the quivering lip  --  the very anguish of the soul . But what has that man in black to do with the scene , who sits sedately by , and as he sees limb after limb stretched upon the rack , and screw after screw applied , and turned , and tightened to the bone , says to the executioners , " Take courage , brethren , we shall get the confession soon , " and to the prisoner , " Only confess now , and you will for ever bless God for his mercy on your soul ! " ? Say you , this ' flight to the inquisition is a flight of fancy ! Then let it go for that ; but , after all , in sober sense , how can the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to condemn that prejudice and oppression which render its interference necessary % Let the organs of the Society , at length , answer this question . Surely , it has been asked by friends , and asked by them in vain , till , in many cases , they have waked up in the ranks of the Society 's decided enemies . To put the case in the most favorable light , by the supposition that the sin of the legislators is , by the Society 's scheme , overruled for good , has the Society any right to rejoice at the sin ? Does not the divine justice condemn the sinner , and does not the divine compassion weep over him , even while the divine wisdom brings good out of his evil ? On the example of the Society , when we do evil from which good may be extracted , we have a right to calculate on the approbation of all those angels of mercy , at least , whose business it may be to bring glory to God out of the wickedness of men . On these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adjusted to the wicked prejudices of the community against the people of color , and , of course , that its action cherishes these prejudices to the injury of innocent men . But if the evils which hang around the colored American were irremediable here , it is still a forlorn alternative that the Society has to offer . Let us divest the colony of the poetry which is thrown over it so profusely by the advocates of the Society , in their public addresses , and see what remains . Let us suppose ourselves in the room of the emigrants , and see what inquiries would arise in our own minds . " Is not a temperate more favorable than a tropical sun to the health and mental development of man ? Is not the climate of Africa confessedly dangerous ' ? Is not the colony surrounded by jealous savages , always ready to shed blood , and who must be propitiated by a traffic in RUM ? Is not the prosperity of the colony regarded as extraordinary by all intelligent men ? What will its guarantee of protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if its incipient prosperity should call to it an unmanageable accession of unprincipled and ignorant men ? What if the Colonization Society  --  hoidd set down on the coast of Africa at once , the whole black + Sec Appendix , /z/ population , or even the yearly increase of it , or even the tenth part of that increase ? Under all the circumstances of the case , is it probable that in my own life , or that of my children we can enjoy there the privileges which , in spite of prejudice and pers.ecution , we enjoy here ? Is there not vastly more probability of a return to truth and righteousness of public sentiment in this christian land , than of the colony 's escaping the ten thousand evils to which a colony in such a situation is liable 1 Is not the risk of an African voyage something ? " Let history answer . These American colonies , planted under far more favorable circumstances , in regard to climate and the character of the colonists , had for a long time to struggle against fearful odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers can scarcely be imagined ; it defies calculation . Even after the colonies had been established , and had gained strength and opulence , they ran a feariul chance of becoming the vassals of a foreign power . What if , instead of being pious , learned , enterprising , the very cream of the English race , the first settlers of NewEngland had been from the lowest grade of society , driven off because they were a nuisance at home ? Where would have been the stern virtue to resist the numberless temptations that came upon them in their new abode ? Where the wisdom to impose upon themselves salutary restraints ? Where the moral courage to meet the many critical emergencies of their first fifty years ? Is not the success of these American colonies to be attributed , under God , to qualities moral and mental in the colonists , which , according to the Colonization Society , are not possessed by the colonists of Liberia , nor by any that are likely to be added to them ? Let it not be said that the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may now guide the tottering steps of the infant colony ; but it will be quite another thing to direct its energies , and repress its waywardness , when it shall have gained the physical power without the discretion of manhood . Successful sc/q/-government is a thing which can not be achieved by proxy . One of two things must take place ; either the colony must fall ( remain ? ) under trans-ocean vassalage , or it must be thrown completely upon its own discretion  --  upon they will of a people who are declared to be unfit even to be incorporated with an already existing and firmly established republic . In taking the testimony of history on this point , we must learn not only that great nations have arisen from small and almost hopeless beginnings , but we must also ascertain what proportion the cases of failure bear to those of success . History preserves every case of success of course ; but from the well known nature of the human mind , multitudes of failures are utterly forgotten . Yet every careful reader of history must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies its page or its chapter , scores of unsuccessful ones are dismissed in a sentence . Certainly it will not be considered remarkable in the year 1900 , to find such a paragraph as the following in a pretty elaborate history . " In the earlier part of the late century , a colony of Africo-Amer.icans , at the mouth of the St. Pauls , attracted much attention , and /z/ prospered to the extent of gaining a large territory and numerous A'illages ; but owing to the excessive desire of the white Americans to rid themselves of the descendants of Africa , it was overpeopled with ill-qualified emigrants and ruined . " I ask again , poetry apart , is there any thing in the rational pros* pects of Liberia to entice an intelligent and industrious colored man away from these enlightened shores , the home of his ancestors as well as ours , while a foothold is left for him ? Will he prefer the liberty/ of making a home and a government for himself , on a distant shore , in a sickly climate , to remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and a country already made ? It may be more than suspected that a chill would strike the hearts of those men , who , in such glowing rhetoric , recommend to the blacks emigration , if in a moment , by the blackening of their own skins , or the turning of the tables , they should themselves be exposed to the motives which they so vehemently urge upon others . In sober earnest , is it not essential and unmixed cruelty , to urge upon simple and ignorant men , such an arduous and hazardous enterprise ? The present boasted prosperity of the colony , may do well enough to grace a public parade , but it satisfies no intelligent man , of ultimate success  --  it makes no white man envious of the lot of his colored neighbor , ( if it did , doubtless the colony would be little secure from white intrusion , ) nor does it prove to any but the unreflecting , that the cause is righteous . It will be seen , that if these arguments have any force , they sperad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for raising the free people of color to refinement , intelligence , and religion  --  more favorable than this , the native land of most of them . That there are obstacles , and serious ones , in the way of effectual exertions for the colored people here , is not denied . But they are not physical ones . They are such as must be met in every good work . Let us compare them with some of those which will certainly exist in Liberia . To raise the character of a whole people , under the most favorable external circumstances , demands a profusely expended and long continued moral influence , the mass of the population must be brought within the full bearing of the Gospel : there must be not only a sufficient number of preachers but teachers of every grade ; there must be not only suns and moons , but innumerable stars . According to all past arremgements of divine Providence , the process of kindling up such a flood of light as is poured upon the most favored spots of Christendom , is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our community is to be sifted out , and to be insulated by heathenism , at the distance of 4000 miles , it is plain that we can furnish them , in consistency with the wants of the world , only a few living missionaries  --  a coal or two , a mere kindling spark . Whereas , here we may , if we please , open upon them at once , all the warmth and light of day . Is it replied , that what ought to be done , can be done ; that we can furnish every thousand - of the colonists with a living preacher of the gospel , and every /z/ hundred with a sclioolinasLer ? How much tuoie then cau we do it here ! for surely a man who can be persuaded by the love of souls , to encounter the pestilence of an African climate , can be persuaded , on the same principle , to encounter the prejudices of his fellow Christians . Let four hundred worthy ministers , and four thousand schoolmasters , in this land , rise up and assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gospel way , to their interests , and whatever prevents their elevation here , would be like the mists of the morning . The absurdity of making heathens* of 400,000 of our countrymen , for their own good , would then be seen in daylight . The special advantages of Africa , as a home for the free colored people , are claimed to be , that there he can enjoy the rights of citizenship , there he can have a voice in making the laws under which he is to live , there he will not be disheartened by a comparison of himself with his superior white neighbors . Place him on the shores of Africa with these advantages , and 3'ou make a new man of him  --  you draw out his latent energies  --  you make him willing and able to do all that can be expected of the most enlightened and Christian philanthropist in his circumstances . If , indeed , there is inherent in man , so strong a desire to be the " artificer of his own fortune , " as this argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted in a wilderness to occasion its full development ; what a surpassing pity it is , that the ignorant , the lazy , and the vicious  --  no trifling fraction of our white population  - -  cannot be colonized ? Under what discouragements do they not labor , when they see the wealth , and power , and intelligence of their more industrious and virtuous neighbors ?  --  from which they would doubtless be delivered , by being set down some where in Patagonia , CafFraria , or Arabia Felix , with provision for a year , and plenty of rum and gw/ipowder . I have supposed that it must be stern necessity which drives men in such a case to exertion , as it seems to have been in Botany Bay ; but I am mistaken  --  and the poor of England are mistaken too , or they would petition their government to transport them to Botany Bay , rather than accept a passage as the miserable alternative of hanging . The intelligence , superior art and wealth of the higher class of the community , in this and other free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class in the dust , repressing even the desire to rise . But place the poor alone , unrivalled , unexcelled , and they will at once become instinct with living ardor ! What new light has the wisdom of some men , employed in behalf of the oppressor , struck out from the obscuritj ' of human nature ! ! Again , if the right of suffrage will work such wonders as are attributed to it by the colonizing scheme , it is a thousand pities that in this country it should be shackled and restricted . Why not apply its elevating virtue to the whole of our own population ? Are there not hundreds , nay , thousands of white men in our country to * The reader will perhaps recollect Knickerbocker 's story of the honest Dutchman , who , for the sake of overleaping a small liUl , went back three miles to get a start ; but when he arrived at the foot of the hill , was obliged to lie down and rest before i ) erforming his wonderful feat . The story finds its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed ? And do not many of these men need elevating 1 Here is the motive by which they may be elevated . If the right of suffrage be so powerful a stimulant in a feeble , dependent , hand-to-mouth multitude of ignorant and ill-assorted men , thrown together by no agency of their own , on a barbarous coast , what would it not be in a long established , well regulated , opulent and Christian republic ? Yes , yes , on the ground of this argument for colonization , any friend of humanity , who can see deeper and feel deeper than the skin , might even venture to ask , why this elevating power is not applied to colored men here ? Sheer hypocrisy prevents it , says Truth . The men who bring this argument , are the very men who do not plead for the complete enfranchisement of the blacks here ; which clearly shows that their pretensions in this matter , are either so meanly subservient or so grossly inconsistent , that they are unworthy of a serious refutation . As the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so completely parted with common sense , that they do remarkably illustrate why the Bible calls the wicked fools . Here , then , 1 must reiterate the charge , that the Colonization Society , by holding out an unsubstantial , fatal lure , is seeking to banish from their country 4OO , U0O of our own native born fellow citizens , nay , to banish 2,400,000 . But there remains another charge ; The Colonization Society basely slanders the whole body of the free people of . color . It makes them a degraded , vicious , incurably besotted class , who not only never can rise , but never can be raised , and are properly to be got rid of as a nuisance . How would the welkin have rung with peals of indignation if such a charge had been uttered against any class of our white fellow citizens ? Even if it had been true , how would it have been represented as abusive and unchristian ? But no candid man needs to be told that against the free men of color the charge is false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as might be expected of necessarily poor and ignorant men , goaded by prejudice and persecution , much vice among them . They do not belong to that class of refined and innocent victims of oppression , which abound in novels , it iTiay be ; neither is their depravity sufficiently dignified to suit the lovers of romance ; but it is an ill-looking , everyday , matter-of-fact thing . They need the same moral discipline which is needed by any other portion of the community . But amidst all their faults there are redeeming qualities , which must put to shame every white man who has not lost the power to blush . No field in the world is richer in instances of stern moral courage , unbending decision of character , exact integrity , unassailable fidelity , self-sacrificing patriotism , ardent thirst for knowledge , disinterested benevolence , and unfeigned piety , than the history of our free colored brethren . Multitudes of them have risen spontaneously from the lowest depths of slavery , have bought their freedon:i by years of toil , have risen amidst unmeasurable reproach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their oppressors . Others have braved dccith for liberty , have been hunted from moun- /z/ tain to mountain , have been ferreted from city to city , by monsters attracted by the price set upon their heads , till at length they have foiled all the advantages of their pursuers , and have planted themselves as quiet and industrious citizens of our northern republics . Some of them have borne away the palm of genius , by their own unaided endeavors . As a class , they have moved steadily forward , till they have consummated a union , whose voice , by its dignity and manful energy , has arrested the attention , and called forth the admiration of the wise and good in both hemispheres . The defence , however , does not rest here ; the calumniatgr may be convicted out of his own mouth . No sooner has he taught the community of white men to regard their black brethren as an excrescence , a gangrene , an intolerable nuisance , to be removed at whatever expense , than , in marvellous consistency , he turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every one of them , he says , " will become a missionary to Africa , carrying with him credentials in the holy cause of civilization , religion , and free institutions . " * With the most dignified composure , he assures us that the same voyage which relieves our shores of a curse , lands an equal blessing upon the shores of Africa . Thus does the Society not only " kill two birds with one stone , " but it throws one and the same stone , at the same time , in opposite directions . It has made the important discovery , that ignorance and vice , which bid defiance to the concentrated force of Christianity , at home , when thrown upon a heathen shore , are the very leaven to produce Christianity . That is to say , Christianity can not convert and elevate 400,000 free blacks , in the most favorable circumstances , much less , then , can it convert Africa : but these 400,000 unconverted blacks can do it ; hence , they can do more for the cause of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to be best propagated by its vilest enemies . Most exquisite absurdity ! ! The Society is presented with this alternative  --  either to confess itself a calumniator , or give up its missionary pretensions . From this dilemma , there is no escape , except by the childish supposition , that some marvellous change takes place during the voyage to Liberia . The probability of a great change for the better , those will easily appreciate , who have themselves witnessed the effects of emigration . Had the absurd suppositions of the Society any existence , in fact , the world might probably be converted , not by the sacrifice of our comforts , but of our curses . Again , the Society presents the colony , as it now stands , as a proof of what may be done ( as soon as funds and the consent of the blacks themselves may be somehow obtained ) in regard tj all the free blacks of the land . But it is said that the morals of the Colonj ' - , are better than those of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the success of Liberia , to what may be done for all the free blacks , or it must allow that the morals of the colored people here , are as good as those of * Speech of Henry Clay . /z/ their oppressors , or , in other words , that it is a cakimniator . That is to say , if it has told the truth about Liberia , it has either convicted itself of a cakimny against the free blaclcs here , or of a falsehood , when it has pretended that their emigration could benefit Africa . From this net of its own making , the Society can come off clear only by showing that the Colonists , now settled in Liberia , were an ignorant , vicious , degraded set while here ; that they are now eminently the reverse , and that they became so in the very act of setting foot on the coast of Africa . It is hardly necessary to add , thai blushes and confessions could hardly make it plainer , than do these tortuosities of the Society , thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defamation against our brethren and countrymen , the free men of color . And who are the objects of all this abuse ? The strong , the proud , the haughty , the tyrannical ? No : they are the weak , the humble , the defenceless . Magnanimous work indeed for the educated , the refined , the pious , the dignitaries of every profession , to scour the country for the sake of reviling the poor in public harangues ! Such a work costs no sacrifice except that of conscience ; ( one which seems to have been made in the lump by the Colonization Society , ) and , to drop irony , it is as despicable as it is cheap . Virulent and persevering as this persecution has been , it is refreshing to every lover of his race , to know that it has failed of its object . With the exception of a few of the goaded and abused colored men of the South , who , as an English writer well remarks , " are glad to jump out ot the fryingpan into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberia  --  they have promptly negatived every offer to remove them ; have attached themselves more closely to the country , and have been stimulated to the most laudable endeavors , to educate their children and elevate themselves . The friends of the free people of color are not afraid to compare the proceedings of the general convention of that people , in Philadelphia , with those of any other body of men whatever . Compare them , candid reader , with the proceedings of any of the annual meetings of the American Colonization Society , and say if , laying aside all evidence but the authorized minutes , you would not judge the latter to be a combination of unprincipled demagogues , seeking under the guise of benevolence , to remove from our land a respectable class of industrious and peaceable citizens , who , in their united capacity , defended themselves with a firm dignity , and exposed the nsidious attacks of their enemies , in the fearless composure of persecuted honesty ? - /z/ I COME now to the Society 's last resort  --  its citadel when hotly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-slave-holding friends of the Society are , to a man , painfully conscious of a perpetual obscurity , like a Newfoundland fog , hanging around the point of the Society 's tendency to remove slavery . Not even the figures , that are so often pompously paraded to show what may be done , can clear it away . Both the how , and the lohen , are beyond the reach of figures . The consummation so devoutly to be wished for , is a semper fugiens , to the Colonization Society , more evanescent than the silver cups at the end of the rainbow , and which leaves the silly arithmetician out of breath , and bewildered in his own pursuit . This , evidently , is not the aspect of the Society on which its friends like best to dwell . Nor is it less sure that they feel considerable embarrassment , in regard to its action on the free colored people . Especially is this true , if they happen to be well acquainted with colored men , and to know , as in this case they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent regard , and every neighborly kindness , must be withholden , except on the express condition of going to Liberia . Men , who have a drop of the milk of human kindness in them , can not but have some misgivings when they act with a Society , which , to secure its object , is obliged to applaud , or at least not to disapprove , the most iniquitous legal enact ments . This again is a point which they are willing enough to have passed by . But , after all , the plan is adapted to benefit Africa . 1st . It will introduce Christianity there . Even here , much olurity beclouds the how ? The Society does not very sedulously explain the precise adaptation of the means to the end ; it does not show hoio the spark at Liberia , so singularly feeble , is to kindle to a blaze , a mass so singularly incombustible as the population of Africa . The material proposition that it will , is taken for granted . And as Africa and its geography have scarcely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty to portray , in her own colors , the triumphs of the Gospel as it spreads from tribe to tribe , carrying the blessings of civilization in its train . Errant fancy threads the Niger , traverses the desert , climbs the mountains of the moon , and every where ; her enchanted eyes rest on cities , villages , and rural dwellings , people ' by regenerated , enlightened and Christian men  --  ? nd all th 's , from the Societj ' ' colony . He who would spoil such a aream , by obtruding upon it the unwelcome inquiries of common sense , is very gravely called upon to lay his hand upon his heart , iuid ansv/er to his Maker for such gratuitous mischief ! Nevertheless , some plain inquiries must be urged , in behalf of 2,000,000 of slaves , whose rights are kept in abeyance , and in behalf of 400,000 freemen , who are being sacrificed in detail for the /z/ sake of this mighty experiment on Africa . The equivocal character of the colonists has already been spoken of But supposing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony adapted to christianize a savage people ? If there is any example of this kind on record , there are advocates of the Society sufficiently profound in history to lay the finger upon it . Why have they not done so ? The familiar examples with which we are acquainted , certainly look in a different direction . What colonies in the universe should produce this result , if not those of New-England ? Some of them received their charters for the express purpose of benefittmg the aborigines . Many of their ministers were devoted missionaries , who labored and prayed without ceasing for the conversion of the Indians . Brit , as we well know , their efforts were thwarted , and almost nullified , by the proximity of the white settlements . The superior skill in trade , of the foreigners , awakened the jealousy of the natives . Wars were the consequence , of which we know the disastrous res'ilt . To be brief , the history of Christianity most clearly teaches us , that no colony can benefit ignorant and savage men , till it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not only to be honest , but to be so " in the sight of all men , " and to abstain totally from Avar and ardent spirits . This is not true in regard to the colony at Liberia , nor can it be expected to be , on the plan of the Society . We are told of a brisk and successful trade with the natives in trinkets , powder and shot , and RUM , and that many of the colonists ate growing rich by it No matter whether this is authorized by the Society or not , we are told that it can not be frevented  --  not even thesellingof rum . Wluit would become of any Christian mission , and what of the heathen around it , if its members could not be prevented from selling rw.  --  j ?  - -  if they enriched themselves by dealing in trinkets ?  --  if they not only ibid the materials of war , but had their mission house fortified with deadly ordnance ? What would become of their claim to benevolence ? Why , such a missio ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse  --  - the very worst obstacle that the devil could throw in the way of the Gospel chariot . The blessed Saviour , who came into this world , " not to do his own will , " is impiously outraged by any such proceedings in his name . Would he , think you . Christian reader , have stood in that fort , where the first colonist repelled a host of savage assailants , adjusting , loading , aiming , and applying the match to that artillery which spent its deadly force on compact masses of living human fiesh ? No , he never would have built a fort . It was his practice , and that of his followers , to gain the confidence of men by showing confidence in them . He never asked for his disciples the protection of hell 's engines of murder . Whenever they have asked it , he has withdrawn from them both his sword and his shield , and they have ceased to be victorious in his warfare . Alas ! poor Africa ! Was it not enough that Christian robbers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdering the grandsire , the mother , and the suckling together , and leav- /z/ ing the ashes ol " their dwelling , reeking in their innoronl blood ?  --  - Was it not enough that they should utter to thy parched lips the scalding beverage of devils , turning thy peaceful villages into scenes of murderous riot , and poisoning thy domestic bliss with universal suspicion and fear of treachery ? Must Christian missionaries , in their first attempt to redress thy wrongs , bring with them the same blood-stained weapons  --  the same infernal drink ? But 1 can not proceed  --  my heart is pained  --  that first African blood  --  nay , fresher blood than that , is crying , like Abel 's , in the ears of eternal justice . The colony was stained with blood in its infancy  --  shall it proceed ? Shall it grow up a murderer ? No , says the voice of heaven-born charity , let it die a thousand deaths , rather than shed another drop of fraternal blood ! ! Let it throw away its carnal weapons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extend its naked hand in fraternal afi'ection , in the spirit of evangelic martyrdom , or else let American Christians renounce the pretence of christianizing Africa by its means . The very reason assigned by the Society , why the colored men can not be elevated and evangelized here , is , that there exists an invincible antipathy , prejudice , and hatred , against them in the breasts of the whites  --  or , in other words , that the whites are so wickedly proud , and the blacks are sb wickedly degraded in consequence of it , that the Gospel can not act . And what is the tendency of that gainful traffic in poison , of that fort on the cape , with its powder and balls , and guns , and martial array , if it be not to raise up the same hostile prejudice there ? Will a mere similarity of color neutralize this adverse influence ? Will a few feeble rays of instruction , addressed to those savages , make a deeper impression upon their minds , than the bullets shot through the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian country , a pestilence , antagonist to the life of the Gospel . Along with the Gospel , shall we inoculate the nations with this pestilence , which we may be sure , from their deep depravity , and a hundred experiments , will grow to the entire exclusion of the living principle ? Why , in sober earnest , the colony is the most serious hindrance of the Gospel on the African coast . If the Christian church wishes to blot out the hopes of the heathen , let it carry every where the worldly principles of nominal Christianity along with its " worldly gear . " 2d . The Colonization Society is claimed to benefit Africa , by its tendency to destroy the slave trade . The first ground of this claim , is its alleged tendency to christianize Africa , which I have already considered . Secondly , the Colony does now defend a number of miles of coast from the slave traders , from which the traffic is entirely excluded ; ( the matter is far enough from being proved , ) hence , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , the trade would be broken up , finished , annihilated . What simplicity ! It reminds me of the scenes of childhood , when a number of ingenious babies of us , formed the design of damming a certain small brook , with a view to catch the fish , as the water below the dam forsook them . It was manifest that a single sod thrown in stopped the water in that place , so we calculated on the certainty of stopping /z/ the whole with a sufficient number of sods . But how sadly were we disappointed when , a fine dam being built , before the water had time to recede beneath , that from above came pouring over with fresh impetuosity . The disappointment taught us that damming a stream is not the way to dry it up . A little of the Infant School philosophy , which was then less rife than now-a-days , would have taught us that water runs by virtue of an attraction , and that , if we could have found the means to destroy this attraction , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In regard to that wide stream of human wo , the slave traffic , in which the Colonization Society , in the simplicity of perpetual babyhood , is always dabbling , the attraction may be removed . It lies within the reach of human agency . It lies in the price paid for human cattle ! Abolish slavery ; make it penal to hold human beings as property , and you stop the traffic henceforth and for ever . It is the market which calls the supplies . What ! do we hold slaves at home  --  bu ' and sell them as things , drive them in herds from state to state , work and feed and lodge them as beasts , and yet wonder that they are brought to us across the ocean for sale ? What boots it , to brandish the sword of justice in one hand , while we hold out the golden bribe in the other ? As there must be perpetual fluctuations in the demand for labor , wherever labor is supplied by slaveiy , there must be a slave trade . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at home . It would separate husbands and wives , parents and children , and open every where fresh sluices of unutterable wo . Nay , in one horrible particular , the domestic outdoes the foreign traffic : we do not learn that it is common for African fathers to sell their own children , but it is quite common for a planter , in one of our southern stales to sell his own offspring  --  even after the most solemn promises to the sable mother that such a thing should never be done ! ! It may even be questioned whether this miserably inconsistent opposition of the foreign traffic , has not increased the evil . In spite of the cruisers , the market has been svpjilied . This is all that would Imve been done at any rate . But to effect this the slaves have been the more cruelly " packed " and hundreds have been thrown overboard in chains , when the slaver was pressed with pursuit . I merely suggest this consideration to those who wish us to treat the subject of slavery with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , while they are making pictures of slave ships , stowed to the full , and rattling African slave chains from every pulpit . Consistency is a jewel . Let it not be understood that I oppose the calling of the foreign traffic piracy , or the measures taken to drive this piracy from the ocean . This ought ye to have done , but by no means to have left the other undone . If the trader is a pirate , the lolder is a felon , and should be called so . I was just closing this chapter , when I heard some one atk , ( it eemed to be a female voice , ) but do we not restore to Africa her ong lost children ? No , kind madam , &.; figure of speech has de'ived us here . Africa , when stripped of its personification , is mere /z/ inanimate rock and soil  --  and some of that very sandy  --  which hag never had any right of property in the men who have inhabited it , much less in their descendants born on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , every man belongs to himself . Every man owns himself as much as he owns his horse or his watch . If a thief should take your watch and retain it a long time , would you not think it a strange restitution , if he refused to restore it to you except on the spot where your grandmother was born ; perhaps a thousand miles oil ' ? Again , if we must hold to the figure , and restore to Africa her children , why not to Europe , hers 1 Would they be any more welcome in one case than in the other ? Would an armed colony of Europe 's children , on the coast of France , or England , planted there expressly to introduce a new order of things , excite more jealousy , than will an armed colony of Africa 's children , on the slave coast ? And more , if Africa is to have her children , and Europe hers , what is to become of America 's children ? This subject is capable of a much clearer development ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the benefit to Africa is exactly what might be expected of a robber holding to his /z/ Since I have shown so little respect for a scheme considered by the bulk of the Christian community , as the last resort , and the only hope against the system of slavery , it may be expected that 1 should point out something better . The expectation is reasonable and shall not be disappointed . Under the government of God , as exhibited in this world , there is bitt one remedy for sin , and that is available only by a repentance , evidenced by reformation . There is no such thing as holding on to sin with safety . It is not only to be renounced , but the very occasions of it are to be avoided at whatever sacrifice . If thy right hand cause thee to oflTend , cut it off "  --  if thy right eye , pluck it out . The dearest human relationships are to be broken through when they interfere with the relation which a man bears to God , and through him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might naturally expect that the entire agency which God has provided to reclaim the world should be adapted to " xoAwcG immediate repentance . It certainly is so , if we take the testimony of the Bible . When the Apostle of the Gentiles attacked idolatry , he said , " The times of this ignorance God winked at , ( that is , used no special agency to prevent it , ) but now commandeth all men every where to /z/ repent . The living ministry , instituted by the author of Christianity , and propagated from age to age , was designed to reform and save the world by preaching repentance  --  immediate , thorough repentance . When it gives up this message , whatever other means it may use , it does anything but reclaim men from sin . Throughout all the recorded messages of God to men , he expresses the utmost abhorrence of sin  --  there is no compassionate promise even , which is not based upon the condition that sin be forsaken as an abominable evil . The entire and total wickedness of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposition of Gospel grace . Those men who are so excessively cautious not to disturb prejudice , who would remove sin while the wicked are asleep , stealing around the bed and effecting a reformation beforehand , so that the sinner may repent at his leisure without hindrance when he wakes , derive their authority elsewhere than from the word of God , as indeed they must derive their hope of success elsewhere than from the natural history of man . The doctrine of the immediate abolition of slavery asks no better authority than is offered by scripture . It is in perfect harmony with the letter and spirit of God 's word . The doctrine may be thus briefly stated . It is the duty of the holders of slaves immediately to restore to them their liberty , and to extend to them the full protection of law , as well as its control . It is their duty equitably to restore to them those profits of their labor , which have been wickedly wrested away , especially by giving them that moral and mental instruciion  --  that education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing . It is their duty to employ them as voluntary laborers , on equitable wages . Also , it is the duty of all men to proclaim this doctrine  --  to urge upon slave-holders immediate eviancipation so long as there is a slave  --  to agitate the consciences of tyrants , so long as there is a tyrant on the globe . Though this doctrine does not depend , in regard to the slaveholder , upon the safety of immediate emancipation , nor , in regard to the non-slave-holder , on the prospect of accomplishing any abolition at all , but upon the commands of God , yet I shall attempt to establish it upon those lower grounds . I am willing to rest the cause on the truth of the following propositions . 1 . The instant abolition of the whole slave system is safe , and the substitution of a free labor sj'stem is safe , practicable and profitable . 2 . The firm expression of an enlightened public opinion , on the part of non-slave-holders , in favor of instant abolition , is an effectual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever . 1 . Immediate abolition is safe . Were I speaking to a Christian public , who believed half they professed , I would not insult them by a labored argument on this point . It would be enough to have shown that emancipation is the duty of slave-holders , to arouse these Christians to plead the cause /z/ of the oppressed , even at the peril of dungeons and gibbets . But the Christians of this age , must have not only a " thus saith the Lord , " but a guarantee  --  safe as a real estate mortgage  --  that the performance of the duty shall not injuriously affect certain temporalities , which , taken together , little and great , are supposed to make up the public weal . No matter how many millions writhe in the last distress , the public safety is the paramount claim , the supreme law . And of this public safety  --  not God , but the public , is to be judge . With a thorough going Christian of the apostolic school , whatever is right , is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strainer and camel swallower , " nothing is right , which can not be wire-drawn through his own apprehension of expediency . For the special benefit of such , I proceed lo this argument . The immediate abolition of slavery is safe , because , without giving to the slaves any motives to injure their masters , it would take away from them the very strong ones which they now have . Why does the white mother quake at the rustling of h , leaf ? Why , but that she is conscious that there are those around her , who have been deeply enough provoked to imbrue their hands in her blood , and in that of the tender infant at her breast ? And this , while all is cringing servility around her  --  while every want is anticipated , and the most menial services are perfonned with apparent delight . But well she knows that it is a counterfeited delight . Well enough she knows , that were she subjected to the same degradation to which she subjects others , vengeance would fire her heart , and seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instincts of animal nature cry out , that oppression is dangerous . The natural history of man cries out , that there is a point , beyond which endurance would be miraculous . But the slaves are now , not only under the motives common to humanity , to throw off their 3'Oke , but they are urged on by the boasts and taunts of their masters . They must either yield up every pretension to manhood , and contentedly think themselves brutes , or they must apply to themselves , and be aroused to action , by those panegyrics on liberty , and that proud contempt of slavery , which meet them on every side . No matter how many laws may be thrown around the slave to keep out every ray of knowledge  --  yon may prevent the knowledge of letters  --  you may withhold the book of God , and every other printed book  --  but yon can no more shut out a knowledge of the fundamental propositions of human rights , by laws  --  you can no more shut out the spirit of liberty , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tO'Shine , or the rain not to fall . The masters , in all their movements , their celebrations , their elections , their orations and conversations , on all occasions  --  are living and breathing sermons lo the slaves , on the value of liberty . Does a tyrant , as for example the autocrat of all the Russias , who wishes to keep all his subjects quiet , harangue , m their hearing , on the value of his own liberty to do as he pleases  --  loes he contemn those who have the meanness to submit to his despotism ? Or , does he /z/ speak of his love for his people , as having induced him to take this course or that ?  --  and attribute all his actions to an ardent devotion to the public weal ? Manifestly , the latter . Why , you might as well think of keeping*powder for ever amidst the sparks in a blacksmith 's shop , as of keeping slaves forever in such a republic as ours . It is said , and with evident truth  --  educate the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of this , and alarmed at some feeble individual attempts to communicate knowledge to the slaves , as if the universal prejudice and despotic power of the individual masters were not sufficient to repress the evil , have enacted LAWS AGAINST TEACHING THE SLAVES TO READ . This is a mOSt capital blunder . It gives ominous pledge , that such tyranny as theirs is soon to be swept from the face of the earth . Had they let the matter alone , or had they made laws in favor of educating slaves , about as operative as the school laws of some of the states , the effectual degree of ignorance might have been secured . But they have , in effect , taught the slaves , in language which they can understand , what letters are good for  --  what printed books can do for men . And there will now be a desire to learn letters , and to read printed books , which the inquisitorial power and skill of all the popes could not repress . It might as well be expected to keep the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of printed books from reaching the slave population . There is another very striking point of view in which these movements may be regarded . So long as the slaves are left entirely to the control of individual masters , some kind and lenient , freeing now and then a slave , and promising frdom to others , and exercising a sort of patriarchal authority , while others are , each in his own way , more harsh and severe , the unity of the slaves , as a body , is broken . They have no common cause . Every conspiracy will be detected early , by means of those who , being kindly treated , have a blind attachment to their masters . But these legislative enactments are a common oppression . They form the slaves into a single body , give them a common interest , and break the claim of individual kindness , as well as attach , in the view of the slaves , an immeasurable importance to a knowledge of letters . Go on , then , tyrants  --  connect into one mine the explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure  --  lay trains of the best fulminating mixtures , and wait for the spark , or the blow that is to annihilate you . Already have your abused , outraged vassals such motives to rid themselves of your yoke , that your knees smite together in spite of the boasted stoutness of your hearts . Go on , then , refuse to emancipate , add insult to injury  --  add stings to desperation  --  make death easier than bondage  --  for , in so doing , you assuredly hasten the day , when the American bill of rights shall mean what it says . But if , you recod at the prospect  --  if sanity has not yet bid adieu to your heads , and the milk of human kindness is not quite dried up from your breasts  --  look at the other side , Immediate emancipation /z/ would reverse the picture . It would place a motive to love you m the room of every one which now urges the slaves to hate you . They would then become , for you well know how grateful they are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderers . The law which now represses their crimes , would then more effectualy secure their good behavior , not being counteracted by the exasperating influence of individual irresponsible oppression . Your fields which now lie sterile , or produxe but half a crop , because the whip of the driver , although it may secure its motion , can not give force to the negro 's hoe , would then smile beneath the plough of the freeman  --  the genial influence of just and equitable wages . Mark , that I say nothing of the amount of human happiness which might be reared by Christian instruction on this ground of justice , mercy and ertiial rights applied to 2,000,000 of men . Your own estates would be worth double the cash . The capital which you have expended in slaves  --  scarcely less than the value of your land  --  is sunk ; for your slave labor after all costs more than free . And , besides , the waste arising from involuntary labor is prodigious . Make all labor free , and the purchaser can afford to , pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and slaves together . Even in a pecuniary point of view the change from the slave to the free labor system would be profitable , and that upon your own comparison . * Do you say these are idle speculations of men who know nothing of facts  --  the dreams of visionary enthusiasts ? Do you say the remedy would be worse than the disease ?  --  that violence , rapine , murder  --  nay , universal massacre , would be the consequence of universal , immediate emancipation ? Gentlemen , you mistake ws much and our argument more . We are matter-of-fact people , and on the ground of well attested , unmagnified , undistorted facts , we defy jou . Show us the stain of a single drop of any master 's blood shed by an emancipated slave ! Why silent ? Why dumb ? Why no motion of the finger 1  --  Do you at length venture to point us to St. Domingo 1 It is too late . We have a better edition of the history of St. Domingo than j-ours , and one which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Domingo was due either to the civil wars which preceded the act of emancipation , or to the unrighteous attempt of the French to reduce the negros to slavery after they had quietly enjoyed their liberty for several years . Not one drop of it was shed by that act which in a moment made 500,000 freemen of as many slaves . Nay , it is testified by French proprietors themselves , that the negros , without a known exception , went directly to work for their former masters , on wages  --  and even without wages or overseers they quietly cultivated those plantations which had been deserted by the whites . St ; Domingo is a blazing beacon in favor of instant abolition , and against that monstrous infatuation and fiendish cruelty , which would attempt to repress the upward tendencies of the human soul by brute force . /z/ In the French colonies of Guadaloupe and Cayenne , the slaves were liberated at once and with the same safety . Mexico made her slaves free at a blow  --  but with the galling drawback that the masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have heard of no evil consequences . Large bodies of slaves were einancipated at once , in Colombia , during the revolution  --  no blood was shed but that of the enemies of the republic . There are 600,000 enfranchised Africans in Brazil , diffused throughout the body politic , enjoying its honors as well as doing its labors  --  who are respected and happy  --  no blood shed . In the colonies of Sierra Leone and Liberia , it is notorious that considerable bodies of emancipated slaves have been incorporated into regular governments  --  and under very unfavorable circumstances . I might fill a volume with instances , but I repeat it , we are not only matter-of-fact people , but we enjoy a complete monopoly of facts ; that is to say , of all past facts , for of the future we say nothing any more positively than we would predict the sun 's rising tomorrow . We would speak modestly here , and say , that inasmuch as the sun always has risen once in twenty-four hours , the probability i  --  , to our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt our prediction who please . Just this and nothing more we would say in favor of immediate , unprepared-for emancipation . We knov ) it always has been safe , and we confidently expect it will always be so . If such emancipations as I have referred to , in most or all of which justice was hampered and partial , were safe and happy , 1 beg to be told whether a complete and magnanimous act of justice on the part of our country , by which the slaves should be placed under the equitable government and firm protection of law , and by which the balm of our disabused bill of rights , should be applied to their lacerated feelings , would result in ruthless violence and butchery ! He who can be persuaded of any such thing  --  nay , he who can fancy it , must be something else than a natural fool  --  he must have been stultified by inoculation . Holders of stolen men ! do you still point us to the degraded free blacks of the South , and say they are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We appeal to yourselves whether there be any suffering even unto death which you would not endure rather than be slaves  --  rather than to he fed and fattened slaves  - -  rather than to wear a single link of the slave 's chain  --  rather than to submit to slavery even in the abstract principle , apart from all matters of reality . But granting the assertion to express a fact . You are not the men to plead it . You have made this fact with your own blood-stained hands  --  made it for the very purpose of disparaging the slave 's freedom in the view of the slave , and the view of the world ! This shall be proved from your own lips . J. A. M'Kinney , Esq. , says , " Let them the free blacks be maltreated ever so much , the law gives them no redress unless some white person happens to be present to be a witness in the case . If they acquire /z/ uvfoperty , they hold it by courtesy of every vap:abond in the country ; and sooner or later are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if it were true , that the free black at the South is more miserable than the slave ? It would be no argument against that sort of emancipation for which we plead . We plead for no turning loose , no exile , no kicking out of house and home , but for complete and hearty justice . Justice requires that the masters who have shut out the light of knowledge from their slaves , should now freely communicate it ; that they should follow up their acts of emancipation by giving employmcmt and affording the means of education . A wise and vigorous system of free labor and of primary instruction , should be immediately erected on the dark pile of oppression , which we urge them instantly to demolish . Nothing like this has been done heretofore , either at the South or the North , on any extensive and liberal scale . Ts it a wonder then , that these poor enslaved men , when thus turned adrift , have in so many instances missed the path of moral and mental improvement ? Is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , deeper in vice than we find them ? We hold the masters bound , individually and in the aggregate , first to LIBERATE and then to enlighten the immortal minds that have been abused and debased by their avarice and lust ! Justice hitherto has been clogged , defaced , mutilated ; but the day of her power rolls on .  --  Her sun is above the horizon ! Shame on you , proprietors of men ! Do not add to your inhuman cruelty the useless hj ' - pocrisy of professing to wish the free blacks away for their own good ! Say , in plain English , for we can not be much longer deceived , that your sole object is to rid yourselves of colored freedom , lest your slaves should be provoked to think themselves men , and discover that they too have rights . Shame on you loo , benevolent colonizers ! Do not add to your unchristian prejudice the gratuitous sycophancy of doing their foulest deeds lor menstealers ! Say in plain English , for it will be believed whether you say it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreants to the Master in whose rrame you have been baptized ! If , after reading these thoughts , any candid mind should feel a lingering doubt whether emancipation , instant and unconditional , be safe , I beg such a mind to hold its decision in suspense till further facts , which have been unaccountably shut out from the public eye , are brought forward , which , I trust , will be at no distant day . 2 . The firm expression of an enlightened public opinion on , the part of non-slave-holders , in favor of instant abolition , is an effectual , and the only effectual means of securing abolition in any time whatsoever . Many men , very wise men in their own estimj ( , tion , dismiss abolition as a " wild " project , a " theory , " a mere closet theory . Coloni- /z/ z.ition is a praclical business  --  therefore they ore for colonizatioti . But is speaking /q/-/q//q/ a theory ? Is calHng things by their right names a closet theory ? How passing strange that one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere theorist ! For my own part , I had supposed that such large pecuniary transactions involved practical business . I had supposed that this reward miht be viewed in the light of a steam-gage , which indicates the efficiency of the moving force . I had supposed it might be a necessary and practical part of the business of reclaiming wicked men , to say something which they would not choose to have us . If " northern men , as a body , would become abolitionists , and if they will not , what security have we that they will not become slave-holders ? If they would speak out as abolitionists , would the people of the South regard it as a mere unpractical ilieory ? May it not be that they now hold their slaves by virtue of our theory against immediate emancipatio ? i , expressed a thousand times through the Colonization Society and in other ways ? If we , that is to say , all our wise and prudent men , have justified slavery , why should they condemn it ? But if the cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men should enter our ears ; if all our philanthropic men and women should be moved from the bottom of their hearts , and pour out the deep current of their united sympathy for the slave ; and if the cautious and the timid , and the immovably prudent , should be , as they always are , borne along with the tide , might it not have a very practical bearing on the common sense and conscience of the southern people ? How do we know that there are not hundreds and thousands among them , who. need only to be backed by northern sentiment to become martyrs in the cause of humanity ? Are we to be told that the most benevolent men at the South deprecate any such interference on our part ? Let us have the proof thatthey are benevolent men . We can not take their word for it , nor any man 's word for it , till it is shown that those men are not slaveholders , and that they have no sympathy with slave-holders as such ; otherwise , we are merely told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the testimony of the robbers themselves . But , waiving this point , it is said they are on the ground , and know better than we what ought to be done , and how it ought to be done . " Why should men who have never set foot south of the Potomac or Ohio , pretend to know more about slavery and its remedy , than those who have been born and bred in the midst of it ? Insufferable presumption ! " This reminds me of a certain person  --  a mi7iister of the gospel , reader  --  in this vicinity , who , on being asked to subscribe for an abolition newspaper , said he had not yet read enough on the subject to know whether a man could have a right of property in man or not ! accordingly , he very sagely concluded not to take the newspaper till he had investigated the matter more thorouo-hly ,  - -  probably , to see whether or not it was worthy of mvestigatfon ! Should such a man visit the South , and see with his own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pro- /z/ perty in man . What is a man 's honesty good for , if he needs W make a pilgrimage to Georgia to learn whether stolen property ought to be given up ? Others exclaim , " But how can your scheme of immediate , instant abolition be practicable ? Can a handful of northern men , or even the combined North , expect to overturn southern society from its foundation in a vioment ?  --  n the twinkli ? ig of an eye ? What fools ! Forsooth you will do nothing against slavery , unless you can do every tiling , all at once ! Heaven deliver us from such Quixotism ! We are for the gradual abolition , for not attempting more than we can effect . " What a pity that the great body of evangelical preachers of the gospel can not learn wisdom of such counsellors . They preach immediate , entire repentance ; of course they exiuci , " what fools ! " to convert the whole world at a blow ! Why do Me ? / not confine themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are able to effect ? Now if 1 may be allowed to make a distinction too elementary to be overlooked by an infant , a doctrine is one thing , and a plan is another . When we say that slave-holders ought all to emancipate their slaves immediately , we state a doctrine which is true . We do not propose a flan . Our flan , and it has been explained often enough not to be misunderstood , is simply this : To promulgate the true doctrine of human rights in high places and low places , and all places where there are human beings . To whisper it in chimney corners and to proclaim it from the house-tops  --  yea from the mouiv tain-tops , To pour il out like water from the pulpit and the press . To mix it up with all the food of the inner man , from infancy to gray hairs ,  --  to give " line upon line and precept upon precept , " till it forms one of the foundation principles and parts indestructible of the public soul . Let those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done it already , the gospel plan for converting the world ; let them renounce every plan of moral reformation , and every plan whatsoever , which does not terminate in the gratification of their own animal natures . By prosecuting the plan described , we expect to see the benevolent , one by one at first , and afterwards in dense masses , awaking , gathering up their armor and rushing to the standard with the resolution to make up for lost time ; we expect to see , at length , the full tide of public sympathy setting in favor of the slave . We expect to see him , when escaped from his cruel servitude , greeted by the friends of liberty , at the North , equally with the more courtly refugee of European tyranny . We expect to see the free colored American so educated and elevated in our own land , that it shall be notorious that the slave is brother to a man f In the meantime we expect to see the great body of slave-holders exasperated , foaming with rage and gnashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! madly prating about the invasion of sacred rights , the disturbance of their domestic quiet , and the violation of solemn compacts ; and with blind infatuation , riveting tighter the /z/ fetters of their helpless victims . Nevertheless , we expect to sec some tyrants , conscience stricken , loosen their grasp ; we expect , with God 's good help , to hear the trumpet of the world 's jubilee announcing that the last fetter has been knocked off from the heel of the last slave . Thus I have endeavored to develop the nature of the evil to be remedied , and have held up , side by side , the remedies proposed . The reader is called upon to judge between them . It is a question in which he can not fail to be interested till he ceases to be a man . The remedies are fundamentally opposite . The one is physical , and aims , contrary to nature , to withdraw 2,500,000 laborers from a fruitful soil and a healthful climate , and plant them under a tropical sun , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort of robbers , and all for the sake of avoiding the just vengeance of Heaven , without giving up that wicked prejudice which lies at the bottom of the sin . The other is moral ; * it addresses  --  not the slave , but the master it seeks not to abolish slavery by a forced legislation , but to correct that public opinion on which law in a free country is based ; it applies to the subject the principles of the Bible , in the spirit of the Bible ; it holds no compromise with the open violators of God 's law . Let public opinion be corrected and the requisite legislation will be easily applied , and a complete substitution of free for slave labor , without a removal of the laborers will be the consequence . Till that time let every slave-holder who becomes convinced of his sin act upon the principles of justice . No law can justly compel him to regard his fellow men as property  --  to buy and sell them . Let him say then to his slaves that they are slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and protect them in his employ as free laborers , to the extent of his ability . If the law interferes , on others the responsibility will rest . But the friends of free labor at the South , for they are certainly numerous , might combine on the plan of a mutual pledge , like the temperance pledge , to abstain from treatmg their fellow men as property , to advocate their indefeasible claim to liberty under law , and to open to them the field of knowledge . This must be done , or human nature must be left to right itself by physical FORCE . Slavery can not exist forever . If the slaves were all free to-day , it would be as vain to expect that they could be rooted up from the soil with their own consent  --  without an act of direct oppression  --  as it would be to expect the fish to betake themselves to the mountains . But unless the emigration is altogether free , a God of justice will not aid us . If we would have his favor , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , many well-meaning people can not , for their lives , see why emancipationists and colonizationists should not go together . This is merely because they do not see things as they are . 1 must be allowed to tell them a story , /z/ A Fable . A shepherd , whose flock was infested nightly by a wolf , procured a spaniel to defend it . This dog , who seemed remarkably aflectionate and obedient in presence of his master , was of little service to the poor sheep ; for , tliough he barked furiously vvhile the wolf was in the inclosure making his insidious attack , he no sooner saw him fairly otl " with the prey , than he ran to him and fawned upon him , and even at length received and devoured small bits of the torn flesh , and , to save appearances with his master , brought back in his moutli some of the pieces which the wolf had thrown away , and laid them down in the inclosure . Grieved to see his flock still molested , the shepherd procured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of unflinching mettle . His first growl agitated the wolf exceedingly , whereupon that old robber offered a large reward out of his plunder to any one who would bring the mastiff bound to his den . The spaniel , hearing of this , lamented the imprudence of the mastifl " , and expressed his regret that any thing should be done to exasperate so ferocious an enemy as the wolf . The mastifl ' , however , was not to be intimidated . Expressing the sturdiest indignation , both against the wolf and his pusillanimous apologist , he set out to attack the robber in his den . At this moment the spaniel , seeing the resolute countenance and lofty bearing of his fellow , whined in a very soothing tone , why can we not go together ? BECAUSE , growled the mastifl " , you have been for a dogs age the protector of this flock , and have never had a price set upon your head ! /z/ ( A. ) See page 22 . Extract from the speech of the Hon. Mr. Archer , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonization Society . ( " Bound up with " the Fifteenth Annual Report ! ) " Mr. Arclier said , that he was not one of those , ( however dcsirahle it miaht he and was , in abstract speculation , ) who looked tn the complete removal of slavery from among us . If that " consummation , devoutly to be wished , " were to be considered feasible at all , it was at a period too remote to warrant the expenditure of any resource of contemplation or contribution now . But a great benefit , short of " this , was within reach , and made ) art of the scope of operation , of the plan of the Society . The progress of slavery was subjected to the action of a law , of the utmost regularity of action . Where this progress was neither stayed , nor modified by causes of collateral operation , it hastened , with a frightful rapidity , disproportioned , entirely , to the ordinary law of the advancen:ent of population , to its catastrophe , which was repletion . If none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances of climate and production , inevitably and speedily redundant , first to the occasions of jirofitable employment , and as a consequence , to the faculty of comfortable provision for them . No matter what the humanity of the owners , fixed restriction on their resources must transfer itself to the comfort , and then the subsistence , of the slave . At this last stage , the evil m this form had to stop . To this stage ( from the disproportioned rate of nmltiplication of the slaves  --  double that of the owners in this country ) it was obliged , though at ditierent periods , in ditlercnt circumstances , to come . When this istiige had been reached , what course or remedy remained 1 Was open butchery to be resorted to , as among the Spartans with the Helots 1 Or general emancipation , and incorporation , as in South America 1 Or abandonment of the country by the masters , as must come to be the case in the West Indies 1 E.ithcr of these was a deplorable catastrophe . Could all of them be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but one way , hut that might be made eti'ectual , tortunately !

But , sir , the apprehension is groundless  --  your Constitution avows , and your whole history proves that no such ) urpose exists .

Such enthusiasts may be witling to make any Institution , Society , or Government , auxiliary to their wild and mischievous projects ; but the Colonization Society , is not responsible for these intemperate fanatics : nor docs it countenance or encourage thtir schemes :  --  It interferes in no way with the rights or the interests of owners of slaves . That in the prosecution of its legitimate operations , and by aflbrding the prospect of comfort and respectability to the man of color , it may exert an influence altogether of a moral nature favorable to emancipation , with a view to colonization , may be admitted . It imposes no restraints , makes no demands , assails no man 's rights , nor seeks to invade the volition which he indulges , or to disturb the enjoyment of what the laws secure to him . Its sole and single object is the colonization of the free , and with their full consent . " It will be plainly seen by the following extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the " free " colored people is to be obtained . The most " benevolent " thing in the law appears to be this : it gives the slave the alternative of remaining in bondage if he does not consent to be an exile from his native land !

" ( C. ) See page 45 . The following extract from the speech of Mr. Archer , before referred to , reveals the reason why the free blacks at the South are " worse off " than the slaves . It seems that those who have heretofore emancipated , have neglected to employ and educate ; they have " turned loose ; " they have thrown the emancipated , while liberty was in the bud , directly beneath the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the air and sunshine of liberty which has done this mischief to the freedman , but the poison tree , which must be torn out by the roots ! But where were the free blacks to find occupation in the slave-holding States , in which they abounded the most 1 in the other States , they might be absorbed to some extent , in ilomestic or mechanical service . This could " take place to no extent , that deserved to be named , in the slave-holding States . There all the avenues of occupation were filled . Even were there space , a necessary and /z/ The free blacks were , therefore , destined , by an insurmountable barrier  - -  a.red pale of social law to the want of occupation  --  thence to the want of food  --  thence to the distresses which ensue that want  --  thence to the settled depravation which grows out of these distresses , and is nursed at their bosoms : and this condition was not casualty , but fate . The evidence was not speculation in political economy  --  it was geometrical demonstration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried that abolition is a party question  --  that it belongs to polilica , not t  --  religion . 1 can not better reply to this , than by quoting a passage from the London Christian Observer , directed against the same cry in England . " But be the Quarterly Reviewer is averse to their system of diffusing a knowledge of the real nature of slavery through the land ; nay , ' he decidedly reprobates it . ' And why docs he reprobate it 1 The reason is curious : ' We do not object , ' he says , ' in the slightest dtgrce , to a deep rooted hatred of slavery , or a tliorough knowledge on that or any other . subject . ' This is precisely the preface to be expected when a man is about to defend slavery , or to plead against diffusing a knowlege of it . He , therefore , proceeds  --  ' But we protest against this thorough knowledge , or deep rooted hatred , being confounded with religious feeling , or employed for PARTY ruRPOSEs .

Is it that the energies which are enlisted in favor of the freedom and happiness of miuikiml , in fivor of the oppressed against his oppressor , are to be likened to a scramble for place , or some paltry question of party pohlics 1 * * * * Party politics !

An extract from the address of Bolivar to the legislature of Peru , or Bolivia , on the formation of their constitution in 1826 . " I have Ictt untouched that law of laws  --  equality , without which all other guarantees perish , as well as all other rights . To her we are bound to make sacriiices. 1 have laid prostrate at her fret the infamous state of slavery . " Legislators !  --  slavery is the infringement of all laws . A law having a tendency to preserve slavery , would be the grossest sacrilege . What right can be alleged in favor of its coniinuancel In whatever view this crime is considered , 1 am persuaded that there is not a single Bolivian in existence so depraved , as to pretend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be legalized . Man to be possessed by hi.3 fellow man  --  man to be made property of ! The image of the Deity to be put under the yoke ! Let these usurpurs show us their title deeds ! The coast of Guinea has not sent them to us ; for Africa , devastated by fratricide , exhibits nought but crimes . After these relics of African tribes are transported hither , what law or power can sanction a dominion over these victims ' ? The act of transmitting , proroguing , and perpetrating this crime , with its admixture of executions , forms the most shocking outrage . A principle of possession , founded on the most serious delinquency , could not be conceived without overturning and upsetting all the elements of right , and without a perversion of the most absolute notions of duty .
