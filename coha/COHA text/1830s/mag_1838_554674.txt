txt WE have prefixed to this article the title of one of the most esteemed among the writings of Edmund Burke , which is remarkable for its perfect adaptation , in many particulars , to our country at the present time ; and we purpose to lay before our readers some of its pertinent passages , with such commentary as they may require and suggest ; premising only , that the system of administration , against which Eurke aimed this piece , is the same , which drew upon itself the ire , and called into action the pen , of the terse and vigorous Junius . We begin with an extract disclosing the general text of the essay " It is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleasure ; and to annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part , and total debility on the part of the people . To get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance , and to secure to the court the unlimited and uncontroled use of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private favor , has for some years past been the great object of policy . if this were compassed , the influence of the crown must of course produce all the effects , which the most sanguine partisans of the court could possibly desire . Government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the people . " Here is the very scheme of the party now in power , described in just such language as the times demand : - To secure to the court ( Executive ) the unlimited and uncontroled uses of its own vast influence , under the sole direction of its own private favor ; so as , in the usual temper of despotism , to hold power only by its own pleasure , and to level down all the degrees and checks between boundless strength on its own part , and helpless debility on the part of the people . But how was this end to be reached ? " The first part of the reformed plan was to draw a line which should separate the court from the ministry . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be formed ; one which should be in the real secret and confidence ; the other merely ostensible , to perform the official and executory duties of government . The latter alone were to be responsible ; whilst the real advisers , who enjoyed all the power , were effectually removed from all the danger . " Secondly , a party under these leaders was to be formed in favor of the court against the ministry : this party was to ha e a large share in the emoluments of // government , and to hold it totally separate from , and independent of , ostensible administration . " The third point , and that on which the success of the whole scheme ultimately depended , was to bring parliament to an acquiescence in this project . Parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indifference to the persons , rank , influence , abilities , connexions , and character of the ministers of the crown . By means of a discipline of which I shall say more hereafter , that body was to be habituated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * Members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibility to pride as well as to duty . * * Thus parliament was to look on , as if perfectly unconcerned , while a cabal of the closet and back.stairs was substituted in the place of a national administration . With such a degree of acquiescence , any measure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly secure . The capital objects , and by much the most flattering characteristics of arbitrary power , would be obtained . Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the personal favor and inclination of the prince . Ihis favor would be the sole introduction to power , and the only tenure by which it was to be held ; so that no person looking towards another , and all looking towards the court , it was impossible but that the motive , which solely influenced every man 's hopes , must come in time to govern every man 's conduct ; till at last the servility became universal , in spite of the dead letter of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret springs of all the public mischief exposed to the eye . First ,  --  two cabinets were to be formed , one composed of the ostensible ministers , and the other of a back-stairs cabal ; secondly ,  --  a party attached to the back-stairs cabinet , and hostile or indifferent to the responsible heads of department , was to be organized and cemented together by official bribes and public jobs ; and , thirdly , Congress was to be corrupted , or bullied into taking its cue from the back-stairs court of the White House . To set these new springs in action , it was necessary for the conspirators to make many alterations in political arrangement . " In the first place , they proceeded gradually , hut not slowly , to destroy every thing of strength , which did not derive its principal nourishment from the immediate pleasure of the court . The greatest weight of popular opinion and partyconnexion were then with - and - . Neither of these held their importance by the new tenure of the court ; they were not , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were required by that tenure . - was first attacked . Not satisfied with removing him from power , they endeavored , by various artifices , to ruin his character . * * The great ruling principle of the cabal , and that which animated and harmonized all their proceedings , how various soever they may have been , was to signify to the world , that the court would proceed upon its own proper forces only ; and that the pretence of bringing any other into it was an affront to it , and not a support . Therefore , when the chiefs were removed , in order to go to the root , the whole party was put under a proscription , so general and severe , as to take their hard-earned bread from the lowest officers , in a manner which had never been known before , even in general revolutions . * Thus , for the time , were pulled down * * the two only securities for the importance of the people : power arising from popularity , and power arising from connexion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to supply the blanks according to their own judgment : they can be at no loss to discern the true analogy . This administration has , indeed , labored diligently to pull down the only securities for the importance of the people . But such a change could not be made without a mighty shock of the public system ; and ,  --  " To reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements , principles correspondent to them had been preached up with great zeal . Every one must remember that the cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery , both moral and political . Those who , in afew months after , soused over head and ears into the // deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption , cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments , which had formerly prevailed . This marvelous abhorrence , which the court had suddenly taken to all influences , was not only circulated in conversation throughout the kingdom , but pompously announced to the public , with many other extraordinary things . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective view of the court , gorgeously painted , and finely illuminated from within , was exhibited to the gaping multitude . Party was to be totally done away , with all its evil works . Corruption was to be cast down from court , as Atd was from heaven . Power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public spirit ; and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence , except those who had the misfortune to be in disgrace at court , which was to stand in lieu of all rices and all corruptions . A scheme of perfection , to be realized in a monarchy , far beyond the visionary republic of Plato . The whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate those good souls , whose credulous morality is so invaluable a treasure to crafty politicians . Indeed , there was wherewithal to charm every body , except those few , who are not much pleased with professions of supernatural virtue , who know of what stuff such professions are made ,  --  for what purposes they are designed , and in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to depict more accurately , to describe with more cutting truth , the hypocritical pretensions of purity and reform , which General Jackson paraded in advance of himself , at all times , before he became President , and the gross and abominable corruptions , of which those extravagant professions were the harbinger ? " Those who , in a few months after , soused over head and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption , cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments , which had formerly prevailed ! " Ho*v emphatically does this represent General Jackson 's twaddle about appointing members of Congress to office , and interfering with the freedom of elections ! " And party was to be done away , with all its evil works ! " So General Jackson exhorted Mr. Munroe . " Corruption was to be cast down from court ! " Ay , there was to be " no more cakes and ale . " Retrenchment and reform were legibly inscribed upon the list of executive duties ; and we see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , which , although they have utterly " vanished , " - As the baseless fabric of a vision ; Yet , unlike that , have left " a rack behind . " Substituting , in the next extract , the words " members of Congress " for " peers and commons , " and it truly represents the obliquity of all the Jackson slander of the opposition Senators and Representatives . " One of the principal topics which was then , and has been since , much employed by that political school , is an affectual terror of the growth of an aristocratic power , prejudicial to the rights of the crown and the balance of the constitution . * * It is true , that the peers have a great influence * * in every part of the public concerns . * If any particular peers , by their uniform , upright , constitutional conduct , by their public and private virtues , have acquired an influence in the country , the people , on whose favor that influence depends , and from whom it arose , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a peer is the despotism of the aristocracy , when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge of their own importance . * lie is but a poor observer , who has not seen that the generality of peers , far from supporting themselves in a state of independent greatness , are but too apt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity , a d to run headlong into an abject servitude . Would to God it were true , that the fault of our peers were too much spirit ! It is worthy of some observation , that these gentlemen , so jealous of aristocracy , make no complaints of the powers of those peers , neither few nor inconsiderable , who are always in the train of a court and whose whole weight must be considered as a // portion of the settled influence of the crown . This is all safe and right ; but if some peers ,  --  I am very sorry they are not as many as they ou* ht to be ) - set themselves , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-stairs influence and clandestine government , then the alarm begens ; then the constitution is in danger of being forced into an aristocracy . " We have alluded , already , to the system of a double cabinet , which distinguishes the Administration . It is truly set forth in the following passage " All sorts of parties , by this means , have been brought into administration , from whence few have had the good fortune to escape without disgrace ; none at all without considerable losses . In the beginning of each arrangement , no professions of confidence and support are wanting , to induce the leading men to engage . But while the ministers of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power , while they have all their canvas spread out to the wind , and every sail filled with the fair and prosperous gale of royal favor , in a short time they find , they know not how , a current , which sets directly against them ; which prevents all progress , and even drives them backwards . They grow ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity to po er , only serves to remind them the more strongly of their own insignificance . They are obliged either to e ecute the orders of their inferiors , or to see themselves opposed by the natural instruments of their office . With the loss of their dignity , they lose their temper . In their turn they grow troublesome to the cabal , which , whether it supports or opposes , equally disgraces and equally betrays them . It isfound necessary to get rid of the heads of ad inistration ; but it is of the heads only . " Would it not seem as if these expressions had been conceived and written in view of the fate of Messrs . Ingham , Branch , and Berrien and especially that of Mr. Duane ? Hear what Mr. Duane himself says , and compare the two statements . " Mr. Reuben M. Whitney called upon me , at my lodgings , at the desire , as he said , of the President , to make known to me what had been done , and what was contemplated , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication thus made to me created surprise and mortification . I was surprised at the position of affairs which it revealed , and mortified at the low estimate which had been formed of the independence of my character . * * I had heard rumors of the existence of an influence at Washington , unknown to the Constitution . The conviction that such influence existed , at least in relation to the matters then pressed upon me , was irresistible . I knew that four of the six members of the Cabinet , before I became a member of it , had been opposed to any present action in relation to the deposits ; and I also knew that four of the six members of the existing cabinet entertained the same views . I felt satisfied , not only that the President was not in the hands of his constitutional advisers , but that their advice was successfully resisted by persons , whose views I considered at variance with the public interest and the President 's fame . " Surely , Mr. Duane and Burke are speaking with reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the inner constitution of the cabal , canearilia , kitchen-cabinet , or whatever it may be , which Burke and Mr. Duane had in their mind 's eye . " That this body may be enabled to compass all the ends of its institution , its members are scarcely ever to aim at the high and responsible offices of the state . They are distributed with art and judgement through all the secondary , but efficient , departments of office , * * so as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne , and on the other to forward or frustrate the execution of any measure , accord.ing to their own interests . " // Just the position of William B. Lewis , Amos Kendall , and the rest of the cabal . " With the credit and support which they are known to have , though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excuse for salary , they possess all the influence of the highest posts ; and they dictate publicly in almost every thing , even with a parade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from these nominal leaders , the trained part of the Senate , instinctively in the secret , is sure to follow them ; provided the leaders , sensible of their situation , do not of themselves recede in time from their most declared opinions . " We think no member of Congress , or other person , familiar with affairs at Washington , can fail being struck with the faithfulness of this representation . In all the proceedings upon the hank , it was more especially apparent ; and the insolence of the cabal , its " parade of superiority , " its disposition to " dictate publicly in every thing , " and the instinct of the " trained " members of Congress , were all manifest together on occasion of the choice of a Speaker of the House last winter in place of Mr. Stevenson . " it will not be conceivable to any one who has not seen it , what pleasure is taken by the cabal in rendering these heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridicnlous . And when they are become so , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mr. Cass is a good sort of a man who can not take a hint ; Mr. Woodhury is " yes and no ; " Mr. Branch , Mr. Ingham , Mr. Berrien , Mr. Duane , Mr. McLane , are thrust out of place with various degrees of indignity ; Mr. Barry alone , willing to be made " thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous , " is " well supported . " is it not literally true ? " The members of the court-faction are fully indemnified for not holding places on the slippery heights of the kingdom , not Jnly by the lead in all affairs , but also by the perfect security in which they enjoy less conspicuous , but very advantageous situations . * Whilst the first and most respectable persons in the kingdom are tossed about like tennis-balls , the sport of a blind and insolent caprice , no minister dares even to cast an oblique glance at the lowest of their body . If any attempt be made upon one of this corps , immediately he flies to sanctuary . * * Conscious of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exterior ministers . Like janissaries , they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their servitude . They may act just as they please ; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their institutions ; ** enjoying at once all the spirited pleasure of independence and all the gross lucre and fat emoluments of servitude . * * The whole system , comprehending the exterior and interior administrations , is commonly called , in the technical language of the court , double cabinet . " We may add , that General Jackson himself has borne testimony to the existence of the cabal or camarilla behind the throne ; since , on a well-known occasion , he spoke of the heads of department , the only cabinet known to the laws , as his cabinet proper ; on which account the people have very aptly styled the other cabinet , his cabinet improper . Some are accustomed to call it the kitchen-cabinet , we suppose , by way of indicating its meanness . However , as one of the organs of the administration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindicated and justified the kitchen , we take this last to be , at present , on the whole , the authorized , and , as it were , classical denomination of the interior and improper cabinet . // Now for the mischievous effects of this double cabinet upon the public welfare . " It is this unnatural infusion of a system of favoritism into a government which in a great part of its constitution is popular , that has raised the present ferment in the nation . The people , without entering deeply into its principles , could plainly perceive its effects , in much violence , in a great spirit of innovation , and in a general disorder in all the functions of government . This is the fountain of all those bitter waters , of which , through an hundred different conduits , we have drunk until we are ready to burst . The discretionary power of the crown in the formation of ministry , abused hy had or weak men , has given rise to a system , which , without directly violating the letter of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * One great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours , * * is that the prince shall not he able to violate the laws . This is useful , indeed , and fundamental . But this , even at first view , is no more than a negative advantage-an armor merely defensive . It is therefore next in order , and equal in importance , that the discretionary powers , which are necessarily vested in the monarch , whether for the execution of the laws , or for the nomination to magistracy and office , or for conducting the affairs of peace and war , or for ordering the revenue , should all he exercised upon public principles and rational grounds , and not on the likings or prejudices , the intrigues or policies , of a court . This , I said , is equal in importance to the securing a government according to law . The laws reach but a very little way . Constitute government how you please , infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers of state . Even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them . Without them your commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper , and not * living , active , effective constitution . * * When , therefore , the abettors of the new system tell us , that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power , * we must tell those , who have the impudence to insult us in this manner , that of all things we ought to he most concerned , who and what sort of men they are that hold the trust of every thing that is dear to us . Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation , but what must render us totally desperate , or soothe us into the security of idiots . " And the personal nature of the objections to a system of administration in the hands of back-stairs favoritism , is well stated in these words " The people of a free commonwealth , who have taken such care that their laws should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so senseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons on whom they have no dependence , and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to those powers , upon the use of which the very being of the state depends . " Of this description are Amos Kendall and his associates ; men , who may have ability and integrity , but if they have these qualities , their genuineness has not yet been assayed , and marked , and made current by any proofs of public confidence . They have insinuated themselves into power through the mean by-paths of sycophancy and personal subserviency . They possess no constituency , so to speak ; they are not linked by elective ties to one part of the people , nor made known to the rest by responsible public services . These are conditions , without which no man becomes an ostensible head of department ; and they apply , with equal force , to the actual possessor of power in a free state , whether he belong to a cabinet proper , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have got together avowedly without any public principle , in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate , and are , therefore , universally odious , ought never to be suffered to domineer in the state ; because they have no connexion with the sentiments and opinions of the people . * * Here it is that the people must , on their part , show themselves sensible of their own value . Their whole importance , in the first instance , and // afterwards their whole freedom , is at stake . * * We are at present at issue upon this point . We are in the great crisis of this contention ; and the part which men take , one way or the other , will serve to discriminate their characters and their principles . Until the matter is decided , the country will remain in its present confusion . " True : how can we have peace , until the domination of that corrupt cabal of men , without any principle but to sell their conjunct iniquity at the highest price , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ones , applicable to the situation of Congress . " Parliament was , indeed , the great object of all these politics , the end at which they aimed , as well as the instrument by which they were to operate . But , before parliament could be made subservient to a system , by which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council , into a mere member of the court , it must be greatly changed from its original character . * * The virtue , spirit , and essence of a house of commons , consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation . It was not instituted to be a control upon the people , as of late it has been taught , by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency . A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy ; an anxious care of public money , an openness approaching towards facility , to public complaint : these seem to be the true characteristics of a house of commons . But an addressing house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commons full of confidence , when the nation is plunged in despair ; in the utmost harmony with ministers , whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence ; who vote thanks , when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachinents ; who are eager to grant , when the general voice demands account ; who , in all disputes between the administration and the people , presume against the people ; who punish their disorders , but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them : this is an unnatural , a monstrous state of things in this constitution . " This parallel is just to the letter ; in addition to which we have two means , or tests , of judging whether the legislature be corrupt or not ; for it is so , when we see ,  --  " First , a rule of indiscriminate support to all ministers ; because this destroys the very end of parliament as a control , and is a general precious sanction to miso'overnment : And , secondly , the setting up any claims adverse to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers , the present Congress has given ample evidence . Has it set up any claims adverse to the right of free elections ? Yes , in Letcher 's case , described point by point5 in the following passage " In the last session , the corps , called the King 's friends , made an hardy attempt , all at once , to alter the right of election itself ; to put it into the power of the house of commons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting in parliament , without any other rule than their own pleasure ; to make incapacities , either general for descriptions of men , or particular for individuals ; and to take into their body persons who avowedly had never been chosen by the majority of legal electors , nor agreeably to any known rule of law . " We remark only , in conclusion , that all these extracts are , of course , made without any addition or change of words , and without any omission , except when it is expressly noted ; and in those cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . C.@@183058694.txt OUR age is the age of history . Numerous associations of able scholars are actively employed in the compilation of Cyclopa*dias , universal biographies , and contemporaneous memoirs . History appears in dictionaries and manuals , in general views , sketches , and essays . While the ephemeral literature of periodicals and magazines opens the treasures of memory to the newly-awakened curiosity of the people , works of a more solid stamp , noble monuments destined to immortality , are rising in all countries . Such in France are the works of Thiers and Sismondi , those of Schiller and Niebuhr in Germany , of Hallam and Mackintosh in England , of Sparks and Prescott in America . Every insignificant town , every obscure province in the old world , every state forty years old in the new , is publishing its annals for the instruction of posterity . Sepulchral vaults and family portraits , city archives and parochial registers , are rescued from the venerable dust that covers them , to become in their turn monuments // of irrefragable authority . Add to this the establishment of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that ingenious device , recently substituted for ancient epopee , the historical novel . Verily , our age is the age of history . This so decided tendency to look to the past , this restless inquisitiveness , that leads us to disturb the silence of the tombs of our forefathers , this universal rage for story-telling , is not so much a matter of choice with us , as of necessity . There are ages essentially destined to act , and ages inexorably condemned to write , history . The progress of human society is marked by an intermittent succession of activity and repose , which , without interrupting its eternal law of continuity , preserves it from the weariness of monotony . The generation , that comes after a stormy period of revolutions and wars , must necessarily be employed in repairing the ravages occasioned by the late convulsions . A council of philosophers is always seen seated on the bloody field laid waste by the rage of the warriors that preceded them , speculating on the causes of the past desolation , and , with theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system proceeds by the impulse of two opposite forces , analogous to the centrifugal and centripetal laws of gravitation , that suns and planets obey . Man , in conflict with nature , is always aiming in his works at immortality . Cathedrals and capitols , forms of rereligion and constitutions of government , are always intended for an endless futurity . In all his fabrics and monuments , this being of clay seems ever to appeal against the short duration of the span of days that is assigned him . Thus he prepares laws and institutions for the generations to come . He deplores the consequences of the errors of generations gone by . He endeavours to foresee all contingencies , to conciliate all interests , to remove all subjects of collision ; and he fancies he has secured his sons against the horrors he witnessed in his childhood , and that he shall convey to them the peace and order with which his mature age is blessed . But , with the new generation , new ideas come up , with which he was totally unacquainted . His sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravages of war , begin to feel tired of the monotony of a stagnating life . New ambi // tions arise . Men begin to count each other , and to find that they are too many . The most active , at every step , find their neighbours in their way . They feel crowded , uneasy , and jealous . They can no longer breathe freely for want of room . The people riot in the squares ; the nobility conspire in their palaces ; confusion and panic seize diplomacy and police ; men 's spirits are again stirred up by the trumpet , the rusty sword is taken down from the walls of the castle , the war-horse is once more harnessed , and the edifice of the prudent father is razed to the ground , like a castle of cards that costs a child so many hours of labor and patience . But patience is an inexhaustible attribute of man . On the green sides of Mount Vesuvius , there are towns which have been several times covered , and , as it were , washed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molten stratum begins to cool , the scattered inhabitants return from their asylum to the beloved scene of danger , and , making the best of their disaster , rebuild their new house with the same lava which buried the old one ; and with such heroic perseverance , that the pavement of the streets of today is on a level with the roofs of the dwellings of former ages . This is sad ; and yet , sad as the order of human society may appear , we have some reason to believe , that not only is it the result of the inscrutable designs of the Eternal Providence , but that the Utopias and dreams of the most sanguine philosophers , admitting even the possibility of their realization , could never suggest a plan by which human affairs could better be carried on . If all Europe , and all the rest of the world , should advance the arts of civilization to the present standard of England ; if all the systems of popular education , all philanthropic institutions could fully attain their aim ; if all encroachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations , should cease ; if every people should retire within its natural limits , and be contented with its own ; if soldiers and lawyers were sent to till the ground ; we could thus bring society back to the golden age of the poets , but what a fatal monotony would weigh upon life , how many aspiring spirits would pine and sink for want of an object of exertion , how many would say , like Alexander , " Alas ! our fathers have left nothing for us to do ! * Evil is then an enemy left among us by a wisdom like that , with which Cato opposed the total demolition of Carthage , that the young Romans // might have an open field for exertion , and discipline might never relax . By the continual aiming at perfection without ever being able to reach it , mankind are preserved in a state of action and reaction , that keeps them almost constantly on the same level , and prevents them from falling into an apathy inconsistent with the demands of their spiritual nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography of a man before his death . In like manner , because society , and the nations that compose it , never die , or , at least , because the periods of their existence can not be comprehended by the short-sightedness of man , general and partial history is to be composed during those intervals , which seem to divide it into so many distinct epochs ; when society , after a long period of struggle and violence , sinks into a state of comparative repose , into that condition of meditative torpor , during which it supplies its empty veins with new blood , and acquires strength for new catastrophes ; as the geologist , who would explore the crater of a volcano , must wait for an interval , in which the mountain lies still and cold , as if exhausted by the last eruption , and preparing in silence and darkness the glowing materials for a new one . As soon as the hour of action has come , society is divided into injurers and sufferers . The bold range themselves in the lists as actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None is free from hope or fear ; hence none has patience or courage to write . There must be , necessarily , two ages for history ; the age of heroes , and the age of writers . Our age is not , - the young and restless murmur against such a sentence , the benevolent offer thanks to Heaven for it , - our age is not an age for action ; we must be contented with writing . The last forty years ( we mean the days of the French republic and empire ) have furnished materials for a hundred volumes ; the history of the present age will be told in one page . Perhaps the task assigned to us by Providence is the noblest ; perhaps we are , in fact , the benefactors , the true builders , of our race ; but human curiosity is only attracted , where the trampling of hosts and the clashing of steel bewilder the terrified imagination . The history of mankind is only marked by works of destruction , as that of the earth they inhabit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general peace of the world has been repeatedly threatened . // Events of the utmost consequence have been announced , which seemed likely to bring about a total subversion of things ; revolutions in Spain and Italy , a deadly struggle in Greece , - wars between Russia and Turkey , - Algiers , - Navarino , - and finally the three days of July in Paris , and their consequences in Belgium , Poland , Italy , and Spain . Never , perhaps , did discord more madly whirl her torch all over the world . Yet while , in other times , only a spark would have been sufficient to raise a general conflagration , those partial and abortive commotions have naturally abated , without any extraordinary cause , or human provision , only in consequence of the general exhaustion and consternation into which the nations had been plunged by the bloody ravages they had recently undergone , and from which , in spite of the fair results of their statistical accounts , and the seeming prosperity of commerce and industry , they have but scarcely recovered . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies for the diffusion of useful knowledge , the spirit of invention and discovery , manufactures , roads , navigation , all things useful or beautiful , present the fairest results . But , by the side of such an astonishing progress , wild and bewildering ideas prevail ; new or newly-combined doctrines and systems ; a daring , restless , all-pervading inquisitiveness ; a haste , a discontent , an anxiety , very much like the fever of suppuration after the infliction of wounds . Such as it is , our social reorganization looks fair and bright in theory . Posterity must come and see how it will work in practice . But we envy them the sad experiment ; we endeavour rashly to hurry events ; we wish to see the motion of the machine we are constructing ; and , in that deplorable impatience , in that reluctance to submit to the eternal course of human vicissitudes , we worry and torture ourselves , and lose the proper blessings of the calm , meditative age , in which we are destined to live . It would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European mind by merely following the general turn of thought in this country . Since the English colonies of North America have been raised to the rank of an independent nation , they have been separated from the world , or rather they have been called to constitute a world apart by themselves . It was fortunate for them , that their emancipation took place before they were liable to be involved in the horrors of the // French revolution . Yet , since it would be to entertain a mean idea of the divine wisdom , to suppose that much good is not to be derived from so much evil , it remains a matter of doubt , whether America will be able to reap the advantages of calamities , in which happily she had no share . To this circumstance , perhaps , is principally to be ascribed the difference of feelings and manners , visibly xvidening , between the old world and the new . The great achievement of American emancipation was an event wonderful in its success , immense in its results . Still there was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiltless struggle . There was much firmness and unanimity , but very little exasperation of factions . The whole matter was controverted and settled between two nations of men . It was a fair play , a legitimate debate of right and wrong , something like a difference arising between brothers at the division of the paternal inheritance . Never was liberty purchased so cheaply ; nowhere but in America could a liberty , so easily acquired , be so easily maintained . Since that time , Heaven has smiled incessantly on the land of the free . From her inaccessible shores , America has looked upon the conflict of nations periling at sea . She has had much to learn , much to admire , much to deplore , but nothing to fear or suffer . This blessed security , this long enjoyment of order and tranquillity , has exerted a beneficent influence over the minds of her people . Conscious of unbounded existence , the American moves to his aim , circumscribed only by the natural orbit of his powers . He fears no encroachment , no obstruction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life is movement , not struggle ; he is active , not restless ; his interests are essentially in harmony with the interests of society , his private efforts are always tending to forward the public welfare . Accustomed to see revolutions carried by a majority of suffrages , when dissatisfied with his rulers , he awaits new elections ; he has nothing to hope from violence , he has no occasion for secret conspiracies . His equanimity in social life has a soothing influence on his domestic affections . At home and abroad , the American is a reasonable being , par excellence . Disappointed in one branch of industry , he calmly turns to another . Crossed by fortune in the East , he resignedly migrates to the West . He is the citizen of a world ; his rights , his name , and language follow // him everywhere . A descendant of pilgrims , he has no local notions of patriotism . His wooden dwelling is something between a European house and an Arabian tent . On the background of civilization , there opens before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the outcasts of society . There , more than in any constitutional providence , lies the secret source of American security . As long as the valley of the Mississippi has marshes to drain and woodlands to clear , a rich soil and a blessed climate to rebuild broken fortunes and soothe disappointment , America will proceed with uninterrupted prosperity . As long as she is in possession of such an extensive and immediate means of getting rid of all corrupting elements , corruption can not strike deep roots . Civil and religious passions may ruffle the surface , but the waters are too shallow to be much troubled by storms . On the other hand , Europe is afflicted with the evil most attendant upon old settlements , surplus population . Everywhere land is failing the inhabitants . Domestic and foreign quarrels , plagues and famines , though more busy than ever , appear inefficient and slow . The stubborn human race eludes all agents of destruction . The meanest wretch clings to the roof of his fathers , claims his right to the soil , and hangs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injustice of fortune . He ascribes his failures to a general conspiracy of the whole community against him . Once fallen , he never hopes , never strives , to recover . He curses the hard times in which he was born ; he sinks into dejection and dissipation , waiting for sudden vicissitudes to come to his rescue ; he expects the earth to be stricken out of its path for his sake . Placing thus his expectations in changes and revolutions , no wonder if he does his best to hasten them . The number of individuals of this description is considerable in Europe . They are ruined noblemen , half-pay officers , bankrupt merchants , and other men of all descriptions , with an elastic conscience and loose morals ; meddling , fretting , murmuring ; great haranguers , great alarmists , ominous prophets , seizing upon any pretext , real or apparent , of discontent , stirring and blowing , until they have kindled a few sparks into a general conflagration . Such are the evil elements of movement in Europe ; but neither are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to characters a high temper , and // teach individuals how to rely upon themselves . The continual spectacle of violence and persecution keeps sympathy and indignation awake . Opinion , fettered and crushed , becomes passion and will . The harmless dreamer is turned into an active enthusiast . Thus , when the season for trial and conflict is mature , the opposite elements hring their forces into the field , unanimous , compact , determined , to engage in a struggle of various success , to retire at the end with nearly equal losses and halanced advantages . Hence social progress is continual and uniform in America ; in Europe it proceeds hy fits and starts . Here it results from the comhined efforts of masses ; there it oheys the impulse of individuals . In the new countries it follows the dictates of reason ; in the old it arises from the conflict of passions . It is evident , that civilization must advance on a more solid footing , and the influence of evil he less sensihle , in this country , however life may appear more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until America shall have fulfilled her mission of colonization all over the continent ; until there shall no longer he wildernesses to he changed into territories , territories to he organized into states , and states to become powerful nations ; until the spirit of enterprise and invasion shall be compelled , by want of space , to take a retrograde direction from the circumference to the centre , and the diverging interests shall he brought into contact and collision . History is constantly watching over the different phases of social advancement . Its office ought to he that of a monitor ; each of its pages ought to he intended for a lesson . And to its lessons we listen , as long as the consequences of past evils are upon us . But , at the first momentary relief , we feel a deplorable assurance , that the condition of our times is different from any of the preceding epochs ; that the recurrence of such evils is incompatihle with the newly-spread light of knowledge and wisdom ; and we rush headlong down the precipice to add another foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground of such considerations , that we deem it salutary to turn the attention of American readers to the history of other nations . America , as is the case with the young , has all to expect from the future . She has little or no past , and that little is all glorious and serene . A rare hlessing of Providence is it , that she can safely derive from the example // of others what others often fail to learn from their own misdeeds and misfortunes . The Italian historians , until the present day , have by the unanimous assent of all nations been placed in the first rank among the moderns . History , as well as almost every thing else that is noble or beautiful in Christian civilization , was originated or restored in Italy . The memories of past ages are written with indelible characters in the thousand monuments , which crowd that land . Every ploughman has a story to tell of his field . The Lombard plain is heaving with mounds covering the relics of all nations . Wave after wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their footsteps , and the tracks of their chariot wheels , may almost be traced but they are gone , the fated land has swallowed them all . Dispersed , harassed , trampled upon , the native races have survived their destroyers . They have counted those numberless hosts . They have handed down to posterity the names of the tribes and their chieftains . They have preserved their annals with that sad diligence , and dictated them with that touching eloquence , with which sufferers are apt to dwell on their woes as if proud of them . The Italian chroniclers of the Middle Ages , generally the inmates of cloisters , respected by all the successive invasions , had the advantage , over their contemporaries of other nations , of a comparative security ; and , although their writings were far from being free from the superstitions and absurdities of their times , it is not less true , that the little that remained of ancient lore found a last refuge in their cells . But when , at the dawning of a better day , the Lombard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , the young republics intrusted their worthiest citizens with the production of their national trophies ; and history , taken from the silence and barrenness of the convent , and brought into the bustle of social life , began to exercise its highest functions , as treasurer of the past and preceptor of the future . Whilst those enlightened democracies made the first attempts towards establishing systems of general policy and diplomacy , their enterprising navigators brought home information from the remotest regions , and the annals preserved in their archives became universal records of undisputed authenticity . Lastly , when , in consequence of the natural tides of human // vicissitude , Italy , exhausted by domestic jealousies , became a prey to strangers , and , the scene of active life being transferred elsewhere , she was left to exercise her dominion over the realms of the mind , historical studies were pursued under calmer circumstances , and with xvider views ; and , allied with strength of reasoning and the charms of style , they constituted that science to which the following ages have given so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in that period of dull repose which succeeded the conquest of Charles the Fifth , when the doom of Italy was inexorably sealed , and tyranny first declared war against thought , were early made aware , that a writer , espousing the cause of honor and truth , must unite to the power of genius the heart of a hero and the devotedness of a martyr . Whatever were the moral characters or the political feelings of some of them , while engaged in the debates of public life , such an air of candor and conscientiousness , of moderation and impartiality , prevails in every page of their writings , as gives a more favorable impression of the integrity and morality of their age , than their descriptions are intended to suggest . Machiavelli , a stern misanthrope , a warm patriot , - by turns imprisoned and banished , and appointed secretary , ambassador , captain-general , - head and soul of a crumbling state , writing with a hand still bruised and beuumbed by the rack to which the vengeance of the Medici doomed him , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Histories , " any bitterness of resentment . Entirely engrossed by the gravity of his subject , exhibiting his versatile talent in abstracting and generalizing ideas , and his great sagacity in judging of men , he ever shows himself an enthusiastic apostle of freedom and virtue , though he is apt to indulge in some fits of that inborn misanthropy , that a long dealing with men , and struggling with evil , had exasperated and deepened . Guicciardini , a shrewd politician and a heartless patrician , relating events in which he had taken a great part , loaded with honors by popes and princes , detested by the people , deluded and disgraced by the ungrateful tyrant to whom he had given up his country , never permits himself to be drawn , by party spirit or disappointment , out of the dignity befitting his important ministry . So Nerli and Nardi , Segni and Varchi , either impenitent republicans , dying in the distress and sorrow of exile , or awk // ward courtiers , preferring the cause of truth to the favor of their lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in their tombs by his vile jealousy , that succeeded in burying their writings , and defrauding public curiosity for more than two centuries ; all of them equally excel in that self-possession , which , divesting the related events of all exaggeration or palliative , presents them , bare but striking evidences against the monsters whom they consigned to the unerring desecration of posterity . So Fra Paolo Sarpi , by a rare combination a monk and a citizen , scarcely recovering from the wounds treacherously inflicted by the poniard of Rome , in his " History of the Council of Trent , " tracing from its earliest origin that reform which was for ever to part asunder the religious opinions of the Christian world ; so Cardinal Bentivoglio , by a strange anomaly a legate of the pope and a man of high feelings , writing an account of the great struggle of the Hollanders for their religious and political emancipation ; so Davila , an adventurer , a courtier of Catherine de ' Medici , a soldier of Henry the Third and Henry the Fourth , describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wars of the League ; so finally , in times nearer to us , Muratori and T ) enina ; and Ciannone , a hero and a martyr , for twenty years the inmate of a dungeon ; and a vast number of others , seem to instruct mankind by their example , that there is no state of violence or oppression , no seduction , no fear , that can allure or deter truth from its straightforward path , and save injustice or wickedness from the watchful retribution of the generations to come . After such luminous precedents , it would be difficult for writers of after ages to mistake the task , that public confidence , and the great responsibility resting upon their works , impose upon them . But causes of a different nature , resulting from the very calamities of political division and subjection , equally tend to preserve the historians , as well as other writers of Italy , from contamination and baseness . Literature in Italy is no trade . The privilege of copyright can only be secured to the author or editor within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are published . He is well aware , that all around , at a distance of thirty or forty miles , there are a number of piratical printers , lawfully entitled to invade and ransack his property , as soon as it attains any popularity ; and , as the sale of books , except in the kingdoms // of Naples and Piedmont is , commercially , free , those illegitimate republications extend their outrageous competition even under the eyes of the author . Thus it is well known , for instance , that Botta was forced to sell in Paris , for waste paper , the superb French edition of his " History of Italy , " while the Italian booksellers were making their fortunes by an uninterrupted series of new editions . Nor are the Italian princes any longer in a condition to be willing to hire the pens of venal writers . After the maxim of the aristocracy of Venice , they wish their governments never to be spoken of , either for good or evil ; and they rather long for that day in which there shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all courtpoets and historiographers have been dismissed ; and , even were writers in Italy willing to sell themselves , they no more could find a purchaser . Flattery is a merchandise equally discredited before power and public opinion ; and the writer can not aspire to any better reward than the satisfaction of his own conscience and the esteem and gratitude of the good . Literature is there , in consequence , comparatively more sterile and silent , but more pure and dignified than in any of the free countries . It is more oppressed and fettered , hence less apt to grow licentious and insolent . It follows not the opinions and passions of the multitude in all its ephemeral wanderings , but it marches at the head of the movement , a stern censor , dictating and ruling with that authority , which the consciousness of its own irreprehensibility gives it a right to exert . Of all branches of literature in Italy , history is that to which the greatest attention is generally paid , as it is also , of all studies , the most dreaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History has been long since banished from the Italian universities . In recent times , the heroic epochs of early Greece and Rome have been generally illustrated and understood ; while of Italy not a word has been spoken . The very name of their country has conveyed to the Italians an indefinite idea . Their patriotic feelings have been restrained within the limits of a petty state or town , and all who came from beyond those limits have been pointed out as strangers . It is only in our days that they have begun to acquire some knowledge of themselves . The busy curiosity of the age has led them to interrogate the monuments and // writings of their forefathers . That Italy , which the relentless enmity of fate had long hid away from their anxious solicitude , at last they have discovered ; but , like the Spanish hero in the chivalrous legends , the joy of the discovery has become a source of new distress , when that parent is found lying prostrate and low , her vigor and beauty wasted in tears and chains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the history of their country ; because , strange as it may appear , whilst , as we have said , that nation may justly boast of having produced a greater number of good historians than any other , there is , as yet , no work answering the purpose of a general history of Italy . Beyond all political impediments or sectional prejudices , that may oppose the completion of such a work , the most immovable obstacle lies in the vastness and arduousness of the undertaking . It would he impossible to form a just idea of the extent of the subject , by taking into consideration the works of a similar nature , on the history of any of the other countries of Europe . The annals of these last can always be fairly referred to one determinate epoch , and comprehended within one period ; and , though the natural course of events may have been repeatedly interrupted , and the national unity broken , still there is always a central organization , a great metropolis , a dynasty forming , as it were , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily traced , and on which they all essentially depend . But the history of italy is the history of many nations and states . With its head hidden in the clouds of the remotest antiquity , rehearsing for a long lapse of ages the principal part of a drama in which the other nations only played the episodes , twice at the head of the civilization of the world , twice constituting the history of the world ; the history of that country is necessarily divided into several distinct periods , and each period into an infinite number of subdivisions offering but few general points of analytical survey . The first period , that of Italy before the Romans , is rather indeed the province of the antiquary , than the historian . It comprehends the researches about the aborigines ; the Pelasgi , ( IEnotrii , Itali , and Siculi , the Etruscans , the Ligurians , and a hundred primeval tribes inhabiting the peninsula , whose existence is attested by the remains of their cities and // the relics of their works of art , whose high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , and whose names , residence , con*nes , laws , manners , and literature are , in great part , a ground for vague conjectures , and not very profitable controversies . The second era , the best known and most universally studied , embraces the recital of the glories of Rome . But the history of the Eternal City is not the history of the whole country . The resistance that each of the native tribes opposed to the rising ambition of Rome , threatening its existence in its first growth ; the share that each of them took in the exploits of Rome , when united with her ; the settlements of the Greek colonies in the south ; the invasions of Gauls and Illyrians in the north ; the social war by which the rights and privileges of Roman citizenship were forcibly acquired by the provinces from the capital , and the name of Italy was virtually associated with that of Rome ; are events which , in a history of Italy , claim a more eminent place than they occupy , when only the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages form the third period . It includes the ruin of the western empire ; the invasions of Western and Eastern Goths , of Huns , of Alani , of Vandals , and Gepid* ; ( for Italy has seen all of them ; ) the reign of Odoacer ; the fiftyseven years of Gothic empire ; the two centuries of Lombard dominion ; the eighty-eight years during which Italy was swayed by the French monarchs of the Carlovingian dynasty ; the seventy-three following , in which she was distracted by the factions of her national dukes and marquises ; the two succeeding centuries , during which she faintly acknowledged the dominion of the German emperors from Otho the First to Frederic Barbarossa ; and all that long night of violence , ignorance , and superstition , during which the popular principle was gradually axvakened , during which , instructed by the errors of the monarchical and feudal systems , by the discords between kings and vassals , between popes and emperors , the people lost all feelings of veneration and allegiance , and began to act for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then unperceived , a brute mass of serfs and burgesses were raised to the rank of men and citizens . The fourth is the period of Italian freedom . The maritime towns set up an independent standard , rout the Greeks // 1839 . Extent of a General History of Italy . and Saracens , and begin to ride from one end to the other of the Mediterranean , free , as the waters which they furrow , and the winds that wave their flags . The inland cities raise their walls and marshal their burgesses , join in a general league and shake off the yoke of the Germans . Liberty is no sooner secured than abused . The feudal and democratic systems , the Guelphs and Ghibelines , the house of Swabia , and the house of Anjou , popes and anti-popes , crusades and heresies , feuds between neighbouring cities , factions within the walls of the same city , turn the whole country into a vast field of battle . Meanwhile , Roman institutions , Lombard statutes , Salic laws , feudal and monastic privileges , Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion and disorder into civil life , and those young republics are hurried on to destruction by excess of vigor and ill-directed energies ; until at length a bloody tyranny at Milan , a crafty oligarchy at Venice , a stormy aristocracy at Genoa , a raving anarchy at Florence , a feudal despotism in Naples , and an aspiring hierarchy in Rome , open the way for foreign inroads , and invite the shame and misery of a foreign yoke . The fifth and last period , embraces three centuries of degradation and bondage . It is a succession of invasions of French and Spaniards , Swiss and Austrians , by turns invited and expelled by Italian factions , until the deluded sons of Italy are forced to acknowledge a master in each of the auxiliaries they had the imprudence to invoke . Yet neither is this deplorable period destitute of high interest , nor did Italian greatness set without leaving glorious records . The long struggle of Venice against the league of Cambray , her wars against the Turks , the bold aspirations of Julius the Second , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us reason to mourn over the fate of a nation , every fragment of which seemed able to sustain , alone , the glory of her name . But that fate was fulfilled . A long inaction ensued , only interrupted by a periodical warfare of French and Austrians , in the wars for the succession of Mantua , of Spain , of Austria ; the progressive fall of Venice and Genoa ; the extinction of the princely Italian families ; the exaltation of the house of Savoy , and foreign rulers gaining ground inch by inch ; a lingering decline of arts and sciences , and of all pious , generous , patriotic feelings ; a deathlike torpor , a stupid indifference and oblivion ; then , on a sudden , a general overthrow of all // states and orders , a re-awakening of energies , a maddening of spirits , a brilliant illusion , and a bitter disappointment . For the erection of such an immense building , the Italians are in no want of copious materials . The patriotism of their municipal governments , the vanity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not left the most obscure corner without illustrations , nor the most trifling event without description and commentary . It has never been penury of documents , or chasms in the memorials , that has made the compilers of Italian history at a loss . It was rather an indiscriminate redundance and confusion , that perplexed and discouraged all patience , and led astray all critical judgment . Archives and libraries seem to have escaped the ravages of time , and all sacks and conflagrations of cities to have sent down their treasures safe and sound for the gratification of our curiosity . There they lie in scrolls , parchments , and gaudy manuscripts , huge folios and ponderous quartos , with a variety of binding and gilding , in Gothic Latin , or in rude Italian , heaped up , piled up , drawn up in formidable array , the old-fashioned shelves groaning under their weight , dark and dusty , silent and moody , like spell-bound warriors ready to fall on the bead of the daring mortal who should venture to break the enchantment . But the enchantment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a giant with a hundred eyes and a hundred hands , one of those antique frames cast the present day , whose labors would be a wonder , even if , like Nestor , he had outlived three generations and been always at work , with a perseverance rare in all climates , more rare under the seductions of a southern sky , abjured all the ties and charms of society , and buried himself with the dead , to search their monuments and reveal the secrets of the past . Placed over the . flmbrosian library at Milan , and the Estcnse in Modena , maintaining a busy commerce with the most famous scholars of his times , he published , in one vast collection of twenty-seven volumes in folio , the chronicles and annals of all the towns and provinces of Italy under the title , " Rerum Italicarum Scriptores ab Anno IEra* Christiana* D. ad MD . " Then , giving order and system to that formless mass , he published , in 1738 , his Latin work , " Antiquitates Italic* Medii lEvi , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , religious , and military orders and institutions , with a precise account of all invasions , settlements , and vicissitudes of the different tribes successively occupying the peninsula ; and tracing the origin and progress of letters , sciences , arts , and language , from the fall of the Roman empire down to the year 1500 ; a work which he reproduced several years later , on a smaller scale , and translated into Italian . Finally , in this last language , he wrote his " Annali d'Jtalia , " in sixteen volumes , from the beginning of the Christian era to the year 1749 closely following all mernorable events of peace and war , with a minuteness and precision which leave nothing to be desired . To the Atlantean efforts of this able workman , amounting to the most ample treasure of historical lore , we believe , that any nation can boast , the Italians are indebted for the foundation on which their historical works have been , and ever will be constructed ; and it is a remarkable fact , that , though the activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vigilance , yet such were his sagacity and discernment , such his candor and integrity , that , in so prodigious an extent of narrations , whatever he stated has never , or seldom , been called in question . Thus , before him , nothing had been attempted in his country , but municipal and provincial annals , or contemporaneous history , such being , in fact , even the high performances of Paolo Giovio and Ripainonti in Lombardy , Bembo in Venice , Bonfadio in Genoa , Costanzo in Naples , Guicciardini and his illustrious contemporaries in Tuscany ; whilst , after him , we have not only a good number of more or less successful attempts in general history , such as Denina 's " Revolutions of Italy , " and Bossi 's " Ancient and Modern Italy " ; but even such works as were devoted to the illustration of a single district , or a short period , such as Verri 's Milan , Galluzzi 's and Pignotti 's Tuscany , and Giannone 's immortal work on Naples , are conceived under general views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the progress of civilization . Muratori and his successors having thus cleared and levelled the way for a work of genius , as early as the middle of the last century , the work of genius would long since have appeared , had it not been for the languor and apathy , and the total extinction of public spirit , that characterized the period immediately preceding the French revolution , and the feverish // effervescence of stormy passions that this last event brought with it . Now that , as we have said , the times are highly favorable to efforts of such a nature , among the mental results which will distinguish the present generation in Italy , we have all reason to expect a good history of the country and a general review of what is daily published in that branch of literature will easily assure us , that our anticipation can not fail to be speedily realized . The fondness of the Italians for ruins , medals , and inscriptions , which so often proves contagious even to their foreign visiters , and the great efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the attention of several able writers of the present age towards the earliest memorials of their country , and enabled them , in some degree , to rescue the primeval period of their history from the oblivious silence of ages , and the misguiding lore of mythological traditions . At the head of such compositions , are the works of Micali , " L'Italia avanti i Romani , " published at Florence , in 1810 , and " Storia degli Antichi Popoli Italiani , " printed in 1832 . Choosing his own way , in the midst of jarring opinions and interminable doubts ; by the aid of an enlightened criticism , stating and ordering facts with an admirable perspicuity , without attempting to give his subject more unity than it would naturally admit of , Micali endeavoured to collect the records of each individual race of the primitive inhabitants of Italy , one after another , in an easy succession , according to the chronological traditions of their earliest origin , and the influence which they exerted over the land ; and traced their history down to that single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epoch in which their name was effaced from the list of nations , and their fate involved in the destinies of Rome . The long period of the Roman republic and empire , the second epoch according to our arbitrary division , has been hitherto completely overlooked by the Italian historians . If we except the immortal discourses of Machiavelli on the Decades of Livy , there is hardly any Italian work on that subject . The Italians early reproduced the annals of Rome , by translations of Livy , Tacitus , and other Romans ; but a methodical compilation of those annals , a work that should take up the subject , where Micali has left it , is still desirable ; nor are the profound and philosophical // views of the German , Niebuhr , sufficient to answer the purpose , though they may serve to suggest new ideas and views on the subject , to such as shall attempt the work after him . The history of Italy , in fact , may commence where the history of Rome terminates . The two epochs have hardly any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the two plays that have been acted upon it bear little relation to each other . With the first inundation of the northern races , with the first setting in of the night of the Middle Ages , commences the history of a new nation . The history of the Middle Ages , the narration of the inroads of the northern barbarians , their laws and institutions , their manners and morals , is still a work to appear . In this branch of history , also , the Italians have permitted themselves to be outrun by foreigners . The works of Hallam and of others , English and German scholars , have prepared the way for the historians of Italy ; but the Middle Ages in her history do not extend to the same epoch as bounds them in the history of the rest of Europe . Feudal disorder and anarchy continued in France until the days of Charles the Seventh , or Louis the Eleventh ; the Middle Ages in Spain closed at the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella ; in Germany , under Maximilian the First ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in Italy , modern civilization dates as far back as the peace of Constance , in 1183 ; and from that year commences the fourth epoch , the history of Italian freedom . On this period , a splendid work has been recently published , such as to leave hardly any chance of doing better , hardly any thing to be desired . Sismondi , a name dear to the Italians , descended from a Tuscan family , though a native of Geneva , always seemed to look with pride and affection towards the land of his ancestors . In his " History of the Italian Republics of the Middle Ages , " published in 1826 , in sixteen volumes , and in the compendium of the same work , condensed into a small volume , under the title of " Rise and Fall of Liberty in Italy , " printed in 1830 , there prevails throughout a warmth of patriotism , that might be easily accounted partiality in a native of Italy . Ten years of travel and local researches enabled him to draw information from the most direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wide and deep views of a master mind , and warmed with the enthusiasm of a virtuous and chivalrous heart , has // rendered this work one of the most important productions of the present times . The history of modern Italy has been likewise abundantly provided for . Tbe work of Guicciardini stands at the head of that period . Writing the history of his own age , from 1492 to 1522 , from the first French invasion of Charles the Eighth , to the definitive settlement of the Austrian dominion of Charles the Fifth , Guicciardini amply illustrated that momentous era , which put an end for ever to the supremacy of Italy over the other nations of Europe . The continuation of Guicciardini , from 1522 to 1797 , and the history of Italy during the last French invasions , from 1797 to 1814 , have been written by Botta . This Guicciardini of our days , this prince of modern historians , as he is generally styled among his countrymen , long since established a wide reputation in this country , by his " History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " It was at first , and is still surprising , how a foreigner , who had never visited the country , could have so deeply studied the complicated institutions of the English colonies of North America , divined the causes that excited and the spirit that supported them during the long struggle of their emancipation , and traced its principal events with a chronological and topographical accuracy , that might deserve encomium even in an eyewitness . It is highly desirable for a nation to have its history written by an enlightened foreigner . It is important to divest the annals of a country of the selfishness and narrow-mindedness of a mistaken patriotism . It is curious and instructive to read what other people think of us . The Italians have been long since used to perform such good offices for their neighbours , and have lately been amply requited by the labors of Sismondi . Botta 's " America , " however , was written especially with patriotic views ; and the author , while writing , was not much actuated by the expectation of the popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rights of men were in those days blindly debated in Italy as well as in the rest of Europe . Liberty , an epidemic disease , threatened a general overturn . Botta , desirous of giving his countrymen a salutary lesson , thought of deriving his instruction from that recent memorable event , which had perhaps chiefly contributed to give Europe the first impulse . He wished to teach the Ital // ians , on what ground a people must found its aspiration to independence ; what public spirit , and what private character , become a nation of freemen . It was with that aim , that he dwelt with so much fondness on the simplicity and sanctity of the earliest planters of Massachusetts and Rhode Island . it was as models to the chiefs of the Cisalpine and Italian republics , that he drew , with so much skill , the portraits of Washington , Adams , and Warren . It was as a contrast with Jacobirt and kSansculottic rage , that he exalted the mildness and forbearance of the victors of Bunker 's Hill and Saratoga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedantic affectation of its style , prevented the instruction from descending to those lower classes among which instruction was wanted . Botta was understood only by few ; and that history remained among the works that are more celebrated than read . By that history , however , Botta having raised his name into public notice , he ventured on a work of still greater importance to Italy , by writing contemporaneous history . He was well aware of all the dangers attendant on such an enterprise . " Proposing to write , " he sayrs , at the beginning of the first book , " the history of events that took place in italy in our days , 1 know not what the people of the present age will say of me . " The judgment of his contemporaries did , in fact , bear harshly against him . That work was the object of virulent attacks , and the repose of his last years was disturbed by the animosities he had raised . But now Botta is dead , and we , his survivors , his earliest posterity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the sentence that party spirit has passed against him . It is not difficult to vindicate his fame against all charges of venality . The indigence and exile , that were his portion after the fall of Napoleon , are sufficient evidence against such vile accusations . Equally reviled by all factions , be was sold to no faction . Those who have seen him in his humble dwelling in France , who know on what means he depended for his sustenance , must confess , that , had he ever sold himself , he must have made , to say the least , a very losing bargain . Nor is the charge of ingratitude towards the memory of Napoleon better founded . Botta was , at different intervals , a physician in the French armies , a deputy from his native district , a president of a scientific institute in France . He never attracted the attention of the great conqueror , except in the last years of his reign . With his great talent for // 346 April , judging of men , and availing himself of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conferred on him no favor from which he did not expect to derive equal advantages for the state . Botta was then bound to Napoleon 's memory by no feelings that could hinder him from writing ; nor could he , when writing , be hindered , by any personal feelings , from declaring what he deemed to be truth . Botta was a patriotic historian . At the moment he began his narration , he had just awakened from a dear illusion , in which all the best friends of Italy had equally shared , and wished to leave in his history a warning to his countrymen against future deception . He had finally perceived , that the Austrians , though the most successful , were not the most formidable , enemies of the independence of his country ; that the antipathy of all Italians , and especially the Lombards , against them , needed no further exasperation ; that no time , no mildness , no soothing manners , could ever reconcile the conquered to the conquerors . Sure on that ground , he saw , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Italy was still bleeding from all her veins , the eyes of all Utopians were still turned towards France for their rescue , and Gallomania was still , to many minds , synonymous with patriotism . He saw this ; and , by a heart-rending picture of the horrors he had witnessed , he desired to impress upon his contemporaries that hard , but salutary lesson , which forms almost the conclusion of all his chapters , and so often recurs in the same words ; " that Austrians and Russians , English and French , are equally the sworn enemies of unfortunate Italy ; that there is no deception , no treachery , no ravage she has not reason to expect from them all ; and that , to rely upon foreign aid for her emancipation , can lead to no better result than a change of masters . " A holy lesson this , and a prophetic warning ! But , at the moment it was given , the effervescence of men 's minds was too great to allow calm judgment the exercise of its functions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fancy with all the prestiges of glory . The dull and deathlike yoke of the Austrians made a sad contrast to the activity and life of the French dominion . The name of Italy was , as yet , imperfectly understood . The patriotic ranks were principally filled by malecontents from the Cisalpine assemblies , or from the French armies ; Jacobins , royalists , constitutionalists // opposite elements , cast together by common reverses , and used to call themselves French , and to speak and think in French ; raising , in the secrecy of their homes , shrines to the memory of the " man of destiny " ; looking towards St. Helena , as they had looked towards Elba , for a new rising of the Star ; some of them , even to the present day , refusing all belief to the tidings of the death of the Sultan of death . To such a set of warm and heroic believers , no wonder if the history of Botta sounded like calumny and blasphemy ; and no wonder also , if after so many lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1831 , the Italian patriots , resting on the fair promises of France , and plunging still into the same illusions , had the same calamities to deplore . We do not know , however , how far the end can justify the means ; and we would not take upon ourselves to affirm , that , in pursuance of his own views , Botta has not , in many circumstances , deliberately palliated or exaggerated the truth , making his best of an epoch , in which an impudent system of lying , in all official bulletins and newspapers , had involved truth in a maze of perplexity . He has , for instance , too far exalted the constancy and valor of the ever-beaten warriors of Austria ; he has too often ascribed to chance the brilliant successes of the French ; he has overrated the wisdom and mildness of the old governments , and underrated the talents and uprightness of the new ones . But , above all , the desire of giving to his history the dark hues of Machiavelli and Guicciardini , as lie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him extravagant , in his exhibition of human simulation and perfidy . He has put before his eyes a smoked glass , and all around him looks dark and pale . Society is to him a den of wild beasts . Botta is a virtuous writer , but no believer in virtue . He is a patriot , but he has despaired of his country . He is a lover of good , but a prophet of evil . He revolts you with a faithful exhibition , and a strong execration , of baseness and crime ; but he disheartens you by the conviction of their constant prosperity . If there is truth in his doctrines , still we do not see what they can lead to , but misanthropy and suicide . His other history of Italy , a continuation of that of Guicciardini , from 1522 to 1797 , the last of his works , written in compliance with the desire of an association of illustrious citizens from all parts of the country , who provided for the sus // tenance of their proscribed historian , has met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so intimately connected with the wants and feelings of the country at the present day . Nevertheless , the fondness of the author for an aristocratic or patrician form of government , such as , according to his ideas , principally contributed to the long prosperity of the Roman , Venetian , and Genoese republics , does not agree with the wild doctrines of democratic equality , of which the French revolution has spread the seeds throughout Europe . Italy is eminently a republican country . Wherever her different people , by any happy circumstance , have been masters of themselves , they have never made choice of any but a popular government . All the reigning families in the peninsula have erected their thrones on violence ; none has ever been defended with such beautiful examples of devotion as we read of in the histories of the northern countries . God save the King , and Vive le Roi , are shouts which find no echo in Italian hearts . On the other hand , no republic is able to hinder true merit from shining , or people from valuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , that be may not aim still higher ; nor can he enjoy consideration and power , without endeavouring to forward his descendants in the same career ; nor can nations be prevented from looking with partiality and expectation towards the descendants of a man , who has bequeathed to them high claims to public gratitude . Aristocracy is innate in society ; it is inherent in our best feelings . The republic is wise which provides against its abuses , and prevents this system from becoming injurious to the common interests . The republic is wise , that leaves aristocracy to public opinion , without sanctioning it by law ; but even this is perhaps more than human foresight can do ; as we generally see , where laws oppose aristocracy of birth , a new and more offensive kind of aristocracy arises , that of wealth . Such are the ideas of Botta . He regards aristocracy as the conservative principle of a free state , as the source of all that is really noble and disinterested in public life ; and such principles are quite as likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , as among the innovators of old , aristocratic Europe . Among the latter , at all events , they have destroyed Botta 's reputation . So much provision has been already made for the history of Italy . But the example of Botta has excited a noble // emulation among his countrymen ; and , since his death , history has taken in Italy a significant step . Among the writings in which have been more ostensibly adopted the stern and melancholy maxims , the grand and classic manner , the lofty and affected style of Botta , are to be ranked especially two histories of Genoa ; the one , from the earliest foundation of the city down to the year 1483 , published in 1834 , by Girolamo Serra , a man of noble birth , deeply implicated in the events that brought about the total extinction of his native republic the other , from the origin of the republic to the year 1814 , by Carlo Varese , a work now in course of publication , which has excited the highest expectation . Another work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples by General Colletta , who died an exile at Florence , in 1830 . His history , published soon after his death , in continuation of one of the most illustrious works in Italian histor ) r , the " History of Naples by Giannone , taking up the subject from 1734 to the present day , gives a faithful account of the revolution of Naples in 1820 , an event in which General Colletta played a most distinguished part . In like manner , each province or city is now republishing its annals ; and the history of Como , by Cesare Cantu ; of Saluzzo , by Muletti ; of Pavia , by Robolini ; and essays on the ancient laws of Piedmont , by Sclopis on the commerce of Venice , by Mutinelli ; on the Genoese colonies in Asia , by Sauli ; would prove highly interesting in this country , if they could be introduced and circulated . But works written with more general views , and more worthy of the attention of American readers , such as the history of the celebrated families of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Morbio , both now in course of publication , and the promised history of the house of Swabia , by Nicolini , one of the greatest poets of the age , are destined to be the forerunners of the great work , that , after so many generous efforts , still remains to be written , - a general history of Italy . Conspicuous among the different attempts that have been made towards a general compilation of the memorials of the country , is " The Revolutions of Italy , " by Denina , published at Turin , in 1769 , - a work in three volumes , written with sufficient discernment and skill , but not with that wide power of genius , that embraces an immensity of objects , apparently unconnected , and presents them in their mutual rela // tions , with that proportion and symmetry , which make of history an edifice obedient to the laws of architecture . Nor did the immense work of Luigi Bossi , on the " History of Italy , Ancient and Modern , " published at Milan , in 1819 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bossi , rather an antiquary than an historian , lost himself in dissertations and conjectures , which are incompatible with the highest aims of a philosophical history . His work is one of erudition , and it may be added to the vast amount of historical materials from which the history of Italy is to be framed . Among his most valuable productions , Botta has left the outlines of Italian history , in a work in three volumes , which he published in 1825 , in French , for the Historical Society of Paris , under the title , " Histoire des Peuples d'Italie , " embracing the whole period from the days of Constantine to the fall of Napoleon . It has been several times translated into Italian as well as into other languages . The depth of the master-mind of Botta is especially visible in this great effort , and his is , in consequence , thus far , the best essay on so arduous a subject ; but what he has given , only exhibits the outlines of the great picture for which the artist has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has condensed into one volume the whole history of Italy , ancient and modern . His work has been happily translated into English by a competent scholar in this country . It however had no higher aim than to be an elementary book , and is only to be recommended in that character . The great secret motive which deprives Italy of a work , of which the need is so generally felt , will be easily explained by the success that Cesare Balbo met with in an attempt of a similar nature . He published at Turin , in 1830 , three volumes of a history of the Gothic and Lombard dominion , to which it was his intention to add a history of Italian Freedom , and of modern times down to our days ; but he was forced to abandon his enterprise at the third volume . Such a work can not be safely attempted under the iron rule of the Italian governments ; but the ancient and modern works which we have noticed , furnish ample means of writing , to such of the sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enemies* power . The office of erudition has been completed ; the foundations have been laid , and important monuments have already risen , with shining success . A man of genius is // wanted , to take advantage of the efforts of such illustrious workmen , and raise an edifice , which will be the harbinger of union , independence , and regeneration , to that unfortunate people . The efforts the Italians of our days are making for a unity of language , literature , and history , are the best pledge they can give , of their being fitted for their emancipation . Itis always by such a wise gradation , that the productions of arts , letters , and science , as well as the works of nature , are advanced to their greatest results . The plan for the erection of the greatest of temples had long since been modelled and remodelled ; the treasures of more than one Pope had been lavished ; winters and summers had revolved over the rising aisles for more than half a century , before the Vatican felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence , - before , leaning upon the unwieldy piles heaped up by his predecessors , and taking his model from the works of creation , Michel Angelo raised to the firmament a firmament of marble.
