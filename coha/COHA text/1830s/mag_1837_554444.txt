txt Tuis , so far as we are informed , is the first work upon the principles of the law of nations , that has appeared in the English language . Ward 's History , though valuable in its way , is of course upon a different subject . Mr. Wheaton is well fitted by his professional pursuits , and his personal qualities and accomplishments , to supply this deficiency in our literature . As Reporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court of // 17 Division of the Work . the United States , he had opportunity to familiarize himself with the principles of one of the most important branches of the science ; and his subsequent employment in the diplomatic service of the Government , has naturally turned his attention to the whole subject , as it is set forth in other elementary treatises . We may add , that he possesses the literary taste and talent , necessary to give the work the requisite finish in point of style . It is founded , as would naturally be expected , upon the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which enjoy the highest reputation in Europe . In many parts , our author follows them very exactly . In others , however , he makes important additions ; and he infuses into the whole mass the liberal spirit that prevails in the institutions and administration of the government of his own country . It is this last circumstance , which renders the work particularly valuable . The preceding writers on the subject , though mostly liberal in their political opinions , are yet more or less tinctured with prejudices , derived from their training in a school entirely different from that which is afforded by the practical politics of this country . In the discussions which are constantly going on with foreign governments upon the principles of international law , it is of considerable importance that we should have some treatises to refer to , which are written entirely in the spirit of our institutions . We may ad ( l , that Mr. Wheaton , though liberal in his views , is at the same time judicious and moderate , in his exposition of them ; and lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extravagant and impracticable theories . The subject is introduced by a sketch of the history of international law , occupying sixteen pages . This is necessarily , from its brevity , a somewhat meagre and unsatisfactory account of the science , and perhaps might as well have been omitted ; especially as the subject had been so ably treated , in an abridged and accessible form , by Sir James Mackintosh , in the celebrated Introductory Lecture to the course which he delivered on the law of nations . The treatise itself is divided into four parts , which treat respectively of the Sources and Objects of International Law , of the absolute International Rights , of States , of the International Rights of States in their pacific relations , and lastly , of the International Rights of States in their hostile relations . In the first chapter , which treats of the sources of interna // tional law , Mr. Wheaton , in conformity with preceding writers , finds them in the general principles of the law of nature , regulating the relations of all moral agents , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles are the same , whether applied to states or individuals , the difference between the characters of the subjects in the two cases , occasions great differences in the modes of applying these principles ; that is , in the rules of practice . hence , the law of nations constitutes a distinct and separate chapter of the law of nature . It derives its obligatory character entirely from its being a part of that law . The principal difference between them is , that while the evidence of the law of nature as applied to individuals , is sought for practical purposes in the civil law of each separate country ; the evidence of the same law as applied to nations , is sought for practical purposes in treaties , conventions , decisions of admiralty courts , and in history , which may be regarded as a sort of collection of reports , showing how the law of nations has been understood and practised upon , at different times and places throughout the world . But the civil law in each country is binding , as such , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts , and examples from history , which form the evidence of the law of nations , have , as such , no obligatory character upon the parties subject to that law . Hence , the law of nations resolves itself , for practical purposes , into the usage of nations , which is obligatory only so far as it may he conformable to the law of nature , of which conformity each nation remains for itself the sole and independent judge . It is only , therefore , as Mr. Wheaton rightly observes , in a peculiar and figurative sense , that we apply to the mass of particulars which makes up the evidence of this usage , the name of Law . Upon these preliminary matters there is little dispute , at least among intelligent men , although the principles involved in them are far from being stated with perfect clearness by all the elementary writers . In his second chapter , entitled Sovereign States , Mr. Wheaton enters on a topic of a more debatahle character . We may remark en passant , in reference to the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary usage in this country , can not perhaps with strict propriety be applied to a state . The correlative of sovereign is subject ; hut a state , as such , is entirely independent of every other moral person , and can have neither // master nor subject . In its political sense , the word sovereign is properly applied to the highest or supreme power in a State ; and in this sense it is habitually applied to the kings of Europe . In this country , the supreme or sovereign power is supposed to reside in the body of the people , who may be called with propriety sovereign , in contradistinction to the individual citizens , whether in or out of office . But the state , considered in its relation to other states , has no character either of sovereignty , that is , superiority , or subjection , that is , inferiority . All states stand , as such , on a footing of perfect equality . The idea intended , is properly expressed by the word independent . This may , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and propriety in the use of language are absolutely indispensable to correct reasoning . The inconvenience of using the word sovereign in relation to states , is apparent occasionally in the work before us ; as in the following remark . " Sovereign states may be either single , or may be united together under a common sovereign , or by a federal compact . " States , which are at the same time sovereign and subject , must have a rather anomalous existence . - The phrase sovereign states , as here used , means merely political societies , or in one word states ; and the idea is , that states may he either entirely independent , or united under a common government , or by a federal compact . The use , of single in connexion with state , instead of independent , is an innovation , and we think not a happy one , on the usual forms of language . In this chapter , Mr. Wheaton gives a succinct account of the nature of the union between Prussia and Poland , of the confederations of Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . In speaking of the latter , he takes the true and only tenable distinction , between a league or confederacy of independent states , and a union of states into one body politic or people , like our own ; which is , that in the former case , the acts of the body , representing the confederacy , are in the nature of requisitions on the members , and have no direct application except through the agency of the state governments . Whereas in the latter , the laws enacted by the federal government operate directly upon individuals , without the intervention of the states . This condition of things can not be reconciled with any correct notion of entire independence , or in the common phrase , sovereignty . Hence , // the epithets independent or sovereign , when applied as they sometimes are , to the States of this Union , must he understood , if they are to be considered as correctly used , in a limited and qualified sense . Mr. Wheaton also touches , in this chapter , on the interesting questions connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on tile manner in which the obligations of states are affected , hy changes in their internal constitution , or in the person of the sovereign . He decides , that under all such changes they continue hound hy their treaties , and responsible for all their acts . This principle formed the basis of the demands made by our government upon those of France , Holland , Spain , and Naples , after the fall of Napoleon and his dynasty , for indemnification for depredations committed upon our commerce during their period of power . The demand was long contested , sometimes on principle , hut more frequently by evasive pretences of one kind or another , until at length it was acceded to by France , during the favorable moment immediately following the Revolution of 1830 , when Lafayette exercised a strong influence in the public affairs . The other powers followed her example . The precedent thus established is of the most salutary character ; and the whole afihir furnishes one of the most remarkable examples , recorded in history , of the triumph of justice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arms , and by the mere effect of perseverance , firmness , and discretion , in the management of the peaceful artillery of reason . In the second part , which treats of the absolute International Rights of *States , Mr. Wheaton discusses , at some length , the delicate question of the Right of Intervention by one state in the internal affairs of another ; and gives a succinct but interesting sketch of the several instances of such intervention , that have occurred in the recent history of Europe . As respects the character of these proceedings , Mr. Wheaton correctly remarks , that " they can not be referred to any fixed and definite principle of international law , or considered as furnishing a general rule fit to be observed in other apparently analogous cases . " It is obvious , in fact , that intervention by one state in the internal affairs of another , is inconsistent with the relation of independence which exists between them ; and is , therefore , contrary to the law of nature . If justifiable at all , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the general law , on the high and paramount ground of absolute self-defence . The right , sometimes asserted , of interfering to prevent the aggrandizement of a state by lawful means , lest its increased power , if abused , should become dangerous , is obviously a mere chimera . It is not only the right , but the duty , of every state to develope its resources to the utmost . The pretence in question , which if honestly put forward would be merely absurd , is in practice uniformly a cover for cupidity and violence . Cases may however be supposed , in which the known and avowed principles of the constitution and administration of a state may be such , as not only to justify other nations in interfering , but to render it their strict and solemn duty . Such , for example , was the little community of the Assassins in the mountains of Syria ; and such at the present day are the piratical states of Barbary . The toleration of the existence of these hordes of sea-robbers by the great maritime powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the trade of the smaller ones , is one of the least honorable features in the history of modern Europe ; and it is a fit subject of national pride with us as Americans , that the determination recently evinced by Great Britain and France to break them up , may be traced in no small degree to the influence of our example . The fourth chapter of this part contains , among other interesting passages , an account of the negotiations carried on by the government of the United States with those of Spain and Great Britain , respecting the navigation of the rivers Mississippi and St. Lawrence . In the third part , which treats of the International Rights of States in their pacific relations , Mr. Wheaton recapitulates succinctly the commonly received rules , respecting the interchange of diplomatic agents , and the conclusion and observance of treaties . In the fourth and last part , which is the longest and most important of all , he discusses the various questions that concern the International Rights of Slates in their hostile relations . These were justly considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations , and he accordingly gave to his work the title of a Treatise on the Laws of Peace and War . In considering the rights of war , as between enemies , Mr. Wheaton adverts briefly to the different rules that prevail as to the capture of private property on land and at sea . In the // former case , it is , as is well known , considered as prohibited by the law of nations , and in the latter as admitted . Although no reason , in the least degree satisfactory , ever has been or can be assigned for this difference , no symptom has appeared in the history of modern Europe of a disposition to abandon it , excepting in the single case of the first treaty between the United States and Prussia , negotiated by Dr. Franklin in 1783 . In this treaty , it was expressly stipulated ( art . 23 ) in the first place , that private property should not be taken on land without compensation ; and then , that all merchant vessels , employed in the exchange of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the necessar%es , comforts , and luxuries of life , should pass freely and without molestation ; and the two contracting Powers agreed not to grant any commissions to privateers , which should authorize them to cap1ure such vessels or to interrupt their trade . This article is commonly spoken of , as if its object were merely to prohibit privateering , leaving the capture of private property by public ships on its former footing . Even Mr. Wheaton appears to put this construction upon it . Our readers will perceive by the language of the text , which we give in a literal translation from the French copy before us , that the intention was to prohibit the capture of private property by ships of any kind , and that privatecring is not prohibited , excepting in its operation on private property . This article was omitted in the new treaty with Prussia negotiated by Mr. John Quincy Adams in 1799 , probably at the suggestion of the other party . In his Presidential Message to the House of Representatives , announcinE the appointment of ministers to the intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distinction between the modes of treating private property in time of war on land and at sea , as one of the objects that would probably engage the attention of that body . " I can not , " he remarks , " exaggerate to myself the unfading glory with which these United States will go forth in the memory of future ages , if by their friendly counsel , by their moral influence , by the power of argument and persuasion alone , they can prevail upon the American Nations at Panama , to stipulate by general agreement among themselves , and so far as any of them may be concerned , the abolition of private war upon the ocean. , * The topic of the Rights of War as respects JVeutrals , or , in the // common phrase , . Neutral Rights , which occupies the closing portion of Mr. Wheaton 's hook , has created more discussion than any other , and , from the part taken in these discussions by our own country , will be read with great interest . Mr. Wheaton reviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of the Rule of 1756 , of blockade , of the articles properly denominated contraband of war , and of the right of search and impressment . On all these delicate and disputed subjects , his views are liberal without being extravagant . The existing usage of nations , which has been determined in a great measure hy the practice of the British Government , is considered , by our author , to he of an illiberal character . His own feeling is throughout in favor of the other construction , which it has been for many years past the effort of this country , and of most of the continental powers of Europe , to introduce and establish . The fundamental doctrine of what may still be called the existing law of nations on these subjects , is that which recognises a belligerent right of visitation and search . Sir William Scott , in his opinion in the case of the Maria , * remarks on this subject , that " no man can deny this right who admits the right of maritime capture ; because , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is property that can legally be captured , it is impossible to capture . " And Mr. Wheaton appears to coincide in this view of the subject . " Even if the right of capturing enemy 's property be ever so strictly limited , and the rule of free ships free goods , be adopted , the right of visitation and search is essential , in order to determine whether the ships themselves are neutral , and documented as such , according to the law of nations and treaties . " To this , however , the advocates of the opposite doctrine reply , that the right of capturing at sea private property belonging to enemies , admitting it to exist , is an odious one , condemned by the practice on land of the same powers that claim it , and obviously in contravention of the great interests of humanity , which require the limitation in every possible way of the ravages of war . The right in question being of this character , instead of carrying with it any other rights as incidental , must itself , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of requiring every vessel that sails the ocean , to prove by written documents to the satisfaction of a searching officer , that she is not an enemy , natural * Rob . Adm . Rep. I. 340. // justice , they urge , throws the burden of proof upon the belligerent , who must have sufficient evidence , before he ventures to molest a vessel in any way , that she is an enemy , and then may proceed , as in the case of attacking an armed vessel or a body of armed men , at bis peril . They insist , that the idea that because two nations go to war , tbe commercial exchanges of all other nations are thereby subjected to their supervision , is so obviously untenable , that nothing but the great power of the nations putting forward the pretension could have given it plausibility ; and that it would be much nearer the truth to say , that the other nations have a right to look into the causes of the quarrel between the two belligerents , and compel them by force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , when any of the principal nations have remained in a state of neutrality during a war in Europe , they have , in fact , looked upon this pretension with very little favor* The coalition of the continental powers commonly called the . /Irmed . N'eutrality , which was formed in the year 1780 , and afterwards revived in 1800 , began by refusing to submit to the alleged right of search in regard to vessels under convoy . The British Admiralty Courts insisted , and at both these periods the progress of events pretty soon tern. , inated the question , by involving Russia , and the other great neutral powers , in the war . Had they continued neutral , they would probably have soon taken the higher ground of a complete denial of the right of visitation and search . On the disappearance of this pretension , the questions respecting the rules of free ships free goods , contraband of war , and impressment , would fall of themselves . The British Government , at the opening of the French revolutionary war , attempted , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , in some cases at least , be regarded as contraband , and seized many of our vessels under this pretence . It is to be regretted , that some countenance was given to this pretension by the eighteenth article of Mr. Jay 's treaty with Great Britain , recognising the existence of cases in which provisions may , under the law of nations , be regarded as contraband , and providing for them . Mr. Wheaton appears to think , that this article in Mr. Jay 's treaty " was manifestly intended to leave the question where it found it . The two parties , " says be , " not being able to agree upon a definition of the cases in which alone provisions and other articles , not generally contraband // may be regarded as such , concurred in stipulating , that whenever any article , so becoming contraband according to the existing law of nations , shall for that reason be seized , the same shall not he confiscated , but the owners shall be completely indemnified in the manner provided for in the article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the effect of the article , or of the intention of the parties . The parties , though unable to agree upon the precise cases in which provisions may be regarded as contraband , agree that there are some such cases , and provide for their occurrence . The objection to this is , that there are no such cases ; and that the pretence that provisions may in any case be regarded as contraband , was a mere cover for belligerent cupidity . Mr. Wheaton intimates , that the American commissioner may have had in view the case of provisions bound to a blockaded port . But this construction can hardly he admitted , for two reasons ; first , because in regard to articles bound to a blockaded port there is no distinction between contraband and not contraband , the whole being liable to confiscation on a different ground ; and , secondly , it is apparent that this could not have been the intention of the parties , because the case of a blockaded port is provided for in another part of the same article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparagement to tbe character of Mr. Jay , whose patriotism and ability are generally acknowledged , and whose error is to he attributed to no other motive than an anxious desire to effect the object of his mission , and avert the impending danger of a war with England . Of all the extravagant pretensions put forward by the belligerent powers during the late war , that of paper blockades was perhaps the most violent and absurd . A blockade is the investment by sea of a place , which the besieging party expects to compel by starvation to surrender . To carry supplies of any kind to a place so situated , would be to take a direct part in the war ; and accordingly , the usage of nations authorizes the seizure and confiscation of neutral vessels bound to a blockaded port . But the rule requires , that the bloclading force should be actually present ; and the reason of the rule , which would of course govern its application in every impartial prize court , requires , that the place should he invested at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the belligerent powers erected the enormous pretension // of establishing by a simple notification , a permanent blockade of all the ports , in the whole coast of kingdoms and continents . It should he added , that each justified these proceedings , chiefly on the ground that they were in retaliation for similar acts by the other . The condition of the neutral in this case , was even xvorse than that of the . lchivi , in the Latin poet . Whatever extravagance was committed by either belligerent , the neutral ( for there was only one ) , was sure to be plundered by both ; and it can be no great matter of surprise to any one , that he was at last " kicked into war . " While the great powers were playing these fantastic tricks before high Heaven , the smaller ones occasionally tried their hands at the same game . In the years 1809 , 1810 , the king of Denmark undertook to capture a number of American vessels , on various pretences ; one of which was , that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance , which , according to his Danish Majesty 's construction of the law of nations , subjected the offending vessel to capture and condemnation . A long negotiation ensued between the two governments , which was terminated , in 1830 , by a convention , concluded on the part of the United States by Mr. Wheaton himself , in which Denmark stipulated to pay a fixed sum , by way of indemnity , to be distributed by our own government among the sufferers . Our author 's account of the negotiation on this subject , ( pp. 353 - 364 , ) may be advantageously consulted , for a specimen of the style and manner of the work . Before we conclude , we are tempted to add a very few remarks upon another recent work , in which the same subject is treated , though in a different way . We allude to the " Manual of Peace , " by Professor Upham , of Bowdoin College . Occupying the chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy , in that respectable institution , and known already to the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit , Professor Upham will naturally be heard , with much respect , upon any subject connected with his line of study ; and we regret to see the authority of his name lent to opinions , which we consider as decidedly untenable . Without intending to discuss the topics in question , we feel it a duty , to enter our protest against one leading view , in brief but distinct terms . // The doctrine advanced , and maintained throughout the work , is that of the universal inviolability of human life . No individual acting in a private or public capacity , is justified in voluntarily taking the life of another , either in the way of punishment for crime , or the strictest self-defence . If defensive war be considered as lawful , says Mr. Upham , there will never be wanting pretences for attributing that character to all *vars , however violent and unjustifiable . This may be to a certain extent true ; but the question is not how a certain principle , if true , may be abused , but what the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if the use of food , or the intercourse between the sexes , be allowed , the permission will certainly be abused , for purposes of vicious sensual indulgence , and , therefore , that they ought to be entirely prohibited . Though the fact must be admitted , in regard to both , few judicious persons would consider it as authorizing the conclusion . However sophistically the plea of selfdefence may be used at times by nations and individuals , there are certainly many cases , in which it may be urged with perfect truth . The laws of nature , and of God , which are the same , authorize in such cases , where necessity requires it , the taking of life ; nor has any nation , of ancient or modern times , ever scrupled to found its legislation upon this basis . Our author relies very much in argument , upon the humane and pacific spirit of our religion , as evinced in various passages of the Scriptures , and particularly the article of the Decalogue , which is emphatically confirmed in the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely , in his view of the spirit of Christianity , we conceive that his construction of the commandment in question , is contradicted alike by the plain common sense of the world , and by the practice of the people to whom it was originally given and who certainly never understood it in the sense now given to it by Mr. Upham . Indeed , the case in which an individual must either lose his own life , or take that of another who is violently attacking him , is obviously one in which the rule admits of no application , because the individual must , in either event , sacrifice life . If , in order to avoid taking the life of his antagonist , he voluntarily gives up his own , he commits suicide ; and this is as clearly within the prohibition of the commandment , as homicide of any other kind . He must necessarily kill ; and the only question is , whether he will kill // a sanguinary ruffian , or a quiet and peaceable citizen ; a problem , which , apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can only be solved upon any principle of religion , morals , or common sense , in one way . We need not , however , go into this minute criticism ; nor are we disposed to restrict the right of taking the life of another , in self-defence , to the single case , where it is absolutely indispensable to the preservation of our own . Life is not the greatest of goods ; nor is the preservation of it in ourselves , or our neighbours , to be held paramount to all other considerations . Life must be freely and unscrupulously sacrificed , if necessary , in a good cause of any kind . Such is the dictate of the noblest feelings of the heart ; and such has been the doctrine and practice of the best and wisest men of every age and country . The voice of God within us confirms it as true , and denounces the opposite sentiment , as cowardly and base . The man who could stand by to see his wife dishonored , and his children slaughtered , and then acquiesce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that of the ruffian , who should undertake to perpetrate these outrages , would not deserve to be classed with his species . The case is equally clear , of a nation engaged in a really defensive war . The question was put to the late Mr. Grimk* , of Charleston , S. C. , who was an enthusiast upon this subject , what he would do , if a band of pirates should assail a town , of which he should happen to be the responsible magistrate . His answer , which Mr. Upham quotes at length , and with high approbation , was substantially as follows . " If any fellow-citizen insisted upon my taking measures for a forcible defence , I would at once resign . If I could have my own way , I should make proclamation , that all the churches be opened , and that prayer be offered by the clergy , and all the pious , that God would be pleased to change the hearts of our invaders , and to manifest his power and mercy in our deliverance . That done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thence would I issue forth , not with a band of cavalry and infantry , but with all the clergy , and a long succession of Sunday School teachers and scholars , dressed in th2 white robes of peace , and chanting no battle song of the Bruce , but the hymn of Christian faith and hope . Can it be doubted , that such a spectacle would soften the hearts , and change the purposes , of that band of greedy , lustful , bloodthirsty pirates ? " // It is unnecessary , we presume , to comment upon this passage . We are induced to notice it , because we consider such extravagancies in the professed , and , no doubt , sincere advocates of humanity and justice , as exceedingly prejudicial to the cause . We regret to see them countenanced by the authority of Mr. Upham.
