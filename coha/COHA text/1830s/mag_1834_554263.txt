txt THERE are few passages in history of more romantic interest , than the expedition , of which this writer has undertaken to give a new description ; nor was there ever a more open field for the historian . The account given by Home , was , as might have been expected , full of those prejudices , which so often overbalance , in the eye witness , all the advantage he might otherwise derive from standing near the scene of action . In fact , it is often found , that those , who have borne a trifling part in great transactions , consider everything in relation to what they themselves heard and saw , and in this way form an idea of the whole , much more limited and partial than those who are distant both in place and time , and derive all their information from others . Perhaps too , there never was a time from the fortyfive , ' till the end of the last century , when any writer could have been found sufficiently free from political prejudice , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stuarts ; for although the family and their adherents had long passed away , the prejudices which had been excited for and against them still existed , sustained perhaps by association with religious interests and feelings . Considered as a political contest , involving the cause of good government and the prosperity of the British nation , there was no reason to wish success to this bold adventure ; but if it be regarded simply as a trial of strength between the Hanover and Stuart successions , as individuals contending for the crown , the feeling of the impartial would incline in favor of the losing party ; since they were unfortunate almost beyond example , and their successful rivals disgraced their victory by violence and'blood . The history of the Stuart family itself is a singular one , and very much resembles the course of this knight errant expedition , which seemed thrown like a rocket into the heart of England , where , after startling all eyes with its fiery brightness , it exploded , and was lost in darkness forever . If we may credit // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fleance , the son of Banquo ; and to all who question this fact , they put the question , From whom did they descend , if not from him ? - an int*rrogation , which has often been employed with great effect on such occasions . Lord Hailes professes not to be able to trace their origin ; they were probably a wealthy and powerful Norman family , who derived the name by which they are now known , from their office as stewards of Scotland . When they reached the throne by marriage , their course may be traced in history by its peculiar difficulties and sorrows , which pressed heavily upon all the race , but were seen most distinctly in the fortunes of Mary , and her grandson Charles . No doubt there was much to condemn in their personal characters ; and their maxims of government were such , as never could be tolerated in a nation which had the least pretension to the name of free ; still , we can hardly refuse our sympathy to their discrowned heads , ' as we trace their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunny plains of Italy , where it ended miserably at last . The history of this expedition is interesting , from the circumstance of its making us so well acquainted with the Highlanders , who , though not the best neighbors in the world , are invaluable as subjects of poetical interest and philosophical contemplation . Living in their natural castles and towers ,  - -  separated by their mountain barriers from the arts and refinements of civilized life , they were as little known in Edinburgh , as the Indians of our country are now in our Atlantic cities they were as little understood , as those diluvial currents , which , geologists say , swept down from the north in former ages , and left their traces on all the British isles . rJlheir political organization was , for a civilized region or a civilized , vicinity , vicious and dangerous to the last degree . It was substantially the same with that which existed in the days of the patriarchs , founded upon a sentiment of loyalty and association , which was deeper and stronger than can be conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them terrible instruments of violence at times , also led to unexampled heights of chivalrous gallantry and generous self-devotion . It was not surprising that they should be ready to fight for their chief or sovereign , since they were a military people , who delighted in war ; but it was certainly most honorable to them , that Charles Edward , after bringing ruin directly down upomi them , and depriving // them of all but honor , should have been able to linger among them so long , when a word would have betrayed him , and have earned the price of thirty thousand pounds , which was offered for his head . Whatever their political sins may have been , they have since been expiated . The hloody ploughshare passed over them , and salt was sown upon their soil ; in destroying their social condition as it was , no care was taken to supply it with a better ; the result is , that this romantic region is left , every year , more and more desolate , and its inhabitants are resorting in great numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the individuals , whose names are most distinguished in connexion with this enterprise , the general sentiment has given its verdict long ago . The Duke of Cumberland was exalted to the skies for the victory of Culloden , gained over an inferior , divided and disheartened army ; but his reputation , thus acquired , proves nothing but the universal dismay which prevailed throughout the kingdom ; no other part of his military history indicates anything more than an ordinary man . He was unahle to contend with Marshal Saxe at Fontenoy ; and when he returued to the continent in 1747 , he was again defeated by that distinguished general at Laufeld. 6 Ten years after , he lost the battle of Hastenbach against D'Estr6es , and ruined his credit by the convention at Closterseven , which closed his military career . If this part of his history is not particularly honorable , there is nothing on which his reputation can rest ; for the course which he pursued after the fortunate accident which popular gratitude magnified into a great victory , was more thoroughly brutal and disgusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole treatment inflicted upon the Highlanders hy the English army , shows how naturally the basest fear is followed by wild and fierce revenge . This General seems to have formed a tolerably correct estimate of his own standing ; for after his recall from the continent , he remarked that he no more deserved his present disgrace , than his former glory . The character of the young Ch6valier is also established in history , beyond the power of prejudice to alter . Nothing can be more natural , than that he should have Jelieved in his right to the English throne ,  --  a right , which had been admitted hy the nation itself for more than one generation , and which many lofty minds believed in so firmly , that they were willing to die in defence of it . He had been educated in this faith , which // was acknowledged with enthuejasm by those around him , and it could not be expected that he should be among the foremost to discover the defects of his title to the crown , or to renounce the inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , when he came to Scotland , a brave and accomplished young man . That he had talents , is sufficiently evident from his success ; for none hut an able men could have induced his adherents to embark in an enterprize so desperate from the beginning , nor could any other have kept together the discordant materials of his army , and wrought them up to such gigantic efforts , that the best armies of England , as fast as they met them , were successively swept away . It is true , that he afterwards fell into degrading habits and vices , but these were the consequence of his wretched fortunes ; and it is absurd to say , that because the evening was clouded , the morning could never have been fair . His disappointed adherents ascribed their misfortunes to him , and when he yvas manifestly unable to serve them , their loyalty changed into hatred and revenge . One of these was the chevalier Johnstone , another was Dr. King . The former , unless his work does him great injustice , equally weak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserter from his party , whose temper had been soured by the failure of all his political designs . But it is not necessary to enlarge on this point , since Scott , with his usual fairness , has taken the just view of the character of Charles Edward , and fixed it in the public mind with a depth of impression , which no time will wear away . It does not appear , that he received encouragement from any quarter , to attempt the invasion of England . A constant correspondence was kept up with the adherents of his party in England , but they , while they detested the Protestant succession , and were sufficiently discontented with their own position , had no taste for engaging in any bold adventure . Neither was France either able or willing to render efficient aid . They were willing to keep the exiled family as a thorn in the side of England , but they had not enough ' to ' gain from a change of dynasty , to make then willing to sacrifice much to effect it . The aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought to bear upon her by an invader . She was involved in one of those endless and unmeaning continental wars , in which she has always wasted her treasure and blood . Her army had but lately received a stunning and // almost Fatal blow ; her navy was , as usual , engaged at the world 's end , and the people were complaining bitterly of war , oppression and taxes . But this discontent , which is always found in every free nation , while it seems to those without like the last struggle of life , is , in fact , nothing more than one of the conditions of national existence in a state of freedom ; and should any invader attempt to take advantage of it , he finds that all parties unite , and direct upon him that energy which they have just been wasting in quarrels with each other . And while he had little prospect of aid from others , his own resources were exceedingly few and small . He had no experienced officer with him , and his money was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the essential thing , it was with extreme difficulty that he was able to reach Scotland , almost alone . The welcome which Charles received when he first arrived in Scotland , was as discouraging as possible ; but he had made up his mind to the enterprise , and was determined not to be withheld by the power of his enemies or the coldness of hi* friends . Lie landed with only seven attendants , at Borodale , a farm belonging to Clanranald , a gallant young chieg who represented to him the hopelessness of the undertaking , but ended by devoting his heart and hand to the service of his master . In this act of fidelity , he was , at the time , entirely alone : the Government had many powerful friends in the region , and no other chief had yet declared in favor of Charles . When we remember that this chieftain was fully aware of his danger , that he saw from the first what the result would be , and that , with these impressions in his mind , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , this seems to us like one of the noblest actions which history records . For to follow a sentiment ,  --  to have a noble sentiment inspire the heart with such power , as to make the man hold death and danger light ,  --  to have the sentiment of selfsacrifice act upon the heart , with more power than any prospect of personal advantage , is a decided proof of moral greatness , such as makes the coldest heart burn within . The first who came to Charles Edward at Borodale , was Donald Cameron , called young Lochiel , because his father was still living , though an exile on account of his former exertions in favor of the Stuarts . On his way , Lochiel called on his brother John Cameron , to whom he made known his // purpose of visiting the Prince , in order to convince him that his design was impracticable . But his brother , who knew his character , warned him that the voice of Charles Edward would waken all the sleeping fires of loyalty in his breast . Lochiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted all his eloquence to induce him to return to France . But Charles declared to him that he would persevere , if he went on alone ; and that Lochiel , the brave and loyal , might remain at home , and hear how his prince had fallen . This appeal was irresistible , and the fate of the whole enterprise depended upon its success ; for we are told by Home , that had Lochiel declined following , not another chief in all the Highlands would have taken arms for the exiled king . Charles Edward , encouraged by this success , removed to Kinlochmoidart , and thence to Lochshiel , near the eastern extremity of which he had determined to set up his standard . Meantime the commander of Fort Augustus , hearing some obscure reports of his movements , despatched two companies to Fort William , twenty-eight miles distant , to keep those districts in order . The path of this detachment lay on the steep sides of mountains . As they approached a bridge which crossed a mountain torrent , they heard the sound of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Highianders , whose force they could not discern . Their number in reality did not exceed twelve , but the officer , perceiving the disadvantage of his position , attempted to retreat ; while he was returning , he was surrounded by other clans , and compelled to surrender . This little success tended very much to encourage the Highlanders , and to prepare them for the coming war . The standard was raised in the vale of Glenfinnin , and Charles Edward found himself at the head of a force of twelve hundred men . He then declared war upon the Elector of Hanover , the usurper of his father 's throne . That king was in Hanover when the insurrection began . The nation was governed by a regency in his absences and the affairs of the North were entrusted to an officer called Secretary of State for Scotland . The first intelligence of danger was communicated by the celebrated Duncan Forbes , President of the Court of Session , who exerted his powers and spent his fortune in the service of the King on this occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be too apt to give . He went to Sir John Cope , commander of the forces in Scotland , // with a letter which he had received from a Highland gentleman , giving a distinct intimation of the danger . Cope sent notice at once to the Secretary , the Marquess of Tweedale , advising that arms should be transmitted to the North for the use of the loyal clans . But so inefficient were all arrangements , that nothing was done ; and it is a little* remarkable , that Cope , who was the only public officer who had sense enough to understand the danger , should have so entirely lost his reputation for military foresight and skill . It is one of the most common expedients of political foolishness in high places , to make others the scape-goats for its own sins . But the truth is , that the British army of that day was ridiculously inefficient . From the days of Marlborough , it had been constantly declining in discipline and vigor ; but the decay was not felt , because all the particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was neglected but the man . In fact , there was hardly any approach to reform in these respects , till Napoleon opened his great military school for the nations , and gave lessons in it which will not soon be forgotten in the world . Can the imagination conceive of any thing more profoundly absurd , than Braddock 's army going forth , in powdered wigs , to engage in bush-fights with the Indians ? So lately as the Revolutionary war , we are told by Wilkinson , that the Connecticut lighthorse presented themselves at the camp in full bottomed wigs , and were welcomed with most irreverent mirth by the commanding officer , General Lee . The dress , however , was in keeping with all the rest of the system , which , heside being weak , was inefficient , unmanageable , and wholly unfit to contend with the wild fury of the Highlanders , who paid not the least regard to the graces and refinements of war . If the Highlands had been within the Arctic circle instead of being almost within sight of Edinburgh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely unmformed , both with respect to Charles Rdward 's motions , and the amount of danger which they had need to dread . Cope took counsel with the well known Andrew Fletcher and Duncan Forbes , the latter of whom was familiar with the Highlands , where by his talents and eloquence he had converted many chiefs from Jacobitistn ; their advice was , that he should march forward at once , and endeavor to strike an effectual 1 ) 10w before all the disaffected clans had time to assemble in // arms . As his own opinion coincided with theirs , he led out his army of fourteen hundred men , intending to garrison Fort Augustus , which is in the centre of the district where the troubles began . Though he was to move through the Alpine passes of the Highlands , he was incumbered with vast quantities of baggage , and even with cannon , beside the arms which he had provided for the use of the loyal clans . But he needed a Baillie Jarvie , to inform him that the Highianders may quarrel and gie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a claytnore , but they are sure to join in the lang run , against a ' civilized folk that wear breeks . ' He found excuses in abundance , but no reinforcements ; his baggage horses were stolen , and the supplies necessarily left in the hands of those who hoped to officiate as his executors : all manner of contradictory intelligence was furnished to mislead him , so that he was at last completely bewildered . Finding his situation extremely dangerous , he turned aside to Inverness , after taking the opinions of a council of war . This was precisely the movement which the insurgents wanted ; it left open the path for them to descend to the Lowlands , and the impression that the English were afraid to encounter them , had a great effect in filling up the ranks of their army . It was only necessary to gain the chief ; whatever side he chose , was adopted by the clansmen , though it was sometimes necessary , as Voltaire said of the execution of Admiral Byng , to shoot one , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most successful pains to gain the favor of all , by adopting their manners , speaking their language , and walking at their side . His appearance and bearing are said , by those who saw him , to have been very noble and engaging ; his figure was tall and commanding ; his face had that thoughtful expression which his unfortunate race are all said to have borne , like a prophetic seal upon their brow ; these personal advantages , together with the air of high birth , and the associations , which surrounded him like a glory in the land of his fathers , gave him resistless power over the affections of that warm-hearted people . But his long flowing hair seemed so unfashionable in that day , that one of his Highland guards , seeing an Edinburgh baillie with a xvig of most voluminous proportions , seized It without ceremony , and to the equal horror of the prince and citizen , transferred it to Charles Edward 's head . // The movement of Cope removed every obstacle , which could have prevented Charles from pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while that unfortunate general sent for transports , to convey his army back to the city . Great was the consternation in the capital , when they found that the invaders were coming down upon them , and their preparations were such as fear is apt to suggest , which most endanger those who use them . They immediately organized a civil militia ,  --  a kind of forcewhich has at least its harmlessness to recommend it , and made other demonstrations , which remind one of l3rinkerhoW as described by Knickerbocker , who , when the British fleet appeared on the coast , stationed two swivels in his entry , the one pointing to the front , the other to the back door . Home , the historian , in an anonymous pamphlet , made himself exceedingly merry with these proceedings , and their value is proved by the fact , that when the commander marched out at their head , to encamp beyond the city walls , on turning at the gate to look upon the warlike , columns , he found that , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer visihle to the naked eye ; the duty of self-preservation had struck them as peculiarly impressive and binding , and as their consciences were made more delicate than usual by the circumstances , they felt that they could not answer for wantonly throwing away their lives . This sentiment was so general , that when the Highlanders entered the city by night , they saw nothing but a few nightcapped heads , put forth indignantly , to ask why their sleep was so unseasonably broken . Edinhurgh , with the exception of the castle , surrendered without a blow , and the adventurer was established in Holyrood , the palace and house of his fathers . Charles Edward held his court in the palace , where lie was surrounded by the chivalry and beauty of the land . They felt as if the ancient glory and independence of Scotland were alive again , after having been lost for ages . It is true that wealth and splendor did not abound but this defect by no means served to destroy the resciablauce to former times . The general enthusiasm was extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by those beautiful melodies , full of political allusions thinly veiled under expressions of lover-like attachment , which kept up a feeling , 1 ) 0th in cottages and castIes , that there would be one luck about the house till // its rightful lord returned . The Prince was called by the Highlanders , Charlich , or Charli , which was his own name translated into the Gaelic , and which sounded in the Lowlands so affectionate and familiar , that he was generally known as Prince Charlie . His way thus prepared , his very foot had music i n't , as he went up the stair . ' As he was ascending the staircase of Holyrood , James Hepburn of Keith , who is said by his enemies to have been a noble specimen of chivalrous * race and honor , stepped forward and ushered him into the hall of the ancient kings of Scotland . Charles Edward , feeling the necessity of vigorous action , remained but three days in Edinburgh before he hastened to encounter Cope ; who , not a little indignant at being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was burning for an opportunity to redeem his military fame . The armies met at Preston , and those who saw the disorderly line of the Highlanders , compared with the firm and brilliant ranks of the royal army , believed that their meeting would put an end to the cause of the Stuarts forever . The battle is described in Waverley . Though , as Evan Dhu remarked , the churchyard of Tranent , which was in the field , was a very convenient place for any gentleman who might have the misfortune to be killed , and might chance to be curious about Christian burial , very few in the English army were inclined to avail themselves of that advantage . The Highlanders came down like a thundercloud bursting upon them ; their ranks were at once broken in confusion , the General was borne away iy the retreating torrent , and no one maintained the honor of England , but the celebrated Colonel Gardiner , who , deserted by his own troop , put himself at the head of a few resolute men , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was on the border of the battle field . General Cope carried to the south the news of his own entire defeat , and unmerciful was the ridicule which followed him . Home , in the pamphlet to . which we have alluded , says that he had once seen an Italian opera , in which Caisar was represented as giving orders to his men to take to their heels , and encouraging them by his energetic example ; so that Sir John Cope answered to some descriptions of Cresar , if not to all . The melancholy and the ludicrous are seldom brought so near to each other , as on this occasion . While the field was covered not only with bodies , but with limbs , which had been hewn off by the broadswords , and while // the wounded lay bleeding in every apartment of Colonel Gardiner 's house , where the stains are seen in the floors to this day , the Highlanders were engaged in the work of plunder , though profoundly ignorant of the use and value of the most common things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took for a living animal , to an officer , saying that he was glad to be rid of the creature , which had died shortly after he caught it ; when it had stopped for want of winding up . A gentleman , whose horses had been taken for the use of the army , applied to Lord George Murray after the battle , to have them restored . The General told him that he could by no means consent to such a measure ; but , ' said he , the horses are all in Tranent churchyard ; watch your opportunity , pick out your horses and make the best of your way home . ' The advice , was followed , and the proprietor recovered his horses , or at least provided himself with others as good . The course which Charles Edward wished to pursue , was to march directly for England , where the panic caused by the defeat at Preston would go before them , and do as much for them as their arms . This counsel , had it been adopted , might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who believed , that by remaining in Edinburgh for a time , he might recruit his forces , and obtain valuable and important friends . He certainly succeeded in gaining the ladies to his party , so that Duncan Forbes complained , that he could not get one man of se*se to aid him , so fearful were they of dis .. pleasing wives or mistresses , by acting against the young chevalier . The clergy were zealous against him , but were entirely unmolested ; Charles was sufficiently a man of the world to laugh heartily when he heard of the devotions of the Rev. Mr. M'Vickar , who prayed that the young person , who had come in search of an earthly crown , might soon have a heavenly one , which was a great deal better . Whatever Charles 's maxims of government might have been , , had he reached the throne , he always seemed perfectly indifferent to the Catholic faith , and would not probably have exerted himself to restore it The battle of Preston or Gladsmuir was fought on the 21st of September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation were sufficiently alarmed . A large force was despatched to Scotland under Marshal Wade , and part of the continental army was ordered home to defend the country . But such was the manner in which military operations were // then conducted , that it was not before the last of October , that these troops were on their way . About the same time , Charles Edward left Edinburgh to cross the Enolish borders , dividing his army in such a manner , as to leave it uncertain where they would enter the kingdom . These bodies were at last concentrated before Carlisle , a place formerly of great strength , and still defended by a castle and a wall . The city was summoned to surrender it refused , and preparations were made to besie*re it in form . When the garrison found that the hesiegers were in earnest , as they had actually no means of resistance , they 6ave up the city and castle . This new success rang like a knell through England , and aided to increase the terrifying impression which prevailed , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on hearing this news , felt as if something must be done ; he immediately put Ins troops in motion at Newcastle ; but there happened to he a fall of snow , which made the roads somewhat unpleasant ; he therefure concluded to return to his station . and wait for comfortable travelling . This officer seems to have resembled the Russian admiral , who officiated as a General at the time of Napoleon 's invasion , and was said to have felt unable to bring iw his force to the scene of action , on one important occasion , by reason of an unfavorable wind . The road was now open for the invading army to proceed to London . But all the exultation arising from this wonderful success , was overbalanced , by their finding *o accessions in the towns through which they passed . There were Jacobites enough in England ; but few were animated with the chivalrous spirit of the Highlanders . Had the Prince succeeded , he would have found thousands declaring in his favor ; but so long as the event was uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives to aid him . In truth , the chances of his final success were exceedingly small . The army under the Duke of Cumberland had now returned ; his own little army was outnumbered by more than two to one ; he had penetrated further into the heart of England , than any invader since the Norman conquest ; there was no hope that he could do more , though the metropolis , and indeed all England , was in a state of profound dismay . Six miles beyond Derby was the utmost point reached by the invading army , and this was within four days ' march of London . It is not distinctly known what counsels induced them to return ; the Prince // urged them to press onward , with the zeal and eloquence of one who is pleading for his life ; but he could not prevail ; and when they began their retum , he seemed in perfect despair . His bearing , as described by those who were with him , was precisely similar to that of Fergus McLvor , as painted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed that the interest of the story must have ended , when all hopes of success were evidently gone ; but the desperate nature of the enterprise gives it so much romantic attraction , that the interest increases , instead of declining , from the moment when they commenced their return . The return was more dangerous too than the advance , and was conducted with greater firmness and skill . They had stolen two days ' march upon the English army , before the Duke of Cumberland knew any thing of their movements : but when it was ascertained that they had aclually commenced their retreat , his courage and that of his army began to rise ; it seemed to be the first time they had breathed freely for six weeks , during which a small and ill appointed force had carried the standard of Glenfinnin a hundred and fifty miles into the heart of England , in the face of a hostile people , and of an army which immeasurably exceeded theirs in discipline and numbers . That army could boast , like Sancho , that they feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been any one among them , from the highest to the lowest , who was in the least ambitious of the crown of patriotic martyrdom or of any posthumous fame . The English army pursued , but they seem to have taken judicious care not to proceed too fast ; for though they were mounted , and the Highlanders on foot , a fortnight passed before even the cavalry overtook them . Marshal Wade , whose army lay nearer Scotland than that of Charles , sent a force , mounted , that they might not suffer from bad walking , to cut off'their retreat : but they arrived at the place where they had heard of the Highlanders , some time after it had been deserted ; and having thus obeyed their orders , they seem to have thought it more safe and social to join the army of Cumberland . The order which was sent to the north to break down bridges , was another interruption ; a river , however wild and rapid , was no more interruption to a Highlander , than to a wild bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were compelled // to wait till boats could be prepared , or to submit to the painfail necessity of wetting their feet . The rear guard was commanded by Lord George Murray , a man of great courage and talent , who , when the English army came nearer , contrived to keep them at bay , by making it dangerous to approach him . Being delayed by the breaking down of some baggage wagons , the enemy came upon him ; his force consisted of but two or three hundred men , and he applied to the Prince for a reinforcement , with permission to turn the flank of Cumberland 's army . The permission was refused , and orders were sent him to retreat ; but , after requesting the messenger to say nothing of the orders he had brought , he determined to give them a check with what force he had ; he therefore drew up his troops in order for battle , and the English army came up just as the sun was setting . After making his hasty arrangements , which were not completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge upon the English , lighted on by the moon , which broke at intervals through the dark clouds . The dragoons were forced back , with the loss of one hundred and fifty , while the Highlanders lost but twelve : this was the conflict at Penrith , in which Scott represents Fergus Mclvor as taken prisoner ; it fully answered the purpose : the Scotch general drew off his little force unmolested ; his enemies seemed to be of the same mind with Dogberry , who , when asked by the watch , what they must do if they saw a thief breaking into a house , were told by that official , that in his opinion , the less they had to do with that sort of people , the better . After leaving a garrison in Carlisle , which was soon obliged to surrender , the army of Charles re-crossed the border . The Duke of Cumberland then thought his further services unnecessary , and returned to London , leaving the remainder of the campaign to be conducted by General Hawley and Marshal Wade . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crush the rebels , exhausted as they were by their long march in the depth of winter ; but nothing was done to prevent their moving on to Glasgow , a place bitterly hostile to the Stuarts , where , perhaps by way of punishment , the Chevalier recruited his army , which was fainting with hunger and want of rest . A citizen of Glasgow , seventy years after , described his appearance to Mr. Chambers . I managed , ' said this ancient , to get so near him , as he passed to his lodgings , // that I could have touched him with my hand ; and the impression which he made on my mind , will last as long as I live . He had a princely aspect , and its interest was much heightened hy the dejection , which appeared in his pale fair countenance and his downcast eye . He evidently wanted confidence in his cause , and seemed to have a melancholy foreboding of that disaster , which , soon after , ruined all the hopes of his family forever . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command* of Cumberland 's army . His character seems to have resembled that of Vain Glory in Bunyan , since , without reflecting that what had befallen others might possibly happen to him , he expressed himself on all occasions with the utmost contempt for his brother generals and their forces , who had been beaten by what he considered a contemptible foe . As he approached Edinburgh , a party of Gardiner 's dragoons came out to congratulate him : he received them with a sharp and scornful reproof for their cowardice at Preston , and warned them , that , should there be another engagement , he would not let them off so easily , unless they conducted themselves better . While his army was reposing in Edinhurgh , Charles Edward was laying siege to Stirling castle , but without success . Hawley , finding that a good opportunity was presented for gaining immortal fame , sent out his forces to Falkirk , a memorable field , where a great battle had been fought in defence of Scottish freedom four centuries before , determined perhaps to establish among its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Highlanders were not in the habit of declining an engagement , and Charles Edward , when he found that his enemy really offered hattle , drew up his army on Plean moor , not far from the illustrious field of Bannockburn . The recollections of either ground were favorable to the army which encamped upon it ; at Falkirk , the arms of England , after a bloody conflict , had compelled Wallace to retreat ; while at Bannockburn , Bruce had given them an overthrow'so decided , that it almost annihilated the English power . Hawley was possessed with such contempt for the Highlanders , that he hardly thought it necessary to observe their motions . Charles Edward took advantage of this vain confidence : he did not allow his own officers to know his purpose , hut , after causing one body to retire to Stirling , in order to persuade the English that he was retreating , he despatched // bus army , in two divisions , one to the right , the other to the left of Hawley 's line . Meantime his great standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still his head quarters , though it was entirely deserted . So unapprehensive were the English of danger , that General Hawley accepted an invitation to breakfast with the Countess of Kilmarnock , a beautiful enthusiast in the cause of Stuart , who paid this attention to the English commander only to decoy him from his duty . It is said that Sir John Cope , who knew from sad experience , from what quarter disaster was likely to come , had taken bets to the amount of ten thousand pounds , that Hawley , who had been very severe upon him , would have no better success than his own ; and he must have been greatly delighted with the result , which placed his censor in a more humiliating attitud* than himself , before the public eye . Between one and two o'clock , scouts came pouring in upon the English army , announcing that their enemies were at hand . The drums beat to arms , the lines were formed , and all possible efforts made by the officers on duty ; but the absence and neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the imagination that he had sold them to the enemy : at last he came , galloping up to the troops , with his head uncovered , and his whole appearance so disordered , as only to increase the panic which had already begun to spread . The day , which had hitherto been clear , began to exhibit the signs of a gathering winter storm , a circumstance by no means cheering to troops , who were unused to the rough climate of Scotland . Finding that Charles was endeavoring to reach the heights , from which he might overwhelm the English with one of the thundering Highland charges , Hawley resolved to dispute the ground , and therefore ordered his dragoons to advance , and the infantry to follow them , with fixed bayonets , up the sides of the hill . But the Highlanders succeeded in gaining the summit , and for a time , the armies stood opposed to each other , with a hollow between . As it was now four o'clock , and the night was already beginning to fall , Hawley ordered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Highianders would stand the shock ; but the moment they approached Charles Edward 's army , and received their fire , they fell back in confusion . When the dragoons were thus disposed of , the clans - rushed forward , and the southern half of the English army was at once swept away before the re // sistless tide . Those who witnessed the rout , describe it as instantaneous ; they saw the English army enter the misty ridge on the hill ; then came the sound of a heavy fire , and rolling folds of smoke ; immediately after , the soldiers broke from the cloudy masses , and fled wild with disorder . In less than ten minutes from the opening of the action , the victory was almost complete . Some of the English avmy rallied and made a sp5rited resistance ; but Charles Edward , advancing with his reserve , compelled them to retreat with the rest . They did so without disorder : but the rest were so easily overpowered , that the Highland officers believed it to be a feint , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struggle , who had fought so bravely at Fontenoy . An idea prevailed , that Hawley had only retired for a time , and would renew the attack next morning ; but the true state of the armies was soon understood , and after being exposed to the storm for five hours , Charles Edward entered Falkirk , and took possession of the cannon , baggage , and all the military stores of Hawley . The loss of the Highlanders was very small ; and the regiments of the English army which resisted , beside saving their reputation , actually suffered much less than those which fled . When the flying parties reached Edinburgh next day , all was consternation there . At no time , was the public feeling so entirely dejected ; for no one had dreamed of defeat . The troops of Hawley were not , like those of Cope , raw levies ; they were veterans , who had seen the hard service of Dettingen , and other hardfought battles . Hawley endeavored to conceal his mortification as well as he could ; he represented himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , and said that he was induced to make a retrograde movement , to prevent the rebels from getting between him and Edinburgh . But it is easier for bulletins to lie , than to induce the public to believe them . The storm which he accused as the cause of his want of success , did not beat half so severely as the shower of ridicule which fell upon him ; and which , it must be acknowledged , he had both provoked and deserved . After the campaign was ended , and the dragoons put into quarters at Redding , one day , when the horses were all feeding together , a storm came up which seemed to remind the animals of Falkirk ; they arranged themselves in a sort of array , and stood trembling and snorting as if waiting for the fire . It soon began to thunder , upon // which they turned , and fled through the town as fast as on the 17th of January ; thus , as if possessed with the spirit of comic action , rehearsing the scenes at Falkirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders . Prince Charles 's army did not follow up this victory with much energy ; they were exhausted by long labors , and were also sensible that it would be impossible for them to accomplish their first design , that of driving the Protestant succession from the throne . Moreover the dissensions which had before interfered with the daring plans of their chief , had their effect on this occasion : the generals of his army constantly accused each other , as if the fortune of the enterprise could in that way be redeemed . While the Highlanders were sad even in victory , their enemies took courage under their perpetual defeat . By charging every misfortune upon the incapacity of their generals , they endeavored to cover the disgrace of their arms . They knew too that there were resources enough in the nation , could they be brought to bear , to sweep away an army ten times as great as that of Charles . The news of the rout at Falkirk reached the court of St. James , on the day when a drawing room was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Cumberland was ordered to proceed immediately to Scotland , where he arrived on the 30th of January , 1746 . He was very much beloved by the troops , probably from his resemblance to the rank and file in personal accomplishments ; and by some mysterious confidence they felt persuaded that he would lead them to victory on that occasion , though he never had done so before . As the insurgents had already determined to retire to the Highlands , the victory was , in fact , gained already , by the despondency of Charles Edward , rather than by Cuinberland 's arms . We should rather say , by the despondency of his generals ; for on the 20th , Charles held a review at Bannockburn , with a view to another battle , when he found that his numbers were reduced to five thousand . On the 29th , Lord George Murray and the principal chiefs presented an address to him , in which they represented that it would be impossible to fight with the least hope of success , and that a retreat to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit their dwindling bands . Charles reluctantly submitted to necessity , and crossed the Forth on his way to the Highlands . The Duke pursued as rapidly as possible ; but though // at the commencement of the chase he was only one day 's march behind them , the distance had increased threefold in less than a week . While the Highianders dashed through the streams , he could not pass them without a long course of solemnities . Finding the pursuit unavailing , and seeing no attraction in the wintry prospect of the Highland mountains , he determined to suspend his movements for a time , magnifying the exploit of fishing up a few spiked guns from the bed of the Tay , and sending out parties to inflict those beastly cruelties upon the inhabitants of the region , which have brought lasting contempt upon his name . Charles Edward , meantime , severe as the climate of February is in the north of Scotland , continued his march till he came to Inverness , which was garrisoned by two thousand men under the Earl of Loudoun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Highlands , one of which he commanded in person , the other was led by Lord George Murray . Before making any attempt upon Inverness , he determined to wait for that General to join him , and in the interval , apprehending no danger , he gave rest and indulgence to his troops , who had suffered so much in their campaign . His head quarters were established at the castle of Moy , belonging to the Laird of MacIntosh , who was in the royal service under Lord Loudoun , while his lady commanded the clan in the service of Charles Edward . Lord Loudoun , having ascertained that the Prince felt perfectly secure , formed a plan to seize him , and having given positive orders that no one should leave Inverness , which was guarded in all directions , he marched out one night at the head of fifteen hundred men toward the castle of Moy . It was never precisely known how Charles Edward received warning ; but probably there were many , MacIntosh among the number , who served in the royal army to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clans were with the Chevalier . A girl of thirteen came running to the castle of Moy at midnight , to give the alarm , and Lady MacIntosh , having no better force at hand at the moment , sent out a country blacksmith , with half a dozen others , to watch the progress of the royal troops . This worthy , who , like all the Hi ghlanders , was most at home in scenes of confusion , by no means considered his trust confined to , mere observation , and as the king 's troops were coming to surprise others , thought it night be as well to surprise them . He therefore planted his // men at intervals along the road , and when he heard the approach of the troops , fired his piece and lifted up his voice as if giving orders , all which ceremonies were repeated by his companions , with so much energy , that the English were convinced that the Camerons , MacDonalds , and a hundred other clans , had ensnared them in an ambush , and were about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fled , and as the rear , not comprehending the cause of alarm , did not get out of the way , they were trampled down in great numbers . The blacksmith gave them no quarter , but kept up his fearful shoutings , till not a man was left in the field . He acted up to the maxim of his profession , to strike while the iron was hot , and did it with so much success , that the Master of Ross , who was in Loudoun 's army , afterwards said he had been in many scenes of danger , hut never was in such fear and peril as in the breathless rout at Moy . The next morning , Charles Edward advanced to Inverness , and the English General , not having recovered from his alarm , retreated into Ross , thus cutting himself off from Cumberland 's army , and making himself useless for the rest of the campaign . We have been thus particular in describing this engagement , because this General afterwards served in America ; his name appears in Mr. Sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , we can not say ; history , that should have recorded them , had something else to do . While Charles Edward held possession of Inverness , the Duke of Cumberland had his head quarters at Aberdeen , a hundred miles distant , waiting , according to the military fashion of the day , till the weather should be pleasant and the travelling good , before he entered again upon the fatigues of a campaign . The Highland army employed their time in reducing the forts and driving away the parties which annoyed them , which they accomplished with almost invariable success . They were sustained by the expectation of aid from France ; nor was Louis at all backward in his attempts to aid them ; but the British cruisers were so numerous on the coast , that it was impossible for the vessels which he despatched for the purpose , to reach their destination . The troops of Charles Edward , thus destitute of resources , began to be reduced to great distress in a country , where there is not more food supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sufferin.g which they underwent from hunger , was proba // bly the immediate cause of their desperate engagement with the English at Culloden , where their force was entirely broken and scattered to the winds . They hardly hoped for success in this bold measure ; but , situated as they were , they felt disposed to anticiDate , rather than to wait for their doom . It was not till the beginning of April , that the English army thought it sufficiently pleasant to advance ; which they did with great deliberation , keeping time with the fleet , which coasted along the shore . On the 15th , they reached Nairn , which was but sixteen miles from Charles Edward 's position and the Chevalier , finding that his army must perish , either by defeat or decay , thought it best to hazard an action , though his own army was not much more than half as numerous as the other , which was besides well supplied with provisions and all other military stores , in all which his own troops were miserahly wanting . He therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of Inverness , where he drew them up in battle array , to receive the Duke of Cumberland . This place is a vast heathy level , two miles from the south shore of the Moray Frith , and ten or twelve from Nairn . The place is favorable to the action of artillery and cavalry ; and the safer course would have been to retire to the hills , in order to take advantage of the movements of the enemy ; but the Highlanders , it must be remembered , were on the point of starving , and after being depressed hy a retreat , would not have held together another day . There was in an engagement at least a chance of success , while in a retreat there was none . As there was little hope of meeting the enemy in open field , when their force was so unequal , Charles Edward , with his usual activity and enterprise , determined to make an attack by night upon the camp of the enemy , which was at this time about nine miles distant . The attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed by the faults of his predecessors , took every precaution against surprise ; and should the enterprise fail ! there was nothing left on which to rely . When he submitted the proposal to his officers , they consented to it as a last resource , though they had hut little confidence in its success . They then went to recall their men , who were wandering in search of fond ; but many of them told their officers , that they might shoot them if they pleased , but they were too much exhausted to obey them . When the time arrived , not more than half the little army could be collected ; // 446 April , with these he proceeded , placing Lord George Murray , his principal officer , at the head , while he himself commanded the second line . The men were charged not to use fire arms , but only bayonets , dirks and broadswords ; the night was as dark as ever fell ; but this , instead of favoring their enterprise , was entirely against them ; for , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been easily detected , they were soon bewildered among the fields and plantations , through which they attempted to force their way . These obstacles delayed them so long , that it was two in the morning before they came within three miles of the enemy ; and the General , calling a council of officers , who agreed that it would be impossible to reach their destination before day-break , determined , though with the utmost reluctance , to return to the former position . They reached it at seven in the morning , thoroughly exhausted . Their wants were so pressing that Charles Edward gave orders immediately to seize , for the use of the army , all provisions that could be found in the country . The foraging parties returned with supplies ; but before they could be prepared for the famishing soldiers , the hour of decision was come . At eleven in the forenoon , the lines of the English army began to appear on the verge of the moor . The Prince had retired to rest in Culloden House ; but as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the army . He there exerted himself to collect his men , who amounted in all to about five thousand , in wretched condition for fighting with a force immeasurably superior , not only in numbers , but in all the other elements of strength . His officers advised retreat and delay , but Charles Edward was fully convinced that his army could hold together no longer , and hoped besides , that the stormy charge which had so often succeeded , would open a path for them to victory again . The line was formed by the clans in their order . Lord George Murray commanded the right wing and Lord John Drummond the left . It was with difficulty that a sufficient number of men could be collected to form a second line . The Duke of Cumberland made preparations on his part , one of the most essential of which seems to have been , to prevent his men from indulging their taste for running away . This way of securing life was rendered less attractive by a martial law , which made it punishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with courage , imploring them to dismiss the remembrance of former failures from their minds , though they were evidently quite fresh in his own . They were then led forward to the charge , and formed in perfect order at the distance of five hundred paces from the Highland line . While this was done , one of those incidents took place , which show the wild spirit of loyalty that animated the mountaineers . One of them , a ragged , wretched-looking creature , approached the English , and demanded quarter . He was sent to the rear , where he walked about apparently quite indifferent to the ridicule which his uncouth appearance excited . But he was watching his opportunity ; and when Lord Bury , one of the Duke 's aids , approached , the Highlander , mistaking him for the commander in chief , seized a soldier*s musket and discharged it at that officer , waiting , as a matter of course , for the fire by which he himself was immediately shot down . The battle was commenced by the Highlanders with their cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered with terrible effect by the batteries of the English army . The day , which till then had been bright and fair , now became overcast , and a storm of snowy rain beat directly in the faces of the Prince 's men . The great object with each party seemed to be to make the other begin the attack : the English would not do this , because they saw that their artillery was rapidly thinning the ranks of their enemies ; and Charles was under the necessity of making the attack . He sent orders to that effect to Lord George Murray ; but the messenger was killed by a cannon-ball : the order , however , was unnecessary , for that officer , a man of fiery courage , took upon himself the responsibility of ordering the charge . The onset was as dreadful , as could be inspired by the energy of rage and despair . Though three ranks of the English poured a fire of musketry upon them ,  --  though the cannon , loaded with grapeshot , swept the whole surface of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel , on they went like a whirlwind , and the front line of the English army reeled and gave way , though not till many a brave chief had fallen . But the English army was so numerous , that before the Highlanders could reach the second line of their enemy , they were entirely destroyed : the last man fell just as he came up to the points of the bayonets . Some few attempted to retreat , and // some of the clans , discontented with the place assigned them , had taken no part in the action ; but the greater part of them were *trown in layers three or four deep upon the field . When Charles Edward saw that his front line had failed in the charge , he attempted to lead forward the second . For a time they checked the advance of the English : hut all efforts were unavailing , and they in turn gave way . The Prince lingered on the field , from which he could hardly be forced away : he felt with a true forehoding , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin of his hopes , his family and his own illustrious name . The line where the Highlanders charged that day is still distinctly marked by their graves : they were buried in pits in the places where they fell , to the number of two thousand . - The scene , ' says the celebrated traveller , Dr. Clarke , is a wide heath , whose uniform and melancholy surface is only interrupted by turf-grown sods , rising at intervals , where , hushed in death , repose the bodies of the brave but ill-fated Caledonians . Wherever these mounds appear , the heath no longer grows , but the white clover and the daisy , mingled with a fine green turf , betray the deposite , mantled by their verdure . ' The cruelty which the English exercised after their victory is wholly unexampled in civilized lands . According to the statement of one of their own number , they looked more like an army of butchers than of soldiers , as they ran round the field stabbing and mangling the wounded : they doubtless had the feeling toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , human to appearance , who have boasted of the pleasure which they felt in shooting an Indian . The Duke of Curnherland himself encouraged this base revenge , and actually took a personal interest in it as it was going on . Soon after the battle , as he was riding over the field with Colonel Wolfe , afterwards so distinguished at Quebec , he saw a wounded Highlander , who looked up at him with a smile of defiance and scorn . He directed Wolfe to take his pistol and shoot the fellow for his insolence ; but that highminded officer replied , that he would resign his commission if it was required , but that he would not consent to be an executioner : a reply which , honorable as it was , lost him the favor of his chief . But , without taking the counsel implied in this answer , the Duke sent out parties to shoot the Highlanders wherever they could find them . They collected the wounded in heaps , and murdered them in cold blood . Many of these // miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of battle ; some persons were charitably engaged in giving them relief : these were all shut in by the soldiers , the building set on fire ; and all within it , to the number of between thirty and forty , were burned to death . But even this act is exceeded by another : nineteen Highland officers , too severely wounded to retreat , were found in a wood and carried to the courtyard of Culloden House , where they lay without the least attention paid to their wants or their wounds . On the third day they were thrown into a cart , ranged against the wall of a park , and the soldiers were directed first to shoot them , and afterwards to beat out their brains to make the work of destruction sure . It is some consolation to reflect that the person , who was responsible for these enormities , reaped afterwards some of the consequences , which show that the heavens* are just . Horace Walpole tells us , that the Duke of Cumberland was always suffering under the reproach of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done nothing more than his duty . Perhaps the ghastly remembrance was one cause of the depression which darkened all his later years . We have been thus particular , in describing the revenge of the Duke of Cumberland , because it shows what often passes in the world for glory . Mr. Croker , a well-known English politician , says that orders were found , addressed by Lord George Murray to his army , directing them to give no quarter ; these orders were forged afterwards , when the public opinion began to require some vindication of such proceedings ; but we hardly know what to think of Mr. Croker 's sense and feeling , who could intimate , that , supposing the order to be genuine , one piece of barbarity could serve as an excuse for another . Saul of my body , ' said Captain M'Turk , gin you promulgate sic doctrines among good company , it 's my belief you will bring somebody to the gallows . ' However this might be , there never was such a storm of popularity , as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , by acclamation , to the very summit of his profession . He was thanked by all the public bodies ; according to the usual fashion in such cases , he was hailed as the saviour of his country ; nor was his country satisfied with these cheap acknowledgments ; twenty-five thousand a year was added to his income ; and the government labored with great success , to efface the remembrance of former dishonor , by a parade of its present glory . // The civil government were not behind the army in following up the work of blood . The first executed were the prisoners taken at Carlisle , where Scott imagines Fergus McLvor to have suffered . Nine gentlemen were hanged , and then had their hearts torn out , and their bodies mangled , according to the English practice of the day . One of these gentlemen , who all died with great firmness , was a young man of family and fortune , who resembled Waverley in his circumstances , though not in his fate . With the wildness of youth , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was engaged to a young lady , who fully expected his pardon , but , finding that his fate was inevitable , determined to be present when he died . No remonstrance could prevent her , and she followed the procession in a coach , from which she witnessed the scene , apparently without emotion ; but the moment the shouts of the crowd rang in her ears , announcing that all was over , she closed her eyes and never breathed again . Some such tragical scenes as this , abated the appetite of the people for blood ; but the government were not so easily satisfied . It was not enough for them , that the Highlands were laid utterly waste , so that one could travel for miles , where villages had been , without hearing the crowing of a cock , or seeing the smoke of a single chimney ' ; it was not enough for them , that the best and bravest of every clan were slain in battle , and that the wretched survivors must wander in poverty , exile and despair ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuarts and their friends had been cast down , so as to leave no possibility of its ever rising again ; nothing would satisfy them , but the lives of their victims . The Lords Kilmarnock and Balmerino suffered in London ; the former moved all to compassion , by the grace and melancholy of his manner ; the latter inspired respect , and ahuost fear , by the iron bQldness , with which he expressed his contempt for his enemies and all that they could do . The fate of Lord Lovat , who had been traitor to every party , was the only one which was not regrett*d . Thus , in the strong language of Johnson , statutes reaped the refuse of the sword. * About eighty persons were thus butchered , with all the forms of law ; but this example was not wanted for any political pur-. pose , nor was it needed to show , that fear tends , more than any other passion , to make cannibals of men . The escape of Charles Edward , after the battle of Culloden , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // romantic adventures . His situation was dangerous in the extreme ; the reward of thirty thousand pounds quickened the exertions of those who pursued him , and the Duke 's instructions to these parties were expressed in very intelligible language . No prisoners , gentlemen ; you understand me . ' He had also reason to fear , that some , who had exposed themselves to the penalties of treason , would be tempted to betray him , in order to secure themselves . Lord George Murray sent a message to him , desiring that he would remain in Scotland ; but the chances were so much against him , that he determined as soon as possible to escape to the Western islands ; nor was his condition such as to admit of any delay ; for the English army immediately established posts in every part of the Highlands , and guarded the shore in such a manner as seemed to render it impossible to escape by sea . His first retreat in the islands was in Benbecula , where this descendant of a long line of kings resided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with a sail-cloth for his bed . He prepared with his own hands his humble ban quet ,  --  a cake of oatmeal , mixed with the brains of a cow . It was not long before Charles 's route was discovered by the English , who had traced him to Long island , which was immediately traversed by two thousand men , while war-vessels formed an unbroken line along the shore . While passing among the islands , which he was constantly obliged to do , to prevent his retreat from being discovered , he was chased for three leagues by an English ship , which he escaped by sailing among the rocks . On stealing out again to pursue his way , he was again discovered , and it was with the greatest difficulty he was able to reach Benbecula ; but as soon as he had landed , a sudden storm arose , which drove his pursuers out to sea . He and his companions subsisted upon shellfish , till notice of his condition could be sent to Clanranald , father of the gallant chief of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the chieftain came , he found the Prince cheerful indeed and undaunted , but miserably destitute of clothing , shelter and food . By the advice of Clanranald , they removed to a more secure biding place , near the centre of South Uist . Here he lodged for several weeks , in what was called the Forest House of Glencoradale , a place sufficiently wretched , but recommended by its having a convenient access , either to the ocean or the hills . // While he was in this retreat , he learned to his great dismay , that the English were determined to make a general sweep over all the islands . It seemed impossible that he should escape them longer ; nor would he perhaps , had it not been for the courage and generosity of a young lady , Flora Macdonald , whose name , as Dr. Johnson says , will live in history , ' where so many die : When the Doctor saw her , nearly thirty years after , he described her as a lady of pleasing person and elegant manners . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had talent and resolution which were equal to any dangers . She applied to her step-father , with whom she was then visiting , for a passport for herself and her two servants , a man and a woman ; he granted it at once , suspecting nothing . A female dress was then provided for the Chevalier , who was to pass as the female servant . When they went to carry him the dress and arrange their plan , they found him roasting the heart of a sheep on a wooden spit ; his condition moved them to tears . He welcomed them with great cheerfulness , saying that it would be well for all kings to pass through such discipline as he was then enduring . While they were together , they heard that General Cam phell had landed , with a great body of soldiers ; and Lady Clanranald , who was one of the party , immediately returned to the house to receive them . For her kindness to the unfortunate Prince , she and her husband afterwards suffered a long imprisonment at London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island , where he had passed two months in constant danger . He* was disguised as a female attendant of Miss Macdonald ; the man servant was represented by Mr. Macdonald , father to the Duke of Tarentum , afterwards so distinguished in Napoleon 's campainns . They took a boat to sail for the Isle of Skye , which was less vigilantly guarded than the rest of the islands . After sailing all night , they approached the island , when they were fired upon by a party of English soldiers , who had allowed them to come within shot , without giving any alarm . The 1 ) alls fell thick and fast around the boat ; but no persuasion would induce the Highland girl to lie down in the boat , to avoid them ; to all Charles Edward 's remonstrances she replied , that her concern was for his life , and not for her own . Skye was tenanted by the Macdonalds and McLeods , who had not taken arms in favor of the Stuarts . Flora proceeded , on landing , to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Cuinherlaud . His lady , who was well affected to the cause of Charles Edward , deputed Mi . Macdonald of Kingsburgh , to provide for his security and relief ; she could not receive him to her own house , which contained several English officers . Kingsburgh took him , with his two companions , to his own house . There he enjoyed a pleasure to which he had long been a stranger ,  --  that of sleeping in a bed . Such was the enthusiasm of loyalty , that Flora Macdonald kept one of the sheets in which he slept that night , through all the changes of her adventurous life , in Scotland and America ; and was wrapped in it as a *vinding sheet when she died . It was thought best that he should proceed to Raasay , where he took an affectionate leave of Flora and Kingsburgh , who had brought him safe through a great variety of dangers , and entrusted his safety now to equally chivalrous and honorable hands . Malcolm McLeod was his guide and friend , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long , though it was crowded with l ) erilous and interesting adventures . Finding that the pursuit hecarne too close in the islands , Charles Edward returned to the mainland ,  --  to the same region , where he had first set up his standard , and which was now desolated by the English revenge . Dr. Johnson says , that English vengeance wars not with the dead , ' but as the dead can not gain much from this praiseworthy forbearance , it might he as well to extend it to the living , when they become helpless and fallen . This district throws out several mountainous promontories into the sea , each of which was so guarded on the landward side , as to render it impossible , to appearance , to escape into the country , while the cruisers prevented an escape by sea . Having ascertained that Charles Edward was in one of these promontories , the English felt sure of their prey ; and for a space of twenty miles , a line of sentinels was established , who were stationed within sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at every station , so as to throw a bright light on all the region round . Each sentinel walked to his comrade 's fire , and then returned to his own , passing each other , midway between the beacons . Of course their backs were turned to each other after passing , and the space between left , for a short time , unobserved . This trifling defect in the arrangement was a circumstance which saved the life of the Chevalier . As constant search was made within the line of sentries , // which could hardly be evaded by all the activity and address of Charles Edward , and one or two Highland gentlemen who were with him , they found it necessary to pass the line at all hazards ; and accordingly effected their purpose , though with extreme danger , by creeping through the bed of a small mountain stream , at a time when the light of the fires was growing pale before the break of day . This remove , however , did not place him out of danger , nor did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together entirely destitute of food ; sometimes he slept under the shelter of rocks , and at one time he committed his safety to a band of robbers , who treated him with kindness and honor . While he was in this condition , his danger was lessened by a singular stratagem of Roderic Mackenzie , a young gentleman who resembled him in person ; when hiding in the Braes of Glenmorriston , he was cut down by the king 's soldiers , to whom he exclaimed , you have killed your Prince * The party cut off his head with unfeigned delight , and brought it to the Duke of Cumberland , who was equally happy to receive it . He set off with it to London , where it was ascertained to be a counterfeit ; but meantime , some of the troops had been withdrawn from the Highlands , under the impression that the great object of the search had been effected . It was not long before the region of Charles Edward 's retreat was again discovered ; but he had been so long accustomed to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and though the English soldiers were very often within sight of him , he did not suffer it to destroy his cheerfulness ; he had also been joined by his noble friend Lochiel , who was now wandering without a shelter , in lands where he held the rights and powers of a feudal chief . They lived in a place called the Cage , in the side of the mountain of Benalder . This was constructed in a thicket , by laying trees , covered with earth , to form a floor , while the trees around it formed its sides , woven with heath and birch , and thatched on the top with moss . It was called the Cage , from a great tree which leaned over it , forming the roof , and seemed to hold it suspended in the air . The smoke rose against the face of the rock , which it so much resembled in color , that one could not distinguish it even in the clearest day . In this wild shelter the Prince remained from the 5d till the 13th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels , despatched on purpose to bring him away , // had succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the English cruisers , and were anchored in a bay of the neighboring shore . Care was taken to inform as many as possible of the opportunity of escape thus presented , and many of his adherents were assembled , some to attend him in his flight , and others to hid him farewell . There were few in the Highlands , even of those engaged in the service of the government , who really wished misfortune to Charles Edward , though many were opposed to his enterprise , some from principle , and others because it seemed to them that the attempt must be hopeless , and could only serve to deluge the whole kingdom with blood . But even of these , there was not one , who could be tempted by **old to betray him ,  --  a fact which reflects immortal honor upon the Highland name . it sb happened , that his course in Scotland ended where it began . Moidart was the place where he landed fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embark , to leave the land of his fathers .
