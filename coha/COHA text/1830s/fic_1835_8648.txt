Grand Council Chamber . Doge and Senators discovered in debate . Doge . Doge of Venice I would not counsel to severity . If Venice be in danger , she has arms To wield the sword against all threatening foes , And hearts enough to bleed in her defence . Loredano . Loredano Should we not watch more jealous o'er her rights ? And rather crush rebellion in the bud , Than pamper it into luxurious growth By our delay ? Spain looks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety Wherewith our vigilance hath hedged the state :  --  France joins the envious league ;  --  their minions lurk Within the city 's bounds , to discontent Stirring the populace .  --  But one way offers Security  --  let laws too often slighted Reign in full force . Contarini . Contarini It doth become us here To feign sleep , but unclose a thousand eyes ; To treasure up each doubtful sign and word , To write down sighs . Loredano . Loredano Let all suspected die ! Let the first breath of treason be the signal To crush the offender . Veniero . Veniero For the guilty , arm Your power with all its terrors . Be severe , And firm , but frame not laws whose weight must fall Upon a thousand innocent heads , to reach One that deserves their penalty . Loredano . Loredano Would you bar The course of justice ? Veniero . Veniero Justice ! ye misname What is but cruelty . Is not your power Already vast enough ? If the pale slave Whisper of you , he bends his brow to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And mutters " Those above ! " A power so boundless , Why would you make but tyranny ? Loredano . Loredano ' T is right It should be so . The multitude esteem Each god a tyrant , and all tyrants gods . Not by the force of hostile powers without , A state will fall , if in herself she bear not , As doth the human frame , those hidden seeds That ripen for destruction .  --  Ours the charge To seek and root them out .  --  Look on the years Of our brave ancestors . The sacred yoke Of laws severe , inflexible and just , They bore unmurmuring  --  and the citizen Learned here the lesson to all Italy Besides , unknown  --  to govern and obey ! ' On such a policy shone days of splendor : Easy was then the task to put to rout The Gallic fleets ; to humble Frederick 's pride In a single conflict  --  and on every tower Raised by our foes beyond our country 's bounds , To plant the Lion standard of St. Mark . Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervened ; and ' gainst all Europe Leagued for our injury , alone and armed Stood forth the genius of Venetian power . ' Now times are changed . Now crime unblushing claims Impunity . In this degenerate age , Nor evils will be borne  --  nor remedies ! And we are branded with the name of tyrants , By every worthless flatterer of the people Who boasts himself a statesman , and would here Let crime pass scatheless . Veniero . Veniero Nay  --  why fix you thus Your glance on me ? am I the " worthless flatterer " Whom you would here denounce ? Loredano . Loredano Even as you will  --  Your conscience must reply . Doge . Doge of Venice Nay  --  nay  --  - my lords , Descend not here to brawl . Retire  --  and let The vote be taken . Contarini and Badoero count the votes . Senators of Venice , Ye to the public eye should be as gods , Not men thus passion moved . Contarini . Contarini Fathers ! the laws have triumphed . Read the decree . Badoero Badoero ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any Patrician be seen to hold intercourse in secret with the ambassadors of France or Spain , or pass their thresholds after sunset , he shall be held guilty of treason and shall suffer its penalty . " Doge . Doge of Venice ' T is well ; such is the Senate 's voice . And now Another duty . Summon Foscarini . A guard goes out , and returns with Foscarini . Antonio Foscarini ! To you our council hath decreed the trust Of the embassy to Switzerland . We will That you depart to-night . Foscarini . Foscarini My gracious lord , Humble , yet grateful , I receive the trust You 're pleased to invest me with . My years are few , Yet ripe for strict obedience . Doge Doge of Venice ( rising . ) It grows late . The council is dissolved . Exeunt all but Doge and Foscarini . Small time remains To show thee , Foscarini , ere we part , The prince merged in the friend :  --  I was thy father 's . Say , if my efforts can in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do prize your goodness : Will tax it for one boon . There is a maid Within this town , I speak not of her beauty , For that were idle , and you 'd smile perchance , At lover 's rhapsodies  --  Doge . Doge of Venice Well , cut them short ; Her name ? Foscarini . Foscarini She is the daughter of Veniero ; All Venice knows his feud with Loredano , Their strife and hate . My suit is briefly this  --  From Loredano and his secret arts , Protect Teresa and her sire . Doge . Doge of Venice You ask As if the Doge did govern here , and were not Most bound to servitude . Yet will I watch Over their safety . Foscarini . Foscarini And if peril threaten , Inform me of the danger ? Doge . Doge of Venice That I promise . Foscarini . Foscarini Enough ! with lighter heart I shall now leave My native city . Fare you well ! Doge . Doge of Venice Heaven guard you . Exeunt severally . SCENE II . A Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vincentio . Vincentio Talk not of patience here ! On every pleasure Some spy doth watch , in mirth 's unguarded hour To seize stray thoughts which haply may transgress The straitened bounds of prudence . Leonardo . Leonardo Hush ! you tread Close on its limits now . The mighty ones Are like the gods , invisible and present . Vincentio . Vincentio Aye , like the gods too , that their cunning visits Their destined victims with a wholesome madness ! By Heaven ! I 'd rather grapple with the Hun , Or serve the turbaned Turk , than linger life out In such concealed bondage ! ' T was but now , Even at the masque , I saw the peering eyes Of that dark villain , Steno , fixed upon me . I 've marked him oft  --  he serves the state in secret ! Mine arm ached for the dagger , as I watched His lowering face . Leonardo . Leonardo Are you alone in fear ? Our Senators  --  Vincentio . Vincentio Are tigers clothed in robes . Leonardo . Leonardo Not all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appear , in terror steals away Each startled reveller , and all around Is silent as the grave  --  Vincentio . Vincentio To which they doom The luckless murmurers . Leonardo . Leonardo Hush ! some one approaches . The Signor Loredano , and another . In converse , too . Vincentio . Vincentio Some double , unheard crime They ponder . Leonardo . Leonardo Let us go . Exeunt . Enter Contarini and Loredano . Contarini . Contarini Chafe not at idle words . Loredano . Loredano I am not wont To let them move me . In another age The stain of insult must be washed with blood , Or it grew rank , and spread unsightliness On him that bore it . Now , though thrice reviled , Thrice , at the banquet , in these times the steel ' T is dangerous to wield . Hate is resisted By wisdom . Contarini . Contarini And let wisdom vanquish hate . And now to softer themes . Wilt go with me Where pleasure ever waits to greet the guest ? Loredano . Loredano The lady Fiorilla 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone where bitterness so lately Hath dwelt , to breathe her name  --  were not that name Of power to sweeten all ! Hear but her voice  --  Oh ! the dull spheres , to hear it , might descend , Lessoned by music sweeter than their own ! ' Twill charm the evil spirit from your soul , As the enamored bard of old beguiled Hell 's guilty prisoners to a transient bliss , And won the bride he loved from Pluto 's arms ! Loredano . Loredano You love this syren ? Contarini . Contarini Nay  --  to shrines so fair , Kneeling , we offer passionate vows , but dream not Of single worship . Would the sun in heaven , That fills the world with glory , treasure up His gathered beams for one poor mortal 's gaze ? Or if he might , would not the dazzling tide O'erwhelm his votary ? Florilla 's charms Were never made for one  --  and all who share The sunlight of her smile , may bask in safety ; It shines on all alike . Loredano . Loredano You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hopes grow ripe Beneath her cherishing glance ! Contarini . Contarini My dearest hopes Are elsewhere fixed . Loredano . Loredano So fickle a gallant ! Contarini . Contarini Your pardon ! The majestic flower that spreads Its beauties to the open eye of day All may admire , and quaff its bounteous fragrance . But love we less some gentle , shrinking bud , That blooms but for our gaze ? Loredano . Loredano Ha ! and who plays The treasured blossom to your miser 's bower ? Contarini . Contarini A lovely , and a stately one ; full soon To be transplanted to that genial soil . To night my vows I pay where hundreds more Will emulate my worship . Will you go ? Loredano . Loredano I 'll join you soon . Exit Loredano . Contarini . Contarini He 'll serve my purpose well . His anger is well-timed : it gives a color To my intent , which makes all doubly sure . This for the marble that so meetly yawns For secret accusations . Loredano Must aid my labors , while I reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Teresa appears , descending the steps of a balcony . Teresa . Teresa ' T is sunset , and he is not here ; though wont To anticipate the hour ! It matters not . How lovely is the silvery , deepening twilight ! There needs but some faint sound , in melody Stealing upon the silence  --  some fond whisper Which makes us sigh for quiet in return , To muse upon its meaning ! ( A strain of music without , which continues for some moments . ) Enter Foscarini . Foscarini . Foscarini She listens like a goddess , fresh from heaven , To airs that breathe nought heavenly save her name . The winds that wanton , lady , o'er thy lips , Steal thence the fragrance that with prodigal wings They lavish round the world ! Teresa . Teresa Flatterer ! thy boldness I would rebuke , but that thy tones have music That charms away reproof . Foscarini . Foscarini Oh ! woman , woman ! Who marking on your cheek the sudden brightness , The brow that strives so vainly to compel Disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voice of homage ? Nay  --  sweet monitor  --  Teresa . Teresa I never feigned disdain . Foscarini . Foscarini Nor felt it ? Teresa . Teresa Never Toward you . Foscarini . Foscarini Why thanks ; and well may I be proud , Who merit scorn so richly ; rashly seeking To win such excellence , as other eyes Are blinded while they gaze on ! Teresa . Teresa Again , again ! Foscarini . Foscarini Forgive me  --  it is hard to measure words When the heart overflows . Mine own Teresa ! Do I not love  --  have I not loved thee long ? As we do ever love all gentle things , All glorious things , and holy  --  the rich flowers  --  The brilliant morn  --  the far and smiling heaven ! All these grow sometimes pale ;  --  heaven is o'ercast  --  The dawn is clouded  --  and the fickle flowers Are blighted ere their bloom be ripe !  --  Oh , tell me , Who shall ensure to love , in chilling absence , Exemption from their change ? Teresa . Teresa It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  wears the sky A fainter hue , because some cloud awhile Obscures its glory to terrestrial eyes ? But wherefore talk of absence ? Foscarini . Foscarini We must part . Teresa . Teresa Part ! Foscarini . Foscarini For a time . Let it not blanch thy cheek , Though , sooth , that hue of fear is dearer far Than were ten thousand roses . Teresa . Teresa Has may favor O'erwearied you so soon ? Foscarini . Foscarini Nay : thou dost wrong Thy favor , to say thus . What could have power To lure me from thy presence , save the trust That short-lived sorrow should a harvest yield Of rich , enduring bliss ? Music heard at a distance . Hark ! ' T is the gondola That waits to bear me hence . I must not linger . Come with me for a space ; and as we go I 'll tell thee of my hopes  --  hopes that will banish Intrusive fear , and clothe the rugged peaks Of wild Helvetia 's Alps with smiles and flowers , Breathing Elysian fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Veniero 's house .  --  Veniero and Contarini . Veniero . Veniero Thus are we diverse  --  both would climb to rule , With different ends : you for the pride of sway  --  I , to amend the people 's wrongs . Contarini . Contarini It may be . Enough of that when we have reached the summit That now appears receding . Veniero . Veniero How is this ? You 've gained the Spaniard , and I 've many a friend To add unto our list . Contarini . Contarini No league so strong But discord may dissever it . Come  --  come ! Veniero , you and I are gone too far , And yet not far enough , for each to hope Safety alone . We need yet firmer ties To bind our mutual interests . Veniero . Veniero You distrust me  --  Contarini . Contarini Your pardon . In an enterprise like ours , Where lives and fortunes hang on mutual faith , Behooves us tread securely . Veniero . Veniero It is just . Nor shall you lack a pledge . My daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bond ! Contarini . Contarini True , yet I doubt . She loves seclusion : And if I meet her in the shaded walk , She shuns me with quick step . Or if we sail By moonlight on the glassy sea  --  or join The dance  --  or banquet in the palace hall  --  She meets my salutation with a mien Repulsive , cold , as if a guest she deemed me Intrusive . Veniero . Veniero Nay , you wrong her courtesy . Contarini . Contarini If wealth and rank , too poor to match her charms , Yet worth somewhat to youthful woman 's heart , Could tempt her to be mine  --  Veniero . Veniero You have a pledge More strong  --  a father 's promise . Were she loth , A prize , perchance a crown , lies at her feet , And ' t were a kindly part to bid her wear it , Even in her own despite . She comes . Enter Teresa . Teresa , Our noble friend doth wait to greet you here , The signor Contarini . Teresa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contarini . Contarini Thanks , lady ! Yet it deeply doth concern me Business now claims my absence , and forbids The dear delight I else had hoped to share With all your presence blesses . With the evening I 'll seek again this happiness . Exit . Veniero . Veniero My daughter ! Why do thy looks  --  nay start not  --  thus belie The morning 's joyousness . Teresa . Teresa What mean you , sir ? Veniero . Veniero A change of late , hath passed upon this brow So open once and trusting . Thy light step Hath lost its buoyancy ; that drooping eye Too often reads the ground  --  and meets not mine With glance so bright and bold , as when it had No consciousness of aught to hide . Dost cherish A grief that I know not ? Teresa . Teresa What should I grieve for ? You have mistaken , father . Veniero . Veniero Nay  --  perch ance Thou lovest me not , as once thou didst ? I am grown Much sterner than of old ;  --  my altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father  --  de arest ! Yet cruel , and unkind , to doubt the love Which grows but deeper with advancing years ! Nay , question me no more  --  these arms shall tell My growing coldness ! Veniero . Veniero Thou dost love me then ! ' And thy young heart , in tenderness unchecked , Shall pour its thoughts and feelings in my breast , Even as of yore . Come hither ! I will hear Patient , the tale of maiden fears and hopes ; And note not all the trembling , downcast looks That comment on the story .  --  Come ! ' ' Teresa . Teresa Dear father  --  What must I tell you ? ' ' Veniero . Veniero O , that innocent look ! Well , I 'll unfold the secret , and list thou ! Thou hast thrown off the garb of joyous girlhood , And donned a statelier one . A riper rose Deepens upon thy cheek . Thine eye can flash From its clear depth of blue such meanings forth As thrill the gazer 's heart . ' ' Teresa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such flatteries ? ' ' Veniero . Veniero Are mine alone The lips that breathe such sounds ? Say , say , how oft In the gay throng of pleasure , when each tongue Uttered thy praise , and every eye glanced on thee With longing admiration , have I marked Thy step grow prouder , and the mantling flush Of beauty richer , ' neath the adoring gaze , As the young flower doth brighten into bloom , From the sun 's ardent glance ! ' ' Teresa . Teresa Nay  --  nay  --  - you wrong me To say I love such scenes . I ask no voice To sound my praise , dear father , if your eye Look smilingly upon me ! ' ' Veniero . Veniero And if one , One voice , my girl  --  in its low musical depth More dear and thrilling than the crowd 's applause , Even as the far off murmur of the surge , Heard at hushed eve , is sweeter than the homage Of waves tumultuous dashing at our feet  --  If one fond voice shall whisper in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banished Indifference now !

' I will not question further .  --  But , just now , When summoned , thou camest hither , wherefore sate Repelling coldness on thy moody brow ? Did not my guest deserve regard ? Teresa . Teresa Forgive me , If I have lacked it ! Veniero . Veniero Nay , it is not well To wear an aspect sullen thus and cold Toward one I love . This noble , my Teresa , Is high in power . Teresa . Teresa In his proud eye there lurks A something which I would not look upon . Veniero . Veniero Nought can'st thou read there , save the admiration Which woman never shrinks from . Hear me girl , This noble loves you . He who spurned all chains , Would be your willing captive . He has bent To sue , who could command ; and offers you His greatness and his power , claiming your hand The purchase of such gifts . Teresa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come  --  come  --  displease me not . What state is proffered That you should slight the boon ? A princely one ! Why  --  not a maid in Venice but will gaze In envy on your pomp , as you flaunt by , A queen in all but name ! Wed Contarini ! The great  --  the proud ! him that would never deign To bend his glance on beauty , emulous To court it ! Teresa . Teresa Nay  --  my father ! happiness Dwells not with pride ! Not for a crown , A regal crown , would I bestow my hand Where my heart went not herald to the gift ! Veniero . Veniero Ungrateful girl ! and may not pleasure dwell With pomp ? Or dost thou deem his years too many ? And know'st not that to such as he , his passion Is an idolatry ? Oh ! when time has checked The blood 's swift current , and made pale the brow With lofty thought , and blanched stern manhood 's locks , Love comes with boundless power , and sways the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soft yoke ? More lightly than he wears The pageant plume , which every fickle wind Stirs at its will , to be thrown careless by , When he shall weary of its pride ! To youth Love is the shallow rill that mocks the sunshine , Wasting its strength in idle foam away :  --  To age , the river , silent , broad , and deep  --  Hiding the wealth of years within its breast  --  Baffling the vain eye that would read its depths  --  Broader and deeper growing , as the channel Of life wears on ! Enter Steno and Pascali . Steno . Steno Signor Veniero , we arrest you . Veniero . Veniero Ha ! Treachery afoot ! Teresa . Teresa My father !  --  what means this ? Steno Steno ( presenting a paper . ) Would you behold our warrant ? Veniero Veniero ( aside . ) ' T is his hand ! And from the cypher breaks a clearer light Upon this business !

Nay , Signors , ye have sought A culprit  --  not Veniero , old Veniero , Whose head is grey in service of the state ! The friend of Contarini , too ! but now He parted hence . Steno . Steno If he be innocent , Let him before the council vindicate His slandered fame , and be dismissed with honor : The guiltless can have nought to dread . Veniero . Veniero No more , Teresa ! He speaks well . On false pretence St. Mark will ne'er condemn one who has prized His interests so dearly . Let us part . Await here my return , which I will hope Mine innocence shall speed . Teresa . Teresa No  --  no  --  my father  --  I will go with you ! Steno . Steno Lady  --  it may not be . Signor , we are ready . Veniero . Veniero I attend you . Exeunt all but Teresa . Teresa .

Fiorilla Fiorilla ( to attendants . ) Go for the present : deck the hall of mirth As may become her state who bids the guests ; And your own emulous skill . For this poor person , I 'll care for it alone . Exeunt attendants . You have prepared The chamber for our secret guests ? Marco . Marco ' T is ready . They need not fear intrusion . Fiorilla . Fiorilla All is right . Exit Marco . I am now mistress of their secret . Set me A woman 's wit against a statesman 's arts ! I 'll hold them at my bidding .

Fiorilla . Fiorilla Tell me , you who hear The lightest breath of ever varying rumor , What says the world abroad ? Leonardo . Leonardo Tumults are stirring That fill the popular ear , and threaten danger To those in power . Fiorilla . Fiorilla What reck I of the danger Which statesmen tempt , when beauty 's empire shakes not Her sparkling sceptre ' T is , that I would wield , Her throne I covet . Leonardo . Leonardo Ramor , too , has tongues Enough to speak of you . Fiorilla . Fiorilla And what say they ? Leonardo . Leonardo They join your name with Contarini 's , lady , And say , they shortly will be one . Fiorilla . Fiorilla Indeed ! ' T is an impertinent tale ;  --  but power like his Were it not worth the sharing ? Leonardo . Leonardo And such grace And loveliness would well become its pride . Fiorilla .

Badoero 's house . Enter Badoero , Loredano , and Contarini . Loredano . Loredano We look to search out guilt among the people , And lo ! it greets us on our very threshold ! Who would have thought that one so widely trusted , A hero in our wars , one who has borne Honors unnumbered from the generous state , Could prove himself a traitor ? Badoero . Badoero We must look More closely , ere we judge . Loredano . Loredano What need we more ? ' T was rumored long ago that he opposed The election of the Ten , the prop of Venice . In the conspiracy so lately crushed , Did he not plead for mercy on the guilty ? Hath he not said we needed not a power Supreme , to interfere with the decrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only last night within the Lion 's mouth , Denounces him our foe . Badoero . Badoero Be it ours to weigh Proofs and defence . We may not spill the blood Of senators precipitately , nor keep The axe from the guilty , though it strike the noblest . But what new guest is this ? Enter Teresa . Contarini . Contarini Lady  --  whence come you ? Teresa . Teresa I come to seek for justice ; yet find only Looks that repel me . Where 's the doge ? Loredano . Loredano Who is it , That thus intrudes on us ? Contarini . Contarini Veniero 's daughter . ( Endeavouring to persuade her to return . ) Business attends us . Nay , we are not used To admit such counsellors . Teresa . Teresa Are you the judges Who fain would close your ears against defence , The culprit 's right ? Away ! there is no place Where innocence may not plead against the wrong Which threatens it  --  wrong that will harm alike The judges and the accused .

Know ye of whom ye speak ? ' T is Veniero , The patriot , the patrician ! He do wrong ? Why  --  not a peasant who e'er shared his bounty , Would not repel the charge ! I 've seen him list With pitying , tearful eye the beggar 's tale , Whose heart was gladdened by his sympathy ! I 've known him watch for hours beside the couch Of some poor menial slave , who had no friend Save God and him . ' He do wrong ? Oh ! the lips Of the poor bless him , and the humblest heart Leaps at his presence ! ' Loredano . Loredano There are sacred duties Higher than such , fair lady !

Would he now cast The reverend mantle of his honors off , To league with traitors ? No  --  you need not fear him ! Loredano . Loredano What boots all this ? The guardian of the state , Where he fears , punishes . Teresa . Teresa Are ye wont to doom Without at least the solemn show of right ? Will ye hear no defence ? And , Contarini , Darest thou not speak for him , who wast so late His loved and honored guest ? or art thou leagued In bitter compact with this scorner here To rob me of his life ? Loredano . Loredano Let her begone ; Must she insult us ? Come , the hour draws nigh . Badoero . Badoero Your pardon . Heed not words that sorrow utters . She did not mean offence . Teresa .

Teresa And do you proffer Such terms in earnest truth ? Contarini . Contarini In truth I do . Accept them  --  and be blest . Teresa . Teresa Is this the noble So honored ? This the haughty senator ?
