TO HIM , WHOSE TALENTS ARE SURPASSED ONLY BY HIS MODESTY , AND WHOSE EFFORTS IN BEHALF OF THE AUTHORS OF GREAT BRITAIN HAVE WON FOR HIM THE GRATITUDE AND ADMIRATION OF HIS COUNTRYMEN , TO THE AUTHOR OF " ION , " THIS POEM IS DEDICATED , BY ONE WHO IS PROUD TO LAY HIS HUMBLE TRIBUTE AT THE SHRINE OF GENIUS . Main text SCENE I. A Cottage , from which Henrici comes forth , and gazes on the scene . Landscape , moonlight . HENRICI . Henrici Yes , ' t is the same , And all things wear their old familiar forms To welcome me again . Yon moon sails on Through her broad plains of azure  --  yonder stars , Which seem companions of my boyish days , They shine on ,  --  still unchanged .  --  Yon giant form Of the broad mountain , on whose peaked top My feet have trodden , nimble as the deer , With a heart light as floating sunbeam  --  now Darkness has clothed it ; and why need I view Its form more plain than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined shapes Of every object that old fancy wove Around its heart strings :  --  There is not a flower That bloomed , when last I gazed upon this scene , But I have thought of  --  and a thousand times Have nursed in storms , or gathered from its bed In fancy :  --  and I tread again these scenes ; These early forms , which infancy hath loved , Are now around me ; and yon lucid stream , How the moon plays upon her rippling waves , Which dance like things of light . How oft I 've dashed Headlong from younder height to its calm bed , And swam its cooling waters , till even play Hath brought its weariness unto my heart , They saw me go forth from them to the land Of bitterness and shame . No ! not of shame ; The tyrants could not brand my name with shame , Unless the foul lie of the rankling heart Had once been uttered ; but the miscreants knew , That purple robes in vain had played with wrath , Such as boiled upwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye changeless forms , that wear The old familiar aspect which ye bore When I , a stripling boy , trampled and lone , Was thrust forth from the land which gave me birth , To bitter exile . Once again I view ye ; I feel the balmy breeze sweep o'er your fields Like notes of music to a weary soul . And one thought more  --  Eugenia  --  should she live , And live to love me still . Oh , I can smile On fate and its black pageantry , and walk My quiet road to death . Eugenia false ! It can not be . I 've fed my sould in darkness , In bitter sorrow , in the hour of madness , When tears were prayed for , but they would not come To ease the burning brain . Alone I 've sat In my strange home , and turned my eyes to Venice ; Have thought of the foul wrongs I 've borne ; have called Black vengeance with its spectres round my heart ; One star alone hath lighted up the gloom , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee , Eugenia !  --  of thy love  --  the first Deep passion of my soul ; thoughts rolled around me Like stars in the broad universe  --  a realm Of bright and beauteous things .  --  Perhaps she looks On yonder moon  --  It is a lover 's task , A foolish one ;  --  and yet not so  --  for love Flies , borne on angel-wing , to claim its hour In the deep cavern of the heart  --  to ask Its heritage of thought , for absent friends , And o'er the purest feelings of the soul To shed remembrance .  --  In my absent days , Could she forget the evening walks we trod , And spoke of pleasant fancies ; and there wove Dreams from the o'er charged heart , which melted as They came  --  in shadows ;  --  golden hours , that once Felt in the heart , become a part of life . The night air chills me  --  once again to rest . ( Exit . ) SCENE II . The inside of the Inn in the former scene ; Henrici is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartholo . PAOLI . Paoli Come , bustle ! hunchback . BARTHOLO . Bartholo Who made us , Count , to differ ? PAOLI . Paoli Out ! incubus ! thou hideous monster  --  out ! Dost dare insult thy master , who has borne Thy cross grained temper  --  let thy passion run Its sordid course  --  has treated thee with kindness , And borne thy uncurbed tongue . BARTHOLO . Bartholo Yes , such kindness As man would show the crush 'd and writhing worm , To pass it by  --  not tread its life out  --  but Reserve it for new tortures . Dost thou think , When thou dost pour thy pitiful abuse On my scorned form , and on my stinted growth , That thou dost mock the common God who made All mortal things . And hast thou , when thou'st trod On some young serpent , and affrighted fled , Leaving the viper living  --  hast thou dreamed It might live on to sting thee ? PAOLI . Paoli What dost thou mean ? BARTHOLO . Bartholo No matter ; It is our province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd have deemed misshapen dwarfs Hold commune with the secrets of the future , And can unfold the coming mysteries Of life , with all its sorrows . PAOLI . Paoli Have they indeed that power ? BARTHOLO . Bartholo Ha ! ha ! what matters if they have . Think'st thou that secret should be wrung from them By taunts and bitter gibes . No ! not with racks , Though their misshapen limbs , a formless mass , Should from the torture-wheel be cast , or death Should stare them hourly in the face ; not one , Not one slight breath , should whisper aught , unless To curse the foul betrayers of their right . PAOLI . Paoli Dog ! misshapen in thy mind as in thy body , Threaten me not with thy unguarded words , Or hold thy life but brief . BARTHOLO . Bartholo My life I care not for ; I have watched thee long ,  --  have tended thee in sickness , Have aided in thy bold intrigues ; nor beats The pulse within thee , would not quicken at The baseborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thee . PAOLI . Paoli Thou hast not ; So let the past be now forgotten . Bear Thy load within the house ! I 'll wait thee here ! ( As Bartholo leaves the room , he points to Henrici ) . We are companions for the night , it seems , Good sir ! and I shall thank my stars , whate'er The peril I have past , if chance should grant me The favor of a friend . HENRICI . Henrici ( gloomily . ) Is friendship then so scarce , Are vows so hollow ? Are the memories Of pleasant times so faintly graven on The hearts of men , that one like thee shouldst seek A friend beneath a humble roof like this ? PAOLI . Paoli Thou hast rightly said ; Friendship is but a mask the wearer borrows , And throws aside when his deceit 's complete ; Yet are there many proud to bear the name Of friend to Paoli . HENRICI . Henrici To bear the name ! yes , even as thousands bear it In name alone ; as every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to day . Meet him to-morrow , and the common robe Which charity had thus bestowed , would scarce Seem wide enough , to bear the pride beneath . It is a mask ! whose often tinsel 'd look Beguiles the gazer ! till , deluded , cheated , He weeps his folly , and with shame retires To mock its very name . PAOLI . Paoli Thou speak'st of it As though thou wert thyself a victim to Its false and faithless name .  --  Thou art poor ? HENRICI . Henrici ( passionately . ) Count , seek not thou to pry into my secrets . I spoke to thee as man might speak to man , On common topics ; but there is a place , A secret place , within the bosom , where No stranger may intrude . The tale was told Here ; in this pale and grief worn form I bear , These tatter 'd rags , scarce worth a beggar 's notice . This humble roof , where I had deemed myself Secure from all intrusion , and this spot , Lonely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherous ,  --  of familiar forms Of grief that haunt my life  --  this wasted body , On which the winds have played , till youth and health Shrunk up with fell disease  --  this eye lit up With something more than fever , and this brain , This o'erwrought maddening brain , had told my story , Without one uttered sound . PAOLI . Paoli I feel for thee , and pity thee ; Accept this trifling offer . HENRICI . Henrici I neither asked thee for Thy pity or thy money ;  --  for the first , I thank thee  --  though it is a common coin That every passing beggar earns ; and for The last  --  Count , I have never asked a boon Of mortal man  --  or those who should have given me , And given mine own . When glaring want gazed forth From my swoll'n eyes , and hunger ravag 'd on My entrails , and my heart was bursting  --  true , The thought has come upon me  --  But I would Have died , died as a dog dies , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its place ,  --  or e'er I 'd crave a single boon Of my most foul destroyers . PAOLI . Paoli Thou dost seem To have borne wrong on wrong ; but wherefore now Refuse the offer of a friend  --  a loan , A common loan  --  a trifle  --  speak not of it . ( Exit . ) HENRICI . Henrici And shall I take it . Oh , poverty ! thy greedy fingers clutch Each straw of hope , and busy famine leaps On all that bears the semblance of relief . A loan ! he said a loan ; and may I not Yet live to pay it back  --  pay it threefold . ' Twill bear me through my journey  --  it will clothe This ruin 'd body with a better garment . I would not meet Eugenia as a beggar ! Did crimson 'd rank , and haughty nobles , know The suffering of one little night of wo , How would they shudder . I have grown quite calm With all ; the canopy of heaven hath been My covering , and the moistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan  --  ' twill buy  --  ' t is all I ask , Vengeance on Venice , and a wanderer 's tomb . He will return anon . What busy devil Plays with me thus ? I feel a glow of shame Play o'er my countenance , to be  --  a beggar ! Will it not wipe a thousand wrongs away , Whose memories haunt me like a spectre form Rising from out its grave .  --  Will it not give me One hour to gaze on Venice and her towers , Her beauteous moonlight , and the parted wave , As sweeps the gondola ;  --  to tread her terraces , And dream again the visions of my childhood ; To smite down my oppressors in their blood . Blood ! Blood ! Who spoke of blood ? I 'm dreaming , dreaming . Enter Bertrand and Paoli . PAOLI . Paoli ( To Bertrand . ) And can he not be found ? BERTRAND . Bertrand Alas , no human being knows his haunt  --  His home I would have said , but exiles have none . HENRICI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last , long , dreamless one . PAOLI . Paoli Stranger , one word with thee ; thou'lt not betray us ; I see an honest bond writ on thy face . Then listen . Venice , trampled down by tyrants Endures their curse no longer . The great " Ten , " The boasting " Forty , " and their dread tribunal , Whose secrets heaven and earth alone can know , Must be abolished ;  --  henceforth , from the people , Must emanate the powers that rule them . All Is ready  --  bands are marshalled  --  at a signal , They fly to arms , and to redress their wrongs . Speak ! thou dost seem to have suffered wrongs that make thee Fit subject for a deed like this ;  --  at once  --  decide  --  Wilt thou strike with us , for the liberty Of Venice ?  --  HENRICI .

Was it for this You scattered here your gold . Could I have dream 'd it , This thought of my dishonor , I had worn This sword not wholly as a play thing . Count , Go to the bed of penury and want , And see the pallid offspring of a suffering , Too bitter for endurance  --  breathe its last ; And , ' mid the stifled sobs a father heaves , And the fond mother 's silent grief  --  then tempt them With sordid gold to sin ;  --  or seek ye out Some thing who never knew what honor was  --  The tool of proud ones  --  the fond sycophant , Who bears no love to country , and whose soul Is too degraded to endure a thought So noble . Give him your gold , and buy him ; Secure him for thy office  --  bribe him  --  then Bring him to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is mere madness . Bertrand , could we find This exiled Count thou speak'st of ; he is brave And noble  --  has endured foul wrongs , thou say'st . BERTRAND . Bertrand The foulest could be borne , Though noble born , One of the council of " the Ten " dared strike him ; He wiped out the dishonor with his sword . And for this act , the Senate banished him , And made his lands a forfeit . PAOLI . Paoli But heard they never of him  --  did he not Return ? BERTRAND . Bertrand Once  --  but ' t is six long years ago ;  --  he loved A being most surpassing fair ; to her , Disguised , he came . The Senate 's watchful spies Spoiled the short hour , snatched out from years of wo ; He fled once more for life . His enemies , The slaves , who fed upon his bounty  --  who , Bones , blood , and muscle , should have fought and died To win their lord  --  with their vile tongues traduced him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Endured their threats , whilst I defended him . Count Manuel  --  HENRICI . Henrici ( With energy . ) Is here , and on his road to vengeance , Bertrand . BERTRAND . Bertrand Thou  --  false  --  and yet it is so ; can it be ? Or art thou from the tomb a visitant , To scare us with thy presence ; and those tones , Those sunken eyes , that solemn look , that brow No longer beaming with the light of youth  --  Is it then all that 's left of Manuel . HENRICI . Henrici Save his firm friendship for thee , Bertrand , time Could never change ; here let us weep together . They embrace . PAOLI . Paoli Mysterious man ! I deemed that more than seemed Beneath those tattered robes , was thine . HENRICI . Henrici Count ! pardon my hasty words ; they were Not fit return for kindness . If I wrong 'd thee , In deeming thou wouldst buy me to thy treason , I ask for thy forgiveness ;  --  but , unbought , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have sworn by my immortal hopes , to shed The blood of those who brought me to this pass , And wipe my wrongs out with a deed of justice . The rock from its fast rest in the deep waves , Or the mailed oak , is torn from out their beds , Sooner than I change purpose . Hour and place  --  I meet you . Let the outlaw perish  --  if He dies revenged , he 'll smile at death , and greet him . PAOLI . Paoli Welcome , thrice welcome , to our holy cause . BERTRAND . Bertrand Our hands are joined  --  now parted ; when we meet , Let them be color 'd with the blood of Venice . HENRICI . Henrici Eternal God ! I thank thee for this hour Of vengeance .  --  Come  --  I would hear your plans . Exeunt . ( Bartholo steals cautiously in at the door which faces the one through which they pass . ) BARTHOLO . Bartholo Ay ! there they go , like sheep to their destruction . They little deem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , the deform 'd , the mad , Misshapen dwarf , shall sting and laugh at them . Their ribald jests , their sneers and buffets , are Nursed up in vengeance . Oh , ' t is sweet to turn On the oppressor.  --  I have roamed at night , And watched the blue soft moonlight , and have asked The question of the calm and sleeping waters ; In my fierce moods of madness , I have trod Under the yawning crags of precipices , And asked the overhanging rocks to fall And dash me to a thousand formless atoms ; I have shrieked hoarsely mid the thunder roll , And crash of blasted trunks ; have walked the shore , Where , on whose pebbly beach the rolling wave Makes everlasting music ; I have sought Death in each plant where poison dwelt , and fled Affrighted from its aspect . Why ? oh why ? Drank I of life from the maternal stream ; Why slept I not , unwakened and unborn , In the eternal sleep of uncreated things , Unnoticed and unknown . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool man Would laugh to hear the dwarf , misshapen dog , The hunchback , talk of love  --  and yet I love , And love so deeply , that the passion must Be life or death to me . Count Paoli , Who trusts me like a fool , is hers  --  her choice  --  Spite of the rumors that have flown abroad Of one fair bride , who died too suddenly . No matter , she must ne'er be his . Oh Beatrice , Thou dost not deem that cased within this breast A heart in maddest passion beats for thee . They talk of marriage !  --  I must spoil the plot  --  Denounce these bold conspirators . The head Of Count Paoli must the forfeit pay To this exalted Senate  --  and the Dwarf Claims Beatrice alone . Ha ! ha ! the dwarf ! ( Exit . ) SCENE III . ( A Room  --  Beatrice is discovered seated ; Eugenia is gazing from the window . ) BEATRICE . Beatrice Dost thou see nothing then ? EUGENIA . Eugenia Nought save the everlasting stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , With her light clouds , fleecy as hope 's soft gleams , And changing full as oft  --  and the deep shade Flung o'er the living landscape , and the pale And playing moonlight on the stirless lake Borne in its stream of light . BEATRICE . Beatrice Dost thou not hear ? A distant horn ? a tramp of steeds ? a voice ? EUGENIA . Eugenia I hear nought , save the still and solemn whisper Of the hushed breeze hold converse with the leaves , And breathe like tales of crime . I hear the noise Of rustling branches , stirred with its soft breath , And the long branches of the willow dash In the soft waters of the lake .  --  I see All that should make night beautiful , and hear All that should make night music , save the sound Thine ear so vainly courts . BEATRICE . Beatrice Not vainly ! on those little words there hang Ages of mystery  --  long years of pain ; The hearts mysterious yearnings  --  the crush 'd fount Of withered love  --  the nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarded hopes , That make the pulse beat quicker , and the blood Course fleeter to its fountain ,  --  all that makes The sunshine of a happy youth , and spreads Joy like a summer sky , unclouded o'er The heart 's rich fondness  --  vows that have been heard By those bright quenchless orbs , that azure sky And that pale moon , and registered in heaven To bless or curse us  --  oaths from one to seal The compact hearts had made  --  virtue approved , And heaven had smiled on ,  --  every sound that brings Certain success , or fell despair , draws near The destiny that seals my doom . EUGENIA . Eugenia You talk like madness in its frenzied mood . Long toil , and weary watching , girl , hath made Thy brain ache with its weariness . BEATRICE . Beatrice No ! No ! Eugenia . Hast thou ever watched Those myriad orbs that gem yon azure field , And viewed their mystic movements ; hast thou e'er Chosen some favorite star to rule thy fate , And felt its movements as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little word To say we love  --  but on that feeble sound A woman builds her hope  --  her soul , her all , Feeds on its memory , like a sun it gilds The landscape of her thoughts ,  --  dries up the tear Which sadness clusters in the eye , and pours Joy and contentment to the thousand streams Of the heart 's fountain ; if those streams be stayed , And if her hope be broken  --  if her soul , And its quick sympathies , be crush 'd ,  --  her all Shivered and blasted by the breath of fate ,  --  And if that vow breathed solemnly , believed As firmly , should be changed into a lie  --  What hath she left ? her heritage of shame  --  A broken heart , and vengeance . But I talk Thus idly  --  Thou hast never loved , perchance . EUGENIA . Eugenia I have ; I too have felt its beams diffusing o'er The soul a new existence ; I have known What ' t is to lean upon another 's faith , Repose on spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where distance seemed to fly , And pleasant fancies and old thoughts have shrunk Days to the narrow compass of an hour ; I , too , with thee , have communed with the thoughts Of other hearts , have felt its cordage thrill Touched with a master spirit , till the notes Responsive found its echo , and deep thoughts , Which I had deem 'd low buried in my soul , Flashed forth in words ;  --  and as o'er stilless lakes The image of the glittering orbs are seen In their bright beauty , so within the depths Of our yet lucid souls , each found the form We loved the best reflected there in glory . BEATRICE . Beatrice Say'st thou that thou hast loved , That thou hast felt enchantments strange and new Astir within thee ? Where is he who touched Thy virgin heart 's first calmness , and awoke Its thought to sense of transport ? EUGENIA . Eugenia O , ask me not  --  it wakes Strings in my soul that should be slumbering now ; It holds a mirror to my thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice So should it not be fearful , Unless it be of crime . EUGENIA . Eugenia No ! not of crime ; I could have borne to look upon the glass With its full image ; torture then had struck My soul to cold insensibility . But to look thus upon its shattered parts , Its every fragment blasts me with the sight Of my own sorrow and my shame . BEATRICE . Beatrice Shame ! say'st thou shame ? EUGENIA . Eugenia Yes , ' t is a tale of shame To plight the faith , to swear the solemn vow , To give all that is woman 's own to give  --  the oath That binds for life , that links us to our grave ; To smile , when sadness gnaws the heart ; to mask The truer feelings , and to play the hypocrite To one we can not love  --  yes , ' t is of shame . BEATRICE . Beatrice O , thou hast never loved , Hast never known what woman 's love was worth . Fame , fortune , station , home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as widow 'd faith Binds its own living body to the corpse Of one she loved , so woman 's faith is tied To even the memory of the man she held Most sacred in her heart . In life or death , In sadness , sickness , persecution , shame , A woman 's love is wedded to its lord , And never knows divorcement . EUGENIA . Eugenia Alas , what could I do ? They told me of his death , his exiled name  --  the power Of parents , with their tyranny , broke on My hours of peace . They bade me think of rank , Of almost regal station  --  of the voice Of worshippers obedient to my beck  --  Ofriches  --  of all wants supplied  --  the gloom Of the low convent vault , my only choice , Refusing theirs . I could not , dared not think , My soul was buried in the tomb of Manuel ; They drove me to despair  --  one choice there was , Marriage or madness .  --  BEATRICE . Beatrice And thou didst choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the love That made life worth the wish ? Oh , hadst thou loved As I have loved  --  do love  --  the bleakest grave O'er which the night winds whistle , sleeping calm With my first vows unbroken , faith unchanged , Were a bright palace to the gloom of life , Living on so ,  --  with sorrow EUGENIA . Eugenia The grave ! the grave ! It is a bed of rest ; would I were there . BEATRICE . Beatrice My brain grows dizzy ; look , Eugenia , look , That star  --  my star  --  the orb that rules my fate , Is clouded  --  then there 's danger near to me . Danger ? It may be death . EUGENIA . Eugenia It may be blighted love . BEATRICE . Beatrice Then is it vengeance !  --  my Italian blood Brooks not the thoughtless tyranny of man , Who tramples on the sacred thoughts of hearts Too fond and too devoted ;  --  I have changed With him my voice  --  if he deceives , he dies ! EUGENIA . Eugenia It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him too ; The victim and the oppressor both will find A common rest in death . ' T is but a stride , Where we should take a step  --  a leap , where we Should tread most slowly . To the common earth Alike all mortals tend ; and wouldst thou have me Live on , and see my murderer smile and smile , As if no bitter memory could tug At his hard heart strings ; hear him breathe his vows , As false as those he hath broken  --  smile those smiles Which should be mine alone , and speak in looks Unto another , mindless of the thin And wasted form that pines its way to death . Should he , or shall he , tread triumphant midst The broken fragments of my perished joys ? No ! when the happiness that made life sweet Is vanished , farewell life !  --  I fall  --  but not Alone . No , never ! never ! EUGENIA . Eugenia Hark ! I hear footsteps ; dry those tears , my Beatrice , It is my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EUGENIA . Eugenia Hush ! not one word of our strange converse here . ( Enter the Count Savelli . ) SAVELLI . Savelli How fares our sweet Eugenia ; oh ! how rest Comes to the tired brain , such rest as breaks From thy sweet smiles , when hard and iron duty Hath worn the soul beyond endurance . BEATRICE , Beatrice ( with forced gayety . ) Have thy decisions , Count , thy noble " ten , " Found victims by its thousands . I have heard The task was not a weary one to sentence The criminal to death ; ' t is very seldom That your tired senators can bear the form Which justice asks  --  a trial . They have found A speedier way to ease them of their tasks . SAVELLI . Savelli Thy jests are ever biting ; Pray heaven they lead thee not to danger , lady . BEATRICE . Beatrice I have heard it said , Although I vouch not for its truth , that I Could boast a fair white neck . How well ' t would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ten , " Your matchless " ten , " stood by exultingly ! SAVELLI . Savelli It seems that beauty has a license to Mutter its treason ; many a life hath perished For less than thou hast uttered . EUGENIA . Eugenia ' T is true , ' t is very true . SAVELLI . Savelli What meanest thou , Eugenia ! ' t was thy wont To keep a silent tongue on State affairs . EUGENIA . Eugenia Mean ! nothing ! ' t was a sudden startling thought ; Remembrance of a tale that I had heard My parents tell , of one who insult brook 'd not ; Struck by a Senator , one of the " ten ; " He nobly did revenge himself ; his ' state Was forfeited  --  sentenced to exile  --  in That loneliness he died . SAVELLI . Savelli Aye , there were many such ; Caravaja , Camillo , and Bertuchio ; and one more , The traitor Manuel . EUGENIA . Eugenia ( passionately . ) Count Manuel was no traitor . SAVELLI . Savelli What means this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee . Speak ! Eugenia ! speak ! EUGENIA . Eugenia ' T is nothing  --  I am well again  --  quite well , You see ! I laugh  --  ' t was nothing . ( She faints . ) BEATRICE . Beatrice She faints ! soft ! bear her to the air  --  some thought , Some childish thought . SAVELLI . Savelli ' T is strange ; yet let me tend her , thou art called ; Thy page , the dwarf Bartholo , entered now The hall , as I came hither . BEATRICE . Beatrice Bartholo here ! Then the strange mystery of my fate must be Disclosed . O , Paoli , I dread to deem thee false . O ! who can know how bitter are the throbs Of nature , when the pleasant hours and tones Remembered play in beauty round the heart ; And when , most felt , they pass away for ever . Yet will I consummate the fearful act , Though all should perish . I have sworn that he Who dares profane the holy altar of My virgin faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BARTHOLO .

Bartholo Lady , thou knowst that thou of all the world Art first within my heart  --  when thoughtless men Drove me to madd'ning frenzy , scorned the form Of the dwarf hunchback , laugh 'd at nature 's sport , And woke the bitter passions of my soul , Tortur 'd to madness  --  at thy gate I sought A refuge  --  it was given me  --  from that hour  --  BEATRICE , Beatrice ( impatiently . ) Thy tale ! Thy tale ! BARTHOLO . Bartholo It doth import my tale  --  thou didst relieve me , Hast cared for me , hast cast an eye of pity . It was not that my shape was stint  --  or black Deformity did mock my eye , where'er I turned to view myself  --  I should not bear A human heart . O !

O ! how I shudder to remember now How fleet as winged steed I climbed the hill , The old brown hill , from whence I viewed that home , Home now no longer  --  and the hunchback left All that he had to give , his curses on it ! BEATRICE . Beatrice Thy tale is strange  --  thy mother ? BARTHOLO . Bartholo Is dead  --  but perish 'd with no hand of mine ; Her darling son , a cherished brother  --  one Who held the place in love which should have been The wretched dwarf 's  --  madden 'd with avarice And guilty passion , heated with the words Of warning which she gave him , struck her , Struck her to earth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice Thy father ? BARTHOLO . Bartholo Lives , or lives not  --  I care not . I , in my maddest frenzy , curst the roof That sheltered me  --  the parents that should love me , And all their offspring  --  and that curse hath fallen Most heavily on one . BEATRICE . Beatrice I heard not this before  --  thy tale is strange , And sad as strange ;  --  thou hast had cause for grief . BARTHOLO . Bartholo Cause ?  --  but I never wept ; I 've borne the insults of a menial crew Till my heart throbbed , and my wild brain has rolled In frenzy  --  till my blood cours 'd through my veins Like liquid fire ;  --  I 've borne the thought of death  --  Rushed to the craggy height of the hard rock , Intent to dash myself to its firm base , And mingle with the waters at its feet . Shame ,  --  despite ,  --  cruelty  --  all have I borne , But would have died ere I had wept a tear . Alas ! why talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  You were the only  --  yes , the only friend The wretched dwarf 's sad heart had ever known ; And from that hour I swore by life eternal , By all that makes man happy ,  --  with truth and love To serve thee to the death . BEATRICE . Beatrice Proceed ! Proceed ! BARTHOLO . Bartholo Thou hast given a task I would have died ere borne . BEATRICE . Beatrice Is this thy gratitude ? My hope , my life , nay , all hangs on the issue . BARTHOLO . Bartholo Pause , lady , say not so ; Bid me begone , and bear my secret on Till the dark grave shall silence all . BEATRICE . Beatrice Let not the storm beat thus in startling flashes ; Pour out its blasting thunders , though it crush me . I 'll bear it all  --  Paoli ! BARTHOLO .

And shall her sons , The sons of Venice , daughter of the Isles , Protect their home in vain  --  is every arm Destined to fall , and every heart to bleed ? O City of the waters ! thou art doomed , With patriot blood poured out for thee in vain . Shall justice keep her counsels in the dark Of midnight secresy , and mock the cry , That like the shriek of spirits warn her from Her coming doom ? To-morrow  --  yes ! to-morrow .

Thou , my Bertrand , Thou ! thou hast never loved . Is it not so ? Thou think'st me fond and foolish  --  but I 'm calm  --  Oh , I can bear it all . Come , Bertrand ! Come ! BERTRAND . Bertrand Pressed by her parents to forget thee , she Still cherish 'd thy remembrance , ' till despair Drove her almost to madness  --  then the tale Of her deceiver 's spoke of thee as dead .

Bertrand Nay ! give not way to grief ; the dye is cast  --  Forget her ! MANUEL . Manuel Forget her ? Never , Bertrand . Didst thou know How I have loved her ; how , for hours , we walked In the clear beauty of the evening air , With moonlight in its glory , and the forms Of the clear stars  --  all were forgotten , save The pure and holy breathings of our love .

Manuel Calm ? am I not calm , Bertrand ;  --  hast thou seen The noble column , which has stamped the name Of glory on its builder , crumble down , And he look on unmoved ? or hast thou seen The desecrated altars of our God Shorn of their costly splendor , and the priest Smile as they passed him by ?  --  Hast seen a man Laugh in the face of cruel death , or dance Around the narrow compass of his grave ?

( Overcome with feeling , he falls in the arms of Bertrand , recovering slowly . ) Where am I ? this is  --  what ? St. Mark . I 've dreamed That one I loved was false  --  no ! no ! no dream  --  It is the truth . Bertrand , thou'lt not betray me ; Thou'lt see her ; do not say I wept  --  I would Not have her think that I could weep a tear For her false heart . How fair she looked ! how true !

Bartholo , with Beatrice disguised as a page , enter , look cautiously around , and pass behind a pillar . Paoli , and a Venetian girl of humble rank , cross the church in earnest conversation , and exit . BEATRICE , Beatrice ( comes forward , and watches them till they have passed . ) It is too true  --  the dream is past !  --  then now The shivered temple of my heart attest The ruin he hath wrought ! The vows he spoke Were idle words , and truth is changed to falsehood . Bartholo , lead me to his mansion  --  quick ! O ! I am sick at heart ! ( Manuel enters disguised as a monk . ) MANUEL . Manuel Ha ! I am not too late  --  the lights yet burn Around the holy altar  --  ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word To speak to her  --  to look on her  --  to tell her How shameless falsehood hath dishonor 'd her ! They say she comes alone ! The rising moon Shines o'er these ruin 'd walls ; how oft that orb Hath looked upon us , as those vows were changed , Which , registered in heaven , are broken now  --  To her eternal shame . She shall not know me ; I 'll probe her soul , to see if yet remains One memory  --  one little thought  --  that o'er Her soul might shed a holy passion . Wedded ? She never knew , perchance can never know , The value of one honest heart that beats Alone for her . ' T is not the pride of rank , The luxury of ease , that feeds the soul With virtue 's essence  --  ' t is the soul that feels No mean dependence on another 's aid , Is fittest to protect and shield the form That clings around its feelings . Aye , the bird That cleaves the air to gaze into the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove , would shrink before the orb , Which , nursed within its mother 's nest , it faced . Alas ! fond man ! how little do we think That one devoted spirit bears more power To shield its loved one , than is found in rank , And all its purple panoply ? the pride Of title  --  or the cloak that makes the crime Which would condemn the poor man  --  wear the name Of folly only to the ears of pride . ( Eugenia enters and kneels at the altar . ) ' T is she  --  almost unchanged ; and yet the shades Of grief hang on her brow . Perchance she prays For thee  --  thee , Manuel . No  --  ' t were crime for me  --  She weds a Senator ! And could the words Of those that did divorce thy heart from me , So change its noblest feelings  --  so benumb Thy soul 's quick senses  --  as to love another , Ere plighted vows on which thy soul was staked Had been redeemed . EUGENIA . Eugenia Father ! thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing , child ? ah , true , my blessing  --  yes ! May all good angels guard thee , as thy soul Hath walked the path of virtue and of truth . Hath ought intruded on thy pious thought , That bids thee seek the altar thus alone . EUGENIA . Eugenia Nought , save a guilty crime  --  if it be crime  --  To think of one whom we have loved , though dead , While vows are plighted to another lord ? MANUEL . Manuel And hast thou thought of one So distant as thou sayst ? so dead ? EUGENIA . Eugenia I have ! I have ! MANUEL . Manuel And didst thou love him ? EUGENIA . Eugenia Love him ! oh more than life  --  do love him still ; Father , it may be guilt or shame  --  but I Possess no power to crush those feelings which Grew with me from my youth . MANUEL . Manuel And if thou lovd'st him , How art thou now another 's ? EUGENIA . Eugenia Oh , it were better fur To have fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherish 'd memories of thoughts that grew Spontaneous in the spirit  --  than have brought A curse such as I bear  --  a broken heart , To wear my soul to death . MANUEL . Manuel And hast thou done this ? EUGENIA . Eugenia Alas , what could I do ? Friends ! parents ! all ! Press 'd round me  --  not one friend was left , not one Whose tones could breathe of comfort . Father , Is it a crime , unwillingly committed ? No peace visits my humbled spirit  --  no relief Comes to my o'ercharged heart and maddened brain . MANUEL . Manuel Poor girl ! I could forgive thee all . EUGENIA . Eugenia Thou , father ! yes , all mortal men might pardon , For all have human passion , and they know not Where guilt may hurry them . I 've prayed to heaven For pardon ! by my heart ! my conscience ! there Floated a self reproaching thought that stung Its powers to madness  --  ' t was remorse  --  the worm That dies not . All the vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectres  --  dance around The lonely grave of all my buried joys . MANUEL . Manuel Daughter , thou'st sinned In pledging thus thy faith , and , unredeemed , Given to another what was not thine own  --  In words  --  in breathed vows  --  which well thou know'st Thou couldst not have performed . Most wretched girl ! EUGENIA . Eugenia Do not condemn me , father ; hear my tale . Oh ! thou hast never loved , or having loved , Heaven had not claimed thy duty wholly thus . Still thou art human ; there are chords that wind Around the heart , that will responsive beat To human faults , and it is woman 's part To claim the greatest share of pity : weak , Mad in her passions , and should be forgiven . MANUEL . Manuel Yes ! weakness is her failing , and if she Alone , of all the world , should feel its sorrows , It should be pitied , not condemned ; but hearts , Bold hearts and brave ones , hang upon her words , As madly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he should grasp the rock . So man hath left the surer , firmer road Of happiness found in himself  --  his powers , His thoughts , and feelings  --  to rely upon Poor changing woman 's vows . When we bethink That lightest tone of voice , uttered , mayhap , In sport , or folly 's buoyant mood , may sink Into the hearer 's heart , and fed with hope , Grow to a serpent that shall sting him  --  then Those follies , and those frailties , lose the name Of failings , and become a fearful crime . EUGENIA . Eugenia There is no pity on the earth . Repentance , And many tears , should have atoned for guilt Committed once , and bearing in its train The misery of years . Father ! farewell ! MANUEL . Manuel Yet stay ; thou sayst thou still dost love , Though wedded to another . EUGENIA . Eugenia Love ! it is the passion often earliest known  --  Alas ! the last forgot ;  --  when yonder moon Beams o'er my grave , and unchecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this maddening brain , This breaking heart , these fearful dreams are past  --  When life is ended , love may end ; for love Makes part of life with me . MANUEL . Manuel And dost thou think , that were that person living , Thou couldst love him still . EUGENIA . Eugenia Mercy ! my father ! thou hast opened up A fearful chasm to my aching view . That were a misery far too great . To bear The old familiar feelings of the heart , Which time , or care had deaden 'd , starting forth In all their ancient freshness ,  --  and the fount Of hoarded hopes unsealed ,  --  and the stern grasp Of fate forbids their utterance . But , ah , no ; In the cold chamber of the dead he sleeps His last , long , quiet sleep . MANUEL . Manuel This is too much . Oh ! would to God he did ; He lives , Eugenia  --  lives to love thee still ! EUGENIA . Eugenia No ! No ! he can not live  --  say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUEL . Manuel Then let us die together  --  see him here ; The wrong 'd , the exiled Manuel , is before thee ! EUGENIA .

Eugenia Thou stirr'st  --  dost move  --  art instict then with life . ' T is he  --  oh misery ! misery ! ( She falls senseless ; Manuel receives her in his arms . ) MANUEL . Manuel Poor girl !

MANUEL . Manuel But one short moment ; It is the last that we shall spend together , Ere the black curtains of our coming fate Shall close upon the picture ! Was it well , Thus faithlessly to deal with me ? Thou knowst , To shield thee with this arm , to watch by thee , To hear thy voice , sometimes to see thee smile , Was all my wild ambition coveted . Thou knowst my bitter sorrows , and my shame . Thou dost not know  --  O ! thou canst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hope ; How in the lingering hours I built in fancy The temple of my future joys , to make The past a thought to smile at ;  --  ' t was a dream ; I woke , and found it dashed to fragments round me .

If my tongue could say the word , The swelling throbs of my now broken heart , The memories of all my perished joys , The spectres of departed hope that made The sunlight of existence  --  all would rise With one fell voice to curse  --  no , not to curse thee ; I could not curse thee , though I died , Eugenia .

False ! faithless ! all that guilt can paint to thee  --  ' Twill rive the heart , ' twill burn it ; but that thought , Forgiveness  --  O ' t would melt it into shame . MANUEL . Manuel I do ! I do forgive thee from my soul ; And in thy lonely hours , think ! think ! Eugenia , My vengeance was forgiveness . ( Savelli , without , calls Eugenia . ) EUGENIA . Eugenia I must not here remain  --  that voice  --  MANUEL . Manuel But one word more  --  EUGENIA . Eugenia Not one  --  ( struggling )  --  madman , thou'rt lost ! SAVELLI .

Manuel Ha ! ( They fight ; Savelli falls . Manuel is about to slay him , when Eugenia rushes between them . ) EUGENIA . Eugenia My husband ? Save him ! Save him ! MANUEL .

There , in communion , I 've traced the dear remembrances of childhood , Those gladsome hours of quietude and peace , When my untroubled spirit loved to roam O'er fields and dales , and in luxurious play , Basked in the sunbeam 's laughing smile  --  but they Are past .

Yet why delay ? to-night  --  they 're prisoners all ; And Beatrice believes herself deceived .

Let them not Believe that they have power in secret , used To draw the life blood from your hearts , to bind Strong chains around you , and though innocent Condemn you to the solitude of cells Where light is known as a forbidden guest . The sighs and groans which yonder vaults send forth , Call on you for revenge ; the sleeping dead , Who nobly fought for liberty and life , Speak to you from their hollow tombs , and ask An answer in your echo .

Manuel Ye are my judges  --  well ye hide your faces , Or shame would cover ye to look upon Your victim !  --  these thin limbs , worn down by grief And sorrow , and these sunken eyes , attest Your sentence .

Pietro Dost own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom ? to you  --  ye secret priests Of hell 's dark altars ?  --  this much will I own , And own it nobly  --  had I lived till dawn , This hand , this pinioned hand , had shed the blood Of many of your Senate .

Ye will revenge it , as ye must revenge The streams of blood which your unholy State Hath stained your names with ! That eternal God , Who brooks not man 's injustice , and where crime Knows no excuse ; before whose throne , ere long , This disenchanted spirit shall appeal For judgment on you . These your senators , ( Their instruments I note not ) charge me as A traitor to my country . If it were A traitorous deed , for wrongs to give revenge , I am a traitor .
