txt WE have examined , with attention , these works of a very intelligent lady , and being fully convinced of the merit of her system , we take the opportunity to recommend it , in few words , to the notice of our readers . The plan is undoubtedly formed upon correct principles of instruction , and seems to contain within itself the assurance of its own success ; hut we are well aware that the value of every practical system can only be determined by experiment , and what we ask is , that the one before us may have a fair and impartial trial . Some of our most successful instructers have , we perceive , given a verdict in its favor : perhaps others , and they are many , who have long lamented the want of some such aid in this department of instruction , may find on trial that the defect is here supplied . We speak of the general system : the details may possibly he found , on experiment , to require correction and improvement ; but such alterations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that they may be necessary should not be allowed to impair the value of a system , which is , in itself and in substance , good . The state of education in this country , so far as respects the study of history , has heretofore been sufficiently forlorn . It was regarded as an interlude , of no value , except to fill up the chasms of the graver business of instruction . Not that its importance was not understood ; but simply because the means and materials for pursuing the study were very imperfect , and // such as were within reach never had been assembled and made accessible by any connected system . Nor perhaps would it have been possible to form any such system , with the heavy and broken materials which alone existed but a few years ago . They were comprised in such a chaos of lumber , that whoever bad any thing to do with the present ,  --  any care or concern of life to attend to ,  --  - was obliged to abandon all hope of forming any intimate acquaintance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollin , Gillies , and Millot , through which the former generation waded , dolorous and malecontent , ' in search of this kind of information ,  --  those channels in which they found only the dust and bones of antiquity , and could obtain no idea of its living and breathing forms . If any one desired to know something of modern history , he was driven to such writers as Mezerai , Father Daniel , and Mariana , the very sight of whose volumes , compared with the duration of human life , was enough to fill the bravest with despair . The results were such as might have been expected : the idea of history , so formed , was a thing of shreds and patches ,  --  more resembling the maps of the Arctic ocean , where land and sea are so harmoniously blended together , than anything which had ever been explored by man . The currents of sacred and classical history came down from the earliest ages in two parallel lines , which , if produced to all eternity , would never meet nor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , which is even now hardly entitled to be regarded as matter of history , will give a hearty welcome to anything in the shape of a system , which promises to deliver the coming generation from an evil under which their fathers suffered and mourned for years . The work before us is intended to embrace , when completed , a full course of historical education . By a systematic process , the learner is to be led gradually to a familiarity with the subject , so that the memory shall not be laden with cumbrous and unmanageable materials , but only with such as bear upon the object immediately in view , and these , whether dates , incidents , observations or poetical allusions , so arranged as to be taken in with a single glance of the eye . Things well disposed require but little room ; and if a general rule of order can be established , so that the records of nations , men , sciences and opinions , shall each have their place in the mind , the student will have his materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use them . It is a great thing to begin well and to get the run ' of the subject ; every young botanist , for example , knows how familiarly a little practice teaches him to refer the new plant to its class and order , where at first all seemed hopeless confusion . In the same manner , if the learner of history begin with a right system of arrangement , the incidents will no longer sit heavy on his mind ; each will appear in its proper light and bearing ; the spirit of philosophical contemplation will then be able to draw lessons of instruction from them , for information , for improvement , or for forming probable conjectures concerning the destiny of nations or of men . Nothing however can be accomplished , unless those who commence the study have a deep interest in it ; this of course is to he formed ; and to make the learner enter into the spirit of the study at once , is one of the advantages which this system proposes to secure . The study itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut the works employed in teaching it are often such , as to quench all the enthusiasm which the young mind begins to feel . it depends on the instructer to remove this difficulty ; he must be familiar with the treasured wisdom of former times , and be able to select from orators , historians and poets , such passages as will make deep and vivid impressions . It will never do to surrender the mind to a single fascinating writer ; the effect of that habit was evident in this country a quarter of a century ago , when the young readers of Hume , republicans though they were by birth and education , were almost to a man in favor of Charles I. , forgiving all his usurpations , and thinking on the patriots of the day as cold-blooded fanatics , almost too savage to be men . Nor will it answer , on the other band , to make an indiscriminate heave-offering of dull writers , since some of them , whose works no mortal would think of journeying through , may have passages which require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having accomplished teachers ; and yet so wide is the field and so rich and various the attainments required , that no one , who has not made it an almost exclusive study , can ever teach it with success . We fully agree with Miss Peabody in the opinion that it is best to have schools entirely devoted to this study , where the leamer may , with small expense of time , be furnished with that right direction in the early steps of the study , which the young can not // be expected to take by their own sagacity , and without which , no small amount of labor and life is lost . Where this advantage is not to be had , the work before us is intended to serve as a guide , directing the attention of the teacher of common schools or of the solitary student to such books as will answer his inquiries , and save him from wandering into investigations of things which , at the moment and for the purpose , he does not need to know . The first object in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the first , or rather the preparatory part of this work , the author has kept this purpose in view . This volurne is called the First Steps to History ; ' in it , she has employed the Life of Columbus , as well calculated to inspire the interest and to form the habit on which all subsequent improvement depends . The biography of this illustrious adventurer , beside the patriotic associations which make it so attractive to the children of our country , affords a display of moral courage , perseverance and energy , such as the young naturally admire , and leads them also to an acquaintance with persons , places , scenes , and things in both worlds , such as they delight to know . He is one , who will hereafter seem to stand between the living and the dead ; his history will form the bright boundary , which separates ancient from modern times ; for his discovery was in every respect the most brilliant , immediate part of that great impulse which was then given to the mind of man by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality the direct results of principles , which had been long at work and were ready to be manifested the moment the world waked from its sleep of ages . The least thoughtful mind is led to inquire what causes led the way to his bold undertaking , and what effects his success is now producing among men . It may be said that these subjects are too large for the investigation of the young ; it may be so ; but it is something gained to give them a desire to know . Moreover , the history of the Spanish nation at that time , which can not be separated from that of Columbus , forces one into acquaintance with that great movement which brought the Saracens from the desert , and established them for so many centuries in the heart of Spain . Nothing is more captivating to the young than the description of Oriental magnificence , whether they see it contending in gallant strife with chivalry on the burning plains of Syria , or reposing in sultry splendor in its // Asiatic halls . Connected thus with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fortunately has been written by the right hand , affords an excellent starting point , where the student may begin to learn that interest ,  --  for it is a thing which must be learned ,  --  and those habits of thoughtfuiness , also , which are essential to his future success . The first volume being simply preparatory , the second is to be regarded as the beginning of the system . It contains a series of questions concerning the Hebrews , whose history is connected , by near or distant association , with that of every other Oriental race . They were thrown into the midst of the Egyptians , Assyrians , Per*ians , and every other people distinguished for arts or arms , and by following the course of their history , the learner is led easily and naturally into an acquaintance with the governments , manners , opinions and religions of early ages . The author regards the Old Testament in this connexion merely as a civil history of the Hebrew state ; and in our opinion this , considering her main design , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other aspects in which it is more important , they belong to the province of theology , which this work does not profess to teach . The authenticity of the record is proved by arguments forcible and convincing ; its divine authority is taken for granted ; but had the author undertaken to enter upon theological discussions , beside being absurdly out of place in such a work , they would necessarily have stamped it with the narrow seal of party . The learner is first made acquainted with the geography of the country in question ,  --  a tbing indispensable in preparation for the study of any history ; since without it , the recollections which the mind gathers in study , having neither local habitation nor name , would soon be irrecoverably lost . On this point reference is made to Jahn 's Archaeology , a work now common among us , which contains a vast amount of information crowded within its nutshell . For information concerning the Hebrew government and law , reference is made to Michaelis 's Commentary on the Law of Moses , which for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of the young . In general the books of reference will answer their purpose quite as well if retained in the teacher 's hands , it being his business to communicate the information which they afford , where it can be done with the happiest effect and most lasting impres*ion* Perhap there is no work which will give a just view // of the Hebrew constitution : this defect the teacher must supply ; and he can easily excite the admiration of every intelligent youth , by showing that , in the midst of tyranny and barbarism , the divinely commissioned statesman established a government of laws and not of meu ,  --  a state in which all were equal , as respected their civil rights ,  --  in which there was no human power above the people , and every member of the state was held directly responsible to God . Here , then , is a civil system , which , apart from its religious connexion , substantially resembled our own ; and to find such a system , at such a time , existing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our opinion go farther than all other arguments , to prove the divine origin of the Hebrew law . The third part of the Key contains the history of Greece , with questions referring to the historians and poets in whom the various passages of its history may he found . First , the geographical plan of Greece , in its larger outlines , is made familiar to the student 's mind , a thing most important where almost every hill and valley is a memorial of the old glories of the land . Some idea of its religion in then given , by referring to the views of Heeren and Constant on the subject ; this also is an important step in making the reader familiar with the spirit of the Greek history ; for their gods were not mere creations of fancy , but mortal characters translated ,  - -  made into gods ,  --  by the simple process of transferring their residence from the earth to the skies : like the castles of the Fairy Morgana , they were not wholly visionary ; they were only an enlarged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in the earth below . Another reason makes it necessary to he acquainted with these subjects ; those immortals have been indebted for their immortality to the power of Grecian genius and the enterprise of Grecian art ; this knowledge therefore leads on to an acquaintance with poetry and sculpture , in which the foundations of their fame are laid . It is one great object of the author , knowing how essential it is to awaken an enthusiasm in the study , to make the student familiar with the beautiful creations of antiquity , though not by a naked skeleton of its fables , nor a mere description of its forms . She knows that there is something so fascinating in those creations , that the imagination , as soon as it approaches the subject , rises and spreads its wings ; in order that it may not be tamed down by any mechanical process of instruction , // she endeavors to communicate to the learner a taste , amounting to a passion , for high thoughts and images of beauty , which shall make him travel over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory , and an eye on fire with perpetual delight . In this country , we have no means at general command for giving the learner an idea of Grecian art ; the originals are out of question , and even copies and casts are wanting . Another plan is therefore necessarily connected with this system ; it is that of furnishing a collection of drawings , illustrative of classical antiquity , giving outlines of statues , has reliefs and gems , which represent mythological stories or poetical imaginations , and adding to them the sketches which Flaxman and others have drawn , as if to show how modern taste and talent must always find its highest pride in doing reverence to the past . We earnestly hope that this interesting plan will not be abandoned , though it may not be understood and appreciated at once ; without some such aid , classical associations will never be distinct and visible as they ought to every cultivated mind . It is truly remarked , that were it only as models for the pencil , these compositions would have great value ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they fill the soul with those images of beauty , which are connected with the purest thoughts and feelings of all exalted minds . We regret that the sketch , we are able at present to give of this work , is so slight but we trust that our readers will be induced to examine it for themselves ; for we are persuaded , that all persons of any cultivation , who in their youth were desirous to become familiar with the past , can remember with sorrow how much time was wasted in unprofitable labor , and how imperfect were their attainments after all . It was like the course of- the Englishman , unenlightened in more senses than one , who visited certain scenes in Switzerland by lamp light , and returned but little impressed with the magnificence of the view ; even so the light of history , as they enjoyed it , shone on a few points of the prospect , gilding here and there an illustrious period or a memorable name , but giving no idea whatever of the extent and variety of contemplations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was owing to the want of system ; for there is nothing stronger than the hold which this subject takes on the affections . We often see those , who begin to read a work of history with distaste and // reluctance ; but it gains upon them every hour : they rueditate upon it by night and day ; it gives a direction to their thoughts and a turn to their conversation , and thus the historian , if he be able and interesting , rules for the time , an absolute sovereign of their souls . When they reach the end , they see before them a vacancy , like that which afflicted Gibbon , when he was writing the last page of his work ; but often , when the reading is over , they find that , instead of having gained larger views of human nature in past ages , they have only added a few more to that collection of pictures which hang round the dark chambers of the mind . Unless these separate scenes are connected together by a system which shows their relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation ; they have no extensive interest , and so far as respects happiness and improvement , all is dead letter in the breast . Whatever opinion may be formed respecting the system , and we confess that it appears to us that some of the more mechanical parts of it might have been as well executed by an inferior hand , no one who examines it will doubt the ability or attainments of the writer ; she is evidently a person of fine powers , and familiar with the subject which she has at heart . Her style is that of one who has never much studied the art of communicating to others , but who pours out with careless freedom the fullness of her mind . Nor is this perhaps a disadvantage ; for the great object is to give the spirit of the subject ; and animation and originality will inspire earnest enthusiasm , were it by sympathy alone , where the master of details would give up the attempt in despair.                 @ @ @ @
