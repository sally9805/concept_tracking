txt It was the fate of Christianity to struggle into existence amidst a host of violent prejudices , and , from the first hour of her being , to encounter a bitter and malignant opposition . Judaism on the one hand , and Paganism on the other , were startled by her claims ; and though for a time , while they looked at her in the feebleness of her infancy , they might have imagined that they could see signs of impotence enough to keep down their fears , yet they soon found that there was an energy and a majesty in her movements , which they could not contemplate without apprehension . They soon saw the infant , which they supposed too powerless to be regarded , putting forth the strength of a giant ; and before many years had gone by , they could not resist the conviction , that she had reached a maturity and was exerting an influence , which had no propitious hearing on their own probable destiny . rrhen came the assault in good earnest ; - an assault , which grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been consecrated by the practice and prejudices of many generations , were in daiiger of being set aside , and that the principalities and powers of Paganism , if not guarded with extraordinary care and sacrifice , were likely to receive their death-blow ; - an assault , which was sustained by the most vigorous and uncompromising efforts of Jewish prejudice on the one hand , and heathen superstition on the other . Every one , whohas looked at all at the history of the church during the first few centuries , knows that Christianity had to make her way against an array of opposition , which no other system of religion has ever had to encounter ; and that , though she marched forward with a VOL xXXVI. - NO. 79. 44 // firm and steady step , yet it was because she had fortitude enough to wade through an ocean of blood . Nor was it in the early age alone7 that Christianity was opposed : on the contrary there has never been a time , in which there have not been found a multitude who would gladly have driven her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at different periods ; but the spirit ot hostility has shown itselfat every period . And there has been every variety of weapon employed in the unhallowed conflict , which a malignant ingenuity could desire . Wit , and ridicule , and sophistry7 and learning , and even eloquence , have been tasked to the utmost in the great effort to bring the Gospel into contempt7 and , if possible , to drive it out of the world . The sentimentalism of Rousseau , the sneering sarcasms of Voltaire , the refined reasoning of Hume , the ribaldry of Paine , have each heen enlisted for this malignant end . And even in our own day , though we have reason to believe that avowed infi ' - delity , especially in all the more decent walks of life , is upon the wane , yet it can not be denied that there are some , scattered through almost every community , who call in question the divinity of the sacred Scriptures ;  --  and though most of these know little of that concerning which they affirm , yet they supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their knowledge to ensure them at least a limited and temporary success . We can not regard it otherwise than as a stain upon the character of this age , that it has witnessed , on both sides of the Atlantic , the unblushing impudence of a female preacher of infidelity ; and that curiosity , or some xvorse principle , has drawn so many within the sound of her voice or the circle of her influence . But that wise and good Providence , which from seeming evil still educes good , has taken care that the desperate opposition with which Christianity has had to struggle should be rendered subservient to her triumph . This has been effected in two ways . In the first place , the nature and extent of the opposition have been such , that the fact , that Christianity has successfully resisted it , and has held a steady and triumphant course onward , leaves no room to doubt her claims to a supernatural origin ; and then again , this very opposition has been met with a corresponding defence , and the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a much greater variety of forms , and doubtless with much greater clearness // and strength , than if their autbority had not been so perpetually and so variously assailed . If Bolingbroke and Flume , Rousseau and Voltaire , and a multitude of their contemporaries and predecessors exerted themselves to the utmost to make the world believe that Christianity is but a miserable cheat , Locke , and Lardner , and Campbell , and Paley. , and Chalmers , and Wilson , and a host of others , both among the living and the dead , have employed their noble powers in meeting these champions of infidelity upon their own ground , and demonstrating the sophistry of their reasoning and the weakness of their pretensions . If Hume*s argument against miracles had never been published , the world would have been without the incomparable work of Dr. Campbell , and several other admirable treatises on the same subject ; which , as they were the product of much thought and learning , will no doubt contribute to elevate the views , and confirm the faith of multitudes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the enemies of the Gospel have indirectly ministered to its success and if it had not been for their efforts , no doubt a considerable part of that flood of light by which its divine authority is illustrated , would have been withheld . The result of the state of things to which we have referred has been , that there is scarcely any department of human thou * ht* which has been enriched by a greater amount and variety of intellectual labor , than that of the evidences of Christianity . Some of the greatest and most accomplished minds have labored in this field with all the might , and zeal , and perseverance , which were ever displayed in any cause ; and the results of their efforts have been given to the world in various publications , adapted to every order of intellect . There are books on this subject of a general character , which professedly go over the whole ground , and present the argument in all its various l ) ar1* and in the harmony of its just proportions . And there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing only upon a single point or a few points of greater or less prominence . Here is a treatise , which contains the most common-sense and popular view of the argument , designed especially for those who are not willing to submit to the labor of deep and patient thought ; and there is another , on which treasures of thought and learning have been expended , and which will repay the attentive perusal - of thinking and learned men . In short , whoever desires to investigate any // part of this subject , to examine the evidences of Christianity in a more or less popular form , need be at no loss for helps to the accomplishment of his object . Possibly the query may arise with some , whether , since the world is so full of books on the evidences of Christianity , the work , whose title we have placed at the head of this article , could really be considered a desideratum . We answer without hesitation that it could ; and for several reasons . In the first place , it is no objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence other good books , and even many of them , on the same subject ; for who does not know , that many people are induced to read a work from their knowledge of its author , or from personal friendship , or from his living in the same community to which they belong , or from other accidental considerations , who would otherwise never have had their attention directed to it , or perhaps even known of its existence ? To say nothing in this connexion of the uncommon excellence of the present work , the writer has for a considerable time been well known as one of the most popular preachers , and one of the most active and influential clergymen of the denomination to which he belongs ; and since the publication of these lectures , he has been appointed to the highly responsible place of Bishop of Ohio ,  --  a sufficiently decisive testimony of the estimation in which he is held by the members of his own communion ; and we may add , a sufficiently decisive pledge that such a work as the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive circulation . Admit that there may be other works on the subject of equal excellence with his , yet so long as this will be read by many who would perhaps never hear of the others , the fact of their existence is surely no argument against the present publication . Besides , the number of those who read on religious subjects is constantly increasing ; and it is right that there should be a proportional increase of religious books ; and especially , that there should be in this respect a reasonable accommodation to the taste and spirit of the age . There are several works of great excellence on the evidences of Christianity , which were written some seventy-five years ago , and some at a still earlier period , which are read and highly esteemed at this day by a few who care more for the spirit than the letter , more for the thought than the style ; but with the great mass of readers , the fact of their having come down to us in the appropriate // dress of the age in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Mcllvaine 's book is written in an unusually attractive and popular style , and will be read by many , with whom naked fact and argument , apart from all literary attractions , would scarcely arrest , much less enchain , the attention . But there is yet another ground , on which this publication is to be regarded as seasonable and important . We refer to tbe fact , that it consists of a course of Lectures designed particularly for young men . The rising generation are emphatically the hope of the world ; for only a few years will have passed away , before the whole moral machinery of the age will be in their hands . It is hardly necessary to say , that the views which they form of the great subject which these Lectures contemplate , must enter essentially into their character ; and of course must give a complexion to the influence which they exert , not only upon their own , but upon coming generations . The destiny of our own country , in particular , is not improbably to be decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are now coming upon the stage ; and if it should turn out that they shall , to a great extent , set at naught the authority and obligations of Christianity , we need only look back to the fearful convulsions of revolutionary France , to find the sad prototype of our own probable destiny . We regard it therefore as a matter of great moment , that our young men should become thoroughly established in their belief of the Christian religion ; and we hail as an omen of good to our country , and to the world , any publication on this subject , which is fitted to induce them to bring to it a considerate and earnest attention . The work before us , as it was more especially designed for this class , is adapted with uncommon felicity to their taste , and habits , and circumstances . If we do not greatly mistake , it will also be found that the fact of the author 's having written with this class of hearers and of readers in his eye , in connexion with the uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , will secure to it an introduction as a text-book into some of our literary institutio.ns. * * Since this article was written , we are informed that the work which we are noticing has been adopted as a text-book in several colleges ; and that the first edition having been disposed of , a new and stereotype edition is about to be issued , in a form and at a price adapted to give it general circulation . // Of the importance of the subject which Doctor Mcllvaine has discussed , there can be but one opinion among those who admit the Bible to be an inspired book , and Christianity to be a religion from heaven ; but it has happened somewhat strangely , that while the divine authority of the Scriptures has almost by common consent been regarded in Christian countries as a matter of the deepest moment , the great mass of the people have known little and inquired little concerning the evidence by which the high claims of these writings are supported . We doubt not that there are many who look upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its contents , and have to some extent arranged its doctrines into a system , who have never yet suitably investigated its claims to inspiration , or intelligently settled the previous question , whether it really bears the unequivocal marks of a divine origin . And if this be true to a considerable extent even of those who are accustomed to read and value the Scriptures , much rather may we expect it to be true of the multitude , with whom there are few , if any , intervals of sober reflection . It is the natural result of this state of things , that Christianity loses a great part of its legitimate influence upon the minds of men . Even those who have made themselves familiar with its truths , are far less secure against the cavils and assaults of skepticism , than if they had faithfully and patiently studied its evidences ; while a much larger class , who have no knowledge respecting it except xvhat may have fought itself into their minds from the pulpit in spite of their drowsy or careless hearing , are left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may happen to be assailed . In the hope of commending Dr. M. 's work , and especially the subject of it , to our readers in general , and particularly to that class for whom the book seems to have been more immediately designed , we will , in what remains of this article , throw out a few hints illustrative of the general character of the evidence on which the divine authority of the Scriptures rests , and of the influence which a sober and diligent contemplation of this subject is fitted to exert on the intellectual and moral character . One of the first things which strikes the mind in relation to this subject is , the great extent and copiousness of the evidence which presents itself . There is no other fact of which we have any knowledge , which is susceptible of such overwhelming // proof from such a variety of sources , as that which involves the truth of Christianity and the divinity of the Scriptures . Of a multitude of arguments which are uro each one might legitimately form the basis of a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are all brought together and the sum total of the evidence is viewed , one might suppose it would be enough to overcome the most stubborn incredulity . It is an error with many , that they contemplate the evidence too partially ; that instead of suffering the mind to range through the whole broad field that stretches before them , they content themselves with surveying a single portion of it , and that perhaps not the most important ; the consequence of which is , that though the mind yields its assent to the grand proposition which is before it , yet there is much less strength of conviction , than would have resulted from an investigation of the whole subject . Nothing is more common , for instance , than in estimating the testimony which the New Testament contains to the great facts of Christianit ) r , than to regard it as if it were the testimony of a single individual whereas the truth is , that it is the testimony of several independent witnesses ; so that if any one of these books were proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rest , while the mutual agreement of the whole goes greatly to confirm the authenticity of each . Every intelligent reader of the Scriptures must be well aware of this fact ; and yet it may reasonably be doubted whether even readers of this description are not . through the influence of habit , frequently betrayed into the error to which we have referred . Take , for instance , the evidence derived from miracles ; - and whoever will contemplate the argument in its various bearings , u nless he deliberately and obstinately shuts his eyes against the light , must be overxvhelmed with the conviction , that the divine authority which the Gospel claims fairly belongs to it . Or take the argument from prophecy , and let the predictions which were recorded several thousand years ago be compared with the history of succeeding ages , or even with those developments of Providence which have scarcely yet become matter of history , and whoever , upon such a comparison , will decide that these predictions were nothing more than fortunate conjectures , and that there is no impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gifted with a power of resisting evidence , which will set the light of noonday at de // fiance . Or let the book itself be scrutinized ,  --  no matter how narrowly ; - let the sublimity of style , the pathos and beauty and grandeur of conception , the harmony of the doctrines , the excellence of the precepts , the originality of the characters , and especially of the character of the great founder of Christianity , the conformity of local and accidental allusions to what we know from other sources to have been the then existing state of things ,  --  let each of these distinct branches of evidence be contemplated and diligently and patiently studied , and each will be like a separate witness standing up to assert the divine authority of the Scriptures , while the whole combined will yield a mass of testimony , before which skepticism may well shrink into silence . It is another interesting feature in the character of this evidence , that it is so various as to be accommodated to a diversity of intellectu*il tastes and habits of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will possess the greatest weight ; with another , the argument from prophecy ; with another , the argument from the style and spirit and harmony of these writings ; while another still will be most impressed by the preservation of Christianity through so many ages of darkness and conflict , , and the regenerating influence which it is seen to be every day exerting upon the world , and the unequivocal indications that it is marching forward to a complete triumph ; to say nothing of the fact , that perhaps* the most convincing argument of all is derived from the personal experience which multitudes have of the influence of this religion upon the heart and life . It is true , indeed , that some parts of this evidence can b* more readily comprehended than others ; though there are no parts of it which are not fairly within the range of an ordinary mind , provided it will give to it an honest and diligent application of its powers . And it has been ordained by the kindness of Providence , that those proofs which are the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is derived from the benign influence of Christianity , it is within the power of every one to contemplate at no greater expense than that of casting an eye upon the world around him , or , as the case may be , upon the world within him . And if great and more speculative minds will have some argument more accommodated than this to their reflecting and studious habits , let them contemplate that which is derived from miracles , taking , if they will , the immortal // 353 work of Dr. Campbell as their guide ; and they will soon find themselves in a region in which they may task their intellects to the utmost , and still find occasion for more deep and extended thought . It is worthy of remark , also , that some of ' the proofs by which the divine authority of the Scriptures is sustained , grow stronger with the lapse of ages , and that the evidence is , on the whole , of a progressive character . It is obvious at first view , that this remark forcibly applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures record reach down through the whole track of ages to the end of the world ; and of course each successive age must add strength to the argument , by developing new facts in which the prophecies have their fulfilment . Before the advent of the Messiah , there were numerous prophecies in existence in which the birth , character and death of this wonderful persona0e were minutely described ; and no doubt the pious Jew recognised in them one evidence of the divine authority of the books in which they were contained ; but how much more of the character of demonstration does the argument assume , since Jesus has actually come , bearing the very character , performing the very works , and dying the very death which these writings have attributed to him ! The destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans had been predicted long before the event , and even he who spake as never man spake , had repeatedly and solemnly foretold it ; but *p to the time when these prophecies were fulfilled , although they might have been believed by the followers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as furnishing evidence that he had come from God . When that fearful event had actually occurred , and occurred too in most striking correspondence with the whole tenor of prophecy respecting it , there was at once a sensible addition to the proof , that Jesus was neither an impostor nor an enthusiast . In like manner , events have been occurring in later years , in which the diligent student of prophecy will recognise a fulfilment of ancient prediction ; and as the plati of Providence continues gradually to unfold , the admirable harmony that will be found to exist between the course of events in the future , and the prophetical representations of the past , will render this argument for the truth of the Gospel more and more conclusive to the end of time . The same general remark holds true of the argument from // the continued , existence of Christianity , and of the writings with which it is identified . Immediately after the canon of Scripture was completed , ( we refer particularly to the books of the New Testament , ) it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this . new religion and the record of it , instead of being imperishable , would soon pass into obscurity , and *t no distant period , be blotted out of existence . And though such predictions on the part of the enemies of Christianity did not at all weaken the confidence of its friends , yet it is obvious that the only reasoning with which they could have been met , at that period , must have been founded upon probabilities rather than upon facts . But now many ages have passed away , and some of them have been ages of darkness and blood , .  --  and yet the Bible , and the religion of the Bible , not only still have a being , but are going forth triumphantly on the four winds to bless and renovate the world . When Christianity was first introduced , though its influence was in the highest degree benign , yet its empire was extremely limited : there was . only a little spot on the whole face of the earth , which it could actually call its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the world : there is not a continent , we had almost said , not a country , nor even an island , upon which some rays of its glory have not fallen ; and there is every thing in the present aspect of events , to indicate that its dominion will ere long become universal . The first Christians knew that Christianity was a divine religion , to say nothing of other evidences , because they had the witness within ; - it exerted an influence upon them which was altogether unearthly , not only regenerating their characters and elevating their aims , but in some instances enabling them to work miracles ; but Christians of this day can look far beyond the limits of their own experience , or even the narrow circle of their own asso* ciates , and can find armies of witnesses for the truth of the Gos .. pel in every part of the world . And this mass of testimony , great as it now is , is destined to become continually greater , until the Gospel shall have gained a complete triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that new light is constantly poured upon the inspired record from the researches and observations of travellers . It would be strange indeed , if , after this lapse of time , it should be perfectly easy to understand all the facts and usages which are incidentally alluded to in the Scriptures ; and it shows at once the weakness // and unfairness of infidelity , that she has availed herself of her own ignorance on this subject to bring contempt on the Scriptures , by endeavoring to stamp them with contradiction and absurdity . It is true , indeed , that when these hooks were first written , no objection could have been made to them on this ground , because they were circulating among a people who were familiar with all the vustoms of the country in which they were written ; but as Christianity spread beyond the region of its nativity , and as it was propagated from one age to another , it came to pass in process of time , that many of the incidental allusions contained in the Bible were to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , with many unreflecting minds , they have operated to diminish its authority and influence . But the spirit of enterprise that has been awakened in modern times , has carried many intelligent travellers into the heart of those very countries in which the Scriptures were written , and has led to a minute and accura* investigation of the prevailing forms and usages ; and the result has been that , in the present constitution of society , even after the lapse of so many ages marked by little else than revolution and decay , there would seem to be bound up the elements of a state of things , resembling in many respects that which existed in the infancy of Christianity . Whoever will consult the judicious work of Harmer on this subject , or will examine any of the more modern books of Iravels in the East , will be surprised to find what a flood of illustration is poured upon the sacred volume by a reference to many of the usages which prevail to this day in those countries . Is it not fair to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we may add missionary , enterprise continues to increase , this important branch of the evidence of the authenticity of the Scriptures will be more and more fully illustrated , until the argument has become as irresistible , as the nature of the case will admit ? While it must be acknowledged by every impartial mind that some parts of the evidence are in their nature progressive , it may perhaps be thought that others grow weaker by age ; and especially that the argument from miracl*s can not have the same influence now , as in the age when the miracles were performed . It must be admitted that , constituted as we are in our present state of existence , whatever is addressed immediately to the senses ordinarily makes a stronger impression on // the mind , than what is presented as an object of faiih ; and hence there is every reason to believe , that those who witnessed the miracles of Jesus and his apostles , or who were the subjects of them , were impressed by them more deeply than it is possible they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events after the lapse of many ages . But though the iml ) ression may be deeper in the one case than in the other , the real force of the argument is not after all di .. minished by distance of time ; for the evidence that these miracles were performed at the time when they claim to have been is complete ; and though it may be less impressive than if it had been addressed to our senses , yet when weighed in the balance of sober judgment , it will not be found wanting in any thing that is necessary to entitle it to full credit . The question , whether the miracles which are recorded in the New Testament were actually performed , being once settled in the affirmative , ( and we venture to say that the argument which proves this is as conclusive as the nature of the case will admit , allowing them to have been thus performed , ) the evidence froiri this source in favor of the divinity of the Gospel becomes , to all practical purposes , as strong as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject addressed to our faith , to establish a conviction as complete and operative , though perhaps less vivid , than if we had actually heard the winds die away , and seen the dead come forth from their graves , and felt the languid pulse quicken into a tone of health and vigor , at the bidding of Jesus . The hints which we have already thrown out in respect to the general character of the evidence by which the claims of Christianity are supported , fairly suggest the inference , that the diligent contemplation and study of this subject is adapted to quicken and elevate the powers of the mind and the feelings of the heart . Any thing , which brings the intellectual faculties into vigorous exercise , contributes of course to their improvement ; but the more elevated and important the subject on which they are emplQyed , the more valuable will be the culture which results from such exercise . But the subject which we are contemnplating is , in its various bearings and relations , the noblest that can come within the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties to it in a proper manner may expect that they will be quickened , and brightened and elevated under its influence . Besides , he who // studies the evidences of Christianity intelligently , is necessarily Carrie ( l out into other departments of knowledge , than that in which he would seem to be mainly occupied . For in* stance , in examining the argument from the prophecies , if he will do it to the best advantage , he must search deep into the history both of ancient and modern times , and must diligently compare the recorded predictions with the recorded facts ; and he must connect the events of different ages with each other , and ascertain , as far as possible , their various relations in the system of Providence . In examining the internal evidence , especially that branch of it which relates to ancient and local usages , he will find constant occasion to refer to the geography , the history , the laws of the countries in which the Scriptures were written ; and this must of course open before him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence , which respects the adaptation of Christianity to the intellectual and moral character of man , he will be led of course to analyze , as far as he can , the mysterious mechanism of the human mind , and thus to make himself acquainted with the noblest kind of philosophy . In short , there is scarcely any department of science or learning , which may not be turned to useful account in a close investigation of the truth of Christianity ; and whoever sets ahout this work and perseveres in it with a determination to be master of the whole subject , will almost of course in the end find himself accomplished in many other departments of useful knowledge . It should be borne in mind , also , in estimating the intellectual and moral influence of the study of this subject , that an investi* gation of the truths which the Bible contains , at least to some extent , is essential to a view of the complete evidence of its divine authority . The external evidences may indeed be understood and appreciated , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the internal evidence , being built in a great measure on the nature and harmony of the trutls which it reveals , can never be even tolerably apprehended , where these truths have not been diligently contemplated and compared . Hence it is , that the study of this branch of the evidences leads to an acquaintance with the doctrines of the Bible ; and there is so much of grandeur and divinity belong- ' ing to them , that it is impossible they should be studied with a right spirit , without purifying and elevating the moral feelings . // It is a law of human nature , that the objects upon which our thoughts are employed help to form our characters ; and that the views and feelings of an individual will he elevated or grovelling , in a great measure , according to the objects and associations with which he is most conversant . Since , then , Christianity brings the mind into contact with such only as are worthy of its noble powers and the dignity of its immortal existence , its tendency must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to impress upon it the living image of moral beauty . And happily we are not left to form our conclusions on this subject , independently of the light which is furnished by facts ; for we may safely and confidently appeal both to history and observation for evidence , that the sublimest models of moral character which the world has seen have been formed in the diligent and devout contemplation of the great facts and precepts of the Bible . In proportion as this sacred hook is studied , its evidences and truths understood , and its legitimate influence felt , we confidently expect that the standard of intellectual and moral character will rise , and a spirit of reform and renovation will diffuse itself over the world . We intended at the beginning of this article to have given a brief analysis of Dr. Mcllvaine 's book , but as our remarks have already run beyond the limit we had proposed , we must refer our readers to the book itself for a knowledge of its contents . It will not supersede other works of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate if it should ; but it is worthy of an extensive circulation , and we have no doubt is destined to great usefulness . It is a favorable circumstance attending it , that it is not only distinguished throughout by sound and perspicuous reasoning , and in many instances by eloquence of a high order , hut also that it is pervaded by the amiable , pure and generous spirit which Christianity inspires . May the benevolent wish of its author be accomplished , in its becoming instrumental in confirming the faith and elevating the views especially of our young men , in whose intellectual and moral character may be bound up the destinies of our country though successive ages !
