txt A BRIEF notice was taken of the " Life and Select Discourses* ' of Mr. Stearns in our number for July , 1838 . The second edition of the work is wholly in the form of // qwq Though " Wide is his parish , and houses fer asunder , Yet he must kave nought for no rain nc thonder . " It is evident , that no man can give himself up to such cares and influences without losing all originality and freshness of character and feeling , unless , by a determined and systematic effort , he makes the cultivation of his own mind a prominent object of his life . He can not for a long time profit others without it . But this is not the motive which we would at present urge . He owes it to himself ; he must not neglect himself in caring for others ; he is of as much importance as any other individual , considered as an intelligent being ; his // own character and influence can not be formed or sustained without watchfulness against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who should withdraw from the world and give himself to solitary study , would soon be unfit for the Christian ministry , and lose perhaps the best of his opportunities for moral improvement . A minister must live and move amongst his people , if he would be successful even as a preacher . Subjects suggested by the experience of a parishioner , and coming , crystallized and sparkling with accretions gained by passing through the well-stored mind of the preacher , will be likely to affect many minds . All discourses , however , are not , they can not be , drawn from incidents in a parish . There are themes which are not of the will of man . But even these depend , for their effect upon a congregation , on that power of presenting truth which is learned only by knowing the channels in which the thoughts of men are apt to flow , and on that ability to make a subject practical which is gained by acquaintance with the wants and errors of the human mind . To this we may add the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general knowledge . Popular lectures make men familiar not only with the various subjects of literature and science , but with the best forms of thom*ght and expression . They bring their instructed minds to the ministrations of the sanctuary ; and , while the preacher has the advantage over all who address them , in his opportunities of reaching their minds and hearts , be must not , in reliance on this superiority , fail to make his " profiting appear to all . " He should seek for the best gifts in thinking and writing and speaking , that his instructions may not be held in disadvantageous comparison with those of literary teachers . If , instead of suggesting new trains of thought , or presenting sacred truth in varied and interesting lights , he occupies his discourses chiefly with exhortations , or moralizes effeminately , or abounds excessively in that tropical luxuriance to which an imaginative mind is prone , he will excite the disrespect , if not the contempt , of his hearers . On the principle of self-defence , as a means of continuing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is essential that the minister take heed to these things . But we now recur to // our original motive for self-cultivation , from which we have thus digressed to magnify its importance . As the camomile gives out its fragrance and multiplies itself by being trodden underfoot , so the minister , who sacredly attends to the improvement of his own mind , is helped in his intellectual efforts by those incessant and urgent demands upon him , which oppress and overcome one who does not study . The studious minister is a student everywhere ; the secretive powers of his mind are always at work ; he is getting intellectual and moral nourishment from men and things , from cursory reading , from passing events and scenes . When called to public intellectual effort , if his health and spirits are in a proper tone , he will have an alacrity of thought and feeling from the influence of active duties upon his cultivated mind . In his private ministerial labors , the consciousness of doing his duty to himself as an intellectual being will give him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and amongst men . He verifies Cicero 's eulogium upon letters ; " IDelectant domi , non impediunt foris ; - nobiscum peregrinantur . " There is an electricity about the mind of such a man , which accumulates thoughts and illustrations wherever he may be . His mind is fertilized , and the seeds of things , which drop into it from books or observation , yield , some thirty , some sixty , and some a hundred fold . The habit of original study gives a man an invigoration , a muscularity of mind , which impresses others with a sense of his strength . He makes a path of his own through every subject . So long as the studies which a clergyman pursues are not unprofitable ( and it is hard to say of almost any thing , as a subject of investigation , that it is useless ) , and provided he does not become absorbed in it , as eccentric minds are apt to be in their odd selections , we had almost said it is no matter what a man chooses by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the things which lie immediately within the scope of his profession , and those concentric studies which belong to his calling , every one who would write sermons is obliged in some manner to regard . But there is something to be done for the mind , beyond its ordinary occupation with mere professional studies . These will soon fatigue and disgust , if not interchanged with studies which have no immediate relation to the profes // sion . It is of great use to keep up a course of reading , or the study of some language , or the investigation of some science , which has not , perceptihly , even a remote connexion with one 's calling . It gives a vigor to the intellectual powers upon returning to the specific duties of the profession . It imparts a self-respect amongst men ; it opens unexpected sources of illustration . There will he one effect from a determined adherence to the principle we are considering , which many preachers , we can not doubt , would find favorable to their increased usefulness . It would lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious minister is apt to employ his time in intellectual efforts for the pulpit , which on account of their number are necessarily inferior , except that occasionally , in a moment of inspiration , he will produce a discourse which he will dare to rank among his happy efforts . When he looks over his manuscripts , his heart sometimes sinks at the sight of what he can not regard otherwise than as useless matter ; - though , when he wrote and preached these discourses , they had to his mind the interest of novelty and of a present excitement . Few discourses will have the same interest to the writer 's mind at all times ; they should not , therefore , be hastily condemned ; hut we believe that the younger clergy , to say the least , generally feel , that they have a collection of manuscripts , prepared amidst the multiplicity of parochial cares , which are unfit to he repeated , or to be read hy another . We believe that this evil can be in a measure remedied , though juvenile efforts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the writer . The evil , we believe , can be remedied in part hy a solemn determination to make the preparation for the pulpit the first and great labor of the ministerial life , by devoting much time to the selection and arrangement of each subject , and , by right habits of selfimprovement , bringing a well-stored mind to its discussion . If a minister sustains himself and makes visible improvement in his pulpit , he is established in the confidence and respect of his people ; but , if he fails here , however laborious and affectionate and faithful he may be elsewhere , the people will soon tire of his services . Now , if , instead of preparing two sermons a week , each hastily written , the time and strength should be devoted to one , the influence of the pulpit would // be greater , the people would be more permanently edified , the preparation of discourses would become easier and more pleasant , and , what is desirable , a great number of them would bear to be repeated . Some plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service on the Sabbath , such as preaching extempore , or a system of exchanges , will enable the young preacher to advance in his ministerial labor with pleasure and profit . These remarks have an important bearing upon a topic of peculiar interest to parishes and the clergy at the present day . We refer to the frequent dismission of ministers . We have no doubt , that one cause of this evil is the want of studious habits in many of the clergy , owing in part to the increased benevolent efforts of the times . If a minister considered it a principal object of his life to study , not only would the people be better satisfied with his labors , but he would think less of the inconveniences and trials of his place . He would be so absorbed in his literary and religious pursuits , that he would not feel many of the irritating things to which an indolent habit with regard to study makes him sensitive . Want of support , serious divisions in his parish , or dissatisfaction with his services , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , without his fault and against his wishes , in his dismission . But a great cause of the removal of ministers at the present day , we have reason to believe , is a dissatisfaction with their places of labor , which might in many cases be prevented by better habits of study . A man , who is conscious of advancement in true learning , will so perceive his ability to profit others , and feel a self-sustaining energy from the natural effect of right mental exercise , as to look upon his people , in a good sense , as his dependents , rather than upon himself as subject to their caprice . Its effect upon him , as to the anticipation or fear of trouble in his parish , compared with a slothful spirit , is , that , whereas in the one case he will " flee when no man pursueth , " in the other , he will be " bold as a lion . " He will be superior to the petty causes of discontent which so often embitter and finally destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchange of parochial duties with sedentary pursuits , provided his habits of study and of relaxation are proper . His advancement in knowledge , and in ability to explain and defend the truth , will be perceived and felt . His // topics of discourse will be so varied , that he will not abound in exhortations which proceed from no definite truth , or which , if they have a form of doctrine for their foundation , remind one of those willows which rise a little way from the earth with a poor , cropped trunk , and straightway dishevel themselves into a multitude of rods . The habit of perpetual exhortation irritates the minds of men , and does little or no good . Its reflex influence on the preacher is pernicious . Discouragement , temptation to say sharp things , a sour spirit towards those who do not yield to his exhortations , will not unfrequently be the fatal result of such habits of preaching ; and then comes a conviction , that his usefulness is at an end in his present place , and that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abram , not knowing whither he goes . Many cases of this kind , we have no question , would have been prevented by suitable habits of study . It is but of little consequence , after all , to a good and faithful minister , where he is settled , as it regards his own profit , or his influence on the world . A man may be almost buried in a hamlet amongst the mountains . The world may never hear or read his name . He faithfully uses the trust committed to him , and dies almost unknown . Such an one may not only be acknowledged hereafter as a better servant than another , whose name and fame were great amongst men , but it may also happen , that the tradition , if not the contemporaneous record , of his hidden life , is published to the world and then his simple faith , his unambitious spirit , his devoted love for his Master and his charge , have a greater effect upon the world , than he could have produced , if he had preached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes of a great city . There are places , small and inconsiderable , in our own and in other lands , which will probably be known , for many generations , by their associatioii with the name and memory of the minister , who spent his life in their quiet and almost unknown retirements . We are deceived , if we think that our characters or usefulness depend , mainly , upon our places of labor . Young ministers , especially , need to learn , that their usefulness is not to be computed by their immediate and obvious success . Opposite the window , at which we are writing , there is a tall , young elm . Its trunk , black with the rain which is now falling , shows , in strong contrast , the // qwq vation . We have spoken chiefly of intellectual culture . The Christian ministry affords the best possible opportunities for moral self-cultivation . In observing examples of excellent goodness , and also of the unsuspected deceitfulness of the human heart , in commending and reproving others , a minister will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to make others better , how can he , without hypocrisy , neglect to practise his own teachings ? Secluded from the world in a degree favorable to reflection , and yet continually called into the world , at least by his official intcrcourse with his people , he fully realizes all that is good in the idea of the monastic life , while he is preserved from its injurious abuse . He is not taken " out of the world , " but is in a great measure kept " from the evil . " He has advantages for learning all that is of general value in other callings , without the undesirable liabilities and necessities of those callings . His studies , for instance , may lead him into some of the paths of that profession which is concerned with the principles of law ; for a knowledge of these principles is of use in the statement and illustration of Christian truth ; but how different with him is the object and use of such knowledge , from its employment in the perplexing and wearisome contests of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // principles of almost every other calling ; the Christian minister has an advantage from them , in which , compared with those who are employed in their practical application to the arts and purposes of life , he is like the earth , which drinks in the shoxvers which the sun , and sea , and clouds have wrought . He seems to be set apart , in every respect , by the arrangements of Providence , for the highest advantage to his moral improvement , and , at the same time , he is deprived of no privilege , nor excluded from any thing which is necessary to his consciousness of being a member , in full communion , of the great human family . The improvement of these opportunities for moral culture will show itself in the character of his appeals from the pulpit . A man , who has done nothing but inform himself , by study , with regard to facts and theories , will address himself only to the understanding , and that with but little success . He will be , perhaps , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher . We remember Burke 's opinion of " the heart of a thorough-bred metaphysician . " The subjects , with which a preacher is conversant , and the motives which are supposed to influence him , will , of course , sever his heart from the cold and inhuman influences , which gather round the soul of one , whose chief employment is to practise metaphysical alchemy upon the nature of man . But , next to him , in doing injustice to the nature which God has given us , is the man who sets forth moral and religious truth , as though we had only the power of cold and barren intellection . What a mysterious and dread power is the human conscience ! To approach it , and deal with it successfully , requires more art and care than in approaching a Pythoness - to secure its well-instructed aid , to prevent its encouragement of evil doing , is oftentimes a harder work than was the bringing back of Eurydice from hell . The man , who would do it successfully , must be able to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust we have a good conscience. ** He must know its ocean-like depths and changes , its troubled YnlXows , hs ? haThyon peace . lie must ? have exper*ienced fhe bitterness of sorrow at its silence with regard to his errors and sins , when it was spell-bound by evil desire ; he must have felt its power , when it afterward shouted , like a giant by reason of wine . Of the human conscience , it may be said , " Its roaring is the roaring of a lion , but its favor is as // dew upon the grass . " Surely none but he who has made himself a study , can speak of such things successfully to his fellow-men ; and we say , that there are no opportunities for such study more favorable than those which he enjoys , who has the " cure of souls , " and is thereby led , if he is a sincere and honest man , to a self-application of the errors , and the self-deceit , and the good moral examples of others . The Apostle Poule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inaketh joy , and wepen with swiche folk as wepen. " * Emotion is indispensable to the highest usefulness in preaching ; and there are no circumstances which call into exercise the various emotions of the human soul , to be compared with those which occur in the experience of a parish clergyman . The necessity of sympathizing with the joys and sorrows of his flock , gives one , who is sincerely engaged in doing good to his fellow-creatures , that moral sensibility which is essential to completeness of character . He is forbidden to be a Stoic , by the irresistible appeals which the circumstances of his people make to his heart . He can not he diligent without having continual occasion for the exercise , and so for the cultivation , of feelings , which , to some , strangely seem unmanly , but without which man is not complete . Pride makes us strive to conceal a softness and delicacy , which nature and the providence of God conspire to produce by things and events around us . We can not yield ourselves up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural influence of many of the events of life is to make us tender and gentle . We need not be ashamed of this , for true genius always has a touch of the feminine . Even in those cases , in which the reign of horrid passions has made the heart desolate of every good thing , no sooner does trouble come , than we discover this same attendant of greatness ; as when the frost falls on an evergreen , the vine , which had hid itself in the changeless tree , turns red , and shows itself , in striking contrast to the unyielding green . But there is danger , to some extent at the present day , of an undue predominance of sentiment in the character and feelings . The *pulpit determines the moral sentiments of men , more than any other instrumentality , when the clergy // are men of proper intellectual and moral influence . The philosophy which they teach , in connexion with religion , pervades the community . They may inculcate a cold , unfeeling system of moral sentiments , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and an opposite error . By appealing to the religious principle in man , which is intimately associated with the love of the mysterious , it is easy to affect meditative minds with such a passion for spiritualizing , that they will dwell continually in an ideal world . There is a luxury to some in spiritual dreams ; a witchery in an imagination , to whose eye new and strange forms of beauty and of supposed truth come forth from common or heretofore unheeded things , investing characters and places with sentimental charms , and making " the sable cloud " of mystery " Turn out its silvery lining on the night . " It is true enough , that we live in a world where sensitive minds are exposed to painful contact with vulgar people . It is also true , that it is rare to meet with those who are natural and simple in their feelings , who have instinctive and just perceptions of natural beauty , who are artless , and humble , and modest , and free from selfishness . In weariness of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senses furnish , there is a temptation , with many , to indulge in reveries , and roam in the solitudes of a fanciful creation , and , when they return to every-day life , to feel and think about every thing with a spiritualized habit of mind . The danger from this is a prevailing effeminacy of thought and feeling , and a more exquisite state of the moral sensibilities than is consistent with the absolute duties of life . We have no sympathy with those who allow no refined sentiments , which are incapable of demonstration hy an anatomical knife , or by figures . But when a system of morals , or of natural or revealed religion , is built upon them , and , chiefly , with them , there is cause for alarm . We deplore that austere and unfeeling method of representing religious truth , as though men had no fancy or imagination . He who overlooks these powers , in addressing men , must be strangely ignorant of the history of literature , and the universal sympathy of the human mind with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be igno // qwq thee , lest thou he filled therewith and vomit it . " The leading and commanding power of a preacher should , no doubt , be investigation and argutnent . But let him add to his faith , virtue ; - let moral sentiments , and feelings coming from the original depths of the soul , blend with his intellectual conceptions . He is only half a man and half a preacher , if he fails of this . His example and authority for it are the teachings of him , who spake as never man spake . Some , who are earnest in preaching against error , preach truth in such forms , and with such absence of emotion , that their truth is practical error . The studies , the meditations , the devotions , the various scenes , which are incident to the // Christian ministry , it would seem , are sufflcient to make any one ardent in this calling , and to excite and cultivate those emotions , which are the beauty and excellency of an intelligent mind . The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the preceding remarks . He laid the foundations of his mind in severe and patient study . It was his custom , in his early literary pursuits , to search out the principles of what he learned , in a systematic and thorough manner . In after life , when ill health prevented a severe application to books , he realized the benefit of his early selfdiscipline ; for the cursory perusal of a book excited his active and well-trained thoughts , and led him to reflections , which were far different from the dreams of desultory think-ers " From this period Mr. Stearns resided , most of the time , for several years , with his parents at Bedford . In the mean while , he was not idle . Retired , in a great measure , from the world , by strict attention to diet and exercise , and by occasional travelling excursions , he was able to give up his mind , with much constancy , to his favorite studies and musings . He projected a work on the Moral Nature of Man , to be comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conscience ; of the second , The History of Man as a Religious Being ; and of the third , the Doctrines and Economy of Revelation . The outlines of the first , after long and patient investigation , were sketched . The subjects of the other two parts were to be , it is presumed , among the principal topics of study in after life . " Such occupations as these , by their effect in making him contented in the places where Providence called him to labor or suffer , illustrate the beneficial tendency of systematic , intellectual pursuits to promote the permanency of the pastoral relation . The valuable works , in theology , of our distinguished divines , would not , and could not , we believe , have been ) produced , if the modern habits of change in the ministry had prevailed in their day . Mr. Stearns 's power , in his ministerial performances , consisted very much in the moral feelings which were prominent in almost every thing that he said or did . These gave an unction to his performances , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed // to act fully on the principle which we have illustrated in our remarks . Self-cultivation , intellectual and moral , was a prominent object of his life . The following resolution , amongst others , was written just before he left the Theological Seminary " Why should we be for ever undoing the work of life Why should we wish to be just like everybody else ? I will be myseig and make the best of it . God grant that I may grow better . " In this resolution is undoubtedly contained the secret of all true greatness in mind and character . It is the only principle upon which self-cultivation will result in original , independent power . All the great works in nature , and all those individuals of a family amongst her products which attract our notice , illustrate this principle . But the reason why so many educated minds have so little individuality , no doubt is , an extreme haste to enter upon professional life . Youth and inexperience catch at the nearest examples and helps . In after life , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is need , that teachers should , to a greater extent , be teachers of the individual , rather than of classes ; and that the pupil , who is past the season of youth , should have a sense of his separateness of character from other minds . We are glad to see , of late , instances in which provision has been made to instruct those who wish to delay their entrance upon the ministry . The result of it , we trust , will be more minds who will shine by their own light . There seldom has been a deceased friend , of whom we felt more restrained in speaking descriptively and critically , than of Mr. Stearns . There was such individuality of character about him , such a distinctness of feature in his mind , that we retain , to an unusual degree , an impression of his presence with us . What a strange liberty the grave yields us concerning its inmate ! Had a departed friend merely gone across the ocean , though entirely separated from the knowledge of him , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we believe him to be , though dead , as fully conscious and active as ever , and perhaps nearer to us than though an ocean were between us , we generally speak as freely of him as though he had ceased to exist . If we felt inclined to do this , on the present occasion , it would be unnecessary , on account of the excellent Memoir , to which // we have again called the attention of our readers . It is rendered still more valuable , by the addition of a letter from the Rev. Robert Baird of Paris , who saw much of Mr. Stearns while abroad , and particularly within a short time before his death . We dismiss our notice of the Memoir with strong impressions of the subject of it , as now engaged in pursuing that exalted standard of excellence which he formed on earth . We feel that , with all his generous love for others and admiration of their greatness , he still retains , in a peculiar degree , an individuality of character and of enjoyment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven.
