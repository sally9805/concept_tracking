txt ALTHOUGH it is , perhaps , not strictly within the ' province of a Review to pass judgment upon the merits of other works of a similar kind , we have been for some time past intending to recommend particularly to the notice and favor of our readers , the very valuable monthly journal , which is published in this city by Mr. Woodbridge , under the title of American Annals of Education and instruction . It would be superfluous to enlarge upon the importance of the subjects to which the work is devoted : that there is no question in the public mind upon that point , is sufficiently shown by the extraordinary efforts that are making in all quarters for improvement in education . It is equally apparent , that one or more journals , exclusively devoted to this subject , if properly conducted , must serve a most valuable purpose ; and are , in fact , almost indispensable auxiliaries to any system of vigorous , enlightened , and concentrated action . We find accordingly , that in Germany , where the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to practice than in any other part of the world , journals of this kind are very numerous . They are constantly published in all the ordinary forms of periodical literature , annual , quarterly , monthly , weekly , and even daily . They are also common in England , and most other parts of civilized Europe . The work before us is , we believe , the only one of the kind that is published in this country , and we regret to learn that the patronage which it has hitherto received is not , sufficient to justify its continuance . We sincerely hope , that efforts will immediately be made , with all the necessary vigor and spirit , by the friends of education throughout the country , for placing it upon a better footing . We consider it entitled , not less by the manner in which it is conducted , than by the nature of the subject , to the support and encouragement of all who are really interested in the cause . Few persons in the United States unite so many qualifications for carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could // employ them with a truer and more disinterested zeal for the object . After devoting several years to the husiness of practical education at home , and making himself known to the public by elementary works of acknowledged value and great popularity , Mr. Woodbridge travelled extensively in Europe , examined on the spot the most approved and celebrated institutions for education ; - became acquainted with their directors , and made himself familiar with the literature of the subject . On his return , he brought with him a large collection of the most valuable books and journals , that treat of it , mostly in the German language , and wholly unknown to the public , both here and in England . Provided with this rich stock of materials , and wishing to turn them to the best possible account for the good of the cause , he determined to publish them in a periodical form ; and became the proprietor and editor of the Journal of Education , which had just before been established in this city , and to which , in order to mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of American Annals of Education and Instruction . In this form the work has been continued for nearly three years ; and in the value and variety of its contents has fully realized the highest expectations that had been formed of it . We should regard its discontinuance as a serious public misfortune . Among the numerous articles of interest and value that have appeared in this journal , we would particularly refer our readers to a series of letters , in which the editor gives an account of the Institution of Fellenberg at Hofwyl , in Switzerland . Mr. Woodbridge passed several months at this place , and examined it with the attention due to its celebrity . Since his return , he has been in constant correspondence with Fellenberg . His account of the establishment is very complete ; and , if detached from the Annals , would form of itself a very valuable work . It is well known , that the leading feature of the Institution at Hofwyl is the combination of manual , and particularly agricultural labor , with study . The practicability and expediency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more objects of attention and inquiry in this country , and a satisfactory account of the Institution , which has been the great model of all others of the kind , is now wanted as a book of common reference . We know of none at all to be compared with this of Mr. Woodbridge . The series of letters , by the editor , upon the Infant School of // Geneva , is also of particular interest . In these , he distinctly points out , and illustrates by the practice of that Institution , the advantages that may really be made to result from such schools , as well as the serious dangers that attend them , if injudiciously conducted . The papers on the introduction of vocal music , as a branch of common education , are exceedingly curious and important . We are glad to learn that the labors of Mr. Woodbridge upon this subject have already produced very important practical results in this city , where we have now an academy of music , and several well-frequented musical schools . The articles on the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual development , and upon the advantages of bathing and swimming , may also be mentioned as worthy of particular notice . There is , in short , hardly a number of the work , which does not contain , in addition to a large mass of information on the common topics connected with the subject , one or more essays of a novel , curious and important character . We are aware that any journal of this kind must work itself gradually into the public favor : but we are still surprised , that the Annals have not yet obtained a larger share . We copy from the last number the following Notice to Subscribers , exhibiting the present state of the work ; and earnestly repeat our wish and hope , that the friends of education in this neighborhood and throughout the country will immediately make the exertion necessary to ensure its continuance . Repeated attempts have been made to establish a periodical on Education , but with little success . This work is the only one of a general character , which now exists in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , as the " Journal of Education , " it has never been profitable to the editor , nor to its early publishers , except as a medium of advertising . Its first editor was compelled to abandon it ; and for some time after , no one was found willing to assume its responsibilities permanently . The present editor returned , after several years spent in examining the state of education in Europe , charged by the friends of this cause abroad to make known the improvements which they had found so valuable . He believed it essential to the improvemeat of education among us , to have some periodical devoted to the investigation of our own wants , and the publication of our own plans and experiments , which should serve as the medium of communication among the friends of the cause , at home and abroad . // In order to secure a publication of this kind , so far as possible , from all influence , or suspicion of influence , he purchased the property of the " Journal , " and subsequently of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , at a very considerable expense . His great object was to place the work on such a basis , that it might assume a permanent and national character , and he did not take the charge of it himself until he had en deavored in vain to enlist others , in his view , more competent , by an offer of all its proceeds , and regular contributions . In order to make it known more extensively , to interest the friends of education , and to circulate the information he had received , about 500 volumes and 5,000 extra numbers have been sent out , without any payment , to public institutions , missionary schools , individuals engaged in education , and the editors of newspapers . The ardent interest expressed in the subject , throughout our country , the general approbation of the work itself and the gradual increase of subscriptions , seemed to justify him in proceeding , even without immediate returns ; and in publishing a larger number of copies than were immediately demanded . He believed it safe to assume that in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any European community , " and where the subject of education excites so much attention , at least 1,500 persons would be found anxious to obtain all the light of modern improvement on this important subject , and ready to sustain a publication devoted to it . Yet the event has proved , that less than nine hundred can be found to support a work , which , for three years , has received warm expressions of approbation from parents , and teachers , and the public press . Notwithstanding all the expenses incurred , he has never received a dollar from the publication , either as editor or proprietor . On the contrary , the accounts for the two first years show a large amount , in addition to all the receipts , still due for printing and paper , for which he is responsible . During three years , a large stock of materials , already pre* pared , and the aid of able contributors , enabled him to conduct the work without giving up other employments . The friends of education , he finds , are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the increased labors of editing , and especially the examination of books , now require so much of his time , as to allow little efficient effort of any other kind . The future proceeds , with the present number of subscribers , will afford no return for his labors , or those of contributors ; much less any means of paying past arrearages . Could the subscription be increased , it would indeed provide for the future , and for this only . Could the volumes now on hand be disposed of by // those inclined to favor the object , without deduction for the commission of agents , the sum now due could be paid . If this can not be effected , he can see no other alternative , but to abandon the work at the close of the present year , and resort to other means to provide for expenditures , which many believe have contributed to benefit the public , by the diffusion of valuanle information . He has come to this conclusion with great reluctance , and it will give him pain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose personal interest in the work has been fully expressed . He has not made known these circumstances earlier , because he had hoped to sustain its losses himself : but he feels more and more satisfied , that its permanency can not be insured , unless the friends of education will unite in supporting it , by subscriptions , and by contributing to its pages . Could each subscriber consider himself an agent for life , we believe this could be accomplished . If men of education will not sustain it , the ignorant certainly will not do it . It has no party character or popular attractions to recommend it . Nor can it furnish the mass of matter , merely copied by the printer from foreign works , or present the attractive engravings , which give such wide circulation to some of our periodicals . It depends for its existence , on that number , comparatively small , who know how to prize solid and useful information . If they refuse their aid , it must expire.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
