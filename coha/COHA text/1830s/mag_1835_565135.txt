txt SIR , - You have been pleased to assure mc that a passing sketch or two of Arkansas , its men and manners , would be admitted into your Magazine . If the hasty and imperfect fragments , which I shall from time to time send you , written in moments stolen from severe professional avocations , should merit a place in the New-England Magazine , I shall be gratified by affording your readers some information concerning a country , of which almost as little is known as of the interior of Mexico . If , as is equally probable , they should be deemed too uninteresting to find a place there , I shall be sufficiently rewarded if you yourself derive any pleasure from perusin0 them . My knowledge of Arkansas , and of the people of the West , has been derived from personal observation and actual residence among them . I know their peculiarities well . I am like one of them - an adopted son of the West ; and I love my brethren and their character . To New-England , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 look back with love and affection ; and could I be the means of making more fully known to your readers the character and virtues of the inhabitants ot the West , I should hold myself a fortunate man . It will be my object , in the few letters which I shall indite at odd seasons and scattered moments , to give you , in the first place , a general sketch of Arkansas . What order I may afterwards pursue , is entirely uncertain . I think , however , that I shall not weary of my task until I have given you a description of some of the principal curiosities , including courts of justice and distinguished men in Arkansas . The Territory of Arkansas , as every one knows , is bounded on the east by the river Mississippi , on the west by the Indian Territory , on the north by the State of Missouri , and on the south by Red River and a part of Louisiana . It is with the portion of the Territory lying on the river Arkansas , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this river should first engage our attention . It rises in the Rocky Mountains , about three hundred miles north of Santa Fe . I have crossed it and been on it in many places , but never within five hundred miles of its head . In the mountains , however , it is , like all other mountain streams , a clear , rapid river , and so continues until its color is changed in its passage through the prairie . I crossed it , in October , 1831 , at a considerable distance above the mouth of the Semaron , where it was a shallow and clear stream , with low prairie on one side and sand hills on the other *- about an eighth // of a mile wide . Farther down it receives the red and salt waters of the Semaron , and above Fort Gibson the waters of the Canadian , which come from unde the Rocky Mountains . In the Cherokee territory , it receives the waters of the Grand River , or . N*eosho , Illinois , and Salisan , and at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river is generally about a quarter of a mile wide ; and in fact , its width is not much increased from that point to its mouth . Above that place the river is shallow , and not often navigable by steamboats . Below Fort Smith , the river continues of about the same size and depth - . passing , in succession , through the counties of Crawford , Johnson and Pope , to Pulaski . Within the boundary of the Territory , that is to say , below Fort Smith , the Arkansas is a muddy , red and brackish stream - though much more so at one time than another , according to the stages of water , or the places where the rises come from . At low water it is the worst river of the West , except Red River , for snags and difficult navigation . To a perscn passing down the river , the country presents generally a uniform appearance , owing to the low bottoms which extehd in a continuous belt on each side of the river from Fort Smith to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juts out upon the river , immediately succeeded by the monotonous bottom . The bottoms , as they are called , being entirely alluvial , are generally from one to three miles in width on each side of the river - of a fine black and rich soil , producing excellent corn , and the best cotton in North America . The stranger who enters one of these bottoms for the first time , in spring or summer , is astonished and delighted . Imagine a New-Englander , familiar with the clear , silver-sanded , pebbly brooks and rivers of that country - the level , verdant , and heavy-swarded meadows through which they run , and the forests of pine , oak , maple and birch - imagine him entering a solid mass of greenness , a heavy and unstirred body of verdure . He enters , by some narrow path , into the depth of the bottom . The first idea that strikes him is , that he could have had no conception of such a depth and solidity of greenness . There is not a hand-breadth of barrenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are completely covered and laden with leaves to their very tops - and their trunks , twined round and garlanded with vines , appear like pillars of embodied greenness . The undergrowth of small trees and bushes is matted with vines and green briers ; and the ground is covered with grass and weeds , or perhaps with the never-failing greenness of the cane . Such is the character of a great proportion of the Arkansas bottom . The cottonwood - a tree similar to the poplar , but of gigantic size and immense height - is the most common tree in these bottoms . There is , besides , an abundance of ash , black , Spanish and yellow oak - all growing // luxuriantly - the branching mulberry , the tall and graceful persunmon , and the bumble but beautiful passaw , with multitudes of others unknown in your country . The dogwood , with its fine , close grain , and its multitudinous red blossoms ; the hackberry , similar to the beech , the honey and black locust , and that splendid evergreen , the holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds shine among the greenness like gems while on the river-bank , the tall sycamore stands , hoary with age , and its silver trunk outlasting many men 's lives . in some places , are impervious forests of cane , twenty feet high , as thick as they can be stuck . In others , are low , swampy places , where the water stagnates , and where there is little or no vegetation . Out of these bogs , or swamps , ' rise the protuberances , or knots , called knees , from which the straight trunk of the cypress ( a tree similar to the hemlock ) shoots up . This is a picture of the Arkansas bottom in summer . In the winter everything is reversed . The vegetation has passed away ; the leaves are massed and rotting below ; and the tall cottonwood sighs mournfully in the wind ; while the dark and sullen river rolls oii under them . Everything seems dark , filthy , and desolate , and high on the trees are the red marks of the great inundation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ; and the facilities offered a man for making a living and a fortune there , are nowhere equalled . A poor man comes here , whose necessities have driven him from the States . He has not a cent in the world - nothing but his axe and his rifle . He goes into the Arkansas bottom , cuts a few logs , and his neighbors help him raise a hut , with a wooden chimney , daubed with mud . If it is summer , he leaves the crannies open ; if it is winter , he chunks them with hits of wood , and daubs them with mud . He chops out a bole for a door , and another for a window ; splits and hews out some thick slabs , or , as we call them here , puncheons , for a floor ; hires himself out for a month or two , till he earns some corn and two or three hogs , and then turns in to work ' on his own farm . He cuts his hogs ' ears in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and goes resolutely to work , chop* ping timber , grubbing up cane , and performing the various operations necessary to clearing up land . Then you may hear a mile off , the continual musketry which the cane keeps up in burning , as the air contained in the joints expands and explodes . Having burned up the underbrush and the smaller trees , he girdles the larger ones - that is , cuts off a girdle of bark around them , for the purpose of deadening them ; breaks up his ground a little , and throws in his corn . In four or five years that man will raise twenty bales of cotton and a thousand bushels of corn , and be steadily enlarging his crop and increasing his income . // The Arkansas is a singularly winding river , during the whole of its course . The distance from the mouth to Dutch Rock - which is by land only one hundred and twenty-five miles - is by water about three hundred miles . On one side , the river is continually forming new land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ofl Father Tellus ; arid frequently , when a high overflow comes , the river breaks over the neck of a promontory , around which it has made a bend , and forms a new channel - while the old one becomes a lake . Thus , in 1833 , it broke across a point of bottom , about one hundred yards xvide at the place , through which new channel , steamboats now pass . The old channel , fifteen miles around the point , is filling up . And thns also , on the south side of the Arkansas , above the fort , are a long chain of lakes , in the former bed of the river . Below Fort Smith , the Arkansas receives the waters of . Mulberry , Frog Rayon , Horse Head , Spadra , Petit Jean , Point Remove , Cadron , and Palarme creeks . The three latter are deep , filthy and disgusting bodies of water , sluggish , and resembling the river Styx or the Dead Sea . The former are very pretty , clear running bodies of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It receives various creeks on its way downamong others , Fourche and BayQn Metre . Within twelve miles of the Mississippi , it separates into two channels - the northern called the Cut-off , while the latter preserves the name of Arkansas . The Cut-off is the most commonly-used channel . The bottoms on each are low , and the greenness extends to the water 's edge . Immediately after entering the Cut-off , you see a change in the water . Instead of the red color of the Arkansas , it assumes the chalky color of the Mississippi - is cooler and more pleasant . Within a mile or two of the lVlississippi , White River comes into the Cut-off , from the north . It rises in Missouri , and is called White River from the extreme clearness of its waters , before Big Black runs into it above its mouth . The junction of White River with the Cut-off , is a most singular sight . Here is a mass of red , or chalky water , there a mass of water which seems to be black-boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter was not water but oil . A little further on , and the waters mingle and discharge themselves into the great Mississippi . Two years ago , in the month of June , the crops were promising in Arkansas . There game a succession of heavy rains , and the river rose to high-wat*r mark . The rise was red , and salt , and evidently came from the desert prairie . The rains ceased , and the people supposed the rise was over . Suddenly the river began to swell higher and higher . The water came down colder and clearer . The snows had melted on the Rocky Mountains . Higher and higher it rose - fifteen feet , at Fort Smith , above high-water mark . The bottoms from Fort Smith to the mouth // were overflowed . The river was filled with fragments of houses , dead cattle , huge trees , rushing on to the Mississippi . Cattle , hogs , even deer and bear , unable to escape from the bottoms , were all drowned . Many people built rafts , and placing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lived out the inundation . The crops were ruined ; whole farms were filled up with sand ; and the channel of the river entirely altered . Such is the Arkansas . I entered the Territory of Arkansas at Fort Smith , which is situated on the Arkansas , on the Indian line . At that time there were no troops there , and the only appearance of a military post about it , were some few old buildings which had served as barracks . It is a place containing three or four stores and some half dozen houses ; and is very prettily situated on a huge bluff on the south side of the river . The county of Crawford , except on the river and creeks , is generally low land , thinly covered with oak timber ; and though a large county , it is but thinly settled . As the August election approached , there hegan a stir in the county on the subject of politics . Candidates were riding in every direction , electioneering ; and now and then a hot quarrel took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town of Van Buren , and the population thereof , in number about a dozen , had established themselves in booths at the foot of the hill heyond the town and there , where I rode in one day in June , I found a multitude assembled . Holla , stranger ! cried one tall fellow , in a hunting-shirt of leather , as I rode up ; Come , light - and take a little old rye , anyhow . ' That s the master , ' cried another ; dern my skin , if he ca n't speechify it better nor any of em . Master , if you 11 run for the Assembly , dern me if I do n't vote for ye . ' Twenty such greeted me , as I dismounted and made fast my horse . 1 soon discovered the object of the gathering . rfhere was a barrel set on end , with a board across it , and I at once divined that the rival candidates were to address the people . I inquired if the candidates for Congress were there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the county candidates , whom I saw busy among the people , shaking them by the hand , and making themselves boon companions . It was a perfect Babel . Hurra for Sinclair ! He s a horse . Who 11 drink Crittenden 's liquor ? Here goes for Sevi6r ! Good morning , Squire ; how s your family ? Come up and drink with an old acquaintance , who s a candidate . Bates forever ! the people 's candidate ! He s a horse in a cane-brake ! Go ahead , steamboat Brown s a roarer ! Five dollars on Martin ! Such were some of the cries which struck my ear . // Directly , Martin - one of the candidates for the House of Representatives , a warm Crittenden man , and afterwards electedmounted the barrel . I assure the reader that he may hear as much oratory in the West on a stump , as in the East in a Courthouse , or in old Faneuil itself . The impression of oddity soon wears off ; and I am inclined to believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more honest and open-handed than the silent canvassing in the East . Martin is a lawyer , who had quit brick-laying for brief-making and special pleading . He is a man of strong natural good sense , and a sarcastic and satirical humor , which tells well in a candi date . His speech was about half an hour long , and he was succeeded by Judge Bates , a man of great talent , a polished writer , full of classic lore , but no speaker . When he was on the bench in Arkansas , a lawyer - also formerl ) r a Judge , and of whom I may hereafter speak - named Hall , was in the habit of interlarding his speeches at the bar with frequent Latin quotations . In one cause , particularly , he was very profuse of his learning , so much so , that when Bates delivered the opinion of the Court , he did it off-hand in Latin . Hall listened , but only knowing a few quotations learned from law books , he was compelled , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require of the Judge to translate his opinion into English . Bates was succeeded by three other candidates , two of whom were farmers and the third a lawyer - the latter by far the weakest of all . I had expected a display of bombast and noise , and was agreeably surprised by good strong sense , keen satire , and almost an entire freedom from violence or affectation in all the speeches . 1 was still better pleased when I afterwards saw Crittenden and Sevidr  --  the rival candidates for Congressmeet on the stump . Robert Crittenden is since dead . He was a brother of John J. Crittenden , Senator from Kentucky , and is universally allowed to have been a more talented man than either of his brothers . I have listened to him frequently , since then , in various places , and I esteem him one of the most eloquent men I ever heard . His voice was full and rich , his language copious , strong and yet brilliant ; and he excelled equally in pathos and irony . His opponent , Colonel Sevi&amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any figure at the bar , and his only character in Congress has been that of an industrious and persevering man . He was evidently no match for Crittenden on the stump , and seemed to be well aware of it . I am extending this letter to an unwarrantable length , and with one tale of perilous adventure , by flood , if not by fire , I shall close . In the month of January , 1833 , there was an inundation of the Arkansas . I was living at that time opposite Fort Smith , and , // in company with my host , got into a pirogue , when the rise was at the highest , and took a trip , like fools , seven miles down the river , to the town of Van Buren aforesaid . After reaching that place , we began to consider - what we had not thought of before - how we were to get hack ; and the result of our joint cogitations was that , as it was impossible to get hack in the pirogue , we must return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it was over the upland ; but at the end of that distance , we arrived at the edge of the bottom , through which we had about three miles to go . It was overflowed in some places to the depth of ten feet . We looked down upon the cane - for it was full of that article - and held another consultation . On we pushed , however , and commenced floundering through the water , among the cane . It was generally about deep enough to immerse us to our necks ; and when the reader remembers that it was in January , he will doubtless be aware that it was not very pleasant . We had proceeded hut a little way , when my companion lost his reckoning , and became lost . He turned from home , and commenced wandering about in every direction , until I took the lead , as the oldest woodsman . After proceeding about a mile and a half , with great caution , we came at length to the bank of a little gully , about fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cane . Here we halted , and consulted how we should cross . I can not swim an inch , and nothing was left but to hunt for logs . We proceeded down the creek until we had found a small one , when I held one end until he straddled it , and coorted it over ; and he did me the same service at the other end . We kept onward . The ground became more elevated ; and just as we got out of the water , we found ourselves on the bank of what is called Garrison 's creek - a stream about sixty feet wide . At low water , the banks are twenty-five feet above water ; now , the water was level with them . We attempted to build a raft , but could only find one log , about twenty feet long , and two others about eight . We stripped some hickory bark and tied them together , and straddled the further end of them - but were no sooner on than the long one toppled over , the short ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; so we gave up that idea . I then took one of the short logs , put one end under my breast , and tried to cross in that way . It would n't do . Over and over went the log , and I got another bounteous ducking . By this time it was getting dark , and the air was growing keen and cold . Just then we heard an axe across the creek , and commenced hallooing , which soon brought a man down , splashing through the water , to the bank of the creek . I advised my companion to go over and hire the man to fell a tree , on which I could cross , and therefore he took to the water , with his breast on one end of the long log . He kicked away manfully , and when the end of // the log struck the shore , jumped off and swam for it . Having made his bargain with the stran * er , he went home , and the latter went again to his house and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime I was nearly frozen . There was only one place where I could move , and that was in a circle about six feet in diameter , round a tree . On one side there was a mars , with a fire flaring near him , chopping away at an oak tree four feet through ; and on the other I was pacing round my circle , which I wore as deep , hard and stnooth as a buffalo-path . At the expiration of ahout three hours , the tree came down , and barely reached the shore . The upper end was covered with water , and I had to get on it a - straddle , with the water up to my neck . However , I reached the shore in safety ; and though I suffered no inconvenience from sickness , in consequence of my adventure , I learned never to go down river again , in an overflow , without knowing how I was to get back . Yours , ALBERT PIKE.                @ @ @ @ @
