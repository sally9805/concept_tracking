txt WHAT is the true principle of conservatism ? or rather , what is the principle of conservatism in a true society ,  --  a society which has for its end , the welfare of its individual members , and the preservation of its unity among the nations ? We conceive this question has to do so intimately with the subject we have taken in hand , that we must devote some pages to answering it , before we proceed to consider the claims of the Fine Arts , as a branch of national education , first upon the State Governments as representing the people , and then on the thoughtful lovers of our country , taken individually . The spirit of the age is mechanical and utilitarian . We hear constantly of the application of science to the Arts . But it is to the useful arts ,  --  to the preservation and commodity of the mortal life . Whatever respects the spirit 's life mainly , is considered by us visionary and unreal . Beauty is hardly conceived to be a real end for a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like justice and holiness , it is a state of immortal being , discriminating man from beasts , and much more desirable , therefore , as an object of pursuit , than wealth ; which indeed is only valuable , as it is subsidiary and productive of those states of being which can be denominated beautiful , just , and holy . One would think from the language held in our lyceums and legislative halls , that the songs of Homer , the tragedies of A*schylus and Sophocles , the high reasonings of Plato , the institutions of Numa-who built a temple to the divinity enshrined in each rule of civil duty  --  the statues and and temples of all antiquity , were the play-things and card-houses of an infantile condition of the race ; and that we , we alone , were the adult . And why ? Because we make our own laws , and elect our own rulers , according to our personal interests . Because we daily discover new means of turning time into money ! The genius which in days of yore loved to ascend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final causes of human existence , and penetrating the material uses of nature for that truth and beauty which elevate and spiritualize our present being , and reconcile us to time , by proving it the transparent veil of an eternity whose central peace is realized by thought ,  --  this genius has found , it is said by some , worthier themes and fields of action , in the political relations of men , and the economical concerns of society . Time seems to have brought forth a new Jupiter , THE WEALTH OF NATIONS , who drives into Tartarus all his Titanic brotherhood . Again is Prometheus chained to the rock , and there is little reason to hope that // this new wiser Jupiter will how his heavens and come down to beauty 's feet , so that as of old a Hercules shall arise , to unbind the death-defying genius . The science of the wealth of nations has indeed its end ,  --  to destroy squalid want , and grant leisure to every individual to find out and unfold himself . But farther than this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the representative of bodily luxury it deceives , inasmuch as bodily luxury is an evil . And it deceives hardly less , by becoming the representative of intellectual luxury ; for all the statuary , and painting , and books it can buy , are utterly in vain to supply the place of the free eye and ear , and heart , which the pursuit of wealth destroys , but into which nature 's beauty always steals , when the physical system is neither enervated by indulgence nor overtasked by excessive labor . And let us not be misunderstood . We would state the dangers of our times , and evils which our government accidentally nourishes ; but we intend no doubt upon its legitimacy , nor a sigh after the despotisms and aristocracies of an old world that are passing away . We do not undervalue the political action of men , nor would we neglect the economical concerns of society . We are conscious of being only too strongly interested in these things ourselves . We have much ado to wait the reasonable time , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights may learn the duties involved in them . But it is only because our sympathies with them are so strong , that we have so little patience with their boyism , and their recklessness of consequences , their so continually exposing themselves to the wise shakes of the head , and not unmerited rebukes of those , who , by reason of their own sinking life , do not feel the resources of nature , and how youth may return from afar , provided it keep its faith and hope . It is our loving faith in the legitiinacy of our government , which quickens our eyes to all the dangers involved in an imperfect developement of its energies . We desire to see its conservative principles unfolded . We feel sure that it can cherish a diviner god than this modern Jupiter , whom it has nourished into existence as its first and meanest fruit . We would dethrone him therefore , by proving that he is the son of Time , and the phenomenal , and nurtured by the earthly ; and would restore to his throne Prometheus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , teaches him heavenly arts , and brings him fire in his musical reed . Unless this is done our free institutions must decay ; for nothing lasts except through the efficiency of its generating cause , and the passion for wealth was not the generating cause of our independence . On the contrary it would not have been gained , if wealth had not been felt to be quite a secondary matter . Witness the non-consumption , non-importation associations of those times ; witness the mercantile communities of Salem and Marblehead , // refusing to take advantage of the Boston Port bill , and magnanimously offering their ports to the merchants of the oppressed town , without charge of storage or wharfage . Not wealth , but the dignity of man , was ever present to our fathers , as the first object of the free institutions for which they were contending . The writers immediately preceding the Revolution were transcendental . They constantly went up beyond material and immediate interests , to principles . When they do speak of the advantages that will accrue to the trading interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to fall upon posterity . That principle of responsibility to posterity , one of the divinest of Heaven 's inspirations , is ever more present to them than personal interests . Hence the sublime moderation of the revolutionary assemblies . Who can read their record without feelings of grandeur which archangels might share ? What a contrast to the stormy assemblies of revolutionary France do their profound feelings of reverence , their slowly gathering hostility , present ! Could some Carlyle dramatize for us the American revolution , how different would be the work from the wondrous reprosentation of the French revolution , by which we have been astonished ? - as different as was the ancient celebration of the festivals of Apollo , from the Bacchic orgies . For so different are the events . Carlyle calls the French revolution " a fire creation . " The American revolution might then be called a creation from the world of waters , wliere all proceeded in order . The event so named was in no degree a destructive process ; in all essential particulars , it was a constructive one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise minds . It existed in the soul of the peol ) le , in the form of a devotion to the moral and intellectual welfare of the country , long before it wrote the Declaration of Independence , or elected Washington the commander-in-chief of its armies . In these wise minds , not less than in the argument from pure reason , is founded our trust in the legitimacy of our government . The former , indeed , might be set aside on the plea that men are not purely spirits of reason , but creatures of instinct too , and primarily . But when we recall those men , in whom pure reason seems to have been instinct ; who lived freedom before they declared it , or even apprehended it as an idea ; we feel that all that was revolutionary in their action was but the accidental accompaniment of the truly conservative principle of society . Republicanism is not to be judged by all that happens in a republican country . We do not ascribe the lynch law and mobs of our day to the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among those who have lost sight of its true principles , in pursuit of some of its nearest fruits ; but we look back on such men as the elder Quincy , who , with purest love of liberty burning in his breast , a fire that might not be quenched , and yet consumed nothing of his moral refinement , boldly came // forward in the path of duty , and defended the British soldiers for firing on the Boston mob . At that moment nothing seemed so important for the liberties of man , as to conciliate that very mob ; but Quincy acted on the principle , that just ends were to be sought only by just means . The value of political freedom in the eyes of our Fathers , was to give scope to the moral and intellectual dignity of the individual man . Freedom was in their eyes an end , like Beauty , Justice , Truth ; it was the proper state of being for humanity . And therefore was so little said or thought by them of the natural wealth which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the combination of a free community with an unimpeded internal industry . According to them , the highest object of civil institutions is to make free individuals ; and individuals are free only as they can cultivate their natures according to the ideal which each beholds impressed on his inward being . But in our republic , are there a majority of freemen , according to this Idea ? Alas , for human nature ! Even in the garden of Eden , where God walked and communed with man , as friend talks with friend , it would first try the experiment of plucking the fruit of the tree pleasant to the sight and good for food , instead of seeking diligently for the tree of life , which was growing unforbidden in the midst of the garden . And this tree of our life , the generating idea and conservative principle of our government , the inward freedom of the Individual , is neglected by us for the golden apples of wealth ! This is obvious from the tone of the debates in Congress , the newspapers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions are spoken of , mainly as instruments for the production of wealth , as if man was made for wealth , instead of wealth for man . The increase of property having become the end of the people , instead of Freedom , Beauty , and Moral Elevation , it becomes the end of the servants of the people . As the electors , so will the elected be . Where wealth is the first object of society , office is sought for its emoluments . The duties of the office then succumb to the interests of the officer ; impartiality and disinterestedness are lost . And is not this beginning to be seen ? Men are sent to Congress expressly to take care of commerce , to take care of manufactures , to take care of rail-roads , and canals , and banks ; but who are elected with express reference to the care of the fine arts , of colleges , of the moral and religious interests of the country ? Have we forgotten that scripture of Shakspeare , " There is a mystery in the soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chroniclers dare meddle with ? " // The opponents of Republicanism would convince us that a representation of these spiritual interests in Congress is virtually excluded by our Constitution , because not expressly provided for . Pointing to the lords spiritual in the British Constitution , to whom the institutions of learning and religion are a personal concern , they tell us , that although that country does not appear so free as ours , theoretically ; yet , inasmuch as a material interest gives a local habitation and a name to the spiritual interest , the elements of individual freedom are preserved in the institutions , literary and religious which are thus made independent . The children of light , they maintain must make interest with the mammon of unrighteousness , for the children of darkness are wiser in their generation . Even despotic Prussia , according to these reasoners , in providing means for the liberal culture of each of its subjects , in science , literature , and art , secures to them a personal freedom that is higher and purer than the freedom of a dernocratical community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no scope is given to any art or science not immediately applicable to the production of this sordid good . This is an important argument , and we should htve nothing to reply , did we believe that there could not be a more adequate representation of the spiritual interests of the country , than has been obtained yet . But the difficult.y has its root much more superficially than among the principles ofour Constitution . It results from our having fallen below the spirit in which the Constitution was conceived , by reason of our devotion to wealth . Going back to the time when our Government germinated , among the Pilbrim fathers for instance , we see that amid pinching want and every kind of hardship , a University was founded , and pro*ision made for a more general education than any other government did at that time afford to its people . And the Revolutionary fathers , as they are called , who are the only true Conservatives the world has ever seen , since they alone acted on principles which would constitute a perfect society , formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have anticipated the exclusive direction which the activity of the country has taken , when knowledge itself is pursued for its subserviency to a lesser good , and thus has lost its independent honors and higher relations . We may believe that they could not have conceived that the time should come , when a petition of their beloved University for a safe building for its library , the largest library in the country , and much of it- ( the American niche ) irreplaceable , would lie over from session to session of their own State legislature , ueglected ; and in prosperous times too . Still less , when the election of its very officers should begin to have respect to their character for business , rather than to their power of awakening and cherishin* genius . We may believe that if they could have // looked forward , to compare the Massachusetts Laws , published in 1823 , and the school law of 1828 , with the " Ancient Charters , and Colony , and Province Laws , " they would have asked , with grieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were richest and most prosperous , we should have sunk so far below what we were capable of , in the way of providing means of education , when we were poorest and feeblest . These things are relevant to our subject . It is the same spirit which builds colleges , and collects libraries , that patronizes the fine arts ; for it is a spirit growing out of reverence for the individual man . The fine arts were never playthings . They were never conceived in amusement , nor is their end amusement . They a rise out of the higher principles of our being , and they tend to expand and unfold them . They are to be cherished on the same grounds that any other means are taken to raise men above the brutes that perish . They can no more live without reflective culture , than can the moral princil ) les of our nature without the aid of religious rites and revelation . Our fathers , it seems , did not dwell upon the immediate consequences of our government , raising its millions , unrefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-estimation and self-direction , k by saying to each , the world is before you , go and take your share ; the race is to the swiftest , and the battle to the strongest . ' They did not think , perhaps , of the real danger of throwing open all the avenues leading to every species of natural power , to every individual of those millions , whose physical energy , in every other country xvhic h history knows , has been coerced by one , or a few , endowed by the faith of the multitude with divine right . But this oversight , if it was one , was it not their strength , rather than their weakness ? Is not the fact , that men , not merely so high-minded , but so deliberate , so moderate , did feel in themselves that which gave them this sublime confidence in the allegiance of freemen to intellectual and spiritual good , fraught with inspiration for us ? Why does it not kindle in us a spirit equally sublime ? Must it ever he only those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must the prosperous always be reckless and selfish ? It is in no doubt , then , respectin* the legitimacy of our republican government , that we speak of the dangers which threaten the highest interests of society in this country . We are ready to grant that it ir better , if such is the alternative , for millions of people to be moving towards the acquisition of such personal power and independence , as may be involved in the pursuit of wealth , than to be chained to a car , like beasts , for the purpose of dragging one or a few individuals towards the same low end . But we maintain that wealth is not the conservative principle of any state ,  --  by reason of its nature , and its necessary effects on the personal character of // those engaged in its pursuit . The conservative principle of all societies is one . It is that which unfolds the higher faculties of man over the lower ; which creates the repose of the physical without its enervation ; and the activity of the spiritual on objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of the pursuit of wealth as the highest good , or as the chief means of securing the highest good , on the moral and intellectual character of the individuals engaged in it ,  --  or to call history to witness the effects of this pursuit upon nations to whom it was a national object ,  - -  would alike involve a demonstration of our assertion . But this would take up more space than we can spare in this Article . Having indicated these two courses of thought , to our readers , and having referred them to Heeren 's Researches into the ancient history of Asia and Africa for data on the latter subject , we will proceed to seek for traces of the conservative principle , which may be found , contending with the elements of destruction , in all the nations of the past ; and which we would fain see in our country destroying the seeds of destruction that as yet lie near the surface . And we have hope of this ; for we remember that a new clement which antiquity did not know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which grows out of the ideas of holiness and love , symbolized in the Life of Jesus Christ . This Religion is nut , indeed , actually , what it is potentially ; what it was in its symbol . We believe it as a written creed , as an historical fact , but we do not realize it as a lire . If we did , ours would not be the mechanical age . If we did , the economical arts would not take the place of the culture of the soul . We should not place a knowledge of the political history of nations , or of the surfaces and mechanical powers of nature , above the analysis of the human being . We do indeed have the intellectual frame-work of a religion , as immeasurably beyond the religions of antiquity , as the Divine mind is beyond the human mind . And yet so little is this religion realized , that we dare to say the religious of antiquity were much more to the nations of antiquity , than the religion of Christ is to Christendom . They surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without dwelling upon the Oriental and African nations , whose halls of legislation , and civil judicature , and commercial negotiation , were the temples of the Gods-so magnificent in size aod beauty , and so truly built for everlasting , that moderns stand in awe before their ruins of three thousand years , and ask if men like themselves could ever have raised structures so sublime , even under the inspiration of the Infinitc , ** without dwelling on these nations , all whose refined polity and // gigantic power grew out of their religions , let us come down to free Rome , whose Cicero , in its most philosophic age , was a minister of the omens of birds ; or to still freer Greece , where there was no state priesthood , but whose lawgivers and statesmen provided for the perpetual reproduction of the religious sentiment , by all that could charm the eye , the ear , the taste for beauty . The stern Lycurgus , no less than the milder Solon , provided for a perpetual recitation to music of the songs of Homer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mind , was the patron of Phidias , the sculptor of gods , and the architect of temples . The acknowledged presence of the religious instinct , and its felt importance to the organization of society , is in nothing shown more clearly than in the anxious carefulness of the greatest minds of Greece and Rome , who , seeing through the symbols of their religions , and feeling all the disadvantages of the mistakes into which these led the unphilosophical , yet did not dare to give up the popular rites . Socrates ' dying command to Crito , to sacrilice a cock to Esculapius , has for us the profoundest touch of pathos . This was no concession of fear , for had it been morally possible for Socrates to have truckled to the powers of the day in his life , he surely had no motive to do so at his death . No , it was a tribute from his own heart to the heart of his own countrymen . Their very superstition was venerable in his eyes , who felt that an honest mistake on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrewdest conclusion of the understanding could place one that denied there was a Divinity , or neglected so venerable a truth . In this view , for which there is much more to be said , that we omit for want of room , it becomes a question of great interest what is the reason that Christianity , so much better adapted to our nature than the religions of antiquity , so much purer , and more elevating , is so ineffective in comparison . How is it , that when a religion of augurs and omens , of oracles and sacrifices to imaginary gods , was never , for a moment , neglected by the lawgivers and statesmen of antiquity , that the lawgivers and statesmen of our freest portion of Christendom made so little account of our religion , inquire so little into the divine will ? Why is it that the acknowledged oracle in our breasts , of the truth of whose responses there is an acknowledged standard in every library in the country , is never referred to in our deliberative assemblies and halls of legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business , on the exchange , in the corporation rooms of manufactories , on the wharves and docks , it would not appear even to exist ? Homer taught the Greeks that if a wall was built on th' seashore , without a sacrifice to Neptune , the waves would overwhelm it . The older Oriental prophet taught , and we have it in our own sacred book , that when the children of men devised to build a tower " to make themselves a name , " in despite , or careless , // of their God ,  --  the Lord came down and confounded their work . We may smile , and call these children 's stories . It were wiser on our part , to raise ourselves to the level of children 's innocence , and ask what principle , what everlasting truth , these voices convey out of the far antiquity ? We may find to our surprise that these children realized more truth in their partial revelations , than we in* our full one . For no matter what truth exists in the words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we live . Christianity is indeed the true religion , if we remember to define Christianity as the Life of Jesus Christ , and not the actual spirit of Christendom . We very much doubt , as we have said , whether this latter , since the days of Constantine , who gave so fatal a blow to Christianity , by stretching it politically beyond its vital extension , has ever risen to the fervor of piety ( we say nothing now of the purity and justness of the sentiments ) which , during their prosperous eras , always pervaded every heathen nation . While Christendom was a society of converts merely-that is to say , from the time of the apostles to the age of Constantine-it was , indeed , a living power , moving with all the energy of the divine in human nature over the chaos of exhausted religions , gathering to itself all their religious life , and consuming their dead bodies . But immediately on this fatal patronage , it began to be amalgamated in unnatural union with these dead bodies , and the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar of the human heart , fell back to the old heathenisms , that were , so to say , galvanised by the etherial element . History shows us that Christianity received no developement in human society worthy of the name of a developement of Christianity , during the ten centuries after Constantine. * It may be doubted whether the few truths that did get abroad , disconnected as they were from other truths which Jesus saw in the forefront of God 's throne , did not do more harm than good . The doctrines of the immortality of the affections , of future retribution , an unpardonable sin , the efficacy of the prayers of saints , the power delegated to man of binding and loosing for heaven as well as on earth , unexplained by the lofty metaphysical system a ad morality of Jesus , put into the hands of men a power of torture and oppression , as much more terrible than any held by antiquity , as spiritual dismay and anguish are more terrible than bodily fear and pain . But this Worship of the Dcvii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably defined , was an effective worship ; abhorrent as this religion is to human nature , it was present , in its day , to the minds of all people , as the more benignant religion which we intellectually acknowledge is not to ours . Hence arose the heroism of chivalry and the crusades which play // in those dark clouds of time , like the lightning in the thunder-storm , with a terrible beauty . Nor let us fail to mark the immediate effect of this lightning of heroism . No sooner is it manifested than song grows beautiful again . And beautiful song xvakes up architecture , and paintiug , and sculpture , and these reproduce each other , together with the spirit of research into th' long forgotten past ; and behold , a new era of the arts , a new beautiful civilization , which is , however , but an after-thought of the Grecian an ( l Roman civilization , baptized with the name of Christianity . But the part of Christianity which galvanized European heathenism , could not make immortal what was essentially dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew , succeeded the ineffectual protest against the Catholic Church , all over Europe . In England , indeed , that protest produced a temporary resurrection of the mind , and an inquiry into its divine relatrons , out of which came the literature and poetry of of the age of Elizabeth ; and , after a slight relapse , more apparent than real , the great Puritanical movement which gave birth to Milton 's Spiritual Epic , and planted the root of a christian nation on the shores of America . No*v , for the first time , was the political side of Christianity unfolded . It is a matter of amazement with what indifference the politicians of this ( lay allow to lie unconsulted the writings of that fruitful era , when the mighty tree of American civilization first germinated , far down in the virgin soil of a new world . In the papers of Sir Harry Vane , to speak o* but one of the great men of that period , whose name an ( l works are hardly known amongst us , is a mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a government as that of the United States ; an ( 1 it is all ( Irawn out with reference to giving to every individual , freedom from all masters but Christ ; and in reliance upon the truth , that the more men are freed from the temptation to power over others , the more will they become sharers of that power which keeps harmonious " the communion of the just . " But because political freedom has bearings so important on the material interests of man , those relations to his spiritual welfare , for which the Puritan heroes valued it , have become of least interest . Yet we owe all that is valuable in our American freedom to that root , planted with prayers and sacrifices of the purest devotion , and watered with tears and blood . The reminiscence of Puritanism was the most powerful element of that spirit which producel the Revolution . The American Revolution was , indeed , the flower of that unsightly root . The odor of the sanctity of the Puritan saints gave its sweetness to the fragrant breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no paper constitution , although it was manifested and declared thereby . It is a tree which grew up , in all its fair proportions , amidst a storm which would have torn up any superficial growth . It ex // isted in the souls of men , in the habits of the people , long before it showed itself in the high places of power . It was the ultimate fruit of the Christian seed , when it was at length planted in the wild soil of nature . There has been , then , a divine operation in the soul of our state also , which must be kept alive . We are no exception to the general rule . Here , as elsewhere , religion was the principle of generation , and must be cherished as the principle of conservation . But this brings us only to the threshold of our subject . The question now comes , how is our religion to be administered so as to answer this end ? Our forefathers made no especial 1 ) rovision for itinvolved it in no material interest-gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive , so incorporated with them , that they believed the best they could do for it was , by negative provisions , that should gu rd us froin the domination of sectarianism , ( religion cut up . ) They left time and thought to bring to light a fit symbol and true priesthood . From heathenism in times past bad been borrowed many an unfit symbol ; and dangerous had been all priesthoods proved , whose establishment depended on the caprice of men . Hence , perhaps , our came to the conclusion , that the crown of thorns was the only symbol , and the Sorrowing the only priesthood , and these they had good reason , from the experience of the past , to believe that God would always provide . And forever sacred be that symbol and that priesthood ! But it is obvious , since Christianity has the promise of the life that now is , as well as of that which is to come , that sorrow is not the only means of spiritualization . If the Redeemer died in the agony of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arid the earth quaked with horror , yet he did also return to his own , with countenance like lightning , and garments . white as snow , and while the earth trembled with joy , rolled the stone away from the mouth of the sepulchre , and sat upon it in triumph , saying to his disciples , Peace be unto you , ' - ' the son of man shall come in clouds of glory , with all his holy angels - mystic words , which mean , do they not , that humanity shil be glorified even to the divinity from which it has fallen ? Spiritualization , then , in joy and gladness , is to be sought for ; and when we consider on the one band , this genius of the religion , which may be defined as the refinion of the human spirit that has fallen into matter an ( l circumstance with God , its cause and sustainer ; and , on the other , that the beautiful world around us , At T*rne 's roaring loom doth always ply MTeaving for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly led to the means of spiritualization that may yet be wieldedbyourgoVerflmeat , nOt only without encroaching upon our // Constitution , but in furtherance of its spirit . And this brings us back to the subject with which we began our remarks ; - that is to say , the Claims of the Beautiful Arts upon the attention of the Government . There is an eternal alliance between the Fine Arts and Religion , for beauty is one aspect of truth . The sentiments of good and beauty are aspects of truth respectively to the conscience and imagination : an ( l are twinborn in the spirit of mnn . These sentiments are best preserved in union with each other , because the nature was intended for a harmonious development . In youth , when imagination is alive and salient , religion may be brought to bear on the energies of the soul , and become its life ; and thus form the life of the nation . Now if imagination is the minister of beauty , instead of being the minister of terror , and unreal objects , the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural priesthood of the race . No less than the Sorrowing , are they chosen and appointed by God , and beyond the reach of corruption , for their certificate is divine and they bring it in their hands . Their power comes by what they produce from inward inspiration , and can be increased in no degree by any artifice . Their honors are personal and intransmissible , and therefore not liable to hereditary abuse . They are perpetual symbols of the Divine in human nature , and as such should be acknowledged . And is it an extravagant demand that this acknowledgment should take the form of " maintaining them at the Prytaneum ? " It is no more than has been beforehand paid for , and with interest , by those whose works , by breaking the power of wealth over the imaginations of men , shall preserve the spirit that created the Constitution . It has been already remarked that wealth derives its charm primarily from being supposed the only and inevitable means of luxury ; if leisure , and opportunity for the production of works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefor ; if every Corregio among us can feel that I , too , am a painter , ' and every Claude hidden among the pastrycooks , can learn that painters ' colors are their elements of power , so many of those who at present pursue wealth , will be cut off from the career ,  --  for they will find their luxury in the narrow bounds of the painter 's studio . And if fine works of art are scattered every where , not only more artists will find out their genius , but multitudes , not in the high rank of creators , yet who are now uneasily pursuing they know not what , will find the true enjoyment of their natures , as men of taste , no longer stimulated to labor beyond the healthy point . Thus , enjoyment being at hand , the fever of the times may in some degree abate , and population cluster round the seats of art , bringing society to perfection there , ceasing to spread over into the wilderness faster than the means of culture can follow . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is thus refined . Among the least of these , the care of the beautiful buildings and their treasures is an employment calculated to make happy persons adapted to such quiet occupation . Nor will society in its very economical interests flourish less than at present . From this thickening of population new demands will be made on the agricultural and mercantile classes , and all kinds of mind will thus have their element , in which to work happily and successfully . It can not be but that in this ease the new era of art , already begun by Christianity , will unfold a glory in some relation with the superiority of our religion to all others , and commensurate with the theoretical perfection of the government in which it is to preserve life . We might indeed be satisfied and grateful if nothing more were obtained than the reproduction of such eras as came and passed away with the short-lived civil freedom , and the evanescent religious life , of the nations of antiquity ; but we can not limit our imaginations to this . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services that artists render a government ; it is an indispensable condition of these services being rendered . The care of worldly concerns is utterly incompatible with the life of an artist . Those early days , when impressions are most easily received , and imagination takes its character , should not be lost to his education . " Genius of any kind , or in any age , " says the eloquent author of the Introduction to the Study of the Classic Poets , " is a being of an extremely tender and susceptible nature ; its thought , temper , and dimensions , depend much on external accident ; it may be stifled in its birth , enervated in its nonage , or curtailed of its fair proportion by defect of education ; it has no irresistible tendency towards maturity ; it has no indefeasible claim upon immortality . Whether itself shall be consummate , or its creations everlasting , rests upon other causes besides the power of its own physical essence . It is not merely a tree , the fruits of which may be sweet r or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also not unfrequently a flower , which dies or blooms , as it is visited with a blight , or fostered by the dews and gales of Heaven . " The biography of men of genius sadly confirms this view . How large is the proportion of those whose maturity did not answer the promise of their first unfolding , notwithstanding the success which they ( lid attain . How large a proportion have died in the meridian of life , worn out with their fierce conflict with circumstances A maintenmc ' . then , should be provided for the sons of genius , who are themselves devoted to their art . It should be liberal , but a true artist will prefer a simple life . Upholstery and other expensive caprices of fashion are far below the beauty that his eye makes , whenever it falls on the face of nature , that can never be // shut out from the hearts that love and seek her , and that is sufficient for them in the way of luxury : Beauty  --  a living presence of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delicate spirits hath composed , From earth 's materials-waits upon his steps Pitches her tents before him as he moves , An hourly neighhour . But he should not b* condemned to a life of celibacy who needs , more than others the ministrations of wife anti family , and all the comforts of home . Nor should he be condemned to toil first for the commodity of life , to whom appears that " relation of the forms of nature to mind , " which " is not fancied by some poet but stands in the will of God . " For he is to be employed in making it known to other men less gifted . Many can receive and enjoy what a few only can see originally or create . But we are not pleading entirely or chiefly for the sake of the gifted individuals of whom we speak . It is the country which sustains the greatest loss when genius dies discouraged and silent . Nothing is so desirable for a country as luxuriance of genius . Had circumstance prevented Raphael and Klichael Angelo from giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a personal suffering to themselves for a few years . It might have postponed to the other side of the grave some of their glorious self-consciousness . But the human race would have lost more than they . They could not have been altogether dep*-ived of their personal enjoyment of the vision and the faculty divine , but would the human mind have suffered less loss that it suffered ignorantly ? It is common to say that areat genius will find its way out . This can never be proved . *e know only such genius as does find its way out . And we so often see it scathed by the storms through which it has won its way , that we may reasonably doubt whether it is not often entirely silenced . Every man of genius must be known as strangely powerful in his own circle . But we believe with Gray that many a mute , inglorious , Milton has reposed , unknown to fame , in the country church-yard . Any one who reads carefully Dunlop 's Lives of the Artists , will see proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of his heavenly priests of beauty . But almost every page of these Lives is a heart-touching appeal to our governments for their paternal protection . There is no want of the spirit of disinterestedness and self-sacrifice on the part of artists . Every one must feel that under such circumstances as are related in this book , every production was but a feeble indication of xvhat might have been dnn* under better auspices . With respect to the greatest artist the // country has produced , it is a fact worth observing , that he was born with a patrimony which he could sell and apply to the purposes of his education . He did so , and went to Europe , and having studied with Sir Joshua Reynolds , proceeded to Italy , and spent years in study there . As long as this patrimony lasted , the glory and joy of successful genius was his . lie once told a friend that until he was obliged to spin his brain for bread he never felt any fluctuation in his powers , but could always at will return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glory of this genius , it is true , has not become dim , for it leans upon a philosophy which looks down on circumstance , that unspiritual god and miscreator . ' But the joy and gladness of independent exertion is in some degree shadowed . And is it not mournful that he should have come home to his own country , away from the great patronage of England , because his love for it was so strong that it worked in him the wish to adorn it with the genius so highly commended abroad , and that the country allows him to be depressed by want , and to turn away his mind from greater works to smaller ones , because only thus can he earn his bread ? In all the numerous institutions which our liberal means of public education throughout the States have endowed , is there not one which mi*ht afford to the greatest Painter in America , if not the greatest in the world , an endowment *i h would put him beyond the fear of want ? Suppose a provision of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to practice by some of the more influential States , would not the brilliant eloquence of Carolina burst forth in favor of such protection of the art of her native-born son ; and would not his adopted Massachusetts with her deliberate reason sustain the claim ? If our legislatures had no such powers , we might heave a sigh for the departed glories of Kings and Popes , who called forth genius to adorn their palaces . Better that it should be patronized and delight the eyes and cultivate the minds of a few than of none . The difference , however , ought to be that in a democratical country these treasures are more widely diffused , and therefore not less but more in number . They should be placed , as in Athens , upon a hill , to answer an ( l call upon the universal mind . The caprices of individual patronage have been the torment of genius in all aristocratical governments . The patronage of a great people , made through enlibhtened representatives of its love of art , might be adequate to cherish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental duty , ( if it may not more properly be called a filial duty which our governments owe to their conservative principle ) is to throw open a free academy to young artists , and since this can not be immediately furnished with the works of the great masters , we should provide a fund for sending the most remarkable pupils abroad . // Another mode of contributing to the same end would be to offer prizes for statues and pictures , which when purchased , might adorn the rooms of public edifices , to educate the taste of those who could not afford to own them , and serve the still farther end of being accessible models for young artists , who need to learn the details of execution , by copying what is excellent . Occasionally , . master pieces from Europe would be added to these collections . Public spirited individuals , as the great importance of this subject unfolded upon the mind of the nation , would find their delight and honor in adorning our public places with the proofs of their own appreciation of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby . We have said nothing of architecture , because this is more obviously a national concern , and , comparatively , has not been neglected by us . It may be worth while , however , to remark in passing , that the prodigious monuments of this art of which Heeren 's Researches have given us an account , were not the production of one generation of men , but works which it took centuries to complete . Perhaps it is our greatest fault , with respect to architecture , that we attempt too much at once . Being in a hurry to complete our building , we necessarily lay it out on a small scale . But is there not something sublime in that trust in posterity which lays out a work the unborn must complete ? This call from the past ,  --  has it not relations with a sei*se of responsibility to the future-tending to deepen the sentiment which binds the geuerations together ; and give a sort of sensible immortality to the sentiment of patriotism ? We have left ourselves no space to speak at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But perhaps we have implied the chief arguments we should use . Wealth is not beauty or enjoyment . For these the richest are pensioners upon genius . They should cherish genius accordingly , with liberality of hand , and reverence of heart ; not as an object of charity , but ( we would be taken with due limitation ) as an object of homage . Thus may they rise into its atmosphere ; and give their material wealth a value which intrinsically it does not possess.
