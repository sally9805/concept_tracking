txt LITERATURE has been declared by a celebrated female writer to be an expression of the state of society : by which is meant , that its various forms are determined , in a gre at measure , by the political and social condition of the nations , in which they are exhibited . This remark is confirmed in most respects by the literary history of modern Europe , and is particularly verified by the fact of the subdivision of European literature into several distinct branches , corresponding with the political sections into which the common continent was cut up after the fall of the Roman Empire . As the continent of Europe , politically viewed , presents the appearance of a number of nations of kindred origin , and of manners substantially similar , but nevertheless marked by formal differences of considerable importance ,  --  nominally independent , hut really , though loosely combined together by their constant intercourse and the various moral ties and relations , that necessarily result from it , - so the literature of this part of the world , while it all springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of its development and progress several distinct and independent branches , whose forms are now so various , that each requires a separate course of study . The immediate cause of this division was the variety of languages , which // naturally grew up in different parts of Europe , in consequence of their political separation , their little intercourse with each other , and the general rudeness of the period , during which these languages were formed . Other causes , of a less direct and powerful character , also operated in a greater or less degree in producing this effect ; such as the difference that existed among these nations in regard to geographical situation ,  - -  political institutions ,  --  economical pursuits ,  --  and , ultimately , religious forms and principles . All these circumstances operate , to a certain extent , thougW indirectly , in encouraging or depressing the growth of learning , and in modifying the form which it assumes ; while learning , in turn , exercises a strong reaction on the state of society . The principles that regulate this connexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among the most interesting subjects of general inquiry , and have not yet been settled in a satisfactory way . The question has been considered , hut not exhausted by Madame de St*el , in her work on the Influence of Literature . In fact , the highest and most general problem connected with it , viz : whether learning and the arts flourish better under liberal or despotic governments , does not seem to be viewed by the best judges as entirely free from doubt . While the splendid example of Greek refinement favors the opinion , that liberty is the proper nurse of genius and taste , as well as happiness and virtue , some other brilliant periods in the history of wit and learning coincide with the existence of absolute , and even niilitary monarchies . It is not , however , our present object , to enter at large into this inquiry , nor to examine particularly the causes which have created this variation bbtween the several branches of the modern literature of Europe . Each of these topics would furnish the matter of a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , to state very briefly the manner and succession in which these branches respectively shot from the parent stock . I. From the period of the invasion of the Roman Empire by the barbarians up to about the time of the first crusade , there was no such thing , in any part of Europe , as a modern literature . The learning of the period , such as it was , was wholly in the hands of the monks and clergy , and was recorded and communicated exclusively in Latin . Greek was unknown ; the vernacular languages were despised as barbarous // by the clergy , and , in fact , can hardly be said to have then existed . These were gradually forming out of a slow and forced amalgamation between the original Celtic of the west of Europe ,  --  the Latin of the Roman conquerors ,  --  and the various Teutonic tongues of the last invaders ; all dialects of kindred origin , and fitted of course to co*ilesce in the end , as they have done ,  --  into compact , and tolerably homogeneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutually unintelligjhle . They were not then used for the ovdiua*y despatch of important business . The laws were published , and the religious ceremonies conducted in Latin . The very few attempts at literary composition , made at this time , were mostly in the same language , which also continued for several centuries to be the most usual instrument of communication , verbal and written , among the learned . Hence arose very naturally , and even necessarily , the practice of making this language the basis of literary and professional education ; which has been kept up by habit , like many other practices , long after the state of things that rendered it necessary ceased , and is often defended on account of some fantastic and imaginary advantages , which are supposed to result from it , but which had no connexion with its first introduction . The earliest appearance of any thing like a regular modern language and literature , was exhibited in the south of France , and the neighboring parts of Spain and Italy , about the time of the crusades . The P*oven9al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole south of Europe . It was cultivated with enthusiasm for two or three centuries , and produced many poets of high reputation in their day , and probably not inferior in genius to their modern successors . During the flourishing period of this school , polite literature was , in fact , a sort of passion amon0 the higher orders of society , and was more in honor with them than it has perhaps ever been under any other circumstances profess and practise what they called the gay science ; and carrying into their amusements the forms and terms to which they were accustomed in their more serious occupations , they instituted their courts of love ,  --  enacted their codes of laws for the better regulation of courtship and matrimony ,  --  and conducted the trials of the heart , like those of the person and property , by judicial process , before a jury impannelled and // 161 sworn in proper form . The lion-hearted Richard , King of England , was distinguished in his day as a minstrel . Ren6 , titular King of Jerusalem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry the Sixth , was illustrious for his patronage of poetry , and for the care with which he superintended the proceedings of these tribunals of the tender passion . He appears to have been the Justinian of this strange code . The Floral games , which were instituted about this time at Toulouse , by Clemence d'Isaure , and have been held there ever since , formed a regular annual festival , somewhat analogous to the periodical religious celebrations of ancient Greece . A similar institution existed at Tolosa in Spain . Catalonia produced , even as lately as the thirteenth century , many ProVen9al bards of high celebrity , and this school of language and literature had even sent off colonies into the south of the Peninsula . There was therefore at that time reason to expect , that it would continue to be cultivated , until its productions should assume a finished and classical form . This result , however , did not happen , although it is now somewhat difficult to assign the precise reason which prevented it . It is true , that the singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form so prominent a feature in the literary pursuits of that day , argue hut slightly in favor of the general intelligence of the period . The understanding of Europe seems to have been , as it were , in a childish state . But as all the great and wealthy encouraged literature with extraordinary zeal , it might naturally have been anticipated , that it would in time have ripened into something truly rich and vuluahie . Political circumstances probably turned the scale against the masters of the joyous knowledge . The northern provinces of Gaul gradually acquired the ascendency over those of the south , or Langue d'oc , and brought in with them their own Langue d'oui , which was afterwards matured into the modern French language. * Castile and Leon absorbed the kingdom of Aragon , and established their own magnificent dialect on the ruins of the Catalonian , while the more rapid progress of civilization in Italy led to the formation and early cultivation of a purer tongue , which prevented the Troubadours from pushing their conquests in that direc. * Ge and Gui were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southern and northern provinces of France . They seem at one time to have been employed as distinctive names for the dialects of those provinces , and even , in the case of Languedob , for the country itself . // tion . Thus their territory was gradually encroached upon in one way or another , on all sides , until it was finally reduced to nothing . The Proven9al dialect went out of use before it had attained a pure and settled shape , and before it had served as a vehicle of thought and passion to any one of those leading minds , which stamp durability upon the language they employ . The light-hearted race of Troubadour* became extinct , without producing a single powerful writer , and of all the lays that once resounded so merrily through the sunny fields that are watered by the Rhone , the Garonne and the Ebro , and were echoed by the Alps and the Pyrenees , nothing now remains but the name . The courts of love were closed . Society assumed a more sober and business-like aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs and sports , which had given them before so much pleasure . Not long after came on the Reformation , and brought in its train a century and a half of mysterious metaphysics , and uninterrupted war . Science was now any thing but gay ; and this unhappy generation , which seems to have been driven on by a sort of demoniacal frenzy to pour out torrents of tears and ink and blood , in quarrels about points which they did not even pretend to understand ,  --  notwithstanding their imagined superiority ,  --  must have looked , we should think , with some regret and envy upon the happier lot of their simple and joyous forefathers . In the mean time , the Proven9al literature became entirely extinct , and is now only known as a branch of antiquarian study . Thus ended the first attempt at the formation of a cultivated language in modern Europe . IL . The next was made in Italy , with a success not less signal , than the failure of the former . The beautiful , or as Dante calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern and simple majesty of the Latin , had been silently maturing , and , as early as the thirteenth century , while the Provenal poets were still lisping their childish and ephemeral lays , was seized upon and fixed by . three manly minds , which appeared about the same time in the north of Italy . It is hardly necessary to add the names of Petrarch , Dante and Boccaccio ; who may well be considered , especially the two former , as the great fathers of all modern literature . Petrarch and Dante were doubtless two of the loftiest and finest spirits , that ever descended upon this our visible diurnal sphere . They divided between them the empire of poetry ; the disposition of Petrarch being particularly sensible to kind emo // tions , and the beautiful forms which naturally correspond with them , while Dante dwells , in preference , in the regions of sublimity , and loves to experience and excite the deeper feelings of fear and wonder . The respective events of their lives may have had some effect in determining the tone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest intellectual endowments almost every accidental advantage , was an object of general respect and esteem , throughout the civilized world of his time . His undoubted mental superiority elevated him to a familiar intercourse with the highest social circles , and made him the associate of the nobles and sovereigns of the day ; while the gracefulness and beauty of his person , and the elegance of his manners , rendered him a universal favorite in all the companies where his talents introduced him . He was doomed , it is true , to suffer the pangs of an unrequited passion ,  --  if indeed his Laura were a real personage , which seems to he still douhtful ,  --  and sorrows of this description are certainly entitled to their full share of compassion . But when we read the sweet though melancholy strains , with which he was accustomed to complain of the cruelty of his mistress , in the cool shades of his favorite retreat at Vaucluse , and see him coining out of these delightful gardens , to appear at Rome , and receive a laurel crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to suppose that the trials of the heart , to which he was subjected , very much diminished his actual enjoyment of life . Dante , on the other hand ,  --  - naturally , perhaps , a darker spirit ,  --  - fell on evil times . His native city was distracted with parties , contending in bloody struggles to determine which of two foreign interests should obtain the ascendency . The private happiness of this great poet was sacrificed to these contentions . He was banished from Florence , and lived and died away from home . Thus his great work was matured in exile and misfortune . Hence it naturally assumed a severe and gloomy character . The vision of Beauty. , which filled his soul , and which he has personified under the name of Beatrice , instead of inspiring him , like the Laura of his famous contemporary , with passionate emotions ,  --  finds him in a thick and shady forest , and conducts him to the infernal regions , where he meets the greater part of his political enemies , condemned to various forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern satisfaction from taking this poetical revenge upon the opposite party ,  --  he pursues his imaginary course into the // happier abodes of the other world , and consoles himself , in his present wretchedness , by dwelling in fancy on the joys of Paradise . In the midst of his distress , he appears , however , to derive a secret compensation from the consciousness of the beautiful language , in which he is able to express it . It was from Virgil , ' he observes , that I learned the fine style that does me so much honor . ' His sublimity relaxes at times into tenderness , but even love with him is mixed up with images of pain and horror , and we recoil from the vision of Francesca da Rimini , with almost as strong an instinct , as from the tower of Ugolino . Petrarch , on the other hand , never deviates into painful reflections , nor clouds his pictures with any other shades , than the delicate and tender distresses of his hopeless affection . And love , with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . so wholly clear of all mixture of sensual and corrupt ideas ,  --  that it rises almost into moral sublimity , and seems like a sweet and gentle breathing of the spirit of harmony , that informs and moves the universe . The third member of this illustrious trio ,  --  who can hardly , however , be placed upon a level with the others ,  --  possessed a genius more akin to the gay and sportive humor of the Proven9a ! poetry . The Tales in the Decameron , upon which his reputation is founded , are mostly of a comic cast ; and the motives to mirth are not in every case as pure as the language in which they are described . The Italian language has never departed from the standard fixed by these great authorities . Whenever any tendency to vary from its rules has been exhibited , there has always been found , soon after , some powerful genius , who has returned , by the native effort of kindred taste and talent , to these original wells of undefiled learning , and recommended them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within our day , the great dramatic poet Alfieri , passing over the whole intermediate train of his predecessors in the art , and forming his style on the antique model of Dante . The perfect success of the attempt , and the great popularity of his tragedies among his countrymen , are strong proofs that the national taste in Italy is still uncorrupted , and as pure as ever . It is , in fact , a remarkable thing , that in Italy , poetry , instead of declining very rapidly ,  --  as it did in Greece and Rome , and has done in some parts of modern Europe , almost immediately after it reached the point of classical perfection ,  --  has been maintained for five or six centuries , and up to the present day , at the same // height of excellence . Not long after the decease of the three great inventors whom we have just characterized , appeared the brilliant group that adorned the period of Leo the Tenth , and comprehended such names as Ariosto , Tasso , Machiavel , Michael-Angelo and Raphael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , to which in one of its expressions we give the name of poetry , animates the equally delightful creations of the chisel and the canvass , so that the perfection of the latter proves its activity as much as that of the former . It has been evinced in like manner during the last and present century , by the charming strains of Paesiello , Cimarosa and Rossini , the various dramatic excellence of Alfieri , Metastasio and Goldoni , and finally the matchless offspring of the graceful genius of Canova . This continual display of first rate talent in poetry and art , throu 0h a long course of centuries , is the more remarkable , inasmuch as Italy has been regularly falling in political importance , comparative and positive , during the whole period . It seems to be the destiny of this favored , though in some respects nnfortunate region , to rule , at all times , in one way or another , over the minds of men . But we may safely conclude that even the political condition of a country , which still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that is capable of justly estimating their value , is not wholly desperate . The Italian school of literature , as it was the first in order , is also perhaps the first in value of all that have appeared in modern Europe . If indeed we consider the other fine arts as belonging to the same family with poetry , ( which is really the case , ) the question is no longer doubtful , since in architecture , sculpture , painting and music , Italy stands without a rival . In poetry the superiority is somewhat less certain , altliough it would be difficult to produce any other modern school , in which transcendent genius is so well allied to fine taste , or in which the products have been supplied in such astonishing abundance . It is only in those branches of polite literature , which border on the region of practical science , such as eloquence , history and moral philosophy , that England , France and Germany may with some show of reason pretend to dis pute the palm . Even here , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose the pretension . But whatever may be the other merits of the Italian school of art and learning , ( which it is not our present object to exaniine in detail ) it possesses , at any rate , the singular and undisputed glory of // having preceded all the others ,  --  furnished them with models and rules to work by , and encouraged them , by examples of brilliant success , to enter into similar pursuits . III . We find , accordingly , that the next development of taste and talent took place in a part of Europe , where the influence of Italy might have been expected to be the greatest . At the same period , when the learning and art of Italy had reached their highest point of perfection , in the golden days of Leo the Tenth , Spain ) which then comprehended the whole Peninsula , was flourishing in all her glory , as the leading power of the European Commonxvealth . Her dominion extended over a great part of Italy , and the intercourse between the two countries was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who travelled from Spain into Italy , were naturally struck with admiration at the state in which they found the arts , and carried back with them some degree of knowledge and taste . In this way , the attention of their countrymen was directed to these pursuits ; and to this circumstance we may probably attribute immediately the formation of the Spanish school of poetry and painting . It grew up with great rapidity , and declined as fast ; but during the short period of its splendor , was one of the most vigorous , rich and original creations , in which the intellect of modern Europe has ever put forth its strength . Spain , at that time , held the reins of art and learning as well as policy and war , and while the kingdom of France was distracted by the intrigues of Philip , and almost subdued by his arms , the great Corneille and Moliere were seeking at Madrid for the models which they first copied , and then improved upon , until they finally formed a new , and in some respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation for the literary school of their own country . At the same time , the kindred art of painting rose at once , as if by a sudden effort , in all parts of the Spanish dominions , to an astonishing degree of perfection . This circumstance is another strong indication of the quarter from which the genius of the country derived its inspiration . Three different schools , the Spanish , the Flemish , and the Dutch , sprung up almost simultaneously in the different parts of the vast empire of Charles V. , and his immediate successors ,  --  being , with that of italy , the only ones of any merit that have ever appeared in Europe . The names of Murillo and Velasquez , of Rubens and Vandyck , of Rembrandt and Teniers , stand upon the // same line with those of Raphael and Titian , and only differ from them as one star differs from another in glory . Such was the luxuriance with which genius poured forth his rich gifts in Castile and her dependent provinces , during the short period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only copious and brilliant , but , as was intimated above , in a very eminent degree orio*inal . Although roused into life by the inspiring example of Italy , it was far from presenting a simple imitation of Italian models . Its great development took place , in fact , in a department which was least cultivated by the Italians , and was indeed at that time almost wholly deficient among them ,  --  we mean the drama . In this attractive branch of the art , the Spanish genius chiefly displayed itself , and could it have united with its wonderful power a somewhat higher perfection of taste , might have thrown into shade every other example of dramatic literature that the world has seen , excepting always the Greek masters , and the unique talent of Shakspeare . Besides several dramatic poets , who flourished at this time and place , and who fall but little below the standard of first-rate excellence , such as Tirso de Molina , Moreto , and others , the Spanish school then possessed , in Lope de Vega and Calderon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight above all standards , and form , with some half a dozen others of the same kind , that have appeared within the memory of man , a little class of their own , distinct from all other classes . The prodigality , with which these illustrious masters poured out their productions , was still more astonishing than their excellence ; hut we now see , and must acknowledge with regret , that this circumstance greatly diminished their separate value . Tragedies and comedies , by scores and hundreds ,  --  epics by the dozen , were easy labor to the boundless fertility of Lope , whose dramatic pieces alone are reckoned by thousands . The enthusiasm of his contemporaries , which was thus kept alive , and constantly fired anew by fresh efforts , all displaying the highest talent , though all in a greater or less degree iml ) erfect , could hardly find terms to express itself , and finally consecrated his name as the appropriate designation for every thing rare and precious . We now see , with some degree of pain and regret , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his works has injured their effect . In this , and some other later cases , expe // rience shows that no superiority of talent will compensate for the want of care and finish. - Out of the hundreds and thousands of Lope 's pieces , it would be difficult to select a single one , sufficiently free from faults* to he pronounced on the whole good . He says himself , that he knew very well what the rules of correct writing were , but that he was obliged to put his art of poetry under a dozen locks , and suit his wares to the taste of his purchasers . It may be feared , however , that a restless and insatiable thirst for new demonstrations of public favor , cooperated with this motive to create a habit of rapid and careless composition . The same remarks apply in the main to Calderon , who , with somewhat less both of prodigality and power , had enough of both to give his works a reputation and a real value , nearly similar to that of Lope . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have both left behind them a vast body of poetry , which has served to subsequent authors as a mine of rich materials , but which is very little read or used by the public . The sin- ' gle tragedy of the Cid , horrowed by Corneille from one of the secondary Spanish authors , and wrought up by him into the form of a finished piece , may be said to have , in some sense , eclipsed the whole drama from which its materials were drawn . Thus in our own literature , the few small , but precious gems of poetry that fell from the pens of Gray , Collins and Goldsmith , occupy a larger space in the public mind , and constitute for all practical purposes a more important part of the national literature , than the whole mass of the voluminous but unfinished works of the earlier poets , including even Dryden . Although the drama was the department in which the Spanish writers chiefly excelled , others were , however , by no means neglected . In epic poetry , besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Araucana a production of great power , and of a strong original cast . To this we may add the Lusiad of Camo*ns , since the Portuguese literature is properly an appendage and constituent part of the same Peninsular school . The Spanish romances furnished the original type for the novels , which have multiplied so much of late years , and which may be viewed as forming the real modern epic ; while the admirable genius of Cervantes produced the finest specimen of the mock heroic or comic epic poem , that the world has seen . In this inimitable work , genius appears , as it always ought to do , under the conduct of good taste and // patient industry , and so much superior is the effect of a finished work to that of the crude and unwrought efforts of equal or superior talent , that Don Quixote has drawn upon itself and the author a greater share of the attention of the literary world , than the whole contemporary drama . Thus Montesquieu , in his brief review of Spanish literature , entirely overlooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language contains nothing hut Don Quixote and the old romances . He observes , that the Spaniards have hut one good book , the object of which is to shew the worthlessness of all the rest . ' The success of the Lusiad affords in like manner a strong illustration of the superior value of finished productions . This single work has secured to its author , like that of Cervantes , a permanent literary glory , while the reputation of Lope and Calderon rests in a great measure on tradition , and will gradually sink into the mere shadow of a name . The great writers whom we have mentioned , although inspired by the literature of Italy , may he said to have imitated the success of the great writers of that country , rather than to have directly copied their works . Others , such as Garcilaso and Boscan , imitate more directly the taste and form of the poetry of Italy , and have left some beautiful specimens of the elegiac and amatory style . The departments of eloquence and moral philosophy are nearly vacant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period which we have now described , the Spanish school sunk at once ,  --  still more rapidly than the political greatness of the country ,  --  into a state of abasement from which it has never yet made an effort to recover . Genius , taste , industry , every thing liberal and valnable ,  --  excepting perhaps , the natural dignity and uprightness of the Castilian character ,  --  disappeared together , and the seat of learning was transferred , as it were , by an instantaneous movement , with that of power , from Madrid to Paris . It is rather difficult to account satisfactorily for this sudden revolution , as it is , in fact , for the rapid political decline of the Spanish monarchy . Ancient Greece was the favorite abode of art and literature for a long time after she had lost her national importance , and so it has been with modern Italy . In the absence of any other plausible reason , it has been usual to attribute the decay of learning in Spain to the influence of the Inquisition . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Inquisition was not only in existence , but // was more active than it ever was before or since , precisely at the epoch of the greatest literary glory of the Peninsula . Lope de Vega was himself a familiar of the Holy Office , and lent his aid , on more than one occasion , at those infernal festivals which bore the name of Acts of Religion . We must , therefore , probably look for the cause of the intellectual and political decline of this powerful empire7 in other circumstances of a less general character , the nature of which it is of course foreign to our present purpose to examine . A future , or at least very early revival of learning in Spain herseig is hardly perhaps to be expected ; but we may venture to hope , that in the flourishing states which will naturally spring up in the ancient possessions of this kingdom in America ) under their new political forms , the noble and expressive Castilian dialect may yet bring forth another harvest of fruits , even more mature and exquisite than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . The seat of learning was transferred immediately , as we have already remarked , from Madrid to Paris , and at this epoch is properly fixed the commencement of the French school , to which we may advert on a future occasion . We propose to complete the present hasty outline of the rise of leai*ning in the other parts of modern Europe , by a cursory notice of the circumstances attending it in England . There , as in Spain , learning received an impulse from the example of Italy , and began to flourish , in a remarkable manner , contemporaneously with the most brilliant epoch of the arts in the Peninsula . The English and French languages were the last of all in assuming a precise and mature form . The Italian , the Spanish and the Portuguese had , as we have seen , reached very nearly the forms which they now wear , as early as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , while the French and English were yet wholly unsettled . Learning had been encouraged and protected in England by the Saxon Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first scholars of his time , and would doubtless have made rapid and regular advances from that period , had not its progress been interrupted by the Norman conquest , which not only crushed the spirit of the people , hut introduced for two or three centuries a new and foreign language to the exclusion of the English . But the natural vigor of the mass absorbed and assimilated to itself this mixture of extraneous substance , and it was not long before // the hardy , independent and original English spirit began to show itself in literature as well as in politics . Our earliest poets , particularly Chaucer , though they failed in forming the language , and are now of course in a great measure obsolete and unread , are not inferior , for true poetical inspiration and an affluent facility of style , to the best of their successors . They looked to the great masters of Italy as models , but not with a servile eye . Some of Chaucer 's Tales are imitated from those of Boccaccio , but the subjects are treated with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good story belonged to him who knew how to tell it well , and he took his property , as Moliere said of his own occasional recurrence to the works of his brother poets , wherever he found it . In the mean time. , learning advanced , and the language was gradually formed , but the best writers still kept their eyes on Italy , and their taste was doubtless directed and much improved by this circumstance . We discern traces of the study nf Italian literature in Spenser ; and , at a later period , Milton , whose mind indeed embraced the whole world of thought , drank deeply at these pare and sweet fountains . Even Shakspeare , careless , as he was and had a right to be , of every thing foreign to the resources of his own unrivalled genius , appears nevertheless to have had some knowledge of Italian poetry . It is properly with Spenser , that the English school of polite literature may be said to open . Few poets of any age or nation have excelled the author of the Fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste , or felicity of law . guage ; and had he been a little happier in the choice of his subject , he might have held the same rank in the poetry of England , that was assumed by Dante and Petrarch in that of Italy . But as poetry is properly a representation or picture of the actions and passions of real life as it goes on before us , it can never produce much effect or become truly popular , unless its forms correspond with those of its subject . Hence the great popularity of the dram ? , which represents exactly the outward semblance as well as the spirit of the world , and thus holds a perfect mirror up to nature . In the Fairy Queen , on the contrary , the observations of the author upon actual life , ( for to this , after all , the substance of poetry reduces itself ) become unintelligible , and lose their effect in consequence of the precise circumstance , by which he probably intended to heighten it , of their being wrapped up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by an abstract image of Hypocrisy or Avarice , hundreds and thousands burst with laughter at the grimaces of Tartuffe and Harpagon . We read with satisfaction a well-written statement of the effects of ambition or jealousy , and lay down the book with considerable emotion ; but Othello and Macbeth fire the stage , and convulse the spectator with terror and pity , as if the images before him belonged to the circle of his own friends and family . Hence it is that , while Shakspeare and Scott fill the imaginations and the mouths of men , the work of Spenser ,  --  a poet not inferior perhaps in genius to either ,  --  is much praised , occasionally quoted and criticised , now and then taken from the shelf , and wholly unknown to the mass of the people . In England , as in Spain , the great development of literary talent took place in the drama . The general characteristics of the two schools are nearly the same ,  --   - -  originality , richness and power , with a somewhat rude and imperfect taste . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and the extraordinary talent of the principal writers belonging to it , that it would at first view be difficult to suppose that it could have been surpassed or even equalled ; but it is nevertheless certain that the British drama , though distinguished in general by beauties of the same kind , and liable to nearly the same objections , has nevertheless reached a height of perfection , which places it far above that of Spain . For this superiority , it is principally indebted to the unique and unrivalled genius of Shakspeare . Every form of praise has been , for a century past , so completely exhausted upon this writer , that it is too late to attempt to add any thing either in commendation or illustration of the value of his works . Suffice it to say , that he seems to delight alike in all the great departments of his art , and carries them all to the same degree of perfection . He thus combines in his own person the various sorts of merit which , as we have seen above , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  and also among the illustrious trio , which stands at the head of French dramatic literature . As the powers requisite for excellence in the various branches of the art depend upon the same principle , viz , a keen sensibility , or in other words , an exquisitely fine constitution of the organs by which our intellectual part communicates with the world around us , the possession of them all by the same individual is not in itself extraordinary . It is rather a thing comformable // to the order of nature . But the development of them all by the same person to any great extent , is found by experience to be very uncommon . Accident generally determines , pretty early in life , the direction of the intellectual faculties : habit soon confirms it , and after a time renders any change difficult , and finally impossible . But the genius of Shakspeare never consented to wear these common shackles . He expresses all the vinious emotions with equal power and freedom , and exhibits in all the same mastery over his subject , facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly suppose it possible that the spirit , which raised the terrible storms of passion that distract the brain of Lear , could breathe with such melting sweetness the soft accents of pure and tender love through the lips of Juliet and Miranda , and then again burst forth with such a hearty good will in the horse-laugh of honest Jack Falstaff . Shakspeare ranges like a chartered libertine through all the domains of the understanding . He could hang up philosophy out of compliment to the charming Juliet , but when he chooses to enter the field of general observation , he puts the seven sages of Greece to the blush . It would be easy to select from his plays a body of practical ethics , superior not merely in power and beauty of expression , but in actual truth , w any treatise on the subject that has yet been produced . When he paints nature , his canvass is all alive , and when he chooses to exert his creative power , he introduces us to half a dozen imaginary worlds , each of which appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as our own . To display a second-rate talent in several walks of art or science is nothing ,  --  the worthless triumph of conscious mediocrity ;  --  to excel in any one , is sufficient for the glory of any one man :  --  but to carry each and all at once to a greater perfection than any other person of any age or nation , is something apparently miraculous , and places the divine genius which was able to accomplish it , , entirely hors de pair . Such , however , is the praise of Shakspeare . Nevertheless , he may justly be charged with occasional offences against good taste : and this seems to be an accidental result of the astonishing variety of his powers . His faults consist for the most part in bringing together in the same picture various figures , in themselves all good , but in their nature incongruous . The porter in Macbeth , for example , is a capital sketch , but he interrupts , unpleasantly , the solemn interest with which we follow out the wild and supernatural story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a real lover of poetry , to desire , that the works of Shakspeare ,  --  whatever may be their faults ,  --  had been any other than they are . The enthusiastic admiration of the German school of the present day has even sanctified his errors , and proved , satisfactorily , that they are all real beauties . By the side of this miracle of genius , the other dramatists , his contemporaries , though possessing great merit , appear at a disadvantage . The wit and learning of Jonson ,  --  . the sweetness of Beaumont and Fletcher ,  --  the power and richness of Massinger , Ford and Shirley , are eclipsed by the superior perfection of their matchless rival , in most of their as well as his peculiar qualities . They constitute , however , a noble cortege to his triumphal car . Their value was more highly appreciated by their contemporaries than it is now , for the age in which he lived , by a singular fatality , does not seem to have been fully aware of the transcendent excellence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoirs , lately published , declares the plays of Ben Jonson to be the best he had seen , pronounces the Midsummer Night 's Dret*m insipid and ridiculous , ' - Othello a mean thing , ' and Henry VIII . a simple piece of patch-work . ' Such profane language as this , in the mouth of one of the best judges of the time , himself a poet and fond of the drama . may serve to console the admirers of Racine for the fall of Ph*dre , and the complete failure of Athalie . Such were the glories of the English school of poetry , in its best and brightest days , but they did not end here . The same period , which produced this brilliant constellation of dramatic poets , beheld the youth of one , whom a competent judge has declared to be not second ' to the best of them , and who has tried his powers in a line of poetry which critics commonly regard as superior to the drama . It does not belong to us to correct the decision of Gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his judgment may not , perhaps , agree with ours : nor does the cursory manner in which we are compelled to treat the subject permit us to enlarge upon the merits of the latter . We are free to confess , that with the highest admiration for the genius and character of Milton , we do not recognise in his poetry a talent of the same order with that of Shakspeare . His touch is free and bold ,  --  that of Shakspeare airy and elastic . The coloring of Milton is rich and true ,  --  that of Shakspeare fresh , bright and dewy . In Milton 's creations , we feel the hand of a master ; - in those of Shakspeare , we forget // it . But why balance invidiously the respective merits of these illustrious men , each of them in his way original , and without a rival , and who , from the circumstances of their education , and the form of their productions , do not properly come into comparison ? In fact , when Gray declares that Milton was not inferior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds , moving in different spheres , and not susceptible of being weighed in the same balance . This is doubtless a correct view of the subject , but were we compelled to sacrifice the works of one or the other , we should consent , with comparatively little reluctance , to relinquish those of Milton . The revival of eloquence and moral philosophy is another of the great merits of the English school of literature . Bacon and Jeremy Taylor stood at that lofty , and to most minds inaccessible height of intellectual eminence , where philosophy and poetry are seen to flow together from their common spring in the heart ; and they combine the essential qualities of both . Locke took his departure from a somewhat different point . He made no account of feelings and set hut little value on what he considered the deceptive coloring of eloquence and poetry ; but explored with singular clearness of view the field of intellect , which he thought worth attention . His philosophy , however , remained imperfect , and in order to produce its proper beneficial effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of this , it was destined to become , in the hands of his foreign disciples , a code of immorality and falsehood , and in its practical results to unsettle , for a time the peace of Europe and the world . Such was the brilliant state of the English school of learning and art , during the reigns of Elizabeth and James . Although the drama was discouraged in the following period of confusion and civil war , the spirit of poetry survived , and flourished in the person of Milton ; and from the great display of talent , which took place after the accession of Charles , it is probable that the standard of taste would have risen still higher than it stood before , without any corresponditg decline of genius , had the mind of the country continued to pursue its former independent and original course . But at this critical moment , it met the fate which befel the ruined archangel in his tedious flight through chaos , having been struck by a side-wind , whose tempestuous rebuff ' drove it ten thousand fathoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for at least a cen* tury , a new and false direction . This side-wind was no other than the influence of the French school of poetry , then at its highest point of splendor and perfection . Charles 11. and the train of attendants who accompanied him on his return , had been educated in this school , and had no taste for any other . Their personal and political relations with France , kept up a strict and continual intercourse between the two courts : and that of Charles was in every respect fashioned on the model established by his illustrious contemporary . Language , manners , morals , taste , politics , religion ,  --  every thing was French . Learning and art could not fail to he affected by this revolution ; and Dryden , one of the most powerful , but not least pliant of the masters of English literature , was hut too well ' fitted hy his talent and character to set the new fashion . Milton , still alive and in the fullness of his power , was forgotten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true English drama was despised as barbarous , and nothing would answer but tragedies in rhyme , on the model of Corneille and Racine . It is painful to reflect , that Glorious John , ' as Dryden has hy courtesy been lately called , should have prostituted a first-rate talent to the sole purpose of supplying the vicious taste of the court with these miserable wares : and after forty years of constant literary labor , have left no monumnents , excepting a few short occasional pieces , really worthy of his genius . Pope followed in the same taste , hut with better success , and though writing in another language , is one of the principal ornaments of the French school of poetry . But this exotic style never took deep root or flourished much in the English soil , and after the time of Pope pretty soon decayed , and came to nothing . Meantime , the true native school had also ceased to he productive , and there intervened a temporary poverty of real poetical and literary talent , greater , perhaps , than had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellect , that came on soon after throughout all Christendom , and the expansion of the political influence and national glory of England that followed , awoke the slumbering genius of the country , and within our day another native school of learning has sprung up with a most lu*uriant display of original vigor , and , having taken in the main a right direction , promises to pursue a long and successful career on both sides of the Atlantic . // Thus the brief review of English learning , into which we have now entered , brings us back to the French school , which we had already reached by the way of Madrid . It is not from any prejudice against the French style of poetry , that we have been led to represent its influence on the state of English learning as unfavorable . Pride , indeed , as well as principle , ought to induce us to do full justice to the merit of a foreign school , which possessed power enough to arrest the progress of the English mind , at one of its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great let me call him , for he conquered me . ' We ought , for the honor of our fathers , to presume that the strange gods , which could draw them from their natural allegiance to Shakspeare and Milton , were not without some well-founded claims to real divinity ; higher , perhaps , than the public of the present day is in general ready to admit . The character and real value of the principal writers of the French school may , probably , engage our attention in a future article.
