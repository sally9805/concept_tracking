txt 2 . The Token , a Christmas and Yew Years Present . Edited by N. P. Willis . Boston . 1829 . S. G. Goodrich. 3 . The Talisman , for Mncccxxix . New York . E. Bliss . Wa may seem to have a somewhat less grave task in hand than common , in taking cognizance of the claims of these pictured duodecimos . But we have never been wont to estimate literature by the quantity , or to appraise the productions of intellect by the space which they occupy on paper . Nor yet have we ever found , in the natural history of books , that in these , as in the feathered tribes , sweetness of song is never combined with brilliancy of plumage . These volumes are in* deed small in size and beautiful in binding , lettered in gold and full of plates , but not therefore the less will we acknowledge the excellence and beauty of their literary contents . Not every book that is biggest must needs be best , nor dc* most words always convey most information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One stirring thought , one strong wnception , one sound and useful maxim ,  --  and it may as well be conveyed in the three words oC a simple sentence , as hidden in the chaff of a folio ,  --  is more deserving of the praise , and will better repay the consideration of the world , than an infinite deal of nothing . ' And as to engravings and pictures and all the embellishments of a fair outside , they can do little harm ; but when employed in adorning innocence or illustrating truth , // may do much good . Where there is virtue , these are more virtuous . ' Literature is not , now-a-days , so much the idol of enthusiasm , that she needs to be clothed in a grave and austere habit . In the most fascinating attire , her disciples may wellnigh be counted . in looking , then , at these little volumes , we would first hail with pleasure that enactment of modern taste , which has con .. verted the symbols of love and friendship and remembrance from pencil-cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , ' into something more worthy of intellectual and moral beings . There is little enough of real fellowship and true sympathy in this world of self , and it seems like taking away even that which we have , to make us depend for theit ' expression on the artificial and heartless creations of mere mechanism . The attachments of society are too apt to be matters of caprice or accident , of convenience or policy , to be of long duration . They need the strong cement of reason to secure their uncertain continuance and fasten their slippery hold . The amity which Wisdom knits not , ' says Nature 's best interpreter , Folly will easily untie . ' We are glad then to see anything , which only looks like bringing in this necessary aid to that which , in its purity and strength , is the very joy and poetry of life . We would have Genius make ready his richest gifts and Virtue her purest sacrifice , as offerings for the altar of Friendship , that haply , not only the hearts of *her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the cold and indifferent lookers-on may be purified and set right . Words , and thoughts , and pictures embodying thoughts , seem more proper and trust-worthy expressions of rational affection , and love coming from the soul . They speak to the understanding , and not to the senses only ; with the eloquence of the heart , and not the mere cunning of the hands . We can not indeed say that there is less of mechanical skill and the nicety of art in these , than in the old materials of friendly interchange . But here genius and reason unite with and sanctify the art , and each borrows a grace and a beauty of the other . The difference is like that between paper and coin as the circulating medium of commerce . In the one , the value is wholly artificial ; in the other , art is employed only to adorn and designate its intrinsic worth . lATe are far from intending , by these remarks , that the sincerity of friendship is to be tried by the quality or the // cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we measure a man 's grief by the width of his crape , or his piety by the length of his prayer . We disclaim , , too , any reverence for those ancient superstitions that amulets can keep , or knives cut love . A hearty shake of the hand , an honest counsel , an open trust , a free communication , is , any time , to our mind , better evidence of real regard , than all the love-tokens or keep-sakes which art could devise or wealth can purchase . But forasmuch as it is a popular and innocent custom , for those who are near or dear to each other , to interchange , at the begin. * fling of a new year , some token that their love has not died with the old  --  a kind of renewal of the bond of affection-we would have such a token , as much as may be , adapted to its purpose . If possible , it should be , in itself , an image and a type of the beauty and purity of that spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , for it can not be denied that many of these slight tokens of regard are mere gifts of ceremony or compliment , to atone for some past neglect or secure some future favor . But still we would have them signify what friendship ought to be , not what it is ; or rather what friendship really is , and not what the world too often make it . Though secretly on our guard , we would never acknowledge any such thing as an interested attachment or a politic love . We would learn to shudder at the idea of a false friend or a hollow heart . Haply , by not acknowledging , we may prevent their existence ; as an unreserved confidence will sometimes ensure faithfulness . These little volumes , then , breathing with . the eloquence of pure thoughts , with the music of a rich and chastened fancy , and adorned with all the delicacy of the most refined arts , seem a faint , but not untrue , expression of real intellectual friendship . But we turn from these somewhat extraneous considerations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more appropriate to our character as literary reviewers . And here we are not inclined , nor , if we were , would we indulge the inclination , to clamber to the dizzy top of prophecy , and point to these and the other little golden specks , which are just glimmering above the dim horizon , as the twilight dawn of American literature . Still less are we disposed to get us up upon the mount of retrospect , and counting over , as we too easily could , the scant and thinly scattered productions of our past years , to add these as fresh specimens of a vain and vaunting // littleness . Both these operations have often enough been performed . Often enough has the latter brought down upon us a ridicule , whose justice ourselves could hardly gainsay ; and too often has the former only served to cheat us into so selfsatisfied and sleepy an assurance , that our literature must of mere necessity become as perfect as our liberty , that we Iaave almost forgotten to use any exertions to make it so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to roll in upon us these treasures of learning and knowledge , as if a ripe and abundant harvest were about to spring spontaneously up to feast our lazy admiration ! We scorn to use those blest en dowments of memory and imagination to so miserable and mischievous an end . We would simply remark , and that without fear of having it cast in our teeth , that these little works , made up of short articles of poetry and prose , seem especially suited to the instant genius of our land . The body of our writers are yet young . Few of them have acquired experience and strength enough to venture alone into the world . Here seems to be a fair and pleasant field for them to exercise together , to prove their powers and prepare them for future *nd nobler exertions . Not that we would allow our young men to devote their time or talents exclusively , or even in any considerable degree , to works like these . On the contrary , we are ready enough to confess that it is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which augurs illest for the success of our literature , that our scholars are permitted so soon to steal out of their closets , to throw by their books , and attempt to teach others , who themselves need instruction . And were the tendency of these literary toys to encourage so pernicious a course , beautiful as they , are , we would condemn them . It is not only in the lines of a good judges that the maxim should be written , He should continue the studying of his books , and not spend upon the old stock . ' No one can expect ever to be rich in wisdom and in good learning , whose expenditure is exceeding , or equalling , or coming nigh to equal his income . But the short articles of which these volumes are composed , appear to us to require just enough of the time and labor of our scholars to keep their pens ready and their ink from growing thick , to give their reason a breathing-time and let their fancy sport its wings . They serve as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niceties and beauties of expression , hereafter to be worked in upon more enduring ma* // terials ; or , to use a more dignified figure , they answer as the cartoons of the Italian artists , on which may he figured in small those creations of fancy and devices of thought , which may afterwards be applied to the more matured and nobler fresco . Our poets , too , ( as indeed may be said of almost all poets of the present day , ) seem to have a peculiar aptitude for short pieces , or at least a peculiar inaptitude for long ones . Whether it be want of power , or want of confidence , or want of desire for a longer flight , they venture but a little way at a time . But their productions , though destitute of the fulness and strength of larger proportions , have much beauty , and will merit an exemption from the common doom of fugitive verses . The fair pages of a Souvenir or a Forget-me-not seem a pleasant ai1d not inapt habitation for these bantlings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion , the vast improvement which these annual publications are helping to produce in the useful and ornamental arts connected with book-making . Let any one compare the neatness , the accuracy , the strength , the beauty , in all its features , of one of these volumes , with the loose , misshapen , sorry tomes , which were issued , perhaps from the same shops , not a score of years ago ; let him look at the engravings , some of them illustrating the fairest or grandest portions of our own scenery , and others copying the designs of our own painters , and compare them with the sombre wood-cuts which were at great expense imported for us not a half*century back , and he will no longer doubt that not less to the luxuries of literature than to those of fashion or of folly , may the arts look for encouragement . Again , there is much of curious anecdote and romantic tradition connected with the early situation of ur land , the manners and superstition of the natives , the enthusiasm and sufferings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a history , but which ought to be embalmed in the fondest efforts of our song and story . No inch of ground is without its peculiar association , its appropriate legend ; and it seems hardly more than filial duty , no more than filial affection , to gather and garner up these little mementos of our fathers ' joys and trials , before time shall have marked them as alms for oblivion . What seems more fitting for the pledge of alliance and amity among the children , than the stories of the fathers , by whose toils and struggles our lots have been cast together in a world of so much happiness and comfort ? The // idea of making these seemingly frail and ephemeral works the place of safe-keeping for anything so precious , may seem but poor philosophy ; and we confess that we scarce could single out from the whole mass of literary rubbish a more exact emblein of that dread wallet at the hack of Time , than the common run of periodical publications . Trudit alius alium , ' one pushes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so with these . The pledge of affection , the offering of friend .. ship , though they may wax poor ' and be returned when givers prove unkind , ' are rarely thrown away or lost . Besides , the deposit will lend its own sacredness to that which contains it , as the worship sanctities the temple , and each will ensure the preservation of the other . Nor are we without examples of tradition handed down incorrupt , from one generation to another , by works even less enduring in their nature than these . Thus the language and ceremonies of feudal homage were preserved with the greatest exactness in one of the ancient juvenile games , called basilinda ' or the king I am , ' the counterpart , perhaps ; of our royal game of goose , ' or some other of our royal pastimes . And to mention a still higher example , we have decisive confirmation as to the much disputed right of William the Conqueror to the throne , from a bit of ' barbarous needle. *work , ' found in the cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward , supposed to have been wrought for diversion by the queen and ladies of the court . This last consideration is rather intended as a suggestion for the future than as a comment on the past Annuals . Indeed , we know of nothing in their whole execution , which so readily suggests itself as matter of fault-finding to the Anierican reader , as the want of patriotism and native incident . In the hope that it is a fault which needs only to be mentioned to be amended , we pass to a short but nearer examination of their respective merits . And here we can not attempt an elaborate criticism even of those few volumes whose titles are before us . Their nature and our space alike forbid it . Were we only to make out a fair tatalogue of all the articles of which they are severally composed , and affix to each , in briefest phrase , the opinion we formed of it when read , as good , bad , pretty , stuff , we fear not a few would have to lie over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another number should afford room . On the other hand we are not disposed to deal out an indefinite and // sweeping praise to works which , though small , are so various in their features . Nor , further , can we , as in reviewing common books , transcribe select portions of each , to serve as samples of the whole . For , besides that the newspapers have already anticipated us in this rather dubious compliment , it would obviously be unfair where the works are , professedly , not homogeneous . The truth is , their web , like that of life , is of a mingled yarn , good and ill together . ' To examine its individual threads , were like criticising the hues of an opal or the colors of a rainbow . For justice ' sake , as well as our own , therefore , we shall content us with describing , rather than reviewing them . 1 . And , *first , The Atlantic Souvenir , ' published at Philadelphia , by those enterprising patrons of literature and the arts , Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having , four years ago , appeared , sola atque unica , ' may claim to be the mother of the whole tribe of genuine Annuals in our country . The present number evinces the improvement which age and experience might be expected to bring along with them . In the list of contributors , we find many of our most popular writers , and many who , hitherto*.unheard of , give here good promise to become so . Some , too , there are , who , though withholding their names , have by no means left us without excuse for remembering them . The Catholic ' and ' The Methodist 's Story have an air of moral purity and beauty about them , which merit special commendation . Much as we would like to boast of this work , as the effort of a genius purely American , we can not bring our heart to find fault with the few but beautiful strains which have been loaned to its melody by one of the richest lyres of our mother-land . The poetry of Mrs Hemans will never need an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Token , ' edited by Mr N. P. Willis and published by Mr S. G. Goodrich , in our own Boston . The improvement in t , his work since its first appearance , only the last year , is scarce within measure . We then almost trembled for the reputation of the fair city . ' But the present number we esteem , as able to stand a strict comparison , side by side , with its twin from Philadelphia . Indeed , in comparing their literary contents , we shall find that the same pens have written the larger portion of both . We are glad to see this free interchange of labor among writers from different quarters of our land . We are glad to see those , who , by their genius or their // eloquencQ , may exert a strong influence on the popular mind , wreathing together these garlands of love . A common litera. ture is not among the least safeguards of our confederacy , and it is one which sectional prejudice should never be allowed to break througb or corrupt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by keeping alive a generous sympathy and free cooperation among our literary men , may form the first link in one of the strongest bonds of our national union ? But to return ; the contributions of the editor are , as always , pleasing ; though we are , at times , tempted to wish , for their own duration , that they bore deeper marks of classical study and sober thought . His Unwritten Philosophy , ' in The Legendary , ' which , though not poetry , is thought to be his best performance , contains some useful maxims , and we could wish that he would more reck his own rede. ' 3 . The Talisman , ' published at New York , and purporting to be written by one Francis Herbert , a gentleman , who , we believe , is only known to the public as the author of the first number of the same work , last year . We have no desire to intrude upon the privacy of one who has done so well , and tried so ingeniously to conceal himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one who seems so perfectly to unite in himself all the peculiarities and all the beauties of Bryant , of Halleck , and of Verplanck , in conjunction with other features , which , though hitherto in the mask , are scarcely less known to fame . It must surely be the world 's mercy and not his insignificance , if such an one be not speedily drawn into light and resolved into his component parts . ' The book has too many of those Rich , racy passages , where we The soil from which they sprung , taste , touch , and see , ' for its author to be left long in darkness . But one actual error struck us in its perusal , and that in the notes to the first story . In that well-known scene and oft-quoted passage ' from Shakspeare , we would remind Mr Herbert that it is not great but imperious - Imperious Caesar , dead , and turned to clay , Might stop a hole to keep the wind away . ' Perhaps t were to consider too curiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying much for the text , when we are obliged to resort to the notes for matter of fault-finding . He may well be counted strong , who is vulnerable only in the keel . But we // never had any Tpntience with a misquotation from Hamlets It was in reading this Annual that we especially remarked that want 4 ' patriotic incident , which we ' have before alluded to , and which indeed the 4nithor himself acknowledges . It seemed the more surprising in this work when we considered the locality of its birth-place . The majestic Hudson and its brave , o'erhanging ' highlands have not deserved such neglect of their own sons . Having thus mentioned the three most noted of these little works , from three of our great ' Atlantic cities , it might appear less invidious to stop short , than to attempt a selection from that numberless mass of others , which , coming from all quarters of our country , *eem " tohavean equal claim , if any , uponon ? * But , at the risk of being accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty glat*ce at The Offering , ' published at Cambridge , whose benevolent and beautiful object ought alone to ensure its exemption from the undistinguished doom of those *melti pr*terea quos fama obscura recondit . ' Its execution and embellishments are in themselves neat ; and when compared with those which we have mentioned before , may appeal without*fear to the consideration that the whole work was unthought of till within two months . of its appear*1nce . Its literary contents need no such apology . Many of them would have done credit to a longer forethought . Coming to us , as it iiloes* in the blended ' beauty of charity and friendship , it may claim yet a further hold upon our regard as being the fruit of classic ground . Issuing from the very atmosphere of learning , it has imbibed much of the purity and strength , without any of the starch propriety of scho*. lastic lore . There is ' nothing in it but what is strictly moral , but many things of which it would he difficult to answer what they prove .

The differe*iee is wide . Theirs are the application of arts and literature which were long a go in perfection ; ours are the subjects of a practice which we hope will m*ke perfect . Theirs are the fruits of a harvest which has been long ripe ; ours are // the blossoms of a harvest to come .

Essays on the Philosophy of Instruction , or the ? furture of Young Minds . Greenfield , Mass. 1828-9 . EDucATIoN , as we should naturally expect , has been a subject of discussion from the earliest periods ; from those rigorous times , when the severe and much perverted maxim , Spare the rod and spoil the child , ' was the law of instructers , to the more lax period of modern days , in which the opposite doctrine has been inculcated . The principal aim of most experimenters in education ha* been , rather to devise a method of filling the minds of pupils with the greatest possible mass of materials during the common term of study , than to train the mind itself in a manner which shall be the most efficacious in enabling it , during the succes* sive periods of our lives , to make the greatest amount of such acquisitions as shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is evidently proceeding upon an unsound principle . Endeavoring to make children prema. * turely wise , ' says Johnson , is useless labor . Suppose they have more knowledge , at five or six years old , than other children ; what use can be made of it ? It wilt be lost before it is wanted , and the waste of so much time and labor of the teacher can never be repaid . Too much is expected frorrt precocity , and too little performed . ' * * Boswell sculpture , have lately been gratified by a very interesting exhibition at Corinthian Hall . An enterprising merchant of Boston , with more taste , we fear , than regard to his inter* est , imj ) orted a numn bee of copies , in marble , of some of Canova 's best works , executed by his pupils . In addition to the statues , several pieces of monumental marble were shown to the public , all chiseled with exquisite skill , and of the most appropriate design . These would have been suitable ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , is the place of their destination . The exhibition continued // several xveeks , and received a reasonable , though rather moderate , share of the public patronage . Compared with similar exhibitions in the great cities of Europe , this display of good taste , by a Boston Merchant is not perhaps entitled to particular notice ; but , compared with everything of the sort , before seen in our goodly city , we hold it to be a subject of no common interest and gratulation . The art of sculpture is the simplest of all the arts in its materials and means of producing an effect . Painting combines drawing , coloring , light and shade , and many subordinate particulars . It imitates Nature more closely , and conveys to the mind of the observer a greater variety of expression . It has the eloquence of the eye , the mantling blood , the rich and many*colored drapery , at its command . Its bold upon the feelings of the uninstructed is much stronger than that of sculpture . They see in its creations , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist , and breathed a life into every stroke of his pencil , but a nearer or more remote likeness to the animated forms around them . Its lofty meaning-its inspiration , they no more comprehend , than they comprehend a noble statue , or a glorious epic . But these popular attractions of painting are essentially transient . All our associations with them are tinged with a feeling of their transitoriness . We look to childhood for full , and active , and blooming health ; to manhood for muscular strength , but less of the rose ; to old age , for the faded color , the sunken cheek , the dimmed eye . Art , though soaring beyond the actual in humanity , is so far bound to it , that it must keep itself within the possible or the probable . Thus , when we gaze upon a beautiful and finished painting , our minds are turned to the contemplation of the conditions under which human life exists . The bloom of youth calls up the thought of manhood and old age . And , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes and the different stages of man 's worldly being , by the sight of exquisitely wrought pictures . But when the mind has become accustomed to the aesthetic air of art , the judgement gradually separates the higher from the lower , the principal from the accessory attributes , and reposes on the essential qualities of the *vorks before it . In this stage of the progress of taste , sculpture comes forward , with its simple and austere majesty , to meet the wants of the mind . Its stern and unearthly character , its chaste beauty , are doubtless hardly appreciated at first . The fascinations of color are yet on the mind like a spell . Severe Form , and the simplest expression of character , to be understood , require an abstraction from the senses , that is not easily , nor without repeated efforts , attained . The wish of a learned gentleman to paint the Venus de Medici , and the surprise of the honest old lady , when looking on Chantry 's Washington in the State-house , that " the Gineral was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in proportion to its simplicity , the art of sculpture has a concentrated power over the imagination and the heart , when the mind has become somewhat accustomed to its laws . If color is associated with the idea of transitoriness , Form is essentially immortal . It was a dogma of an ancient system of Philosophy , that Forms existed , as antetypes of all things , from eternity . This may seem a little mystical , but it is the expression of a truth , which has an important bearing on art . Form is eternal . It exists in the mind , // and partakes of the mind 's deathless nature . It is absolutely necessary to the conception of an idea of any object whatever ; and the true meaning even of the word idea is form . We think of God , as having a Form , and we are told that God created man in his own likeness . Sculpture is therefore better suited in its essential nature to convey the idea of unending duration . The material in which it works is admirably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception of an artist , when once wrought up in the marble , stands there forever . Time has scarcely any power over it . The Apollo has remained , the grandest triumph of art , a god embodied in the breathing and moving marble , undimmed arid undecaying , for sixteen or eighteen centuries ; and the figures that adorned the Parthenon , excite as strong an admiration in the British spectator , while he gazes upon them , in the British Museum , as they did in the cultivated Athenian , four hundred years before the birth of Christ . But we are wandering from Canova . Sculpture had fallen low before the time of this great man . He was the first among the moderns to call up from past and distant ages the true idea and the correct principles of his art . He banished from sculpture the grotesque barbarisms , which had usurped the place of antique grace , simplicity , and majesty . He may , in truth , be considered the founder of a new school , whose practice is guided by the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from the ideal , and founded on nature . The statues exhibited at the Corinthian Hall are copies of some of his most interesting works . From these may be selected the group of the Graces , and the Hebe , in small , as probably the most attractive . The Dancing Girl , though a beautiful figure , is not altogether to our taste . There seems to be a little affectation in the attitude , and a simpering sentimentality in the position of the head and expression of the face , which , to say the least , are inconsistent with the higher beauties of the art . But the Graces are a most exquisite group . It is impossible to look on them , and not be filled with a sense of their surpassing loveliness . Their forms are developed with a perfect mastery over the technical learning of the art , and a most finished conception of beauty . Taken singly , they are perfect ; taken together , they are a combination of perfections . Their attitudes are most excellent to show the graceful outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and captivate the imagination . An ancient epigrammatist said , " The Graces seeking to find a temple , which shall never fall , took possession of the soul of Aristophanes . " They have surely thought better of their first choice , and , in modern times , set up their worship in the soul of Canova . The figure of Hebe is among the most celebrated of Canova 's works . The small copy exhibited in Corinthian Hall is a most beautiful piece of art . The marble , as if conscious of the perfect innocence of the being it represents , shows no defect , not a single colored vein to mar the delicate beauty of the Goddess of Youth . In this work , Canova exhibits his fine perception of simple and antique grace . All buoyant with immortal life , the Divinity appears in a form just bursting into the perfection of womanhood . Her attitude , her drapery , her contour , all at once inform the eye , of Youth , and Health , and Joy , ministering at the Festival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we heard with satisfaction that a new work of our countryman , Greenough , had just arrived in Boston . We have always looked forward with peculiar interest to the course of this most promising artist . We well remember his commanding figure and intellectual countenance while at college . his taste for art was strong ; the inspiration was upon him ; and when he left the walks of academic life , it was to study , and imitate , and rival the great works in the classic land of italy . His whole life has thus far been most truly the life of an artist . With a mind richly cultivated by the treasured beauties of ancient and modern poetry , with a love of sculpture , as intense and self-forgetting as ever animated a human breast , with a generous ambition to acquire a name that shall do honor to his native land , and with a genius and industry to which nothing is denied , our young countryman bids fair to place himself in the same rank with Phidias and Praxiteles of the past , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . God speed him . The statue of Medora is modeled from Byron 's description in the Corsair . In life itself she was so still and fair , That death with gentler aspect withered there ; And the cold flowers her colder hand contained , In that last grasp as tenderly were strained As if she scarcely felt , hut feigned a sleep , And made it almost mockery yet to weep ; The long dark lashes fringed her lids of snow , And veiled-thought shrinks from all that lurked below-. * Oh o'er the eye death most exerts his might , And hurls the spirit from her throne of light Sinks those blue orbs in that long last eclipse , But spares as yet the charm around her lipsYet , yet they seem as they forbore to smile , And wished repose  --  but only for a while ; But the white shroud , and each extended tress , Long-fair  --  but spread in utter lifelessness , Which late the sport of every summer wind , Escaped the baffled wreath that strove to bind ; These  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he here ? Beautiful poetry this ! But go , reader , and gaze on the sculptured marble . The artist has surpassed the poet . Taking his general idea from Byron , Greenough has wrought it into a form of loveliness , and given it a tenderness , a pathos , a deep and solemn beauty , before which the gayest talker and the most frivolous laugher are silenced in a moment . No loud tones have been heard in that sad presence . It is the abode of death , but death in the perfection of melancholy beauty . Criticism is hardly possible . The deepest emotions of the heart are moved , and we come away with a sober and chastened feeling , and with an image of soft and gentle loveliness impressed upon the soul , which will abide there forever . The chiseling of this beautiful piece is beyond praise . In the most subordinate particulars , it is finished with exquisite delicacy . The soul of the artist was in the work , and animated every part of it . The repose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transparency of the drapery , are as near perfection as they can be . The wavy hair floats over the pillow in gentle undulations , wrou* , ht // with the finest delicacy of handling . Every part of the form , the lines of the month , position of the head , the contour of the neck , the bust , the arms , the hand holding the flowers , and the draped limbs , are rendered with the utmost skill , harmony , chasteness and proportion . Before the beauties of this achievement of cultivated genius , description faulters . We borrow a few lines from Lord Byron , which ; by a slight change of application , more closely illustrate this piece than the passage from which it was professedly taken . He who hath bent him o'er the dead , Ere the first day of death is fled ; The first dark day of nothingness The last of danger and distress ; ( Before Decay 's effacing fingers Have swept the lines where beauty lingers ) And marked the mild angelic airThe rapture of repose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that placid cheek , And-hut for that sad shrouded eye , That fires not-wins not-weeps not nowAnd but for that chill changeless brow Where cold obstruction 's apathy Appals the gazing mourner 's heart As if to him it could impart The doom he dreads yet dwells uponYes-but for these and these alone Some moments-ay-one treacherous hour He still might doubt the tyrant 's power , So fair , so cairn , so softly sealed The first , last looh , by death revealed . We have been told by gentlemen , who have visited Mr. Greenough 's studio , in Florence , that Homer is his constant companion . The beautiful simplicity , and the vivid , animating genius of this poet , in whose verse the personages of the scene stand distinctly before the reader 's eye , with the perfect outline and fully-developed form of statues , is a singularly appropriate teacher for the sculptor . In his poetry , there is nothing grotesque , exaggerated , or unnatural ; but there is much that is supernatural or ideal . In this , Homer differs much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal work is full of the most strange conceptions ;  --  and in this respect , too , Homer , rather than any other poet , should be in the hands of the sculptor . Homer was the copious fountain from which the ancient artists drew their conceptions of simplicity and beauty . When Phidias was asked whence he derived the idea of the Olympian Jupiter , he replied by quoting the famous lines in the Iliad , which describe the Father of Gods and Men as shaking Olympus by his nod ; and an ancient critic remarked , that this statue was so wonderful and sublime , that Jupiter himself must have revealed his form to the vision of the artist . It is a pleasant thing to contemplate a young American following the same career with the great men of antiquity . The bard of Chios teaching a native of the western world the same lesson of truth , and beauty , and grandeur , that he taught of old in the schools of Athens , must excite the dullest mind to a train of agreeable reflections . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in literature . He is perfectly free from fantastic ornaments , and // tasteless trickery ; he shows a preference of the pure and the simple over the gaudy and ornate ; he confines himself strictly to the legitimate objects of his art , and now bids fair to rival the first masters in tenderness and grace , in propriety and dignity , in chasteness of design , and perfectness of execution . How far he will succeed in works of a more stern and sublime character , his countrymen have as yet had no opportunity of judging . In a few years we shall all have the privilege of seeing with our own eyes . To embody in enduring marble the imposing form of the FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY is a work , which the proudest genius should deem itself happy in accomplishing.
