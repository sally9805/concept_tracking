txt Many years ago , the first wit of his day , representing the character and habits of John Bull , stated that , although he was peaceable in his disposition , and fully convinced of the fact , that whosoever goeth to war must do it at his own charges , he did nevertheless , if he heard the sound of a fray , however distant , rise from his warm bed at night , put on such clothing as came to hand , grasp his cudgel , and go forth to the scene of actiou , where he generally received a battering , which would have cracked a crown less substantial . When this ceremony was over , the parties repaired to a tavern , where John , in consideration of receiving many praises for his valor , closed the concern by paying the bill , and departed extremely well satisfied with his own exploits . This account , though meant for an individual , describes to the life almost every war , in which any country has been engaged for the last two centuries ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the great body of the human race , who were formerly too happy to be permitted to die for the glory of one or two , now testify a strong reluctance to making themselves food for powder , without strong reasons for such a proceeding . This grand discovery on the part of the multitude , however auspicious to themselves , is exceedingly inconvenient to those who are ambitious of fame . Happily other paths to distinction are still open , which are trodden with a zeal and spirit as resolute and somewhat more rational , than ever was found in the bloodshod - march of glory . Some esteem it a privilege to be frozen up during three quarters of the year , in the dead night-calm of a polar sea ; others spring forward to seize the fortunate chance of leaving their bones whitening on the sands , beneath the red beat of an African sun ; some are enchanted with the idea of tracing the course of rivers , which , according to the best authorities , have neither beginning nor end ; others can die contented when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stand , petrified with cold , several inches higher than man ever stood before . Now , all this restless energy , withdrawn from the fields of war , is like the electric fluid , harmless and useful when diffused among the elements of nature , though so disastrous when concentrated in the thundercloud . There are many men in the world sufficiently intellectual in their tastes , but too active in their habits to submit to quiet literary labor . There are some , whose minds can never exert themselves , except when their frame is in action ; and doubtless that employment is best suited to our nature , which engages at the same time the physical and intellectual powers . The pursuit , in which the author of the work before us is of late so honorably distinguished , is of this description ; it combines within itself many circumstances which give it attraction it requires the self-complacent skill of a sportsman , and the wild romance of an adventurer ; it opens a field for the beautiful powers of an artist , and the fine discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science to the exciting consciousness of danger . We do not wonder in the least , that the heart of such a man is bound up in it , nor that he should be willing to sacrifice the ordinary comforts of life in his devotion to a pursuit , which must be a happy one , because it requires the full and constant exertion of all his powers ; and in which , if he need anything more than hi* own feeling to sustain him under his various difficulties and disappointments , he is sure to be followed , sooner or later , by the general applause of the world . But in truth he needs nothing more than the glowing inspiration within ; though many ,  --  wise persons too ,  --  would be as sorely puzzled to understand this self-supporting princi .. pIe , as the Mississippi boatmen were to comprehend the mira* cle of Wilson 's supporting life without whiskey . In the original constitution of things it is wisely ordered , that b happiness shall be found every where about us . We do not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul ; it is not a distant good ; it exists in every thing above , around us , and beneath our feet ; and all we want is an eye to discern , and a heart to feel it . Let any one fix his attention on a moral truth , and it spreads out and enlarges its dimensions beneath his view , till what seemed at first as barren a proposition as words could express , appears like an interesting and glorious truth , momentous in its bearing on the destinies of men . And // so it is with every material thing ; let the mind be intently fixed upon it , and hold it in the light of science , and it gradually unfolds new wonders . The flower grows even more beautiful , than when it first opened its golden urn and breathed its incense on the morning air ; the tree , which was before thought of only as a thing to be cut down and cast into the fire , becomes majestic , as it holds its broad shield before the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its sails furled , and all made fast about it , in preparation for the winter storm . All things in nature inspire in us a new feeling , and we begin to consider their fate and fortunes , their birth and decay , as resembling those of man . The truth is , that ignorance and indifference are almost the same , and we are sure to grow interested as fast as our knowledge extends , in any subject whatever . This explains how men of great ability are so engaged in what are often ignorantly regarded as little things ; how they can watch with the gaze of a lover , to catch the glance of the small bird 's wing , or listen to its song , as if it were the breath of a soul ; bow the world and every thing in it looks so spiritually bright to them , when to others the bird is but a flying animal , and the flower only the covering of a clod . It explains many things , which are perfect mysteries to vulgar minds . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , that he sat down one evening to draw a mouse , and all the while the pantings of its little heart showed it to be in an agony of fear . He had intended to kill it , but happening to spill a few drops of water where it was his face tied , it lapped them up eagerly , and looked up with such an expression of supplicating terror , that it overcame his resolution , and he let it go . Here , we think we hear some voice exclaiming , the man was a fool ; ' but we recommend to the speaker to wait awhile , seeing there may be different opinions respecting the party to which that generic name belongs . A devoted attachment like this to the works of nature , is an evidence of delicacy and refinement ; and we have cited this incident to show that the common prejudice , which regards it as inconsistent with energy of thought and action , is entirely unfounded ; for assuredly , the radiant files of war can show no spirits more resolute than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized life , launch their canoes on unbroken waters , depend on their rifle for subsistence , keep on their soli-. tary march till the bird has sung his evening hymn , and have // no society at night hut the heating sound of their fire . Neither is it inconsistent with a strict regard to all the duties of life ; on the contrary , it is the part of duty to draw happiness from these sources , which , in all the changes and misfortunes of life , will never cease to flow . The poet Gray , one of the most in-. tellectual and fastidious of men , says , happy they who can create a rose-tree , or erect a honey-suckle ; who can watch the brood of a hen , or a fleet of their own ducklings as they sail upon the water . ' The words are true was inspiration , and we recommend them to our readers , of whom a due proportion no doubt are miserable . They will learn from them , what is of great importance to know in such calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the want of pleasures , but to their not understanding how to select and enjoy those which they possess , or we may say those which all possess , since they are given freely and impartially to all , so that no avarice can monopolize them and no oppression take them away . This being the case , those who point out to us the extent and variety of such resources , and show by their own example how full , rich , and inspiring they are , deserve to be recorded among the benefactors of mankind . No greater treasures can be offered to human desire than enjoyments like these , which at once exercise the mind and improve the heart , repel the influence of sordid passions , and encourage the suggestions of humanity , virtue , and religion . Men do ivell to secure them , even if , in order to do it , they must sacrifice some other objects of ambition ; for their drafts upon the applause of future ages maybe dishonored , and disappoint them of renown . The gold which they have collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it melted from the crucible , may fall from their grasp as the fires consume and the floods drown ; but these pleasures are always within their reach ; they do not lose their charm in the hours of anxiety and sorrow ; and those who possess them have the satisfaction of knowing , that they will last as long as the soul . But we have little hope of convincing men of the truth of these things ; it is less hopeless to undertake to show them what is for the interest of others , than what is for their own . We can therefore state with confidence to the rich , that it would be much for the interest of their children ,  --  of the society in which they live , and of science and literature in general , if they would buy this work with its magnificent illustrations . ' // We are not so visionary as to expect that they will all read it themselves ; wealth and taste do not invariably go together . We recommend it as a favor to others , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munificence come with much more grace from the living hand than from the last will ; for men are seldom grateful to those who do not give till they can keep no longer . They ascribe whatever they receive in this way to the charity of death , and not of the dead . When a man has given up other employments and other prospects , to devote himself to a pursuit like this ; when lie has spent days of toil and nights of danger to accomplish a purpose , which lie feels entitles him to encouragement and applause , it is not refreshing to be told , that he may spread out his treasures on the pages of a magazine , for the reconipense of a dollar an acre ; or that he may have the privilege of publishing , if he will advance a few thousands . He has no resource in such a case , except to give up the favorite wish and long devotion of his heart and life , or to range through the United States , as Wilson did , to find two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliating enough , to break a tin pedlar 's heart . The great work of Mr. Audubon is such an one , as could not probably under any circumstances have been published in this country , and we rejoice that he was so kindly encouraged and welcomed in the home of our fathers . But since much talent is likely to he turned in this direction , of which the benefits may be lost for want of just rewards , we wish it were possible to hold out inducements large enough to satisfy reasonable expectations , and to reflect honor on our great and growing country . We regret to see that Mr. Nuttall , in his valuable work on the birds of the United States , which will demand a more extended notice when it is completed , was compelled to restrict himself in the number of his illustrations by the expense of obtaining them , fearing lest an increased price of the work would interfere with its circulation . We hope that no apprehension of this kind will prevent his giving colored illustrations of every subject he describes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a future time . Without being very costly or elegant , they may be exact enough to answer the purpose of the reader , if not to satisfy the delicate taste of the connoisseur . Not one in a hundred of those who are really interested in these subjects , know a bird , an insect , or a flower , by its scientific distinctions ; and a work of the kind // must be suited to all who have any taste for the study , as well as those who aim at a thorough knowledge of it , or it can have no great circulation in a country like ours . It is surprising to see how few of all the birds which annually visit us , are known by name , and how little their habits are understood . Most natives of New England are acquainted with the bluejay , one of the earliest of our visiters , who comes sounding his penny trumpet as a herald of the spring , and either amuses himself by playing pranks upon other more serious birds , or entertains ibem by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry Frenchman . Every miller and vagrant fisherman knows the belted kingfisher , who sits for hours upon his favorite dead branch , looking with his calm , bright eye , to the lowest depth of the waters . The robin , also , makes himself welcome , not only by the tradition of the kindness shown by his European rela-. tion to the children in the wood , but by his hearty whistle , lifted up as if he knew that all would be thankful to hear that the winter is over and gone , and his familiarity with man , whereby he shows his belief , that they who least deserve confidence , are sometimes made better by being trusted . The solemn crow , who is willing to repose the same confidence in man , taking only the additional precaution of keeping out of his reach ,  --  the quizzical bobolink , or ricebunting , who tells man in so many words , that he cares nothing about him , not he ,  --  the swallow , that takes his quarters in our barns , or the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thunder ,  --  the purple martin , that offers to pay his house-rent by keeping insects from our gardens ,  --  the snow-bird , that comes riding from the Arctic circle upon the winter storm ,  - -  and the baltimore , or golden-robin , that glances like a flame of fire through the green caverns of foliage , - will almost complete the list of those , which are familiarly known to man . We say familiarly known , because there are many which people in general think they know , and which are yet sadly misrepresented . The farmer , for example , accuses the woodpecker of boring his trees , when he only enlarges with his bill the hole which the grub had made , and darting in his long arrowy tongue , puts a stop to its mining forever . Many a poor bird , in like manner , after having slain his thousands of insects which were laying waste the orchard and the garden , is sentenced to death as guilty of the very offences , which he has been labori. - ously preventing . There are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when we see some idle young knave permitted to go forth with a fowling-piece , to murder creatures , of which it is not too much to say , that they have done more good in the world ( it is a bold speech , we confess ) than ever he will do evil , and applauded for his exploits by his old father , who , in rejoicing ignorance , congratulates himself on having a son so efficient and useful . We hear complaints annually from all parts of the United States , that some insect or another is destroying the fruit , and proposing to offer a large reward to any one who will discover a remedy . Lest we should be anticipated in our design , we would say that we mean to contend for that prize , and to secure the orchards and gardens by protecting the birds , and offering a handsome bounty for the ears of those who shoot them . Kalm tells us , that the planters in Virginia succeeded at last hy legislative enactment , in exterminating the little crow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , before their triumph was changed to mourning . They found that the acts had been passed for the benefit of insects , not their own , and they would gladly have offered a larger bounty to bring back the persecuted birds . We shall not plead for the crow , who is fully able , to take care of himself ; but we must file a protest against the practice of destroying the birds of the garden , for , besides depriving us of the beauty of their appearance and the music of their song , it lets in a flood of insects , whose numbers the birds were commissioned to keep down ; and when we find this evil growing year J*y year , as most assuredly it will , there will be little consolation in reflecting , that we have brought it upon ourselves . The song of birds is not much better known , than their habits and persons . We have been assured by several individuals , that they have heard the mocking-bird in Massachusetts ; and in some instances , we thought it probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird is seldom found in so high a latitude ; but in other cases , we were convinced that they had been listening to the performance of the cat-bird . Most persons would as soon expect to hear the cat herself uplifting her voice in melody ; but the powers of this bird are by no means confined to the mew and squeal . Though sadly afraid of man , and with sufficient reason , he is a fine singer , a great wag , and in mimicry is not far inferior to the mockingbird ; but he has so little peace of mind , that he seldom dares to let us know where he is by his note , till after the fall of evening // or before the dawn . We venture to predict , that in the month of May , strangers will hear from the windows of the Tremont House , a delicious note , that seems to proceed from some singing leaf of the topmost tree in that mall , which bore the once distinguished name of Paddock ,  --  a hero , who has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hear it , rising high above the hackman 's whistle and the rattling wheel . Few will be able to tell him more , than that the sound proceeds from a bird ; while the warbler , and his brother of the red eye , will sing on , in happy indifference both to the attention and neglect of man . But their favors will not be confined to the city : they will be heard in the country , from the broad arm of the elm that overhangs the cottage door , singing on , at morning , noon and night , with a taste and science that fill other listening birds with admiration and despair . There is another bird , well known by the name of the brown thrasher , whose musical talent is but little understood . It is said that he is called the French mocking-bird at the South , and we have heard that name given to him here , not on account of his imitations , but the extent and variety of his powers . He has no ambition to display himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all who hear him , by the luxurious fulness of his song . How many have ever seen the crimson linnet , as he sits playing the flute on the very summit of the loftiest tree , sometimes sinking his strain almost to silence , then pouring it out in bursts of rapture ? It is common to say , that beauty of plumage and sweetness of song are not found together . It may be true , that they are seldom united in the highest perfection ; but every child knows , that the clear piping of the baltimore and the varied whistle of the goldfinch , are as pleasant to the ear , as their fine colors are to the eye ; and the brilliant redbird , which sometimes visits New England , is not more distinguished for the bright scarlet of his dress , than for the sweet and bold expression of his song . There is so much that inspires curiosity about the various tribes of birds , that it is difficult to account for this contented ignorance of their ways , in which so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , the friendly voice of the robin , telling us that he is glad to see us all again , has a magical effect upon every one ; it calls the heart and memory into action , and reminds us of all we love to remember . Here he is again , but be can not tell us where he has been ; what regions // he has traversed , nor what invisible band pointed out his path in the sky . If this inquiry interest us , we begin to look about us in the closing year ; we see , that when the leaf grows red , the birds are disappearing ,  --  some assembling in solemn deliberation , to make arrangements for the purpose ; others taking French leave , as it is unfitly called , without ceremony or farewell . Some , like the great white owl , delight in the prospect of moonlight gleaming on the snowy plains of the north , where all is still as death ; others , like the snowbunting , rejoice to accompany the storm , as it rushes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure a mild climate and perpetual verdure , by retreating from the wintry tempest with a fleetness greater than its own . Some , like the sagacious crow and the light swallow , which was formerly thought to drown itself by way of escaping the winter , fly only by day ; while others , like travellers in the desert , rest by day and go on their way by night . It is curious to observe the order in which some arrange themselves . The wild-geese , . for example , whose word of command we so often hear above us in the stillness of night , form two files , which meet in a sharp angle at the head , where the leader cleaves the air and guides the course of the procession , giving up his place when he is weary , to the next in order . All similar caravans move on with a regularity and precision , that do them infinite honor . If they can secure a favorable wind , they consider it an advantage ; but if not , they beat and tack so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They make every thing subordinate to the great business of migration ; - the swallow snatches the insect and the kingfisher his fish , without suspending their flight ; and if they are late in their J*urney , they allow themselves no rest till they reach their destination . Hard times these for birds of large size and little wings ; on they must go ,  --  and partly by trudging , and partly by swimming , they relieve the hardship of flying , and contrive to reach a place of safety and rest . It seems at first like a prodigious undertaking , for a bird to pass from Hudson 's Bay to Mexico or South America ; but as some of them can fly at the rate of sixty miles an hour , and more with a favorable wind , the journey is soon over , and the shelter they gain well worth the toil of reaching it . We wonder not that they should go : we are rather tempted to say to some poor goldfinch , which we occasionally see pale and starving in the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland , What ! have wings , and // stay here ! ' We know not that birds have much imagination themselves , but they certainly inspire it in others ; witness the wish which Logan sang , and a thousand hearts have echoed ,  --  to travel and return with the bird in the heavens , which knoweth its appointed time , a perpetual companion of the spring . It is well worth while , also , to observe the provision which birds make for their own wants , and to see how , when reason sometimes falters , instinct always operates with the same certainty and success . We have already mentioned the woodpecker , who grasps the trunk of a tree with his claws , and stands upon his tail , drawing out insects from their burrows in the wood . It is said , that he goes to an ant 's nest and lies down pretending to be dead , with his tongue out , drawing it in , however , as often as it is covered with the ants , which are a favorite article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stones of fruit , by repeated blows of his sharp , horny bill . The butcher-bird , which lives on insects and smaller birds , is said to attract the latter by imitating their call , and has also a habit of impaling upon thorns such insects as he does not need at the moment . Some have thought this a trap set for other birds ; but this is improbable , because unnecessary . It seems more likely that this trick of gathering what he does not want , and keeping it till it is of no use to him , is one which he has learned in his intercourse with man . The whippoorwill sits upon the fence or the step of a door , singing mournfully , as if he had lost all his friends ; but woe to the moth , who believes in the mourner 's having lost his appetite also ; the bird seizes and swallows him , without any suspension of his song . The raven and the gull , who are fond of shell-fish , but are riot provided with instruments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let them fall on rocks , in order to break the shell . in this way it is said that a philosopher 's head was broken in ancient times , being accidentally mistaken for a stone ; whether this be true or not , we can not say ; the heads of sages are harder now . The bald eagle , proud and disdainful as he seems , gets a great part of his living in a manner that does more credit to his ingenuity and strength , than to his morals . He sits in gigantic repose , calmly watching the play of the fishing-birds over the blue reach of waters , with his wings loosely raised , as if keeping time with the heaving sea . Soon he sees the fishliawk dive heavily in the ocean and re-appear with a scream of triumph , bearing the sluggish fish . Then the gaze of the eagle grows // fiery and intense ; his wings are spread wide , and he gives chase to the hawk , till he compels him to let fall his prize : hut it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , sweeps down upon the edge of the wave , and secures it before it touches the water . Nothing can be more majestic , than the flight of this noble bird ; he seems to move by an effort of will alone , without the waving of his wings . Pity it is , that he should dishonor himself by such unworthy robbery as this ,  --  though it by no means destroys the resemblance between the king of birds and the kings of men . The art which birds display in their nests deserves admiration . We are in the habit of speaking of the nest as the home of the bird ; but it is nothing more than the cradle of the young . Birds of mature years are exposed to all the elements , but are provided with oil to spread upon their plumage , which enables it to shed the rain . This supply ceases in a measure , when birds are sheltered by the care of man ; while the small bird is dry and active through all the heaviest showers , the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned and draggling hen . The nest of the humming-bird , that little creature , so beautiful , and like most other beauties , so deficient in temper , is the choicest piece of work than can be imagined ; being formed and covered with moss , in such a manner as to resemble exactly a knot of the limb on which it is built . But this is exceeded by the little tailor-bird of India , which , living in a climate where the young are exposed to all manner of foes , constructs its nest by sewing together two large leaves of a tree at the very extremity of the limb , where neither ape , serpent , nor monkey , would venture for all beneath the moon . It uses its bill for an awl , and fibres for threads , and thus unites them in a workmanlike manner , placing its nest between , lined with gossamer , feathers , and down . We can see something resembling this in the nest of the baltimore-oriole , which is so common in our gardens in summer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity of a limb , with strings either stripped from vegetables , or , if more convenient , stolen from a graft or a window . These twigs form a frame-work , round which they weave a coarse covering to enclose the nest , composed of thread , wool , or tow . The inner nest is at the bottom of this external pocket , where it swings securely in the highest wind , and is sheltered by the arbor of leaves above it , both from the rain and sun . This intelligent bird was not slow to // discover , that much trouble might be saved by employing strings which have been already prepared by the bands of man ; and if skeins of thread or any thing of the kind come in his way , he makes use of them without asking to whom they belong . This is the most remarkable structure of the kind in our country ; but if we may believe the accounts of others , a bird in India makes a similar nest , with several apartments , which it lights up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nests with less delicacy , but more hard labor ; the woodpecker , for example , which chisels out its gallery in the trunks or limbs of trees , and thus prepares a lodging , not only for itself , but for the nuthatch , black capt titmouse , and other birds , which take advantage of the woodpecker 's deserted mansions . The kingfisher chooses a bank near the scene of his labors ; and here , with his mate , works with his bill and claws ,  --  ratherineffeciive tools for the purpose ,  --  till he has scooped out a tunnel of the depth of several feet horizontally . The extreme part is spacious and ovenlike , but the entrance is only large enough for one . This bird does not waste its labor , like many others , but makes the same cavern answer its purpose for a number of years . The little sandmartin follows the kingfisher 's example . The purple martin and the republican swallow , which is now emigrating to us from the West , defend their habitations with a mud wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diffusing it so as to resemble the turf around it . But some birds show great indifference to this subject , from whom it would least be expected ; as the hen , which merely scratches a place for its nest , though it is afterwards so attentive to its young . The sea-birds , in general rough and hardy in their habits , leave their eggs lying loosely on the sand . The duck , however , the eider particularly , which is one of our northern visitors , is so motherly in its habits , as to strip the down from its own breast , to line the nest for its young . In the northern regions , where they breed , the natives plunder the nest ; the bird again lines its habitation , and again it is plundered . Many an individual in civilized countries feathers his nest at the expense of the poor eider , who is thus a martyr to her maternal affection . Most birds make their nests in an honest and industrious way ; but there is a knavish crew , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to save themselves the trouble , both of providing lodging and education for their young , by // imposing the burden upon others . In foreign countries , the cuckoo is guihy of this unnatural proceeding , which combines the sins of desertion and imposture . The reproach is of course transferred to our American bird of that name ; but our yellowbilled cuckoo is very motherly in its habits and feelings . It is true that.its eggs have been found in the nests of other birds , but a distinguished naturalist conjectures that its intention was to steal the nest , and not to leave its young to the care of others . The worst thing known of our cuckoo is , that it feeds upon the eggs of other birds . The unnatural parent in this country , is the well known low blackbird , the pest of almost all the feathered race . She lays her egg in the nests of various other birds , without much concern in the selection , and seems fully conscious , that she is acting a disgraceful part . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she takes care of the strange one , rather than desert them ; if not , she generally gives up the work she has finished with the sweat of her brow . Sometimes the birds throw out the egg that has no business there ; sometimes they lay a new floor to the nest ; but in many cases , affection for their own induces them to submit with a good grace to the imposition . When the young foundling is hatched , the quarters are so small for him , that he often stifles the other young birds , merely from want of room . He retreats the moment he is able to fly , as if conscious that he has no right to his home . This reproach should be given to the real sinner , and not to the cuckoo ; for the latter bird does actually patch up something , which , considering that it is honestly made , may be dignified with the name of nest . Birds , like men , are apt to regard each other as lawful prey ; which renders various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . The structure of the eye gives an advantage to the cannibal , as well as to his victim . It is suited in a wonderful manner to the wants of the animal , and to the element in which it lives . It has an apparatus , by which the bird can push it out and draw it in , thus extending or lessening the sphere of vision at pleasure ; the nictitating membrane covers it with a partially opaque curtain , when it would reduce the light withotit closing the lid ; the nerve is quick in its sensibility to every impression , and birds are thus enabled either to pick up insects close before them , or to look abroad over miles of earth and sea . The fishhawk sees the fish at an immense distance beneath it ; and others of the same race // discern their prey on the ground or flying , when an object so small would be wholly invisible to the human eye . Under these circumstances , the smaller birds sometimes borrow resolution from despair . The graceful little kingbird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sometimes displays , will attack the largest tyrant of the air , and not only crows , but hawks and eagles retreat from him with an expedition , which signifies that they have gained neither profit nor honor in the encounter . When the smaller birds think it unwise to do battle , they retire under hedges and brush-wood , and the hawk looks after them , as British frigates did after the little Greek pirate boats , sorely puzzled to tell whether they had passed into the earth or air , while they were quietly sunk along the shore , ready to float again as soon as the danger was past . When this can not be conveniently done , they sometimes rush out to meet the bird of prey in great numbers , and by flying about him in all directions , attempting to get above him , and setting up a general outcry , they bewilder his brain , - never very bright ,  --  in such a manner , that he is compelled to retreat , in order to collect his scattered wits . When they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of man , but they consider this a choice of evils , and to be done only in desperate cases . Nature has provided for the security of some , which have not ingenuity to defend themselves . Some are made to resemble the tree so closely , as to escape unpleasant observation ; some find the same security in their likeness to earth and stones . Many of our readers have doubtless met the quail , with her thriving family of children , in their rambles through the woods . If they are so well aware of the artifices of the mother , as not to regard her pretence of lameness , they may attempt to secure the young ; but fortunate and sharpsighted must they be to discover them , such is their resemblance to the dried leaves in which they nestle . The young of the whippoorwill , also , seem aware of this advantage , and retain great composure in danger , trusting that they shall not be distinguished from the ground . It is this fear , so necessary to their defence , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their characters are but little understood . The crow , for example , never acts himself till he is tamed and made familiar with man . In his wild state , he is eminently suspicious ; let him see but a string near the corn-field , and he imagines it a snare ; let any one attempt to approach him with // a gun , and he keeps at a respectful distance , while he manifests no fear of an unarmed man . When domesticated , the grave and jealous wiseacre lays aside his solemnity , and becomes mischievous as a monkey , showing in his tricks astonishing sagacity , in selecting both subject and occasion . Most birds can be tamed ; but man has not a good reputation among them in general ; and it is not easy to quiet their fears , lest he shall abuse his power . The voice is the power for which birds are most remarkable , and this depends very much upon the quickness of their hearing , in which they excel most other animals . The lungs bear a very large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive great admissions of air , which aids the energy of sound . The distance at which the soaring birds can be heard , is almost incredible . The cry of the eagle will reach us from his most towering height , and the wild scream of the sea-bird rises above the thunder of the beach . The variety of their tones is not less surprising ; the common barn-door fowl is an example ; its tones are ludicrously human , running through all changes expressive of passion , but most eloquent in discontent , anxiety , sorrow , and despair . But the smaller birds are those , which fill the garden and the wood with their spiritlike song . Their strains are poured forth to swell that stream of blended melodies , which form the voice of spring ; a voice full of pleasing and tender associations , which comes upon the ear , reminding us of all most dear to remembrance , and often fills the soul with happiness and the eyes with tears . No country can exceed our own in this music of nature ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it is conceded that its strain owes something of its charm to the hour when it is heard , when the sounds of the day are over , and all around is listening , breathless , and still . But our mockingbird , so unworthily named , since he introduces snatches of songs of other birds into his voluntary , not from poverty of invention , but in wantonness , and to show how his own surpasses them all , is rather an enthusiast than an imitator ; as any one may know who has seen him at his matins , with every nerve in motion trembling with delight , and resembling St. Ignatius , who , as Maffei tells us , was often lifted several feet from the ground , by the intenseness and spirituality of his devotions . These fine powers of song , however , are not confined to one or two birds ; where the mocking-bird is never heard , there are // strains not so various and striking perhaps , but equally plaintive , original , and sweet . Every one hears the voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the habits and history of the wild and retiring musician , will be generally welcome . For reasons which will easily suggest themselves to the reader , no general attention has been hitherto given to the subject . The heavy works in which information can be found , have been treasured in expensive libraries only , where they are out of the reach of the great proportion of those who are most interested in these things . But a few such men as Audubon will soon place the results of their adventurous travels , where men shall see and know them ; a taste for their favorite sciences will gradually be created , and they will be sure of the general applause . But we hope that the melancholy line , Sic vos non vobis nidificatis ayes ! ' will not apply to them as truly as it does to many of their favorite race . Those who have labored and suffered in the cause of science , are entitled to something more substantial than golden opinions ; for if fame he a reward , it is one for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most celebrated adventurer in this charming pursuit was Alexander Wilson ; a name not sufficiently known when fame would have been of use to him , but now surrounded with many interesting associations . He was , till the 18th year of his age , apprentice to a weaver ; but he never seemed to regard his trade as an employment at all sedentary , and he was in the constant habit of making pilgrimages through his native land , Scotland , in the capacity of a pedler , displaying at the same time an indifference to profit , and a passion for poetry , not often found in that estimable race . This latter propensity was encouraged by the success of Burns , with whom he was personally acquainted ; but Wilson , when he attempted to publish his inspirations , met with no good fortune , except once , when compelled to burn , with his own hands , at the town cross , a satire , which he had written upon some individual , by whom he thought the weavers had been oppressed , upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a martyr . We can hardly account for his entire failure in his poetical attempts ; one would have supposed , that with a glowing imagination , a quick and delicate sensibility , a melancholy and sometimes majestic tone of thought , and a perseverance untir // ing as an eagle 's wing , he must have become distinguished in an art , where many have secured eminence without half his powers . But so it was , that he might as well have attempted to weave the visions of his fancy in the tapestry of a Paisley loom , as express them in such numbers as those which he gave triumphantly to the world , and which the world , fortunately for science , rejected . Wilson came to this country in 1794 , so forlorn in circumstances , that he slept upon deck through the whole voyage , and when he arrived , had no property but a fowling-piece . He landed at Newcastle , and as he was walking to Philadelphia , shot a redheaded woodpecker . It is said that he often mentioned afterwards , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as this was a time when he was naturally full of excitement , the incident probably had much effect in determining his mind to that pursuit , which resulted in his becoming the historian of the feathered race . After a few years of depression , variegated by an occasional change from the employment of schoolmaster to that of pedler , he found a resting-place on the banks of the Schuylkill ; the same region which afterwards inspired Audubon with taste and enthusiasm similar to his own . Here he was fortunate enough to find friends , who , though they dared not encourage him in a pursuit , where the sacrifices were likely to be great , and the substantial rewards very few , seem , nevertheless , to have sympathized with him , and to have believed as he did , that the volume of nature deserved to be read , as well as the day-book and ledger . This was precisely the encouragement , which his energetic spirit wanted ; his plans were already rough-hewn in his own imagination ; and once assured that his object was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to make minor difficulties give way before him . He applied himself earnestly to the study of natural history , in the intervals of his labor as a teacher , and made various attempts at delineating birds , but so unsuccessfully , that for a long time the sight of them filled him with indignation and despair . Still he persevered , wisely resolving to make that preparation for his rambles , without which his labor would he thrown away . He went on foot to Niagara in 1805 , and on his return , we find him with a spirit undaunted , but a fortune considerably less than a dollar , expressing a manly confidence that he had the resources which his enterprise required ,  --  a constitution , which hardship only strengthened ,  --  a heart , // 381 enchained by domestic affections ,  --  a disposition , equally satisfled with a comfortable bed , or an Indian fire , in the heart of the woods ; - .  --  and above all , a resolution , which no failure could depress and no obstacle withstand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to advance the funds required for an edition of two hundred copies , while Wilson was to furnish the drawings and descriptions , receiving meantime a small sum for coloring the plates , which formed his only support . He thought it necessary to make a commencement of his work , in order that he might use it to gain subscribers , while wandering through the country to collect materials for his future numbers . In 1808 , he went forth , directing his steps eastward ; and arranged his Outposts and spies in such a manner , that he expressed his confidence , that not a wren could travel from York to Canada , without his receiving immediate information . But subscribers did not abound , and the whole number he was able to collect amounted only to forty-one , while the drudgery of making his proposals again and again , only to hear them rejected , was extremely grating to a spirit like his , melancholy and somewhat proud . So little was his object appreciated , that in Haverhill , New Hampshire , he was apprehended as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen in love with their paradise , and was preparing plans for an invasion . When he returned from the East , after resting but a day or two , he made a tour through the Southern States , and succeeded in adding one hundred and twenty-five to his subscription list , beside gaining subjects for his pencil from the cypress swamps and pine savannas . All his remarks upon men and manners , are those of a sharp , thoughtful , and rather sad observer ; but in a third tour , where his route led him through the vast Western regions of our country , which he *. visited before the steam-boat had supplanted the ark and the bush-whacker upon the rivers , thus removing solitude and extending civilization , by crowding the work of a hundred years into ten , he seems to travel with a lighter step and heart , as if he had learned distrust from those subjects of his art , that spread their wings and fly from the presence of man . But he did not escape mortifications even there ; a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reach of the commonalty , was antirepublican , and ought not to be encouraged . Wilson asked him , what he thought of his own handsome three-story house ? // " - whether such buildings were within the reach of the commonalty , as he called them ?  --  a question , to which it is not stated , that the bench made any satisfactory reply . He evidently felt such coarse remarks , much more than the serious difficulties and hardships of his way . In fact he held those labors very light ; and there is , to our apprehension , something grand and striking , in the thought of a man going forth alone , in the strength of his own heart , with none to share his trials , or even understand his feelings ,  --  seeing what others could not see , hearing what others could not hear ,  --  bearing gallantly onward , like a light vessel over the unsounded seas , while all who crowd the shore as it departs , prophecy that it was built in the eclipse , ' and they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasts , which would be fatal to our reputation as reviewers , we would say , that it is not every great naturalist , who makes a sublime and affecting impression ; witness Mr. Audubon 's picturesque account of his visit from M. de T- , a blank which some readers will probably be able to fill . One day , when walking by the river , he saw an individual land from a boat with a hunch of hay upon his back , who seemed to occasion some speculation among the boatmen . The stranger inquired for Mr. Audubon , and learning that he was the person , gave him a letter of introduction from a friend , which began , I send you an odd fish , which I hope you will describe . ' Mr. Audubon read the letter aloud , and asked him where it was * The stranger rubbing his hands with much glee , replied , I am the odd fish , I presume , Sir . ' After such an apology as was forthcoming , Mr. Audubon offered to send for his baggage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing him that he had none , save the cargo of weeds upon his back . When introduced to the ladies , he thought it necessary to improve his appearance , and accordingly pulling off his shoes , began to draw down his stockings to hide the holes about the heels , remarking that his dress had suffered a little in his journey . It consisted of a long loose coat of yellow nankeen , which had been stained into a resemblance to that of Joseph 's , by the juice of various plants and fiowers ,  --  a waistcoat of the same , with unfathomable pockets , and buttoned up to the chin , covering a large portion of his tight pantaloons ,  - -  the whole raiment surmounted by long hair and a beard , which were left to the care of nature . The spectre conversed in a very intelligent and agreeable manner , but was impatient // to see Mr. Audubon 's drawings of birds and flowers . On looking at one of the latter , he shook his head , and declared that there was no such plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the spot where it grew , upon seeing which , he danced and shouted in ecstacy , declaring that he had found not only a new species hut a new genus , and appearing as if he could have died happy . At midnight a great uproar was heard in the naturalist 's apartment , and Mr. Audn ' - hon running thither in alarm , found him racing round the room with the handle of a violin in his hand , having already demolished the body of it in attempts to heat down some bats , noth*. ing regarding his own want of drapery , nor the destruction he was making . Having secured one of the intruders for his collection , he retired to bed with singular satisfaction . After remaining an inmate in the family for three weeks , he suddenly disappeared , and they could only account for his absence by supposing that he had himself been taken and secured as a specimen , till a letter of thanks from him came to hand some time after . Mr. Audubon seems to have taken vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various other inconveniences he had occasioned , by showing him the interior of a cane-brake , where they encountered a bear whe was upon the same expedition , and were overtaken by a thunder-storm , which made the man of science for once forget his enthusiasm in his fears . We can forgive this , inasmuch as the jest was in the way of their profession ; but we feel bound to declare our entire disapprobation of his proceeding , in exposing a fellow-traveller to the wrath of a pole-cat . This gentleman , struck with the beauty of the animal , dismounted in order to secure it ; hut was soon convinced , that because the creature was pleasing to one sense , it did not follow that he should be equally acceptable to another . We should as soon have thought of exposing a human being to the attacks of a party newspaper , on the eve of a presidential election . How far this unsavory jest was carried , we are not precisely informed ; but , though reviewers by profession , we can see no sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure Mr. Audubon , that the least play of such humor is extremely offensive . But to return to Wilson . When Mr. Audubon resided in Louisville , Wilson came into his counting-room one morning , with the two nunibers. of his work then published , and . offered // his proposals . Mr. Audubon describes his appearance as rendered striking by the keenness of his eyes , and the prominence of his cheek bones ; and his peculiarities of look were probably heightened by an expression of surprise , at finding another person engaged at the moment in a pursuit similar to his own . As Mr. Audubon was about to write his name as a subscriber , his partner advised him rather abruptly to forbear , assuring him in French , that his own drawings were superior to those of Wilson , and that his acquaintance with the habits of birds could not be less ; this advice prevailed , and he declined subscribing . Mr. Audubon observes , that Wilson did not appear pleased , either because he understood the language in which the remark was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding to his list . He probably did not understand French , but the language of manner is the same all the world over . It requires but little study to discover the meaning of expressions of light esteem ; and beside this , a man who has given his life and heart to the accomplishment of an object , believing that he has no rival , must be somewhat more than human , if he be delighted to find that another is engaged in the same purpose , with equal energy and advantages far greater than his own . They , however , compared notes in a friendly manner , and ranged the woods together ; Mr. Audubon introduced him to his family , and did all in his power to make his visit pleasant , but he seemed oppressed by constant melancholy , which was only relieved by the Scotch airs , which he played sweetly on his flute , social enjoyments having for him no charm nor attraction . Mr. Audubon offered him his own drawings for the Americaii Ornithology , only stipulating that they should bear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Audubon afterwards waited upon him in Philadelphia , and was kindly received , but nothing was said of the subject which was nearest to their hearts . When the ninth number of the Ornithology was published , Mr. Audubon was surprised and not particularly delighted , to find a note from Wilson 's journal , dated March 23d , 1810 , in which he remarks , that in Louisville , he received no attention , and gained neither new subscriber nor new bird . Science and literature , ' said he , have not one friend in the place . ' Mr. Audubon relates these circumstances with a tone which does him honor ; without making complaints of Wilson , who certainly appears at disadvantage , and without losing his respect // for the talent and enterprise of a very remarkable man . He had a right to justify himself , and this is all he attempts in his explanation . The note was probably wrilten in a moment of disappointment and depression , and was an exact description of the writer 's feelings . We can do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then known to the world . If we think of Wilson at the time , as one whose acquaintance was thought an honor , or whose genius was respected as it now is , we shall widely mistake his condition . He was a man of plain appearance , of manners not prepossessing to strangers , engaged in a pursuit which not one in ten thousand knew how to appreciate , and which indeed owes its fame in our country principally to his exertions . His features were rather coarse , and his dress better suited to the forest than the drawing-room ; moreover he carried with him a subscription list , and was thus connected with a class of visiters , which no man welcomes to his house with rapture . Under these circumstances , though we have no doubt that Mr. Audubon treated him with kind atten* tion and felt respect for his enthusiasm , still it required a pro .. phet 's eye to discover his full claims , and to assign him that high place , which , as a man of genius , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson unanimously testify , that , although irritable , and unable to endure the least disrespect , his disposition was remarkably kind , liberal and just . In all his dealings with others , lie was the very soul of honor ; so that he was doubtless misled by feelings of despondency , which often attach unpleasant associations in an unjust and unaccountable manner , to places and persons which by no means deserve them . We observe that the American Quarterly Review , in noticing the work before us , justifies Philadelphia from an implied censure cast upon it by Mr. Audubon . He says that Liverpool freely accorded to him honors , which , on application made by his friends , Philadelphia had refused him . We do not profess to understand the allusion . That city is the last to deserve a charge of want of hospitality , and Mr. Audubon is evidently not the man to make unreasonable complaints or demands . We think it probable , that he wrote thus from having accidentally connected depressing associations with a place , where he had hoped to publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it never occurred either to him or to Wilson , that in expressing their feelings , they were bringing gtave charges against any place or people . // 386 April , It does not seem probable to us , that if Wilson and Audubon had been acquainted with each other , more intimately and under more favorable circumstances , they would have been very well suited to each other . Those who agree in being devoted to a similar object , are generally said to have similarity of taste ; but this does not follow ; and where they are unlike in feeling , their pursuit of the same object is more likely to make them rivals than friends . Wilson was a man , whose powers were concentrated upon a single purpose ; he pursued it , not as an amusement , nor even an employment , but as the great object of his life , and with a deep and determined spirit , which few could understand . The subjects of his art and inquiry were not playthings to him , they were intimate and familiar friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of dying away upon the ear , it went down into his soul . To him , the notes with which they heralded the spring were full of glory , and when in the autumn , they heard far off the trumpet of the storm , and sang their farewell to the woods , it was solemn and affecting , as if it were breathed from a living and beating heart . To others , this interest seemed senseless and excessive ; but he was one of those , who never smile at the depth and earnestness of their own emotions . When he described the birds , he spoke of their habits , and manners , as if they were intelligent things and thus has given a life and charm to his descriptions , which will make his work the chief attraction of the science in our country , for many years to come . But as might be supposed , this very enthusiasm , which was so strong that he kept it as much as possible to himself , thinking it would find no sympathy with those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors . He trusted too much to his imagination ; from what he saw he inferred much that he did not see , and therefore his successors have been constantly employed in correcting the mistakes of their master . Audubon entered upon the pursuit with an enthusiasm equally resolute , but much more light-hearted . It began in childhood , and as it grew with his growth and strengthened with his strength , it was more judicious and discriminating than if he had , late in life , turned the whole current of his feeling in this new direction . Beside this material difference , he was more fortunate than Wilson in having a family who sympathized with him , when other friends discouraged him and complained of the waste of his time and exertions . Being more a man of the world than Wilson , though without // 387 losing the simplicity of his mind , we feel that he is less likely to be led away by his fancy , and therefore trust him as a safer guide , though not a more fascinating companion . But if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of his predecessor . The very name which he has given to his work ,  --  .. biography ,  --  shows that he feels as if he were describing intelli. gent and spiritual things , and thus inspires a sort of Pythagorean interest , such as natural history is seldom fortunate enough to awaken . When he introduces a bird to our acquaintance , he is evidently solicitous to place its virtues and attractions in the most flattering light , as if he were speaking in favor of a friend . We need hardly say that his work is very engaging . The singleness of heart , which is always found connected with an enthusiastic love of nature , speaks volumes in favor of such men : and if it were not so , their various and amusing adventures , the wild aspects of the country which they describe , their escapes and dangers , their hardships and pleasures , all alike unknown to ordinary life , give to their writings a romantic charm . Mr. Audubon was born in America , but was descended from a French family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his education in France . This *vonld be sufficiently evident from the peculiar style of his writings , which are fluent and eloquent , but carry evidence with them that they never proceeded from an English pen . It would seem that the direction in which lie has been so successful , was given to his taste in early childhood ; it must have been partly inherited ; for the passion rose at a period earlier than he can remember , and he tells us that his father encouraged it , pointing out to him the graceful movement and beautiful forms of birds . There was no need , however , of fanning the flame ; for , from the first , he was never happy when removed from the forests and fields , and his chief enjoyment was to find out the homes of the small birds in the green masses of foliage , or to follow the curlew and cormorant to the retreats where they sought shelter from the fury of the storm . To look upon their eggs in the downy nest , or on the burning sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their migrations and changes , was then , as it is now , the favorite desire of his heart . it might seem a dangerous thing in a parent to encourage a taste which was already so strong , and which , if it became engrossing , threatened to interfere so much with the more practical pursuits of life . He probably was willing that his son should make this the business of his life , and ap // pears to have taken judicious care to impress upon his child , that all the admiration and love which nature inspires , should remind us of Hun who made it . He was desirous of keeping these subjects of study always before him ; but he found no satisfaction in looking upon the stufThd birds of collections , which , like the Egyptian mummies , retain but a small 1 ) ortion of their living attractions . These would not answer ; and the beauties of their plumage seemed to him as perishable as sunset clouds , till his father , at the proper time , set before him a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he determined to rival , and if possible excel what he saw . But he was obliged to go through the usual discipline ; his first efforts seemed like caricatures ; and every new advance he nade , rendered him discontented with what he had done before . It is a grievous thing to man to be compelled to laugh at his own productions , because lie feels that another year 's improvement may render his present efforts as ludicrous to himself as the former . But this is one of the evidences of real taste and talent . It shows that the standard of excellence in the artist 's mind is set high , and this is an advantage both in youth and manhood ; for the moment one begins to be satisfied with his own productions , he shows that he has lost his enthusiastic desire to improve ,  --  a desire which forms the inspiratioh of genius , and without which no one ever was great . While receiving his education in France , from which country lie returned at the age of seventeen , Mr. Audubon took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects were not such as he would have chosen for himself , doubtless gave him an ease and freedom with the hand and eye , which he found of great advantage . He immediately commenced the great undertaking , which is now well known to the world . His father gave him an estate on the Schuylkill ,  --  a residence well suited to his purpose , and here , he says , it was his constant practice to commence his rambles at daybreak , it being his happiness and triumph to return wet with dew , with the bird which was to ornament his page . Those who are acquainted with birds , know how much they are in the habit of following the course of rivers in their periodical journeys , and that a diligent observer , near one of our larger streams , will be likely to see nearly all the inland birds . But it was not enough for him to know their forms ; he wished to learn their history in every particular ; // and to gain this information , he undertook long and hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engaged in exploring prairies , mountains , lakes , and seas . We said , that he was from the beginning engaged in this undertaking ; but we must not give the impression , that he had in view the publication before us ; on the contrary , he assures us that he was led onward solely by the love of the pursuit , from which he derived constant gratification . His friends were as earnest as those of Job , to convince hin* that he was much to blame ; and he confesses that any one who saw his habits , might have supposed him negligent of every domestic duty ; hut his wife and children , who were certainly most interested in his , movements , did not join in the censure . They will now be rewarded for their forbearance , by enjoying the reflection of his fame . How much he was in earnest in his rambles , appears from his account of a visit to Niagara , in which he has given a picture of himself , as life-like as any of his colored illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was returning with his drawings of plants and birds . The last vestige of his linen had long ago been devoted to the purpose of cleaning his gun ; he was dressed like one of the poorest Indians ; his beard covered his neck , and his hair flowed down his back ; his leathern raiment was crying loudly for repair ; a large knife hung at his side , and a worn-out blanket , containing his tin box of drawings , was buckled to his shoulders . In this guise he walked into the public house , and demanded breakfast , all present being amazed to hear from such a figure anything that denoted a resemblance to civilized man . The landlord seemed anxious to secure him as a lion , and he had in fact come for the sake of sketching the Fall ; but he made a discovery which may well be published for the benefit of painters , viz ; - that in a miniature picture of such a scene , no very impressive idea can be given of the extent or the sound . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean dwindles to a mill-dam . The idea of making a collection for publication never suggested itself to Mr. Audubon , till he visited Philadelphia in 1824 , on his way to the eastward through the Atlantic States . He was then a stranger to all but Dr. Mease , who introduced him to the well-known Charles Bonaparte , whose name we observe is sometimes decorated with a title , though we doubt not he looks to science for his most honorable distinctions , // From Philadelphia he proceeded to New-York , where he was received with flattering attention , and after ascending the Hudson , traversed the great western lakes , making probably the tour to which we have just alluded . The thought of publishing to the world the results of his labors , supplied him with a new inspiration and a more definite object ; the thought of a solitary individual like himself , gaining a name in the old world by his laborious pilgrimages through the desert regions of the new , came in aid of his attachment to nature . He thought of it by day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring to bring his designs to perfection , succeeded at last to his own satisfaction and the surprise of others ; - we say to their surprise , because we are not in the habit of seeing one man make himself familiar with every subject of a science and inquire into all its particulars , in any other way than by studying at home , and depending in part on the authority of others . Whoever reads Mr. Audubon 's account of his various tours , will see that he had a mind , which , in the midst of its devotion to a single object , found time to meditate upon all that was before him . When he embarked on the Ohio in his own boat , with his wife and his infant son , he is very eloquent in his description of the beauty of the river . It was in October , in the season called in this country the Indian summer , when the early frosts are over , and winter , after having given a gentle warning of his coming , suspends his step , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trees had put on their rich and glowing colors , which , with the wild garlands of the vine that covered them , were darkly reflected in the waters . The haze that covered the landscape softened its lines and shadows , melting down the brightness of the sun , and changing the pale waning moon into a golden semicircle , seen as distinctly in the stream as in the sky . The ripple of their boat was the only sound which broke the silence , except when some large fish sprang upwards in pursuit of a shoal that darted out like silvery arrows , and fell in a little shower of light . At evening they heard the distant tinkling , as the cattle were returning to their homes , and saw the shadows mysteriously darken the shores . As the night fell , they caught the sound of the boatman 's horn , as it came softened almost into music by the distance , and at times heard the solemn hooting of the great owl , or the muffled noise of its wings , as it sailed gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , in order to // show our readers in what scenes his fancy was kindled and his taste formed . He had here the charm of solitude , together with the society ,  --  which , for the time , he was anxious to secure ,  --  of that race , which had excited in him from his earliest years , an interest deeper than man is often fortunate enough to inspire in man . But Mr. Audubon affords us the contrast to this picture of solitude without desolation . Our readers have doubtless seen extracted in many of our papers , an account of his adventure in a cabin on his return from the upper Mississippi . He was crossing a prairie , and in taking shelter in this hut for the night , he happened to display his watch to the landlady , who immediately devised measures to secure it for herself , by removing him to a world where measures of time are not wanted . She was prevented by the seasonable arrival of two travellers , armed as usual in such journeys , who aided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well disposed to aid her , seem to have been at that time in no state to profit by her maternal instructions . For this design to murder , the wayfarers burned down the cabin , gave the furniture to an Indian who had warned Mr. Audubon of his danger , and justified the delinquents after the manner of the Regulators ; a kind of extemporal police , established by volunteers , to supply the defective shortness of the arm of the law . When an individual is discovered to have committed an offence of this or any other dangerous description , a court of rather a popular character assembles and takes the case into serious consideration ; the accused is arrested and brought before them , his character and proceedings sharply investigated , and if the verdict of his peers pronounce him guilty , he is advised as a friend to seek out some other climate , more favorable to his constitution . As there may be some little want of formality in the movements of the court , and the evidence may be at times deficient in precision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cases , it is thought better for the suspected person to take the hint , and transport himself beyond the bounds of their jurisdiction ; but if he choose to remain , and is found repeating his transgressions , at the next term of the court he is put on trial , and severely punished if guilty . In many cases , the punishment is inflicted by castigation of the person , and destroying his house by fire , as in the instance of the lady abovementioned . Sometimes it is thought necessary to resort to the punishment of death , in which case the head is affixed to // a pole , as a terror to evil-doers . All these punishments are found effectual , particularly the last . This kind of legal process is fast disappearing from the West . As we have said , Mr. Audubon affords us the contrasts to his pictures . On the spot where the soul of the Ornithologist had so nearly taken flight , are found taverns , those outposts of civilization , and roads and cultivated fields , all redeemed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , the axe is heard ringing from the banks of the rivers , and the fire by night clears out a path through the oceans of wood ; the elks , deer , and buffaloes are passing to other regions ; our Government is aiding the cause in its own way , by grinding the Indians to powder , preaching all the while of mercy , justice , and protection ; words , which make those who understand our language , decamp with all possible expedition . But we will not dwell on those surprising changes , which Mr. Flint has made familiar , in one of the most interesting works ever published in this country . Suffice it to say , that as men , not birds , are likely to be gainers by this miraculous transformation of a vast region , it is well that Mr. Audubon began his pilgrimages twenty years ago . We know not where the lover of a wilderness will go twenty years hence , to find the solitude he desires . Long before that time , we shall hear from travellers who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great western rivers , and shared with the eagle his perch on the highest turret of the Rocky mountains . Mr. Audubon gives us a pleasing picture of the hospitality which prev*tils in the western country ; a virtue , which by no means gains in the progress of civilization , but is apt , on the contrary , to retreat when the sign of the tavern is displayed ; being unJibe marty other things in this world , most abundant when and where it is most wanted . Once , when journeying with his son , ho chartered a wagon for a portion of his journey , and the wagoner engaging to take him hy a short cut , ' he had the satisfaztion to find himself exposed to a storm of thunder , in a night so dark that they could not have proceeded even if they had known the way , every trace of which was lost . While sitting disconsolate and dripping like Naiads , they determined to try , since the sagacity of man had brought them into difficulty , whether the sagacity of the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange matters at their discretion , and they set forward , soon changing their course , and bringing them to a place where they heard the barking of dogs , and saw // a light through the trees . They were soon received into the cabin of a young couple , who were delighted with the opportunity of giving them a welcome . The negro boys were waked from their slumbers , and while some repaired the fire , others went forth to the hen-roost , whence proceeded notes , which indicated that the poultry were bearing their part , though reluctantly , in the duties of hospitality . The table was soon spread , but the whiskey was wanting , and the master of the house , afflicted at this destitution , mounted his horse , rode through the storm to his father-in-law three miles off , and returned with a keg of cider . Mr. Audubon says , that his son , who was about fourteen years old , drew near to him , and remarked how pleasant it was to have met with such good people . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all remonstrances , the host and his wife insisted upon making a division of its component parts , which was done accordingly , and they were soon put into a sound sleep by a long story of the wagoner , showing bow mysterious it was that he should have lost his way . This temple of hospitality was constructed of logs , and the floor formed of coarse slabs of tulip-tree . A spinning-wheel was standing in one corner ; the wardrobe of the host was suspended from the wall on one side , and that of his wife from the other . A small cupboard contained a few dishes , cups , and tin pans ; every thing was as neat as possible , but nothing indicated a condition above poverty , except an ornamented rifle . Nothing would induce the inmates to accept present or compensation ; they detained the travellers as long as possible , and gave them up with regret . Truly , we should be inclined to call such a householder the most remarkable rara avis of Mr. Audubon 's collection ; but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger is by no means uncommon , in any part of our western country . Our traveller appears to be one of those who can make himself easy under any circumstances , and therefore is not quite so dependent on such attentions , as many others in the world . When he was patroling the shores of Upper Canada , he says that some person stole his money , supposing that a naturalist could do very well without it . We would not defend the knavery , but the event showed , that the thief was not mistaken in his calculation . To have repined when the thing could not be helped , would not have been acting manfully , ' says Mr. Audubon . It is a manly sentiment , but when things can be helped // there is no particular call for repining . He and his companion were left with seven dollars and a half , at the distance of fifteen hundred miles from home . At this time they were upon the water when they land ed , they procured a conveyance for five dollars to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the way . At night , they were shown into a room in which there were several beds ; some time after they had retired , three young girls came into the chamber , and having put out the light , placed themselves in a bed most distant from theirs . We beg our English readers , if such there be , to take notice that this was not in New-York nor Boston ; and in order to relieve as far as possible the fears of the worthy travellers of that nation , we think we can safely assure them , that if they venture into the United States , judging of those who follow from those who have gone before , neither man , woman nor child will have the least disposition to force themselves into their society , either by night or day . This custom is peculiar to the back-woods , and there seems to be some little excuse for it in the necessity of the case , where the whole house affords but one chamber . Mr. Audubon had thrown out a hint concerning portrait painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descanted concerning the taking of portraits , explaining to each other how delightful it would be to see their own . In the morning he commenced the sketches , and beside paying for his lodging , had the satisfaction of making some young hearts happy . When they arrived at Meadville , he took his portfolio under his arm , and after walking the streets awhile , begged permission to rest in a shop ; it was granted , and as a matter of course , the contents of the portfolio shown to the trader ; who not only contracted for a portrait of himself , but offered to find him as many sitters as were wanted . He procured a painting room , ornamented with hogsheads of oats , rolls of sole-leather , a drum and bassoon in the corner , fur caps along the wall , and a clerk 's bed , swinging like a hammock , near the centre . Here he closed the windows with blankets to secure a painter 's light , and sketched his sitters much to their satisfaction . The result was , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary of the public house , Mr. Audubon , being taken for a missionary , on account of his flowing hair , was asked to say grace , which he says he did with a fervent spirit . His pursuits seem to have had the right and natural effect upon his feeling ; for he tells us that he never has despaired of divine // protection , while engaged in studying the grand and beautiful works of God . Among the entertaining incidents of his narrative , we find an account of his meeting with Daniel Boon , the celebrated patriarch of Kentucky . He happened to pass a night under the same roof with this remarkable man . Every thing about him , 1*'Ir . Audubon remarks , was striking . His stature approached the gigantic ; his firm indicated great personal strength , and his countenance bore an expression of ' thoughtfulness and resolution . At night , when Mr. Audubon undressed as usual , he merely took off his hunting-shirt and spread a blanket on the floor , which , he said , he preferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before , he was taken prisoner by a party oflndians ,  --  bound , and carried to their camp ,  --  . where he was frankly assured , by signs sufficiently expressive , that the next day would put an end to his mortal cares . The ladies of the party searched his dress , and much to their satisfaction laid their hands on a flask of monongahela , now a historical name , but then the designation of very strong whiskey . They drank freely of its contents , till the distant sound of a gun roused them ; and the warriors immediately went to ascertain the cause , leaving his fair guardians to their vigils and their whiskey . Fortunately for him , they showed a decided I ) reference for the latter , to which they paid such unceasing attention , that they were soon asleep . He then rolled himself to their fire , where he burned off his cords and seized his rifle . He was strongly tempted to return evil for good to his snoring body-guard , but he resisted , and after striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to mark the spot , he departed in peace . Thirty years after this , when Colonel Boon had retreated before the approaching deluge of population , a person removed into Kentucky , where he laid claim to a large tract of land , one of the corners of which was marked , as the deed ran , by an ash , which was notched by three blows from the tomahawk of a white man . ' The object was to find this tree , in order to ascertain the boundary of the land . But the tree had grown , and the wood had covered the scars ; no trace of it could be found . Under these circumstances , the owner , who bad heard of Colonel Boon 's adventure , sent to him to come and ascertain , if possible , the situation of the tree . Having no particular professional business , nor domestic cares to detain him at home , the veteran came as desired . Every thing was changed in the // country ;  --  but having formed a party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the spot where the Indians had encamped ; and having as he thought succeeded , they remained there till the break of day . When it was light , he examined the spot , and declared that an ash , then in sight , was the one . Proper witnesses being brought , he struck the bark ; no signs were seen ; he then cut deep into the tree , and at last found the distinct marks of the three notches , covered with thirty years ' growth of wood . He was , when Mr. Audubon saw him , on his return to his favorite solitudes . This was a surprising effort of memory , when we consider what a near resemblance one such spot bears to another , and what a difference the hand of man soon makes in them all . Mr. Audubon saw the old hunter perform the favorite Kentucky feat of barking off a squirrel . He pointed to a squirrel on a tree at the distance of fifty paces , raised his piece slowly , and at the moment of the sharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in splinters , and the squirrel was whirled into the air , from which it fell dead . The dress of this stoic of the woods , ' was a homespun hunting-shirt ; his feet were defended with moccasins , and his legs bare . It is difficult to explain the fascination of savage life ,  --  but there are more examples than one , which prove that it is much more difficult to tame the wild , than to make a savage of the civilized man . It can not be ascribed to an aversion to restraint ,  --  for such men as this are in general selfdenying in every respect . There must be some delight in the excitement of solitude , independence , and adventure , which strangers to them can not understand . When the gates of the West were first thrown open , they were thronged with many such adventurers ,  --  who pushed their way through the deep forests , ' guided by the sun by day , and sleeping at night by their fires . Their furniture , and in fact all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these , with their horses , were all their preparation , except we take into account what was worth all the rest , a bold and resolute heart . Their way was beset with the Indians , who seem to have had prophetic misgivings that all these movements boded no good to them , and who had the advantage of matchless cunning , and perfect familiarity with the country . Others , who carried more baggage with them , built arks on the rivers , which , like that of Noah , were filled with all manner of living things ,  --  but not equally secure of divine protection ; for the heavy-laden vessel // floated lazily down the stream ,  --  in silence by day , and without light or fire by night , lest they should be discovered by the enemy on the shores . When the voyage or the journey was over , a shelter was to be provided , the soil to be subdued , and the enemy repelled . It is not strange that many became attached for life to adventure , when for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside their arms . Wherever a settlement has been made in the deserts of our country , it has been , both at the East and West , established in the face of many dangers , threatened by the wild inhabitants ; but there are some indications in our history of late , which show that it was easier to gain , than it is now to refrain from abusing our power . Beside the opportunity of becoming acquainted with man , under wild and peculiar circumstances , Mr. Audubon has had the advantage , which as a naturalist he doubtless appreciates , of witnessing several convulsions of nature . He does not mention the years ,  --  but we remember , that about twenty years ago , earthquakes became unpleasantly abundant in the South and West . It was probably at that time , that he was one day , when riding , surprised by a darkness in the heavens . Being as much accustomed to thunder-storms as the birds themselves , he took but little notice of it further than to urge his horse forward ; but the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing , planted his feet deliberately and firmly upon the ground . The rider was upon the point of dismounting to lead him , when the horse began to groan , hung down his head , and spread out his limbs as widely as possible . He was entirely at a loss to know what all this might mean , and could only suppose , that the animal was suddenly seized with mortal agony ; when the earth began to roll , the shrubs and trees rocked and waved before him , and the convulsive shuddering of the whole frame of nature made it evident , that an earthquake was passing by . Shocks succeeded each other for several weeks ; and as most of the houses were by no means towering structures , he became familiar with the prospect of being buried under their ruins . One night , after attending a wedding , he slept in the house of a physician , which was constructed of logs , and large enough to receive a considerable number of persons . At night , the earthquake lifted up its voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rushed out , without waiting for the ceremony of the toilet , or even taking // care to secure any drapery at all . The clouds were floating wildly past the full moon , the trees waving like grass in the breeze ,  --  when the Doctor , his prudence getting the better of his fears , ran to save his gallipots , which were dancing on their shelves in an awful manner , and about to leap to the floor ; but arrived too late to prevent a general wreck . The moment the danger was past , and the promiscuous assembly began to consider ' their defect of raiment , a consternation of a different sort succeeded , and drove them back to bed with equal expedition . Mi ' . Audubon was also fortunate enough to witness a hurricane . We say fortunate , since it crossed his path without injury to him . He describes it admirably , and we wish we had room to give his own full picture of the scene . He saw in the south-west a yellowish oval spot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing away twigs and smaller branches from the trees , till the whole forest was in dizzy motion . The largest trunks of the wood were bent , and at last broken . The stormy whirlpool carried thick-rolling masses of foliage and boughs , together with a cloud of dust ; and the gigantic trees were seen writhing and groaning , as if in agony , for a moment , when they fell in shapeless heaps of ruin . This great work of destruction was over soon ; but a shower of small branches followed in its wake , as if drawn onward by some mysterious power ; the sky had a lurid , greenish hue , and the atmosphere was filled with a suiphury smell . The path of this tornado extended many hundred miles . Mr. Audubon was on horseback this time , as well as before , but the animal betrayed no alarm . The reason , doubtless , of his perceiving the earthquake so much earlier than his master , was that his feet were on the ground , and his rider 's were not ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably have been less affected than the animal , who was shaken at four points instead of two We have given this general account of the work before us , to show the variety of entertaining subjects , which the writer has introduced ; and we commend his judgment in so doing . It takes from the scientific air of the work , and offers an attraction to a greater number of readers . It also serves to show , through how many and various scenes he has passed in his wanderings , and thereby gives a livelier impression of the enthusiasm and resolution , which such an enterprise requires . On one occasion his fortitude was severely tried . Having secured two hundred of his original drawings in a wooden box , he left them // in the care of a friend , during his absence on a journey . When he returned , he re-claimed his treasure ; and found , that a couple of Norway rats , acting , doubtless , on the principle that a living dog is better than a dead lion , ' had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one thousand painted inhabitants of the air . This was a severe blow ; and man ymen under it would have forsworn the pursuit forever . But Mr. Audubon thought as Bottom did , that what could not be endured must be cured ; ' and after a short period of suffering , took his gun , note-book and pencils , and went forth into the woods again . Nothing daunted him , where he could revive his strength by communion with nature ; but when he was on the way to England , and when first walking the streets of Liverpool , he says that his heart almost failed him , and that he longed to retreat into the woods . But this desolate feeling only made the kindness of enlightened men in that city , which was freely given to him , more animating and delightful . After receiving the most encouraging attentions there , he proceeded to Edinburgh , where his reception was equally flattering ;  --  and there he commenced the publication of his Illustrations . It would have been continued there , had not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Audubon , we observe , addresses a word to critics : but these are works with which critics have not much to do ; or with respect to which , they can only discharge that part of their duty which is generally thought to give them least pleasure ,  --  we mean , praise . No one can see these splendid drawings , and compare them with the ordinary illustrations of natural history ,  --  in which animals appear as spiritless as if they had been sitting for their portraits ,  --  without admiring his taste and skill . Instead of a solitary individual , we have here groups of each kind , in all the attitudes of life ; and as the plumage of birds is often entirely changed in passing from youth to maturity ,  --  as the female , also , generally differs very much in color from the male ,  --  a single representation would be of little value . We might easily criticise the drawing and coloring in some small respects , and say that it differs from our limited observation ; hut the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen one . The history of the birds of our country is still imperfect , and whoever undertakes to reduce it to a system , will find every new explorer correcting some of his errors . What he describes as the constant habits of a class , // may appear to be only accidental peculiarities of individuals ; and as birds are affected by climate , food , and various other circumstances , the result of many observations will be exceedingly apt to overturn the theories and systems built upon a few . We do not , therefore , complain of the want of systematic order in the arrangement of the subjects of this work ; - at present , there would be no advantage in such an undertaking . But when this great work is completed , we think Mr. Audubon will do well to follow his own suggestion , and to give a systematic view of the American birds , and his own contributions to the known number . It is well that the world should know the exact value of his labors , before he gives the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to Mr. Audubon for the discovery and description of an eagle , to which he has appropriately given the name of Washington . It is the largest and most powerful of all the race of birds . Mr. Nuttall suspects that it may exist in Europe , and be the same with the great sea-eagle , described by Brisson , which in size and plumage resembles this species , more than any other . Mr. Audubon first met with it , when engaged in a trading voyage on the upper Mississippi . An intelligent Canadian , on seeing this bird floating above them , remarked that it was the great eagle , and the only one he had seen since he left the lakes . He described it as a bird , which built its nest in shelves of rocks , and lived by fishing like the fishing-hawk , sometimes following the hunters to secure the animals they slew . Mr. Audubon was convinced from this account , that the bird was undescribed , and says that the feelings of Herschel , when he discovered his planet , must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , before he encountered it again . He was one day engaged in collecting cray-fish near Green river , in Kentucky , where a range of high cliffs approaches the stream , when he found traces of an eagle , which his companion said was the bald eagle in its immature state . Mr. Audubon , knowing that this species builds in trees , and not on the rocks , was persuaded that this was an error ; his companion maintained the contrary , and assured him that he had seen the old eagle dive and catch a fish . This also was unlike the bald eagle , which , as all know , gets his living in a less honest way . Not being able to decide the point , they agreed to wait till the old birds came to feed their young . Two hours passed // heavily away , when the coming of the parent was announced by the loud hissing of the two young ones , which crawled to the edge of the rock , to receive a fish which was brought them . The observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after , also bearing a fish , her quicker eye detected the spies , and she set up a loud scream , when both birds hovered over them with a growling cry , till they left the spot . When they returned a day or two after , intending to scale the cliff and storm the nest , they found that the birds had anticipated their design , and that the whole family had retreated . It was not till two years afterward , that he saw this bird again . He was near the village of Henderson , with his double-barrelled dun , when he saw it rising from an enclosure where some animals had been slaughtered , and alight upon a low tree . Thence the eagle looked at him calmly and fearlessly , till he fired , and it fell dead . The bird which he describes , is an adult male , and measures in length three feet seven inches , in extent ten feet and two inches . This is a prodigious size ; but among all birds of prey , the female is larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is no reason to doubt it , we may account for its not building on trees , as a French writer explains the reason of the condor 's laying its eggs on the naked rock ; hecause the excessive sweep of its wings makes it impossible for it to enter the woods ! ' Mr. Audubon compares this bird minutely with the sea-eagle , and shows wherein they differ ; in the bird of Washington , the tail is considerably longer than the closed wings ; in the sea-eagle the length is equal . The sea-eagle resembles it in most points , but can not be the same , being merely the young of time white-tailed eagle . Mr. Y4uttall suggests , that a larger species may be confounded with this young bird by European naturalists , a thing which has often happened in other similar cases . Another of Mr. Audubon 's discoveries , is the Muscicapa Bonapartii , or Bonaparte 's flycatcher ; so called in honor of the naturalist of that name . It is a small bird , with a simple note ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Mr. Nuttall , who is not likely to be mistaken , thinks that he has seen the same bird in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge . The one here described was found in Louisiana , near St. Francisville . It was engaged in a quarrel with another . When Mr. Audubon fired , this one fell , slightly wounded , but // still full of life and spirit , so that he was able to give a lively representation of it . He has placed this bird on the magnolia grandflora , but he tells us that we are not to suppose , that he has undertaken to place every bird on the plant with which it is most familiar , or from which it gathers its food . He has , however , added much to the beauty and value of his work , by this happy alliance between birds and flowers . Another flycatcher , which Mr. Audubon has discovered , is named in h nor of Mr. Selby . It was also found near St. Francisville , and was so fearless , that it came up within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bill and swallowing insects with great indifference to his presence or his opinion , till he felt obliged to shoot it , lest he should lose the opportunity . He afterwards shot the female near the same place . Mr. Audubon has been able in the same way to compliment other friends and distinguished persons . In Louisiana he found a beautiful wren , to which he gave the name of Bewick , whose engravings on wood , and work on the birds of Great Britain , are well known in this country . In these plates a bird is represented , which Mr. Audubon has named the Louisiana water-thrush , having assured himself , as lie believes , that it differs from the New-York thrush , which we sometimes find in Massachusetts late in the season . The common water-thrush is very shy , but this , he remarks , is very unsuspicious , and familiar . The color of the feet and the shape of the tail are different , and the Louisiana thrush does not , like the other , wade in the water . The common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing ; while this bird , which he has never seen further east than Georgia , has a note as powerful , mellow , and almost as varied as the nightingale itself . It resides in the low grounds of the State whose name it bears ; it is seen perched on a low bough , standing erect , and with its throat swelling , running through changes of tone , as clear and well defined as the notes of the piano . Its compass embraces two octaves ; it begins on the highest , and moves gradually to the lowest note , which is sometimes lost , if there be any agitation in the air . Its voice is sometimes heard in the water and at night . Mr. Audubon has named a warbler , which resembles the Maryland yellow-throat , Sylvia Roscoe , as a mark of gratitude for the kind attentions which he received from that distinguished man . To show the difference between this bird and the pre // ceding , the author has made the description and illustration of the new species to follow immediately that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , though in form and plumage they are very much alike . In honor of another naturalist , he has named another warbler Sylvia Vigorsii , Vigors 's warbler , but has given us no description of the habits of the bird , having never met with more than one , a male which he found upon the spiderwort on his farm , when he resided on the shore of the Schuylkill . The same family has furnished him with the opportunity of complimenting another friend ; he has called it Children 's warbler , in honor of Mr. Children of the British Museum . Among the hawks , he has found one to which he has given the name of Stanley , after the President of the Linnean Society of London , in gratitude for kindness received from that nobleman . Mr. Nuttall seems to suggest a doubt , whether this be not the same with one described by Bonaparte , which bears the name of Mr. Cooper . It is a strong and daring bird . The author says , that one morning , in the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these hawks flew by , so near him that he might have struck it down with his gun . Very soon he heard the cackling of the hens , and saw the hawk , after rising a few feet in the air , fall again to the ground . On approaching , he found the hawk grappling with the cock , who was soon killed by his powerful foe , his neck being pierced and his breast torn by his claws . Mr. Audubon shot him , and honored him with a place in this work . He afterwards saw a female hawk of this species attack a party of chickens , but the hen came up in time , and flew against the hawk with such violence , as to throw it on its back , and beat it with her feet and bill , till he came up and secured it for his collection . This birds feeds on partridges , hares , and pigeons . In the southern States , it is known by the name of the great pigeon-hawk . Its nest resembles that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henslow 's bunting , and Harlan 's hawk , are birds named for various friends of the writer . Cuvier 's regulus is so called , in compliment to that eminent man ; and a small hawk is oddly enough called , in honor of Napoleon , by the nickname which he bore among his soldiers , the little corporal . ' Beside adding to the list of our birds , Mr. Audubon has increased our stock of information concerning those already // known , by relating anecdotes of his own intercourse with them , and facts in their history , which had escaped all other observers . The mocking-bird appears in his description , like a new creation of fancy . You see him flying in graceful circles round his mate , with his eyes gleaming with wild delight ; then alighting near her , and bowing with his wings lightly opened , you hear him pouring out a concert of all sweet sounds , as if his heart were bursting with rapture . When they have made their nest , if the eggs are displaced or removed during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low mournful note , as if in sympathy with each other . They do not fear the presence of man , for they know that they have enemies more dangerous than he ; they come familiarly to the gardens and plantations , sometimes perching on roofs and chimney-tops , and enchanting all who hear them with their unrivalled song . One thing in their history is very remarkable . It is known that some of them visit the eastern States , being seen occasionally in the vicinity of Boston . When these wanderers return , they are instantly known by the others , who attack them , as if to punish them for wishing to be wiser than their neighbors ; and instead of listening to the story of their travels , force them to keep apart , at least till they have ascertained that their manners are not , as is sometimes the case , altered for the worse by making the grand tour . We knew that these sectional jealousies were tolerably strong in men , and why wonder that they are found in birds ? Really , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to indulge such feelings and passions . We have endeavored to give such an account of the contents of this work , as would induce our readers to make themselves acquainted with it , and have not said a word respecting the doctrine of types , affinities , analogies , progress , development , or quinary circles . If Mr. Audubon had contented himself with Linnean descriptions , he would have had the honor of discovering more birds than readers . Such books as Dr. Lasham 's General History of Birds , though convenient works of reference for those who are acquainted with the subject , are not particularly fascinating to those who desire to learn . We are not so much troubled in mind , however , as Mr. Rennie , well known as the author of Insect Architecture and Architecture of Birds , who is for cutting up all system and casting it away ; on the contrary , we think his own entertaining writings // would be improved by a little more attention to arrangement ; for though a work which is nothing but index is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisitely provoking , as in reading the history of France , Mezerai is less agreeable than Henault . Classification we take to be mere matter of convenience ; and in a collection of specimens , we certainly would rather have the birds without the labels , than the labels without the birds . The way to become interested in this study and to pursue it with success , is to learn it in the book of nature ; its pages are full of inspiration ; and while the hundred volumes of scientific ornithologists create no general interest in their favorite pursuits , whoever will go into the fields and forests , and look about him with an attentive eye , will study the science most successfully , learning it not by memory , but by heart.
