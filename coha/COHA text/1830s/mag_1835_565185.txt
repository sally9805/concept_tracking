txt EARLY on the morning of the third of October , I started from Florence for Rome with several companions , and we soon left the city and its suburbs , with their high walls and olive trees , behind us . The country became far more beautiful . The blue Appenines skirted the way , and the road lay through rich vineyards , over hill and dale ; and a beautiful sight it was to look at the rich grapes , which hung in clusters from the festooned vines , awaiting now , in the first days of the vintage , the hand of the laborer to gather them in their fullness . The first night we slept at a small and uninteresting town , where we were considered a great wonder by the natives , who all gathered around the inn to look at us and our carriage . This kind of curiosity I have noticed ever since I left Bologna ; and above all , upon this last journey I have been stared at as if IL were from the moon . Continuing our journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Aretium from which Flaminius marched to Thrasymene . We did not enter the city , but , skirting along the wall , we passed to the right . The road became continually more beautiful , for the land was undulating , and in many places the hills were covered with fine oak trees , of which the foliage was very luxuriant and covered the whole trunk : these formed an admirable contrast to the tedious olive trees around Florence . As evening came on , we approached the fatal ground of Thrasymene . M***** and I had our Livy and Byron , with ilobbouse 's notes , in our hands , and studied the position and the history of the battIe before we came to the spot . At length , ascending a slight elevation , we had at once a view of the beautiful lake , upon which the setting sun and the eastern moon were now blending their light : this lay upon the right hand of the road ; to the left were beautiful hills , covered , like a fine park , with groves of oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant Appenines . We passed another little valley ; and again ascending a little , we came to the entrance of the plain where the battle was fought . Livy has very well described the situation : loca insidiis nata , ubi maxime montes Cortonenses Thrasymenus subit . Via tantum interest perangusta , velut ad idipsum de industria relicto spatio , inde colles assurgunt . ' The pope has taken advantage of this narrow pass , which is just upon his frontiers , and has placed his custom-house upon the spot ; and there we had to stop , nearly two hours , while our things were overhauled . Jn the meantime , the moon had risen high , and was pouring her magic light upon the scene before us : the lake slumbered like a sheet of silver , ' and relieved // the rich green and the deep shade of the shore : not a breeze ruffled its surface , or moved the foliage of the trees it was a scene of utter repose , and the silence and stillness seemed to me a fitting requiem for the thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain , on the very battle-ground , is a small cluster of houses , one of which is an inn , where we passed the night . Rising early the next morning , we took our last look at the sweet lake , and then went on our way . The same hills and mountains , clothed with the verdant oaks , and vallies rich with vines , formed the scenery around us . The hills reminded me of America and after so long a time in the midst of too much cultivation , it was refreshing to see again something of untouched nature . About noon , we came to a city built upon a lofty hill , and surrounded with a wall , above which arose tower and battlement , arch and colonade , in stately grandeur . There were no suburbs : outside of the walls the land was cultivated ; but the city had gathered all the houses into itself . Its appearance , as we approached , was very sublime - much like Martin 's pictures of cities - and came nearer to the ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was reading of Roman exploits or the tales of chivalry , than any place I had yet seen . Attaching oxen to the carriage , we slowly toiled up the painful ascent , and entered the gate . The same day we saw two or three other towns , rising up in the midst of the country , without a house or anything outside of the walls to indicate that we were approaching a city . The fourth day , at three o'clock in the afternoon , we entered Tcrni , and immediately took a guide to visit the cascade , which is one of the finest in Europe . It is about four miles from the village . After walking along a hill-side , from which we had a delicious valley , through which the Nera flows , and the mountains beyond it and before us , we descended and entered a vale , which was anciently called the Italian Tempe . ' No words can convey an idea of the richness of this delightful spot . The vine and the fig tree wantoned in their abundance ; rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear blue rivulets chased through the vale , and their gurgling spoke of coolness and comfort . Oh ! what a contrast to the dusty and parched plain we had traversed ! We wound about the foot of a hill , which rises suddenly from the valley . The summit is covered with ruined walls and towers , which are overgrown witti moss and ivy . A few inhabitants still live among the remains of the ancient town , and the vesper-bell sounded solemnly from the ruins . We passed under an arch , of Roman construction , built for an aqueduct , and clothed with vines , which hung in graceful festoons beneath , and continued our way through the valley for about a mile . Then ascending a steep hill for some distance , we came in sight of the // cataract , which was pouring from the summit of the opposite mountain , and fell into the narrow vale . The elevation on which we stood , was separated by the valley from the cascade , and we stood perhaps at about midway of the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still the cataract is wonderfully fine . A dense mist arises and conceals forever the abyss into which it is at first precipitated ; presently the water is seen pouring , in many a turbulent stream , over the rocks , and bounding toward the plain , through which it rushes with fearful rapidity , as if flying from the awful scene . I can convey no idea of the mingled loveliness and majesty of the scene : the richness of the valley , the verdure of its impassable wall of mountains , the distant roar of the cataract , the rushing of the many waters , and the sublime ruins on the hill-top . On the evening of the fifth day of our journey , we approached Civit*i . Castellana , supposed to be the same as the ancient Veii which sustained a siege of ten years against the Romans , and was at length taken by stratagem . looked in vain , at first , to discover the cause of its strength , or the means of defence . To all appearance , the city stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little elevated ; and it was not until the moment of arriving , that I perceived a vast ravine , at least two hundred feet deep and as many in breadth , by which the whole city is encompassed , and which , undoubtedly , whether made by nature or art , was a sufficient defence against the common engines of a Roman army . We crossed this by a fine bridge , and immediately found ourselves in the city , which is irregular , dirty and miserable , and only interesting for what it once was . We now came to our last day 's journey , the route lying principally on the Flaminian way . The nearer we came to Rome , the more desolate and dreary did the country appear : no tree was to be seen . A vast , open country , bounded only hy the distant mountains , with hardly a human habitation in view , extended on every side about us : months of uninterrupted sunshine had parched the ground , and the vegetation was withered by the heat . A more dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , and a feeling of awe stole over me as I traversed it . Towards night , we came in sight of Rome , and gazed upon St. Peter 's , and the mausoleum of Adrian , and the seven hills . ' Passing the ZEmilian bridge , where the associates of Catiline were taken prisoners , we ente*red the city by the Porta del Popolo . To me , the whole journey had been most delightful . Among the most interesting objects upon the way , and which I omitted to mention above , were the river and temple of Clitumnus . I had remarked , for some time , a beautiful , clear stream , which flowed rapidly along the vale by the road-side , in its full channel . The sight was peculiarly refreshing , for the heat of the summer had dried up most of the rivers , and it was mournful , as w* passed // over bridge after bridge , to see the dry bed of the river , which , , in many instances , the peasants had used as a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been spared . Luxuriant trees hung over and darkened the waters : the fig and the vine rejoiced by its margin ; and one might fancy the golden age was reigning there . On a steep bank , which rises from the water , stands a little classic temple , which assured me that the stream must be the Clitumnus , of which Virgil sings the praises* The temple is small , but very beautiful . Four Corinthian columns support the projecting roof , and the front is upon the river . Pliny speaks of this temple , and Byron , too ; so I need say no more about it . The entry into Rome by the Porta del Popolo , is very superb . Passing the gate , we found ourselves at once in a magnificent square , in the centre of which rises a huge Egyptian obelisk : on either hand , are palaces with their lofty terraces - and in front. , the way opened between two fine churches , built to correspond to each other . On the right hand of the square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gushing fountains wer.e paying their homage ; while the haughty figure of Mars , on the opposite side , seemed to guard the entrance into this city of the ancient gods . We passed through long streets of palaces and glittering shops ; carriages and foot passengers thronged the way , and all seemed life and gaiety . This was modern Rome . October 9. * ** and I took our supper , and then went out to look at the city . Observing a hill very near iis , upon the summit of which is a church , we ascended by a long flight of broad stone steps . Here we had a fine view of the city , reposing in the soft light of the moon , which was now at her full . Far away to our left , was the ancient part of the city - the forum , the capitol , and the coliseum . The nearest object of interest seemed to be St. Peter 's , which arose up , like a giant before us , to the clouds . The way seemed plain before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so thither we determined to go . Following the street for some distance , we came at once upon the bridge which conducts across the Tiber to the castle of St. Angelo - origianlly the mausoleum of Adrian - which arose up before us in colossal grandeur . Whether it is the form or the actual size of the building , I know not  --  but we were much impressed with the grandeur of the proportions , which seemed to dilate and increase as we gazed : perhaps the moonlight contributed to produce this effect . But we were now approaching the masterpiece of the whole earth , and we could not linger to look at anything else . Following a long , narrow street , xve came into a square , and St. Peter 's stood before us . I was much disappointed . I remarked that we had come the wrong way , and were now by the side of the building ; that I wished to find my way to the front , where // we could see the colonnade . The edifice seemed close by me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was utterly deceived . We had come to the right spot , but were still afar off . My companion presently pointed out the obelisk , which , though rising to the height of a hundred and fifty feet before us , had been at first unnoticed in the vastness of the place and the surrounding objects . Advancing , we at length entered upon the place of St. Peter 's , and then the whole view burst upon us with all its magnificence . We could not have chosen a better moment for our first impression . All was hushed to the profoundest repose , save the fountains , which threw up their sparkling waters to meet the moonlight the vast colonnades stretched , away on either band , and seemed measuring the way to the still distant temple . As we wandered from each other , we seemed lost in the immensity , and the loneliness was painful . We approached the edifice ; but the labor seemed vain : it was like attempting to ascend some mountain , which seems farther off the more you walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building appeared only like a large house - others , that it was like the side of a mountain . Yet it was difficult to conceive of their grandeur till we approached and touched the columns . All is colossal ; all seems like the work of greater beings than ourselves ; the very indefiniteness of the edifice is imposing and awful . We could not enter , for it was late at night , and the temple was closed . We retreated from it slowly , constantly turning to look back on the wondrous work - Worthiest of God - the holy and the true . Since Zion 's desolation , when that He Forsook his former city , what could he , Of earthly structures in his honor piled , Of a suhlimer aspect ? - Majesty , Power , glory , strength and beauty , all are aisled In this eternal ark of worship undefiled . ' October 10 . We went in the morning to look at the Pantheon. lit is more dilapidated than I expected - the capitals of the columns which support the portico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , has been much diminished by the blocks of houses which have been erected against its walls , so that the circular part on one side of the portico is nearly concealed . The interior , however , is in very perfect preservation , such of it , at least , as has not been entirely carried away ; and I was amazed at the beauty of the workmanship . Modern art can produce nothing superior to the exquisite Corinthian columns which surrounded the interior ; the walls , too , are covered with marble , polished to the highest degree . I need give no description of the edifice ; it is known to all . Simple grandeur is its characteristic ; and the ages which have rolled over it seem to give it increased dignity // In the afternoon , we went to St. Peter 's , and entered . Irresistible curiosity hurried me along the church , without stopping to look at anything till I stood beneath the great dome . I found the same indefiniteness there ; it was like gazing at the sky ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was : the eye had lost its judgment , and the work was ever swelling on my vision , till , weary with its vastness , I turned away . I cared not then to look at painting or statuary , though both were there . I retreated to the extremity of the choir , and there stood , meditating the proportions of the temple . Though crowded with ornament , still it looks simple , and even plain , so vast are the dimensions ; hut the longer I looked , the more I was amazed at its magnificence . I wandered amidst the chapels and looked up at their lofty domes , and then , when my eye was filled with their dimensions , I came and stood under the great one , which seemed to stretch away , like the heavens above me . But night was coming on and we retired . In the evening we went to the Coliseum , for we wished to see it first hy moonlight . The sky had become overspread with clouds before we reached the spot , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light hardly penetrating the deep arches , and the shadowy outline but half traced against the sky . XVe answered the centinel*s challenge , and entering , traversed the whole vast area towards a light which was burning on the opposite side . It proceeded from the cell of an anchoret , who has fixed his abode in one of the vast arches , and who shows the place to strangers . With this guide we wandered over the ruins , through long corridors , up and down the flights of stairs , which conducted the Romans to their proper places - at one time having a view of the country through the arches , and again looking down from the high walls into the arena . At length we came to the eastern side , upon the spot occupied by the emperor , at the games . The clouds had now passed away , and the rising moon was pouring her light through the arches behind us , and the whole opposite wall , with part of the arena , were bathed In her rays . A profound stillness prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I gazed on the immense ruin , I thought with sadness of the days when the proud Romans were gathered there in their strength - now all sleeping in the cold grave . Why have these fragments been preserved so beyond their time ? It seemed almost an outrage to tread upon the ancient stones which tell of a race which has passed from the earth . Why have not their monuments perished with them ? It is even painful to my mind to behold these colossal works , and stand among and touch them , and then connect them with their builders . Why do we thus cherish the memory and cling to the monuments of a people who // are nothing to us , who are swept away , and not one left ? And modern Rome has fairer palaces and statelier temples ; but , her power and her pride , her conquering people and her vanquished nations ! where are they ? October 12 . Time seems to have fixed his habitation amidst these walls ; and so vast is the edifice , that two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present size . Wild plants are rioting over the broken edges , and waved mournfully in the night-breeze . But this silence - this eternal silence of the forsaken walls ! - it is sad and impressive ; and it reigns everywhere amidst the ruins of ancient Rome . I have not yet seen them by day , but have delighted to linger around them by the pale moonlight , which adds to their romance ; and there I have stopped , spell-bound , to gaze on triumphal arches and ruined temples and walls , like the earth 's foundations , which have defied the elements and the unsparing hand of man . I have traversed , again and again , the Roman forum , which looks like the battle-ground between Chaos and Order ; and have wandered by the shores of the Tiber to the temple of Vesta , the holiest tabernacle , where the eternal fire was cherished and the Palladium preserved . Their beauty and majesty are astonishing ; a dreamy , visionary beauty , which the imagination moulds almost at will when seen by the uncertain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
