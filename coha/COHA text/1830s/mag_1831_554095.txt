txt Before proceeding to examine this work , we wish to say a few words upon the department of literature to which it belongs ; and in which the French language is far richer than that of any other nation . It is pleasant enough to step occasionally behind the curtain , and to see the operation of the moving forces , by which the great enginery of the world is kept in action ; and we are enabled to do this , in a considerable degree , by the record of their own lives and characters , which men of political and literary eminence have sometimes bequeathed to us . In thts way , the dark passages of history are illustrated , and valuable materials provided for those whose vocation it may be to write it hereafter ; the state of society and manners at particular periods is more clearly revealed to us ; and , what though less important , is certainly not less interesting , portraits of the wise and eminent are drawn , not as history paints them , in their robes of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It is almost superfluous to say , how much more exact and satisfactory would be our knowledge of the state of society and manners in former times , if the business of writing memoirs had been fashionable at an early period ; or how much light would have been shed upon various portions of English history , if the actors in its eventful scenes had less frequently left to others the task of recording their most remarkable achievements . We are aware , that many of the great Generals of England have been thought to resemble Cresar more in a military , than in a literary point of view ; but the real cause of this deficiency , is probably to be traced more directly to the fact , that this species of literature does not seem to be in all respects adapted to English taste . The French , on the contraiy , have excelled in it , in consequence of some peculiar traits of character . Their memoirs are written with all the ease and freedom of conversation ; while in England , not only no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of another , without resorting to all the grave dignity of historical narration . This propensity is particularly obvious in English biography , which is too often // deficient in what should constitute its principal attraction , familiar details of a personal and private nature . The life of Pitt , for example , is a solemn history of the age ; and there are many other works , to which a similar objection may be made , but to which we need not here refer . it is not improbable , that some have been prevented from writing their own memoirs , by an apprehension of being liable to the charge of vanity . This was the ground , upon which the really interesting and valuable memoirs of Burnet were assailed by the merciless ridicule of Swift ; nor was the accusation in that instance , wholly unfounded ; but the example of Dr. Franklin may serve to show , that it is very possible for a man to write his own memoirs , without being considered unreasonably vain . A few years since , one of the distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own adventures , thought it expedient to avoid too frequent a use of the first personal pronoun , and spoke of himself under the style of our General ; ' a descriptive phrase , which though better on the whole than that of our hero , ' is far less eligible than the mode adopted by C*sar and Napoleon . In the French writers , we find no such excessive delicacy . They remind us rather of one of their countrymen , who never spoke of himself , without taking off his hat . They are firmly persuaded , that whatever relates to themselves must be interesting , and seldom fail to render it so ; and their literature has iii consequence been enriched with a series of memoirs , many of which are inter*sting , and some of permanent and real value . It may be proper , however , to remark , that some deduction must not unfrequently be made from the credit accorded to most of them , owing to the prejudices of their writers , who have been sometimes tempted , if not wholly to pervert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful coloring . The Memoirs of Madame de Genus form no exception to the remarks , which we have just offered in regard to this class of works in general . Several of the first volumes are extremely interesting ; but we are bound in candor to acknowledge , that some of the last present as melancholy specimens of prosing , as the imagination can easily conceive . The ninth consists principally of a collection of anecdotes , which seem to be inserted in it simply to refresh the memory , as very many of them are taken without the alteration of a word or letter , from the preceding volumes ; while the tenth and last has been reserved as a receptacle for all the fragments , with which the // world had not been previously favored . Although Madame de Genlis does not belong precisely to the first class of writers , she , nevertheless , filled for a long time a considerable space in the public eye ; and her recent death , at a very advanced age , affords a fit occasion for a cursory notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we shall add a few extracts from the volumes before us . Madame de Genlis was born , January 21,1746 , at Champc*ri , a small village of Burgundy ; and on the very same day , the opening flower had nearly been unkindly crushed . The Bailli of the place called to offer his congratulations to her father upon the joyful occasion , and was proceeding to install his portly person in the chair , on which her infant ladyship was laid . Nothing but the sudden and vigorous interposition of the nurse could have averted the impending danger , and preserved more than a hundred volumes from being irretrievably blotted from the circle of French literature . If any doubt existed in regard to the early developement of her talent and beauty , her own emphatic testimony upon the subject has set the question at rest . At the age of seven , she was placed under the care of a governess of sixteen , who was at all events to instruct her in music , and in the next place to improve her mind by giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the learned father was soon laid aside , by joint agreement , for the more edifying instruction of Scuderi 's romances , and the dramas of Mademoiselle Barbier . Before she was taught to write , she began to extemporise romantic stories ; which , owing to her deficiency in that important requisite , are lost to the world . About the same time her mother composed a comic opera , in which the young lady was called upon to play the part of Cupid , and personated the character with so much success , and so entirely to her own satisfaction , that , notwithstanding the lapse of seventy years , she has given us a description of her dress in it , with all the professional accuracy of the Petit Courier des Dames . For some time she wore this dress habitually , but at last exchanged it for that which custom has appropriated to the other sex ; to the use of which she attributes the perfection of her gait , aud the ease and freedom of her manner . During a whole year , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in each day , very often eight or nine , and occasionally from ten to twelve , in playing upon the harp ; her favorite instrument , and one , upon which she appears to have performed with unusual grace and skill . // We have given these details , not with the design of casting ridicule or censure on Madame de Genlis , but Th order to present some idea of what female education must have been among the higher classes in France for some years prior to the revolution . It appears to have*7been conducted according to the principle dogmatically asserted by one of Shakspeare 5 clowns , that beauty is the work of art , and that reading and writing come by nature . In fact , the condition and character of the nobility of France , when the storm at length swept over them , were not wholly unlike those of the ancient world , when it was overwhelmed by the deluge . The want of morality and virtue was poorly supplied by a gorgeous veil of exterior decorum ; which , though it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecrated , instead of removing the evil of vice , by investing it with unnatural attractions . There was much of that dignified loyalty , that generous and lofty courtesy , that proud and chivalrous sense of honor , so splendidly portrayed by the inspired eloquence of Burke ; but there was also a sad alloy of baser qualities , of open frivolity and ill-concealed vice , which checks the sympathy we naturally feel , when the exalted are brought down to the dust . Still so powerful was the influence of this society upon the imagination and the heart , that we see Madame de Genlis , amidst all her high , and doubtless sincere professions of religious zeal , stating , apparently without the least perception of their impropriety , circumstances to which a person of real delicacy would scarcely incline to allude ; and we find her , also , at the period of her subsequent misfortunes , looking back to it with the same feeling , with which the exiled Hebrew remembered the Holy City , as he wandered in a strange land . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sufficient force of character to withstand and overcome that influence to such a degree , as to acquire and preserve a taste for literary pursuits , and an active industry , to which she owes all her reputation . The beauty and talent of Madame de Genlis , together with her taste for music , which was developed in her earliest infancy , had procured for her a welcome reception in the most brilliant circles of Paris ; and to these titles to success in society , was added that of a connexion with the family of Orleans . She was the niece of Madame de Montesson , who became the wife of the Duke of Orleans , by a marriage , which was denominated secret , because , though known to all the world , it was not // acknowledged at court . The intercourse between the aunt and niece does not appear to have been remarkably cordial . Both had literary pretensions . Those of the former were not supported by much taste or talent but she made ample amends for this deficiency by the strength of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless hatred of her younger rival ; who was on her side not slow to requite the obligation by an exposition , more triumphant than charitable , of the system of tactics by which her aunt induced the Duke of Orleans to espouse her , in opposition to his judgment and inclinations . Indeed , this litigious propensity *1ppears to have taken deep root in the family of our author . A bitter controversy was carried on for a long time between her mother and grandmother , which was terminated only by the death of the latter . When Madame de Genlis was about fifteen , she received the offer of the heart and rent-roll of the Baron D'Andlau , a veteran spark of sixty , whose suit was supported by the interest of her mother ; but as she testified some reluctance in accepting the proposal , her mother , in order to set in a strong light the folly of her conduct , married him herself . About this time one of her letters fell accidentally into the possession of the Count de Genlis ; whose admiration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair writer , and who espoused her for her style , as the learned ladies in Moliere embraced the pedant of the play for the love of Greek . He was an officer of reputation , and of a noble family . The immediate effect of her marriage was to extend her circle of amusements among the relatives of her husband ; and she has given a lively account of one , to which , so far as we are informed , the married ladies of this country are not much addicted . One evening at ten , she went with her brother into a little village adjoining Genlis , where they amused themselves with beating against the windows of the ale-houses , and calling for spirit ; taking due care to effect a retreat before the publican could reply in person to his vexatious customers . This charming jest was several times repeated in the course of the evening , and always with complete success . Happy age , ' she remarks , in which pleasure is so cheaply purchased , when nothing exalts the imagination , or disturbs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at this time afforded her , by the opportunity which she enjoyed of becoming familiarly acquainted with distinguished literary // men ; but it may be proper here to remark , that her judgments in regard to most of them , are strongly affected by her prejudices . Like another French personage of some note , whenever she differs in opinion from others , or maintains a quarrel , she is invariably in the right . Her hostility to the philosophers was uniform and unrelenting ; and though some have thought fit to ascribe it to the treatment which her works received from them , we see no reason why it should not be attributed , in part at least , to her natural aversion to their principles . Whatever may have been its cause , it was at all events too indiscriminate , and carried to an unreasonable extent . She had previously seen and disliked d'Alembert ; and her prejudice was now ripened into utter aversion . She describes him as mean in his person , and disagreeable in manner ; and by way of illustrating his kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreboding apprehensions of affection , he composed a funeral eulogy upon his intimate friend Madame Geoffrin , during her last illness , in order to have it in a state of preparation for the press at the very instant of her death . His attachment to Madame de Genlis , such as it was , was considerably impaired by an occurrence , which we think might reasonably justify the wrath of a philosopher . M. de Sauvigny , it seems , had regularly sent to her all the academic eulogies of d'Alembert . One day he presented her with one to which the name of the author was not attached , but with which she was so much gratified , that she despatched a note to d'Alembert , expressing her satisfaction in animated terms , and informing him , that she considered it by far the best of all his discourses . Unluckily the eulogy was the production of Condorcet ; and d'Alembert , as may be supposed , was rather offended than otherwise by her compliment . The following extract describes her interview with another distinguished personage . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of her husband to present to her the actor Preville , in the character of Rousseau ; and shortly afterwards the philosopher himself was announced . Expecting , of course , ' says Madame de Genlis , to see Preville only , it was with some difficulty that I promised to do my best to entertain J. J. Rousseau . I waited impatiently for his entrance , believing that nothing could be more truly comic than Crispin in the guise of a philosopher . My spirits were so extravagant , that M. de Genlis , knowing my natural timidity , was lost in astonishment . It was impossible for him to imagine how the expectation VOL. xxxll. - No. 70. 26 // of receiving so grave a personage , should produce so strange an effect ; and he thought me wholly beside myself , when he saw me laugh as Rousseau entered the room . Nothing could be more agreeable than his appearance , though , to me , it was a mere masquerade . His coat , his claret-colored stockings , his little round periwig , in short , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkably well-acted comic scene . With great effort , I preserved a sober countenance , and , after stammering a few complimentary phra es , sat down . Fortunately for me , the conversation took a lively turn . I said nothing , but laughed occasionally with so much heartiness , that Rousseau himself appeared disposed to share my mirth . He said many pleasant things upon the subject of youth in general . I thought Preville very intelligent , but it appeared to me , that Rousseau in his place , would have been offended with me . He then addressed himself to me ; and being perfectly free from embarrassment , I uttered every thing that came uppermost in my mind . He thought me very original , while I , on the other hand , considered him the best actor I had ever seen . I was never pleased with caricatures ; and what gratified me in this instance , was the nature and simplicity of the comedian , who appeared to me to be far greater than I had ever thought him on the stage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-humored . I played on the harp for him , and sung some of the airs of the Devin du Village ; while Rousseau listened with the air of satisfaction , which the simplicity of childhood usually inspires . On taking leave , he promised to return and dine with us the next day . Nothing could have given me greater pleasure , and I accompanied him to the door , with all the pretty compliments imaginable . When he was fairly gone , I laid aside all restraint , and laughed outright ; M. de Genlis all the while regarding me with a grave and uneasy expression , which by no means tended to diminish my mirth . " Now you are angry , * ' said I , " because you did not succeed in deceiving me ; but how could you think me simple enough to mistake Preville for Rousseau ? " " Preville ! " " Oh deny it , if you will ; I am very easily convinced . " " Are you insane ? " " Preville , I acknowledge , is charming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a very agreeable old gentleman , and not of Rousseau , who would have been provoked by my reception of him . " At these words , M. de Sauvigny and M. de Genlis laughed so immoderately , that I began to be surprised in my turn ; and my confusion may be imagined when I ascertained , that it was Rousseau himself whom I had been entertaining in this agreeable way . ' The ncquaintance , thus commenced , was soon interrupted . M. de Genlis offered Rousseau some Sillery wine , of which he // consented to receive two bottles . M. de Genus had the hardihood to send him two dozen ; and the affront was so flagrant , that Rousseau never entirely forgave it . His friendship for Madame de Genus , which lasted a few days longer , was at length broken off by an occuirence of about equal importance . One evening he agreed to accompany her to the theatre , on condition tl ) at the party should occupy a private box . When they had taken their places , Rousseau insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally desirous of closing it to gratify him . In the mean time , the attention of the audience was attracted towards him , and he accused her forthwith of making a spectacle of him , like a wild beast at a fair ; while she on the other hand insisted , that he thrust his head forward repeatedly with the express purpose of being seen , and was offended because the recognition was not followed by applause . At any rate , he took his leave in transports of wrath ; and Madame de Genus , with no great reason , piques herself upon the steadiness with which she afterwards resisted his efforts to effect a reconciliation . Her whole account of this singular personage reminds the reader very strongly of that given hy St. Pierre . Shortly after her marriage , Madame de Genlis , at the desire of the family of Orleans , took up her residence at the Palais Royal . To this step , which she ever afterwards regarded as a fatal error , she often alludes as the cause of all her subsequent misfortunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice the domestic tranquillity to which she imagined herself so strongly attached ; though the prospect of a brilliant provision for her husband and children was not wholly without its influence . Her beauty and talent had made her known in the highest circles ; and she could not readily consent to relinquish the hope of a more complete triumph in the midst of a dazzling and luxurious court . Experience had not yet taught her , that the bright sunshine has little power to calm the agitated waves ; that human nature , in every situation , is still the same ; and she appears to have been surprised to discover , that any dark and relentless passions could find entrance into such a paradise as this . She complains that cold and malicious looks were fixed upon her ; that her actions were ridiculed and misconstrued . The truth undoubtedly was , that she set a high estimate upon her own pretensions , and soon found , that the claims of others interfered with hers . The descent was very direct // and easy from jealousy to envy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Madame de Genlis was repining at the illiberality of the ladies by whom she was surrounded , she was herself possessed , perhaps unconsciously , by the same unfortunate spirit . The gentlemen vied with each other in offering her their homage ; but all this availed her nothing , so long as she was the object of female aversion . Her spirits were broken , and her health impaired . During one of the journeys , which her physician directed her to take , she paid a visit to Voltaire at Ferney . We give a portion of her account of her dining at his residence . We took our seats at the table , but M. de Voltaire was far from being agreeable . He appeared to be in a constant passion with his servants ; crying out to them with a tone of voice so loud and shrill , that I several times involuntarily started from my chair . I had been previously apprised of this habit , which is not very common elsewhere in the presence of strangers ; but it was easy to perceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave no indications of surprise or alarm . After dinner , M. de Voltaire , knowing my fondness for music , called upon Madame Denis to play upon the harpsichord . Her style of performance reminded inc of the age of Louis XIV ; but it could not be numbered among the most agreeable associations with that delightful period . She had just completed a piece of Rameau , when a pretty little girl of seven or eight entered the room , and ran to embrace M. de Voltaire , calling him Papa . He returned her caresses with infinite grace ; and seeing that I contemplated the scene with pleasure , told me , that the little girl was a great grand daughter of the great Corneille , on whose mother he had bestowed a marriage portion . How would this have affected me , if I had not called to mind those commentaries , in which injustice and envy are so awkwardly betrayed ! In fact , I was every moment wounded by strange contrasts , and my admiration was constantly checked , and even destroyed , by odious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received several visiters from Geneva , he proposed to us a drive in his carriage . The horses were brought , and he , his niece , Madame de St. Julien , and myselg took our seats in the berline . He carried us into the village , for the purpose of showing us the houses he had erected , and some benevolent institutions which he had founded . Here he appears far greater than in his writings ; for the effects of an intelligent liberality are every where visible , and one finds it difficult to believe that the same hand which has recorded so much impiety , wickedness and falsehood , has done so much that is noble , judicious // and useful . It was his custom to show this village to strangers , and to speak of it plainly , hut without the slightest affectationto explain every thing which he had accomplished , without any appearance of vanity . There is scarcely any other person of whom the same remark could be made . When we returned , the conversation upon what we had seen became very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. de Voltaire urged me to remain to dine the next day ; but I was anxious to return to Geneva . All the portraits and busts of Voltaire resemble him strongly ; but no artist has done full justice to his eyes . I expected to find them brilliant and full of fire ; and they were in fact the finest I had ever seen ; but they had at the same time a softness of expression , which it is impossible to describe ; the soul of Zaire shone through them . This charming expression was entirely destroyed by his very malicious laugh and smile . He was quite infirm , and his gothic movements made him appear older than he really was ; his voice was sepulchral , and the more strange in its tone , as , though by no means deaf , he had a habit of raising it to a very high pitch . When his conversation did not turn upon religion , or his personal enemies , it was simple and unpretending , and his talent did not fail to render it delightful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not endure to hear another express an opinion different from his own ; the slightest contradiction made the tone of his voice very angry and piercing . ' We come now to a period in the life of Madame de Genlis , in which she presents herself in a more interesting point of view ; in wl ) ich she conducted herself with a disinterestedness and assiduity , which indicated a high sense of duty , and a devoted zeal in the discharge of it ; and to which some recent events have imparted an interest , which it did not previously possess . At about the age of thirty , she yielded to the earnest request of the Duke of Chartres , better known afterwards as the Duke of Orleans , and during the revolution , by the name of Egalit* , that she should retire from the world , and employ herself in the education of his children . His three sons , as well as a daughter , were confided to her care ; and she assumed , in consequence , the rather unusual title of gouverneur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Duke of Valois . At the death of his grandfather , which occurred shortly afterwards , he became Duke of Chartres , and after the execution of his father , Duke of Orleans ; a title which he has very lately exchanged for that of King of the French . The second was the Duke of Montpensier , and the third , the Count of Beaujolais . The youngest bore the name of Mademoiscile // d ' Orleans , which she still retains . Madame de Genus , as we have already remarked , devoted herself to the task of educating these children with untiring industry and zeal ; and probably contributed , in no small degree , to form the character of the present King . It may be agreeable to our readers , to know the opinion which she appears to have entertained of him at an early age . This morning I received a touching letter from the Duke of Chartres , which I shall preserve as a precious memorial of him . The following passage is faithfully copied from it : " I will res*gn all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , until April , 1790 , in order to devote my money to benevolent purposes . On the first day of every month , we will agree upon the objects , to which it may most advantageously be applied . I beg you to accept my most sacred honor as a pledge for this . I should prefer that my plan may be known to ourselves only ; but you well know , that I do not now , nor ever shall , keep any thing secret from you . " The character of the Duke of Chartres is greatly improved , particularly within the past year . He was naturally well disposed ; and he has become intelligent and virtuous . He has nothing of the frivolity usually found in children of the same age ; and he despises the airs , the dress , the jewels and ornaments , of which the young are commonly so fond . He has no attachment to money , is very disinterested , despises luxury , and his disposition is very noble ; in short , like his brothers and sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of reflection , will become the source of every other valuable quality . ' The sole superintendence of the education of her pupils , together with the invention of gymnastic exercises , and new methods of instruction , gave hardly sufficient employment to the active industry of Madame de Genlis . In addition to this , she prepared for their amusement and benefit her Th6dtre d'Education , . Idde et Thiodore , and Veilbies du Clidteau , the last of which is familiarly known in this country by the name of Tales of the Castle . These were the first productions , by which she acquired reputation es an author . But the work which excited by far the most general interest , was one which she published at this time upon the subject of religion , considered as the basis of happiness and true philosophy . The sensation created by its appearance was very great . It was a subject of no small surprise to see any good ' coming out of the Palais Royal ; but when the first sentiment of astonishment // was over , this ill-fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . it was denounced by the stern theologians as deficient in orthodoxy ; the fashionable world , not usually the most competent judges in matters of this sort , agreed unanimously , that Madame de Genlis had mistaken her vocaticn ; some went so far as to accuse her of an unpardonable violation of the principles of her own book , in having pillaged all that was valuable in it from another writer ; and the philosophers , whom she regarded from this time forth as her bitter enemies , assailed her with a pitiless torrent of ridicule and slander . Some of her sex would have been a little startled by this commotion among the elements ; but Madame de Genlis was not so easily daunted . To the fashionable world , and the theologians , she discreetly refrained from making any reply ; but she henceforth made war upon the philosophers with a degi ee of vigor , which would have been praiseworthy in proportion to its fierceness , if she had not assigned charity rather too low a rank in the scale of her religious graces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genlis has been sometimes accused of having exulted in its progress ; a charge against which she has labored very zealously to defend herself . Whether the accusation was well founded or otherwise , is a question of very little moment ; but it is hardly credible that it could have been true to any considerable extent . Like many others , whose insight into political mysteries was far deeper than hers , she may have regarded its beginning as the dawning of a golden age , destined to realize the dreams of which sages had predicted and poets sting ; and never thought of looking in the calm and clear sky for the ominous signs of that tremendous hurricane , which swept over the land with a fury and desolation unparalleled before in the history of man . Her delusion , if it existed , was but of short duration . It could hardly have continued , when her husband had perished upon the scaffold , and she was herself wandering in poverty and exile . Alarmed by the threatening aspect of the times , she went with the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year before , and where she had an opportunity of renewing her acquaintance with many illustrious persons , of whom it is sufficient to name Fox and Burke , to show , that her reputation had gone before her . But the Duke of Orleans , who had already attached himself to the Jacobin party , soon // sent orders for the return of his daughter . They returned only to enter upon a new scene of peril . The horrihle mnassacres of September , 1792 , had just taken place . The daughter of the Duke of Orleans , hy a recent decree , was included in the class of emigres , not having returned at the time prescribed in the decree ; and Madame de Genlis , to secure the safety of both , accompanied her to Tournay , in Belgium , at that time a neutral country . This city was occupied by the army of Dumouriez ; hut the approach of the Austrians induced the exiles to retire into Switzerland , where the influence of General Montesquieu at length procured them an asylum in the Convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her pupil , who left her in order to take refuge with her aunt , the Princess of Conti . For many years from this time , the history of the House of Orleans has all the interest of romance . That of the present King is too well known to require repetition ; hut we will for a moment advert to the fortunes and fate of his two brothers , with which it was , most honorably to himself , connected . They were imprisoned for a considerable time at Marseilles , and occasionally treated with great severity , as appears from a narrative of their sufferings since published by tile Duke of Montpensier , the elder of the two . It was afterwards proposed by the Directory to release them , on condition that they , with their elder brother , should depart from Europe . The proposition was instantly accepted ; and the Duke of Orleans took passage for Philadelphia , where he was soon afterwards joined by his brothers . They lived together for some time in this country , in a state of comparative obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they made several efforts to rejoin her there , without success . They then went to England , where the Duke of Montpensier died , in 1807 , after a lingering illness , at the age of thirty-two . The health of the Count de Beaujolais was also declining , and he was carried hy his brother to the milder climate of Malta , in the hope of obtaining relief ; but the progress of his disease was so rapid , that he died a few days after his arrival . Their sister , in the mean time , had not been without her portion of misfortune . After many vicissitudes , she returned to France in 1815 , where hercharacter is said to fulfil all the promise of her infancy . Soon after their separation , Madame de Genlis quitted Switzerland , and went to Altona , where she remained several months . The King of // Prussia , deeming her political principles much too liberal for his dominions , courteously drove her away from Berlin ; while the Directory considered them by far too monarchical for the meridian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remained until the accession of a less benighted monarch permitted her to fix her residence again at Berlin . It is certainly very honorable to her , that during the greater part of the period of her exile , she was enabled to rely for subsistence almost wholly on the productions of her inexhaustible pen . Her account of this portion of her life , although upon the whole somewhat tedious , is not destitute of interesting details . While residing at Hamburgh , she received a visit from Klopstock , of which she gives the following account . There are certain persons , who are entirely insupportable , when you first encounter them . Their object is not to become acquainted with you , but to give you an exalted impression of their own knowledge and abilities . I shall not soon forget my first interview with the famous author of the Messiah , which took place while I was residing at Hamburgh , in the house of a clergyman , M. Volters . He had requested permission to visit me , and came while I was sitting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man hobbling into the room , I rose and conducted him to an arm-chair , in which he seated himself without saying a word ; he then crossed his legs , fixed himself comfortably in his chair , and assumed the air of one , who intends to maintain his post for a considerable time . At last , in a very shrill tone , he proposed this singular question ; " Which , in your opinion , Madame , is the best prose.writer , Voltaire or Buffon ? " This commencement of a thesis , rather than a conversation , almost petrified me ; but Klopstock , who was much more anxious to explain his own opinion , than to ascertain mine , did not wait for a reply . " For my part , " he resumed , " I give the preference to Voltaire , for several reasons ; in the first place , because He then stated at least a dozen reasons , in a pretty long harangue ; and proceeded to speak of his residence at Dresden , and in Denmark , of the attentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation which some emigrant had made of his Messiah . During his whole visit , which lasted about three hours , I did not utter six syllables ; but he went away very well satisfied with my conversation , and remarked the same evening to a friend , that he found me very agreeable . My reputation was surely purchased at a very cheap rate . ' We feel tempted , also , to give an extract of a letter written // by Talleyrand at Philadelphia , to Madame de ( *enIis . It is plain to us , that Mr. Moore must have borrowed his Oh ! had we some bright little isle of our own , ' from the first part of it ; while the latter part appears to illustrate the talent , which that single-he:irted personage is reputed to possess in high perfection , of using the gift of speech to conceal his thoughts . Separated as I am from all those in whom my heart is interested , I am now engrossed by the idea of that which may enable me to return to them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enable me to live with them apart from the rest of the world , where , with a few friends , we may create a little world of our own , free from all the folly and evil that now besets our unhappy Europe . My disposition is unchanged ; I am no more fond of violence or hatred , than in former times . My thoughts no longer dwell upon my enemies ; I am laboring to repair my fortune , with all the assiduity which the purpose to which I intend to apply it can inspire ; and in this occupation , my imagination finds a sentiment of pleasure as well as hope . If my efforts should be rewarded by success , I shall consider the years thus spent as the most useful of my life ; I shall count myself among the small number of the fortunate . This is a country where honest men may prosper , but by no means so well as rogues , who have naturally many advantages . It was once my intention to write you upon the subject of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an absurd one . I reserve my observations for the conversations which I hope to have with you in long evenings to come . America is very like all other countries ; there are some leading facts , the knowledge of which will enable you to understand it , as well as the cabinet of Copenhagen can do . You know what its form of government is ; you know that it has vast tracts of land , where a freehold may be purchased at an infinitely lower price than in Europe . You know that the country is new , and destitute of capital , but abounding in enterprise ; without manufactures , because the price of labor is , and will be for a long time very high . Combine these facts , and you have a better idea of America than most travellers ; better even than M. de L. , who sits by me making notes , asking for papers , and who is a thousand times more curious than the inquisitive traveller of Sterne . ' It has already been remarked , that the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were severely criticised ; and she found , or at least deemed it // necessary to enter into a formal justification of them . Whatever they may have been , she did not hesitate to avail herself of the permission given her to return to France , after the tottering despotism of the Directory had been overthrown by Bonaparte . It was the ambition of that remarkable person , to withdraw the eyes of men from the iron rigor of his military power , by fixing them upon the dazzling brilliancy of a new Augustan age . He labored , therefore , to collect around hi:n all those who had the discretion to devote themselves to scientific or literary pursuits , without entering the forbidden field of politics . There was , perhaps , some reason for excepting Madame de Sta*l from his act of general amnesty ; for , as he correctly observed , her literature and her conversation were both political ; and even her flattery wounded him , because it pointed to a moral greatness , to which he never permitted himself to aspire . She appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinmingled with a sort of apprehension , which was exhibited in rather a singular way . We are assured , upon high authority , that the conqueror of Austerlitz and Jena , the arbiter of the fate of nations , 1 ) ublished a most bitter critique in the Moniteur , upon Madame de Sta*l 's Corinne . In Madame de Genus , there was little of that perilous force of mind and character , which despotic authority has no small cause to fear . She had , moreover , the advantage of being in some degree connected with the old regime ; the style and manners of which Bonaparte attempted to reproduce , as the old gilded coach of the Lord Mayor is paraded to adorn a city pageant . She was not unwilling to burn a little politic incense before him ; and his gratitude furnished her with . the substantial recompense of a lodging at the arsenal and a peusion . It was his custom to require those about him to communicate to him , at stated l ) eriods , their opinions upon various subjects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they provided him with the means of receiving information , which , if not always valuable , was probably sometimes of a description , which a less restricted press would have communicated in a more disagreeable way . It became the duty of Madame de Genlis to write every fifteen days upon the subjects of politics , finance , literature , morals , or such others , as she might select for herself . With laudable discretion , she avoided the subject of politics altogether ; and confined her attention to that of literature and morals , particularly the last , with a zeal , which , if not always strictly according to knowledge , was at // least so earnest , that , as she herself observes , if the Emperor failed to become devout , it was no fault of hers . We are inclined to fear , however , from a specimen of this correspondence which she has given us , that the information which she gave the Emperor was not always of a perfectly authentic character . She assured him , among other things , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Protestants ; and that the clergy of that faith in Holland and Germany were all of them Deists . But she had the unimpeachable testimony of Talleyrand for believing , that the Emperor found her letters very charming . Being thus placed entirely at her ease in a political point of view , Madame de Genlis had abundant leisure for a controversy , in which she became involved with the projectors of a work , entitled Universal Biography , to which she was invited to become a contributor . She consented on condition that the contributions of certain individuals , whom she regarded as infidels , should be excluded ; but her demand was not complied with , and she published the articles which she had already written , in a separate volume . A fierce war of pamphlets followed ; until Madame de Genlis , fatigued with a contest in which there was less honor in victory than disgrace in defeat , was fain to forsake the field . Madame de Genlis appears to have exulted in the return of the Bourbons , without much reason , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went only once to Court after their restoration , and as far as we are informed , was not regarded by them with unusual favor . It is said , however , that the family of Orleans were not unmindful of their early obligations . From this period , she lived in a state of comparative obscurity ; but her passion for writing was hardly mitigated by the growing infirmities of age ; and the memoirs before us are in some degree remarkable as the production of her eightieth year . We do not propose to enter upon a critical examination of this or any of her other works ; few of which have ever acquired much popularity in this country , or will be extensively read hereafter . They belong in general to a class , the interest of which is apt to be fleeting , and which seldom attain to a high and permanent rank in the literature of any nation . Her talent as a writer was not very early developed ; but the zeal with which she prosecuted the work made ample amends for any uncommon delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , she published not less than a hundred volumes . If they are deficient in some of the most essential requisites of romantic narrative , in profound knowledge of the heart , in skill to paint its stormy passions , and in fertility and power of invention , they are universally admitted to possess the rare merit of a rich and beautiful style . It is an involuntary tribute to her real desert , that her critics are not agreed in determining which of her various productions is the best . Some of them have selected the TIt&amp;itre d'Education , as the one by which she will continue to be known ; while others are surprised , that any person should hesitate to prefer . Mademoiselle de Clermont and Jliladame de la Valliire . It is amusing , and not uninstructive , to observe in the personal character of Madame de Genus , the manner in which the most contradictory qualities may be mingled in strong and almost ludicrous contrast . She intermits her usual philippics against Voltaire , to praise him for his exemplar*r modesty in speaking of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosopher , however accommodating , would have found it iiost difficult to bestow on her in return ; for it must be admitted , that what plain-spoken men would call vanity , stands but too conspicuously in the van of her many accomplishments . She entertained a deep , and doubtless a sincere aversion for the impious and profane ; yet she dwelt with complacency on the delicate ingenuity of a few miserable verses , in which she was herself compared to the Creator of the Universe , beholding the work of his hands , and pronouncing it good . She inveighed against superstition with edifying seriousness ; while she attributed all the misfoitunes of her life to the neglect of a celestial vision , imparted to her during a severe illness . These inconsistencies , and others of a similar kind , may probably be found in greater or less degree , in the character and conduct of all ; but they are not often acknowledged so freely , without the slightest apparent consciousness of their existence . It is but just , however , to confess , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-denial , which must have tasked , to the uttermost , the energies of a fashionable lady ; particularly of one so sensitive as Madame de Genus , upon the subject of personal beauty . We are inclined to doubt , whether the critical talent of Madame de Genlis could have been of a very exalted order . Of the romances of Scott , she takes occasion to declare , that // they are wholly destitute of imagination , real interest , and fine writing , and are on the whole , very tedious . Her sentence upon the works of Lord Byron is hardly less severe . With respect to her contemporaries in general , she appears to have acted on the principle of one of Sheridan 's characters , that it would be a pity to 5J ) Oil a quarrel , which was a very pretty one as it was , by any sort of explanation . We regret to see her , besides depreciating the excellence of Joseph Chenier 's literary works , accuse him of having suffered his unfortunate brother to perish upon the scaffold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign of terror , he might have rescued him from destruction . We believe , on the contrary , that so far from having it in his power to avert his brother 's fate , it was with dilliculty that he preserved his own life , during the multiplied perils of that dreadful period . She tells us , on the authority of Chastellux , that it was the custom of Madame Necker , by way of i ) reparatioll for dinner , to make copious notes beforehand of the conversation which she proposed to carry on with her guests  --  a practice not unlike that of the Abbe Raynal , who is said to have carried constantly with him a huge volume of anecdotes , for the purpose of discharging an apposite one tmpromptu , at the first convenient opportunity . This lady , she remarks , was a philosopher , or in oi*er words an unbeliever , without being conscious of the fact . All this is not very flattering ; but her daughter Madame de Sta*l , does not escape so easily . Her productions are criticised with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the revie*v is concluded with the solemn decision , that they are deficient in that superiority of style , which alone could render them immortal . Not less severe is her estimate of tile merits of the interesting Madame de Cottin , who is accused of having pillaged her best things from tile works of her accuser . In fact , Madame de Genlis appears to have regarded most of her contemporary writers as a lawless horde , whom she was bound , to tIle extent of her abilities , to denounce and exterminate . We have had occasion to advert , with some degree of freedomn , to the faults as well as foibles of the author of tile Memoirs before us ; but it should not he forgotten , that we are indebted to her own candor , in a great degree , for the knowledge of them ; and we are bound in justice to remark , that she exhibited at the same time , some iligh qualities of mind , and estimable traits of character . She was for many years , very // popular as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidiousness in the selection of its favorites ; and if the form of romantic narrative , in which she excelled , has given place to others of a more exalted nature , it is some praise to have succeeded in a department of literature , in which none but the highest abilities could have attempted a reform . in her disposition , there was much of disinterestedness and magnanimity , and a readiness to make large sacrifices for the welfare of others , or to a sense of duty , which are certainly the indication of no ignoble spirit ; and there was combined with these qualities , an earnestness in the cause of religion , which , if sometimes misguided by the prejudices arising from her education and position in society , was yet inspired by correct and honorable principle . The closing period of her life appears to have been as tranquil , as its meridian was disastrous . She died at the moment , when a new and most momentous chapter was about to be added to her country 's eventful history ; at the very opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil has been destined to play a most conspicuous part ; and when , as she might have felt without affectation , her own character and principles were to be vindicated by the excellence of his.
