My heart rejoices to see thee in the wigwam of the chief , who ere the setting of the sun will claim thee for his bride . And see , my people share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee homage on this happy day . Oulita . Oulita True , all around looks joyful , and yet Oulita 's heart is sad . Tam . Tammany What means my child ? Oulita . Oulita I know not . I should be happy , very happy ; yet there 's a weight upon my heart which tells me that the sun will not go down as brightly as it rose . Tam . Tammany The hatchet has been buried long and deep , but if Lenape dares to slight my child  --  Oulita . Oulita He slight Oulita ? He is all love , all care , and is concerned if the hot wind too rudely passes over me . Lenape slight me ? Even now he encounters the hazard of the chase to procure some offering for me . Oh , with him all will be sunshine , but still I have forebodings . Manta , the Sanhiccan chief  --  Tam . Tammany What of him ? Speak . Oulita . Oulita Yesterday , at evening , I went beyond the village alone to meet Lenape returning from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manta crossed my path . He spoke of love ; his voice was fierce ; his eyes were inflamed , and his features distorted with passion . He wooed me as the panther wooes the fawn . I fled , but he pursued and soon overtook me . He grasped me rudely and cried , " Thou'rt mine at last . " I shrieked and struggled . " It is in vain , " he said , " your fate is fixed , and if you will not consent , then by force you must become the Sanhiccan 's bride . " He hurried me away towards the river . I was nearly dead with fright , when the sound of a horn recalled my bewildered senses , and Lenape and the hunters suddenly appeared . I shrieked aloud . The Sanhiccan fled to his canoe and left me trembling as the dove that had escaped the talons of the eagle . Even the presence of Lenape could not quiet my fears . Tam . Tammany And must a father hear of this outrage and not revenge ! Oulita . Oulita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be provoked , for our people are peaceful and prefer the pleasures of the chase and the quiet village to bloodshed and desolation . Tam . Tammany We have indeed been stricken by the Mengwe and our warlike name is gone . They laugh at us and call us women . Hark ! A horn is sounded . Music . Enter Lenape followed by his Hunters bearing the spoils of the chase , which they lay at the feet of Oulita Len . Lenape Princess , behold the spoils I bring thee . Our hunters are laden with deer and the soft-furred beaver . But Lenape scorned such prey . I watched for the mighty buffalo and shaggy bear . My club felled them to the ground and I tore their skins from their backs . The fierce carcajou had wound himself around the tree ready to dart upon the hunters ; but the hunter 's eyes were not closed and the carcajou quivered on the point of my spear . I heard the wolf howl as he looked at the moon , and the beams that fell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter . I marked where the panther couched , and before he could spring , my arrow went into his heart . Behold the spoils the Shakamaxon brings thee . Oulita . Oulita Thou art a mighty hunter , and even Oulita has not escaped thee . Len . Lenape Welcome , mighty chief , to the village of the Shakamaxon . Your people are welcome , too , and let general joy prevail that Lenape may see all partake of his happiness . Hunter , bear in the spoils of the chase ; let our sports begin to make our brothers welcome . Exeunt Lenape and Tammany Oulita . Oulit a Alone O Lenape , the redman can not boast thy equal ! Thou'rt brave as the goaded buffalo , yet gentle as the fawn . The mountain stag scarcely exceeds thee in swiftness , and even the timid doe is less light and beautiful . Song I will sit and twine the red feathers of the flamingo with the flowers of the valley into a chaplet to bind the temples of beloved Lenape . During the last verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Oneida comes silently ashore . Music Oneida . Oneida Aside Ha , there she sits alone . Manta , she shall yet be thine . Could I but decoy her to the canoe , I might escape with the prize in safety . But how ? Something to excite her sympathy . I have it . Music . Takes berries from a tree and squeezes them over his breast to imitate blood , then thrusts an arrow through part of his garment , and shrieking as if suddenly wounded , falls at the feet of Oulita , who starts up in alarm Oulita . Oulita Ah , who has done this ? Oneida . Oneida I know not . Help or I bleed to death . Oulita . Oulita I am alone . What shall I do ? I 'll fly and call for help . Oneida . Oneida Stay  --  I die ! In the canoe you will find herbs to staunch the blood . Support me to it . She assists him to rise and leads him toward the canoe . When near it , he seizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She shrieks and breaks from him . Lenape rushes in , preserves her , and kills Oneida . Tammany and Indians rush on as he falls dead . Tableau formed Tam . Tammany Oneida , the brother of the Sanhiccan ! Scene 2 : A grove on the Jersey shore . Enter Manta and an Indian . Manta . Manta Not yet returned ? Then he has failed and my hateful rival triumphs . Ha , proud Oulita , the happy bride of the peaceful Shakamaxon , while Manta and his love are scorned ! They may despise the Sanhiccan 's love , but let them beware how they brave the Sanhiccan 's hate . Enter an Indian What tidings from Oneida ? Indian . Indian Bloody . Manta . Manta Has he failed in his attempt ? Indian . Indian Yes , mighty chief , has failed and has been killed . Manta . Manta Aresqui , hear thou this , and forget Manta when he forgets it . Killed ! My kinsman killed ! And by the coward Shakamaxon who would fly from the rage of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a death . But speak . Who among them had the courage to spill Sanhiccan blood ? Indian . Indian Lenape , the chief . Manta . Manta Then I shall be revenged , for his blood must answer it , and Oulita shall yet be mine . Go , announce this insult to the warriors , and bid them produce the bloody hatchet , and prepare to demand their victim . Indian . Indian The Sanhiccan scents blood in the air . Hark ! They have already heard it , and see they come prepared . Enter Indians in procession , preceded by a Chief bearing a red hatchet Chorus Aresqui ! Aresqui ! Lo , for vengeance we prepare ! Snakes adorn each painted head , While the cheek of flaming red , Gives the eye its ghastly glare . Aresqui ! Aresqui ! Exeunt in procession Scene 3 : The Shakamaxon village , the same as Scene 1 . Chorus of Indian Girls and Hunters . Ceremony of the marriage of Lenape and Oulita , after which Tammany and others come forward . Tam . Tammany The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of his age is happy with him she loves . My children , be the blessing of the Great Spirit on you . Lenape , my hut is now deserted , and the innocent fawn has fled to the wigwam of the Shakamaxon ; guard it with the care that I have watched over it . Len . Lenape When I fail in this duty , may the bow of Lenape fail in the forest when the fierce panther is about to spring upon him . May game fly from our hunting grounds and famine overtake the hunter . May the fierce spirits of the warlike Allegwi arise and chase again , like famished wolves the timid deer , the peaceful Shakamaxon , when I cease to hover over the dove of the wilderness . Tam . Tammany Enough , thy words are as a song of joy in the ears of Tammany . Music . A dance , during which several canoes pass the back . Before the dance has terminated , chorus is heard from behind . Indians break off their sports abruptly , then enter the Sanhiccan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing the following chorus Aresqui ! Aresqui ! Thy sons their victim now demand . To the stake we now prepare . Mark the victim 's wild despair , While we ply the flaming brand . Aresqui ! Aresqui ! Manta . Manta The blood of the Sanhiccan cries aloud from the earth for vengeance and will not be appeased until the blood of the murderer be shed . We are here to demand the victim . Oulita . Oulita O Lenape ! Falls on his neck Manta . Manta What are the tortures of the stake compared to a sight like that ? In the arms of my rival  --  vengeance , vengeance ! Chief of the Shakamaxon , behold this symbol . Holding out the hatchet War or the murderer ! The Shakamaxons . The Shakamaxons War ! War ! War ! Manta .

Lenape Lenape hears the fierce voice of Manta , but he has heard the howl of the carcajou and the panther without trembling . Lenape has lived for the Shakamaxon , and Lenape will die for his people . Behold the murderer of the Sanhiccan . Seize him , for he is ready to endure your tortures . They advance to seize him . Oulita interposes Oulita . Ou lita Hold ! Tammany ! Tam . Tammany Stand back and listen to the voice of Tammany . His voice has never yet been heard in your councils but for the red man 's good . Blood has been shed and you claim a victim to appease the angry Spirit . Blood ye shall have , for blood is your due . Tammany will die at the stake to save his tribe and children . Len . and Oulita . Lenape and Oulita My father ! Tam . Tammany Peace , my children ; the will of Tammany has never been opposed through life , for there was always wisdom in his will . Then shall it be opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live ? Listen . I yield but a few years of life , perhaps of pain , that my children may live long and happy . Speak . Has the early wisdom of Tammany forsaken him in his age ? Manta . Manta Asid e Beyond my hopes . Tammany dead , and who among the red men equals Manta ? His wisdom has crossed the Sanhiccan 's path and turned away his councils  --  but that is past . To the stake . Hark ! The angry spirit of Oneida is impatient for blood . Oulita . Oulita My father ! I will die with my father ! Len . Lenape Sanhiccan , this must not be . Lenape claims his right to die ! Tam . Tammany Hushed be the voice of folly . Die ? Lenape die ? Look there and talk of dying . Points at Oulita Back I say . Nay , then ; Shakamaxon , seize your chief . They hold Lenape It is the last command of Tammany . Now lead to the stake , and you will find the old chief as inflexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stake , and having bound him to it , sing the death song . As they are about to commence the execution , a ship appears at a distance . The Indians start and gaze at it with astonishment . Music . The ship gradually approaches until it arrives in front , when William Penn and his followers descend from it . The curtain drops ACT II . Scene 1 : Inside of a hut . William Penn discovered seated at a table with writing implements before him . Secretary Charles at another table examining papers . Penn . William Penn This is indeed a chosen land of productive soil , the climate of genial and healthful temperature , cut off from the vices of the Old World and the influences of political and religious intolerance which have become so onerous as to more than counterbalance the advantages derived from the social compact . Here an empire may be formed and governed by principles best calculated to secure the happiness of man . An empire may be ? Must be formed and will go on and flourish until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the perfectibility of government . Here the poet 's dream of Arcadian happiness will at some future period be realized . Here man will walk forth in the majesty of his nature and feel in all its force the startling truth that all men are born free and equal . But this is no more than a dream ; still it is a delightful and refreshing dream , though I may not live to see it realized . Charles , have any of the messengers yet returned who were sent to the distant Indian chiefs inviting them to attend the council ? Sec . Secretary Charles Several , and many chiefs and their people have already arrived at this village . Penn . William Penn This glorious land must be released from ignorance and idolatry of the heathen , and the light of reason and the true religion be dispensed over it . It must be released but not by rapine and cruelty , bloodshed , and injustice . Better that it should remain as it is than work good by wicked means . The soil is the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be equitably obtained and not by violent measures , for if the foundation be laid in rigid justice , the fabric thereon erected will last forever . But if we commence America in injustice , there can be no certainty as to the result . Sec . Secretary Charles You have been extremely fortunate in obtaining the entire confidence of the natives . Penn . William Penn They already hail me as Miquon , the conqueror of hearts . They are a peaceful and harmless people and prone to civilization , though the remains of a once formidable race , overcome by a fierce tribe , called the Allegwi . Hark , is not that a knock ? Open the door . Enter Lenape dejected Len . Lenape Miquon , the red man 's friend , the conqueror of hearts , Lenape , the Shakamaxon , has sought thee in his sorrow , for there is no other comforter within the reach of the strong gaze of the wild hunter . Penn . William Penn What would the Shakamaxon have of the red man 's friend ? Len . Lenape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he would speak against the red man 's laws and the red man 's justice . Shame would tie the tongue of Lenape before he would speak to the Indian , whose mind is as dark and bewildered as his native forest ; but Miquon comes from the world beyond the great waters where the sun arises , and his mind must be light as noonday . Penn . William Penn Speak without disguise . Len . Lenape Lenape would not stain his name with disgrace . He would rather die than a spot should be on it , rather live in torture than that his people should be ashamed of him ; but he abides by the voice of him who has crossed the great waters to make the red man wise and happy . Miquon beheld the aged Tammany , the life and wisdom of our councils , tied to the stake , ready for the torture , and then saved him from it . Blood has been shed ; that blood still calls for vengeance , and Tammany is again about to suffer . Penn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce Sanhiccans . Len . Lenape Miquon knows not yet the cunning of the red man  --  he saw only the flower and not the serpent that crawled beneath it . Our laws call for blood , and even Tammany will uphold the red man 's law , though he is himself the victim . I have offered my life , but the Sanhiccan scoffs at the life of Lenape  --  else my voice had been silent as the stars at midnight that see all yet speak not . Still , the old man must not die by torture of the Sanhiccan . Penn . William Penn He shall not if the voice of Miquon has weight in your councils . Thus the custom maintains so powerful an influence over the darkened mind that the most shocking sacrifices appear in the garb of virtue . Direct me to the place of execution without loss of time . Exeunt Scene 3 : The place of execution . Time : near sunrise . Tammany , Oulita , Miami , Manta , Whiska , and other Indians discovered . Manta . Manta Tammany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great waters , and the spirit of murdered Oneida is impatient for vengeance . Prepare . The tomahawk has been sharpened and the pine knots have been gathered , and the last hour of the life of Tammany has been told . Sound the death song ! Indians . Indians Aresqui ! Aresqui ! Oulita . Oulita Hold  --  a moment longer . Why is it that Lenape comes not ? The time has past he should have been here and yet he comes not . Speak of comfort to me . Miami , will he come ? Miami . Miami The word of Lenape was never broken . Oulita . Oulita Yes , he will come . I know he will come ; if it is only to share the death of my father , he will come . Manta . Manta Look to the sun , Sanhiccans ; then turn the glaring eye upon your victim . Oulita . Oulita My father ! O my father ! Tam . Tammany Tammany dies as he has lived  --  for the red man 's law . Farewell , my child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or speak the word that can save him . You have heard the voice of Manta . Consent to become the bride of the Sanhiccan chief , and Tammany may live . Tam . Tammany Consent , and she ceases to be the daughter of Tammany . Oulita . Oulita Which way shall I turn ? Warriors , look there ! Ye are brave in battle and daring in the chase . Should such men become murderers and paint themselves with the blood of the old chieftain ? Look there ! How often have you listened to the wisdom of his talk around your council fires , and now can you dance to the death song around the fire that consumes him ? Look there ! Let the eye that now kindles with rage melt with pity . Look there ! Manta . Manta The voice of Oulita is heard by the Sanhiccan , as the passing breeze by the famished wolf when he scents blood of the wild deer . One way is left and only one . Become the bride of Manta . Oulita . Oulita Never ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aresqui ! Aresqui ! Oulita . Oulita Mercy ! On my knees  --  the child of Tammany implores thy mercy for her father . Turn not from me . Ah , there is a light kindling in thine eye ! It bids me hope . Look on me  --  hear my voice tremulous with sorrow . Horrible ! Avert thy gaze  --  the fearful fascination of the serpent is in thine eye . There is no hope  --  ' t was the glare of savage vengeance , not the beam of mercy . ' T is past . Sanhiccan , I am thine . Falls at his feet Tam . TammanyRaising her Monster , touch not thy victim . Awake , my child , thou art in the arms of thine aged father still . But hear his dying words . If thou wouldst live as thou hast lived , the child of Tammany , with the joy of thy father 's dying blessing on thee , thwart me not now . Swear that thy foot shall never enter the wigwam of the fierce  --  eyed Sanhiccan . If thou wouldst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck thyself and become the bride of him who spills my blood . Oulita . Oulita I am thy child , and while I live I will deserve that name . Tam . Tammany Waconda will watch over you . Miami , support your brother 's bride . Look on when the tortures begin and tell him how I died without a groan . Sanhiccans , this old chief is ready . They lead him to the stake . Noise without . Lenape rushes in , falls , is soon followed by Penn Penn . William Penn What is this Miquon beholds ? Tammany at the stake and the painted torturers ready to begin the horrid sacrifice ! Is this the red man 's faith  --  no sooner made than broken ? Shame to the tongue that speaks what it means not ! Ye told me that Tammany 's life should be spared , and I trusted to the red man 's word , for I thought it as firm as the rock , and I find it as light as the wind of the mountain . Aye , ye may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found ye . Chiefs and warriors , I have come from the world beyond the great waters to be the red man 's friend , but the red man regards not his words and rejects the light of Miquon . Had I deceived you as you have me , every voice would have exclaimed , " Behold the white man 's faith ! " But you have found truth in every word I have spoken , and in return ye give falsehood and deceit . I am here that light may shine in the wilderness . Speak ! Shall I return to my own land and leave you in darkness ? Chiefs and warriors , as I have never deceived you , hear my word , believe it , and tremble . Ye are about to shed human blood and imagine the offering will be acceptable to the Great Spirit . Ye know not what ye do . So far from being pleased , he weeps at your ignorance , and your cruelty calls forth his anger . Thunder Hark to his voice on the distant mountain and behold the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , as the light twig yields to the fire in your wigwam . Hear , behold , and then answer who among you will dare to brave the wrath of the Great Spirit . I see ye are abashed , and the light of reason is breaking upon you . All who repose their trust in Miquon will raise their tomahawks above their heads . All do so except Manta ' T is well . Your trust shall not be betrayed . Now let all who wish to see this barbarous custom abolished , throw down their weapons of death . They throw down their hatchets ; Penn extends his arms toward them as if asking a benediction . Manta expresses rage at being deserted and , fixing his eyes on Penn , raises his tomahawk in a threatening attitude . Scene closes Scene 4 : Inside of a wigwam . Enter Sailors carrying chests and after them Hickory Oldboy and Timothy Twist . Old . Hickory Oldboy Verily , friend Timothy , the ways of this people call forth my admiration ; they are passing strange and wonderful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a beaver . Twist . Timothy Twist And truly , nor of any other Christian apparel , friend Hickory , and I fear I left my shopboard in Threadneedle Street to little purpose when I became a follower of William Penn to cut and fashion for the gentry here and equip them after the manner of the Old World . Old . Hickory Oldboy Yea , verily thou didst overreach thyself in thy calculation and speculation . Twist . Timothy Twist But let me tell thee , friend Oldboy , the speculation promised fair . Old . Hickory Oldboy Verily , promises are flattering and should not be relied upon . Twist . Timothy Twist And when I was informed that there was not a tailor in all these parts , I determined to pursue my  --  Old . Hickory Oldboy Vocation . And if I have any skill in divination , friend Timothy , thou wilt have the gratification of pursuing thy trade for some time without rivalry or molestation . Twist . Timothy Twist Friend Hickory , I am as ruined and as undone a tailor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable customers . Look at this paper . It is an inventory of the articles I brought out to turn an honest penny withal , but hope faileth me of finding a ready money market in this wild region . And I should not like to have promissory notes of these red gentlemen without responsible endorsers . Old . Hickory Oldboy Thou canst not be too wary in thy traffic , friend Timothy , when dealing with the heathen . But let me read over the catalogue of thy venture . One laced military coat and white satin small clothes . Hum  --  Twist . Timothy Twist A splendid article . They once belonged to a Cavalier colonel during the late troubles . The first is no wise tarnished , as he was pacific and disliked the field of battle ; and the latter were used on but one occasion , at Charles '  --  Old . Hickory Oldboy Coronation . But let us proceed . The pair of scarlet silk hose and kid slippers . Verily , the color of the hose may please the eye , but that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when worn a little they will change their complexion , doubtless . A pair of military boots and spurs . Excellent and extremely useful . A military cocked hat and feather . There thou hast hit it to admiration , and though the heathen knows not the use of the beaver , I will bargain for that cocked hat and feather with thee at a venture . Twist . Timothy Twist It is thine , friend Hickory , at prime cost , for hope faileth me . Old . Hickory Oldboy Despair not , though in selecting thy venture , thou hast not betrayed much knowledge of the state of the market . Console thyself , for well-informed merchants at times make similar blunders . But keep thy venture , friend Timothy . Twist . Timothy Twist That I shall avowedly do , for I see no prospect of disposing of it . Old . Hickory Oldboy Keep it , I say , for if the gift of prophecy is in thy friend , I foresee the time when satin small clothes , silk hose , and kid slippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the banks of the Delaware . Twist . Timothy Twist Thy sight is as sharp as my needle , friend Hickory . Old . Hickory Oldboy Yea , and my spirit grieveth within me , for though we come with the olive branch and fig tree , and other emblems of peace to found our colony , I predict that we shall one day fall into the hands of the Philistines and be succeeded by a warlike people ; therefore , friend Timothy , I say unto thee , take thy friend 's advice and keep thy military boots and spurs as a model to those who would glory in such ostentation . Twist . Timothy Twist Zounds , I should belong to the race of the patriarchs to enjoy my venture . Old . Hickory Oldboy Thou canst bequeath it to thy posterity as a rich inheritance , as the man saith in the profane book . Twist . Timothy Twist Thou art a wag , Hickory , and thy words but ill accord with the cut of thy apparel . Bobstay . Benjamin Bobstay Shouts without Ahoy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the unmusical voice of our boisterous friend , Benjamin Bobstay , the boatswain . Enter Bobstay , bearing Whiska Bob . Benjamin Bobstay Avast there , clear the deck and make room for my little dusky divinity . So  --  anchor there , my little pinnace . She revives , and opens a brace of as sparkling eyes as ever illuminated a mahogany complexion . How fares it , my little one ? Cheer up , my hearty . She starts from him and looks about in alarm Fear not . You are no longer floundering among the fishes but on dry land , where no one is disposed to harm you nor able to do it while Ben Bobstay is within hailing distance . Whiska . Whiska Goes to him Ah ! Whiska fears nothing now . The brave white man is near her . Bob . Benjamin Bobstay Blessings on her sweet pipe ; it is tenfold more musical than my whistle . Hickory puts on spectacles to view her Avast there , friend Hickory . What are you reconnoitering about ? Keep your yardarms from my rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old . Hickory Oldboy Verily , the damsel , though of a dusky hue , is passing beautiful ; and I must convert her to the true faith . Bob . Benjamin Bobstay Avast ! I have no faith in your conversion , friend Hickory , and if you attempt to meddle with my fair and lawful prize , shiver my timbers , but I will give you a broadside that will blow you out of water . Sheer off , my hearty . Old . Hickory Oldboy Be pacified . I am a non-combatant but I will raise my voice to thee in reason . Thy fair and lawful prize ? Wherefore more thine than mine ? She is , as it were , the fruits of the wilderness , and in the fruits of the wilderness we are indubitably , by the principles of justice , tenants in common . What say you , friend Timothy ? Twist . Timothy Twist Verily , thou speakest like one of the long robes . Bob . Benjamin Bobstay He speaks like an old Turk as he is , but it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to the life I have saved than he has , if so be as how my little Whiska should think so . Do you see , Mr. Oldboy , we have hauled the good ship Welcome out into the stream , and the dusky gentry are flocking about the big canoe , as they call it , with eyes and mouths open . And , do you see , a woman all the world over has a natural right to have as much curiosity as any three men ; and , do you see , little Whiska here was the first to paddle her canoe in the wake of the ship , and drawing too nigh , a rough wave overturned it and spilt her cargo . Faith , the poor little heathen was on the way to Davy 's locker when I jumped overboard , rightened her canoe , and scudded her safe to dry land again . Old . Hickory Oldboy Thou deservest commendation , friend Benjamin . Still this does not establish thy right to the damsel , and I now give thee fair notice that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engraft my affections on this scion from the wilderness . I call thee to witness that I have dealt openly , friend Timothy . Twist . Timothy Twist I will testify as much . But verily , I have viewed her in silence and feel an inward yearning towards the dark-haired damsel myself . So bear witness , both . Yea , she shall be my helpmate on the shopboard . Old . Hickory Oldboy Does the spirit move thee , too , Timothy ? Beware , lest she create as much dissension in our congregation as did the beautiful Susannah in the days of old among the elders . Bob . Benjamin Bobstay The elders ? You are old enough for that matter . Hark ye , do n't be for running your halyards athwart my hawser , or do ye see , Mr. Oldboy , we may come to a grapple ; and if we do , I shall rake you fore and aft in such sort that you will be no better than a shaky Quaker for the rest of your days . But let us drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wood pigeon . Why so sad ? Whiska . Whiska Whiska knows not . She is happy . And yet  --  feel  --  it flutters like the flamingo when wounded by the spear of the Sarbacan . Bob . Benjamin Bobstay Kisses her Pretty simplicity . And now , how does it feel ? Whiska . Whiska Ah ! your lips draw my breath after them , and  --  feel  --  it leaps as if it would jump out of my mouth . Old . Hickory Oldboy Damsel , permit me to feel , too . Timothy , be quiet . Nay , friend Benjamin , I am initiate in the sciences , and it would rejoice me much to instruct this unsophisticated creature in the mysteries of natural philosophy . Twist . Timothy Twist And verily , it would gladden my heart to aid in the good work . Bob . Benjamin Bobstay Avast , you lubbers ! Enough of your flummery . Have you heard that William Penn has called a council of the lords of the soil here , and that messengers have been dispatched to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sage council , my hearties . Penn is the man to work his way with the red man . A fair speech from him will do more than the swords of an army . They have already christened him by the name of Miquon , the meaning of which is beyond my soundings ; but it must mean something very great in their lingo , for they all look uncommon wise and mysterious when they utter it . But see , here comes a squad of visitors . Ragged company , but the best the land affords . Enter several Indians of both sexes . Whiska runs to them and explains the danger she had escaped from , and that Bobstay saved her Old . Hickory Oldboy Verily , friend Timothy , here is an opportunity to dispose of some of your venture . Exhibit your merchandise , and it will be hard if you find not a purchaser in the number . Twist displays various articles  --  wearing apparel , trinkets , looking glasses . Indians delighted ; females get the glasses Twist . Timothy Twist To an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest fashion of Bond Street . Helps him on with a coat . Indian struts about .

Timothy Twist They are hose , damsel , and if thou wilt permit me , I will show thee the use of them . Should they fit , they shall be thine . Makes sign Whiska . Whiska Bad man ! Indian girl 's red cheek grows redder with shame . Old . Hickory Oldboy Hum ! Timothy , try the military boots and spurs ; they may delight her more . Art thou going it again ? Twist . Timothy Twist Thou hast the tongue of a scoffer . Turns to his goods and picks up the cocked hat and feather Old . Hickory Oldboy Hold ! A bargain is a bargain . Touch not the hat and the feather ; they are mine by purchase . Deliver them to their rightful owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his nose . Indians yell with delight and point at him There . I always knew there was much weight in a feather , and doubtless they look upon Hickory Oldboy with his cocked hat as being a much greater man than the world considers Charles Stuart in the full possession of his throne .
