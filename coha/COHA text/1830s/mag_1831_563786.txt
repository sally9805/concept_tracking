txt HEBREW POETRY . IN the earliest ages of the world , poetry was a very serious employment . It was the first form in which the contemplative powers of man manifested themselves ; arid to it may be traced , as a germ , our history , our fiction , our philosophy , and our laws . Even the solemn attributes of the Deity and the tremendous truths of religion are supposed to have been first delivered to mankind , by the inspiration *f the poet through the melody of song . The reason for this peculiarity in the history of nations must be sought for in the counsels by which God instructs his creatures . Men are slow in their movements ; they are immersed in a material body and distracted by its wants . In the earlier stages of society , life is but a struggle for subsistence ; and it must be some glaring object , some powerful motive , which allures men over the bridge which separates action from thought . Matter will attract any one 's attention , even a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrobe it of its form and color , and attempt , without its impressions , to lead the unpractised mind into the intellectual world ,  --  it must be done by new arts to excite interest . The speaker must have deep feeling ; and clothe that feeling in measured language . This is the universal history of the literary dawn ; when the object ceases to arrest the eye , it must take a new embodiment , and charm the ear . The people , who can no longer look , must make a new use of their eyes-they must be forced to weep . But though mind is sluggish in its movements , and it takes all the art of the poet to rouse it to its first attention , it must not be supposed that , when the attention is once up , it acts with any feeble interest . It takes much to make a savage pass the bounds from the world of matter to the world of intellectual forms ; but when he is once there , the very indefiniteness of the objects , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he feels an interest which he never felt before ; he rises as to a new creation , and surrenders himself to the guidance of the genius , under whose manuduction he was first led. 13 // It has often been inquired , why poetry and orations have lost so much of their interest ; and why the best exertions of modern skill never rise to that powerful despotism in ancient times , which no man resisted or wished to resist . Surely the moderns have some advantages . Arts have been improved ; knowledge has been increased ; the passions have been analyzed ; the fountains of the mind have been explored . Why should not equal genius with more materials produce better success ? The reason , however , is obvious . The power of a poet over his admirers , or of an orator over his audience , is to be estimated by a ratio between his genius and their sensibility . The percussion and the object struck must both be considered . In older times , the lack of knowledge and the consequent want of refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience ; every impression was fresh and new ; every passion was incited by novelty , and prolonged , because the feelings of nature were unworn ; every invention produced wonder ; the rapture of the audience increased the inspiration of the speaker ; there was a reciprocal influence ; genius was warmed by its own effects ; and the same powerful impulse which first forced the mind into the paradise which thought had made , gave sweetness to its flowers , and magnitude and beauty to its shades . Ingenuity , *nd invention , melody , and voice , and action , may still exist ; but the sensibility which increased them is lost forever . These remarks might be suggested by speculation , but they are abundantly supported by the history of our race . Let us suppose the wandering story-teller and singer , whom , for the want of a more personal name , we call Homer , to be surrounded by a ring of barbarians , who , having no war on their hands and their bellies full , require him to amuse them for an idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority he but just emerges above them ; and indeed his very superiority consists in knowing how to act on such materials . He knows well that he must stir their passions and draw their tears , or they will hear him with stupid indifference ; indeed , the choice in such an audience is between rapture and sleep . He begins with a prelude on the lyre- .. Hro&amp; V po*qti*wi dve6d ) *ero xaldv dgt7etr ' . And thus fills their ears with unideal sounds . The wisdom of God seems to have made music as a kind of passage between sensuality and thinking . He then plunges into narrative ; sings of wars ; addresses the strongest propensities of the age ; brings out ( or rather , it breaks upon him ) his moral instructions , as an accompaniment of the story ; and thus forces his hearers to feel and think in the only way in which feeling and thinking in such an age can be excited . There is no great art in all this ; or , at least , it is an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the circumstances in which he is thrown . He teaches , to be sure , war , politics , navigation , the theology of heaven , and the sciences of earth ; not because he designed to combine these various things , but because they naturally mingled in the only intellectual stream that was then running . His language is simple , because no other language could be understood ; his figures are bold and striking , because he must strike the minds he addresses ; his poetry is forcible , because no other would excite interest ; and it has all the freshness of // nature , because the book of nature is the only volume he has ever read . Thus the poet becomes excellent ; and thus the earliest rhapsodies of all nations reflect not so much the genius of the individual as a picture of the age . The Jews were a peculiar people ; and their poetry is as peculiar . It was made the vehicle of teaching them the most awful truths ; because , when God speaks to men , he uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable to the mind from which it originated ; but its garb must be as humble as the minds to which it is addressed . In speaking , however , of the poetry of the Hebrews , we shall say nothing of that Supreme Mind from which it is believed to have origmated ; we shall not assume , as the ground of our remarks , the inspiration of the scriptures . We believe , with Lowth and others , that , however infallible the oracles which the Hebrew prophet delivered , and in whatever way we explain the Divine superintendence which guided their thoughts , each author was left to the play of his own genius , and reflects the manners of his own nation and age . We leave to the divines the sublime themes of theology ; we shall consider Hebrew poetry as an effort of Hebrew genius ; and we shall endeavor to compare its relative merits with the poetry of the west . The waters of the Hellespont , except a few Greeks on the shores of Asia Minor , have always divided a people very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to the enterprise , the liberty , the hardihood of the Greeks , and the tyranny and effeminacy of the Asiatic nations . These are the effects of the relative states of empires ; and the first Cyrus , who founded the Persian dynasty , was as great a warrior as Alexander , who conquered the last of his degenerate successors ; he , perhaps , commanded an army of equal heroes . The permanent difference is in their literary tastes . On the eastern side of the Hellespont , we find hereditary dogmas never disputed ; a fixed philosophy ; great authority and great credulity ; morality taught in apologues , sentences and aphorisms ; and in poetry the wildest flights of enthusiasm , rapid transitions , bold personifications ; the very language destitute of those particles , ( the last invention of acuteness , ) which mark the slender shades and turnings of a finer mind . On the western side we find all these things reversed . Whatever may have been the cause , whether it was , as Diodorus says , because their philosophers taught for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , such was the bent of nature , they questioned every thing ; supported their discourses by proofs and not by authority ; gave us their systems in connected discourses , and even in poetry taught us to reason while they compelled us to feel . The European nations have inherited the taste of the Greeks ; their language is formed on the basis of the Greek tongue ; and had it not been that the Bible , by being translated , has preserved among us some elements of orientalism , we should this day scarcely be capable of holding intercourse with more than half our race . The most literal translations would only throw darkness over the most beautiful page . The Hebrew nation have for ages been remarkable for any thing rather than delicacy or refinement . We can not conceive of a race of bipeds , more coarse , more callous , more boobyish , more trifling , than the whole race of Jewish literati , into whose hands the scriptures have // fallen . The Bible , with its native commentators around it , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you pass over the blazing sand beneath the burning sun , before you reach the grateful shades and the bubbling spring . But because this peculiar nation have shriv .. elled in captivity , we must not suppose that they were destitute of genius when they flourished is their glory . We might as well take a degenerate Roman as he was described by the Goths , as a semblance of Cicero , as to judge of an ancient Jew by one of the Masorites . The minds of most men sink to the level of the estimation in which they are held . The despised man becomes despicable ; the slave assumes a servile mind . Judea was once the seat of empire and glory . She had her city , her king , and her temple . She had all that expansive power which the mind feels when left to an open career . Her sons mounted up on wings like eagles ; they ran and were not weary , they walked and were not faint . Then the architect labored , the warrior triumphed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in refinement , one excellence no one can deny her bards ; and that is-they are always idiomatic ; they have qualities and beauties preeminently their own . No man can have read the Prophets with attention , without observing that one of their chief charms is-they are exquisitely oriental . They write with a mode of thought , and a mode of connecting their thoughts , and with allusions , wholly impossible but to one placed on the spot . If a reader approaches the Hebrew poets with a standard fhrmed in modern times , he will be greatly disappointed . Much has been said of the beauties of the Bible ; nor are we aware that its beauties have been overrated . But loosely declaiming on the beauties of the Bible , some fond critics have laid a snare for the reader 's dissent . The Bible is beautiful like most other primitive books in its own peculiar style of beauty . It has those very beauties which a nascent age produces , and of which its sacred subjects are susceptible . It can not combine those artful images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sympathise with the voluptuary at his bowls , or the warrior on the field of battle ; it can not introduce the lover pouring out vows to his mistress ; nor surround the trifles of life with the mythology of gods or fairies . It can not address our imagination on the inflammable side of passion , or lead us through descriptions which pamper the heart . All these ends the awful severity of its subjects refuses . But its beauties are the fruits of its theme . They are flowers of its own soil . They are implements to impress its own lessons . They are pictures of the age , and the men , and the subject . Passing from such a writer as Thomas Moore , for example , to the Bible , there is an amazing contrast ; and the reader who has melted at the tawdry sentimentalism of the Irish bard , ( not without his beauties , we confess , ) would at first be shocked at the stern simplicity of Ezekiel or Isaiah . But has the Bible therefore no beauties ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colossal statue have the coloring of a miniature picture ? It was no more to be expected that the Bible should have these modern manners , than that the Jordan or the Euphrates should reflect the trees or the shrubbery on the banks of the Ohio or the Tweed . One of the pleasures of poetry is the skill and facility with which the author overcomes certain difficulties which the rules of the art im // pose upon him . It is not copying nature , or painting the passions solely , which gives us delight ; but it is the adrQitness with which these things are done , though the work was hampered by certain laws . In certain kinds of verse this is the chief pleasure . It is peculiarly so in the Spenserian stanza , and in the sonnet ; and in those artful involutions and balanced periods which some writers use . For example , in these lines in Pope 's Windsor Forest , which he has copied from OvidNot half so swift the trembling doves can fly , When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When through the clouds he drives the trembling doves . In this case , we admire not only the smooth versification and the beautiful image , but the art with which the poet has involved his eagles and doves in the melodious illustration . The above is not , perhaps , the highest beauty ; it lacks simplicity and is perfectly Ovidian . Nevertheless , in the simplest poetry of Cowper and Milton , there is a secret reference to the difficulties overcome ; and we never should admire nature or passion in poetry , ( for these may exist in prose , ) were there not a secret reference to the skill of the poet . In easy poetry , we admire that the bard can be so easy under so many restraints . At first view , it might be supposed that there was very little of this beauty among the Hebrew bards . Nothing can be more simple than the structure of their sentences ; they have neither measure nor rhyme . They have only to pour out their rhapsodies ; to communicate their feelings , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McPherson , who has passed for Ossian , - per audaces nova dithyrambos Verba devolvit , numerisque fertur Lege solutis . They may have the praise of simplicity , but can not aspire to the victories of art ; and yet I hope to show that a conquest over difficulties is one of the chief beauties of their admirable odes . The Hebrew is one of the most material languages ever spoken . There is hardly an abstract term in its whole vocabulary . In its entire formation it seems to be made by a people who are as far from spiritual ideas as we can possibly conceive . It has no tenses , ( those which have been called past and future are certainly aorists , ) no scientific or scholastic terms ; no particles to express the nicest transitions of thought , very few adjectives , very few intellectual expressions of any kind . Almost all its words which express mental operations are material in their origin . Let us mention a few instances without the formality of quoting the original . The word to judge comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe of primitive hunters , who having run down and taken a deer , appoint one of the wisest of their number to cause it to be cut up in equal portions ; and thus comes the idea of judging . The word to mourn comes from the withering of a plant . The first man who hung down his head in sorrow , was likened to a plant blasted by the sun and failing for want of water . These instances might be multiplied ; but they are sufficient to show that the language was formed in very early times ; it bears all the marks of the poverty and simplicity of a primitive age . It is well worthy of being // studied as a beautiful specimen of the infant efforts of men at expression and thought . It completely transfers you to the ancient world , and associates you with the intellectual habits of these ' primitive beings . Its Lexicon is a magazine of material forms , and you might look in vain for such terms as decorum , grace , legislation , magnanimity , or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Clerc in relating the dogmas of the Pharisees shows that they could not believe in the fate of the stoics , because there was no word in their language , even in that late age , which could express that notion . Such was their speech  --  a tongue which seemed to be formed by beings immersed in the material world . Yet when we pass to their themes , we find them the most vast and intellectual that can possibly meet the human mind . When they engage in their subjects , they seem to leave sublunary nature behind them ; and soar into the darkest regions of the closest thought . They describe not battles and cities ; but the conflicts of mind ; the agonies of conscience ; the mysterious intercourse of man with his Maker . They paint the sorrows of repentance ; the hopes of faith , and the windings and snares through which the errant soul returns to God . They are everywhere like painters with the pencil put into their hands , and compelled to draw only allegorical forms . They must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes . They are not to dwell on the Sweet interchange Of hill and valley , rivers , woods and plains , Now land , now sea , and shores with forest crowned , Rocks , dens and caves . They are to transcribe only the moral landscape-they speak to the inner man . They sometimes pass the flaming bounds of space and time , and deal with the mysterious essence of the Deity ; and all this with a language which seems at first view entirely inadequate to the object . It is impossible to conceive of a greater contrast than the materialism of the Hebrew language , and the unembodied and exalted nature of their favorite themes . This then was their difficulty ; and they have conquered it nobly . This contrast was a far greater obstacle to a Hebrew bard than the Hexameter verse was to the heroic poets among the Greeks . The critics have been in raptures at the invention of Homer ; and all must allow that he has rolled through every melodious note in his own beautiful language ; and laid a contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theme . But every one must see that he had previous facilities prepared at hand . He collected his flowers in a garden ; while the Hebrew poets collected them from a wilderness . What a rich language did- he inherit ! What charming expressions ! Every word a picture ! He was indebted to those prior geniuses , who had invented these expressions ; and thus prepared the field in which his mind was to play in its own unbounded luxuriance . We must take something from the glory of Homer , and divide it with those perished names , which , like unseen roots , nourished the tree on which this Bird of the Muses sat and sung . He could hang his apples of gold in a net-work of silver ; while the Hebrew bards were obliged to provide not only the song , but the lyre and its strings . By the learned reader who appreciates their language , the strains must be read with perfect astonishment . // Let us take an example . I have already remarked that their last .. guage had very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. lutely necessary to describe the character of the Deity . What would a modern theologian do , if he were compelled to discourse on God without using the words omnipotence , omniscience and omnipresence ? These seem to be absolutely necessary to communicate our simplest conceptions of the Great Jehovah . Yet not one of these words can be translated into Hebrew . There is not a term in that restricted Ian .. guage which answers to these essential ideas . The truth is , an infant people never abstract ; and when they first approach these mighty conceptions , they approach them by circumlocution . Let us see how completely the royal poet manages to communicate the omnipresence of God . Whither shall I go from thy spirit ? Whither shall I flee from thy face ? If I ascend into Heaven There THouIf I make my bed in the nether world , Behold THOU . I take the wings of the east , Or I dwell in the remotest west , There thy hand shall lead me ; Thy right hand shall hold me up . Ps. cxxxix. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful and graphic poetry the omnipresence of God is brought out to the dullest conception . We must remember that the upper , the nether and the middle world , was the whole universe to a Hebrew mind. * It is true the sacred poets gather their contributions from all the stores which nature has spread out before them ; they make the exterior world an illustration of the operations of the mind ; and thus they have all the beauties of description without missing that moral dignity which mere description never can attain . I allow the powers of Thompson ; I admire that mighty genius , which , like Antreus , gathers strengih whenever it touches the earth ; and yet the reader of the Seasons feels something wanting . He feels as the spectator at the theatre would , in seeing the shifting scenes , ( most beautifully painted , ) of one of Shakspeare 's tragedies ; and none of the moral sentiments or actions with which these scenes should be filled . Let a man take one of Thompson 's best descriptions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the description is made subservient to a hi her result , and feel the difference . g As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending , while the north-wind sleeps , o'erspread Heaven 's cheerful face , the lowering element Scowls o'er the darkened landscape , snow or shower ; If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet Extend his evening beam , the fields revive , The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds Attest their joy , that hill and valley ring . Never was there a more beautiful or complete scene brought to view . Had the author 's object been mere description , itcould not have been more finished ; and yet it is only an incidental gem which he picks up // in his path without going one step out of the way to find it . He has a higher object than mere poetry ; he wishes to illustrate the dawnings of transient hope on fallen minds . We have the same dignity in the writings of the Hebrews . They make the material world play around the pedestals of those awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel , if it had been the sole object of the prophet to describe pastoral life , it could scarcely have been more beautiful . In this respect his description might rival one of the best pastorals of Thocritus . But at the same time the deepest moral beauty is spread over the whole . God is the shepherd ; and he is watching over his people . In a word , the beauties of the biblical poetry , like all the severe beauties , must be acquired by study . They are so simple , so unlike modern sentimentalism , that , when first seen , they strike the eye with disappointment . But look again and your attention will be arresteda third time and you will admire ; and once let the model impress your taste , and you will admire forever . It seems to me , for touching the deeper tones of the heart , the Hebrew poetry has an internal grandeur , compared with which the songs of mythology are cold and unmeaning .

Bvaon . THE extracts given in my last paper are sufficient to show that Lord Byron was not an Atheist , nor even a Deist , strictly speaking ; that he was truly desirous of being a Christian ; that he thought those fortunate who were so , and whose faith had never been shaken ; that he placed the only one of his two children , that was under his control , in a situation to be educated strictly in the Christian belief ; that he only doubted the immortality of the soul , and the truth of Christianity-not absolutely denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , though not a firm one , of a future life . Blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed . I shall now subjoin a few extracts , which are interesting in themselves , as well as further illustrative of the subject . At the death of Lady Noel , Lord Byron came into possession of certain estates , to which the gift of some good church livings were attached . It might be expected , that a dissolute , profane , unprincipled Deist , as Lord Byron was represented to be , would bestow these upon such of the cloth as were most assimilated in principles and inclinations to himself ; or , at least , that he would prefer those jovial , hunting , drinking parsons , of which there is no scarcity in the established church . This would seem the more probable , from the severe treatment to which he had been subjected by the more rigid of the clergy ,  --  and on account of which he really felt some resentment . On the contrary , he writes to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( after remarking " that the clergy are up against Gain , " ) " There is , // if I am not mistaken , some good church preferment on the Wentworth estates ; and I will show them what a good Christian I am , by patronizing and preferring the most pious of their order , should opportunity occur . " He undoubtedly means , not only that he will show his respect and regard to Christianity , by selecting the most pious and worthy of her priests ; but that he will also show his spirit of Christian forgiveness , by thus returning good for evil . I regret , that want of room prevents inserting here , the whole of the correspondence , &amp;c. connected with the following extract . The reader must be referred to the book itself . A very pious and interesting young married lady , Mrs. Sheppard , had seen Byron when a boy . Two years after her death , there was discovered , by her husband , among her papers , a prayer in behalf of one , not named ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is dated , " Hastings , July 31 , 1814 . " Mr. Sheppard transrnitted a copy to Lord Byron , Nov. 21,1821 , and Lord Byron , replied , in a letter from Pisa , Dec. 8 , 1821 . The prayer and the two letters are all highly interesting . Lord Byron says , " I need not say , that the extract which your letter contains has affected me ; because , it would imply a want of all feeling to have read it with indifference . " " But for whomever it was meant , I have read it with all the pleasure that can arise from so melancholy a topic . I say pleasure-because your brief and simple picture of the life and demeanor of the excellent person , whom I trust you will again meet , can not be contemplated without the admiration due to her virtues , and her pure and unpretending piety . Her last moments were particularly striking ; and I do not know , that , in the course of reading the story of mankind , and still less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any thing so unostentatiously beautiful . Indisputably , the firm believers of the Gospel have a great advantage over all others , for this simple reason , that , if true , they will have their reward hereafter ; and if there be no hereafter , they can but be with the infidel in his eternal sleep , having had the assistance of an eternal hope , through life , without subsequent disappointment , since ( at the worst for them ) out of nothing , nothing can arise , ' not even sorrow . But a man 's creed does not depend upon himself ; who can say , I will believe this , that , or the other ? and , least of all , that which he can least comprehend . " " I can assure you , that all the fame , which ever cheated humanity into higher notions of its own importance , would never weigh in my mind , against the pure and pious interest which a virtuous being may be pleased to take in my welfare . " Mr. Moore very justly remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " however romantic , in the eyes of the cold and wordly , the piety of this young person may appear , it were to be wished , that the truly Christian feeling , which dictated her prayer , were more common among all who profess the same creed ; and that those indications of a better nature , so visible even through the clouds of his character , which induced this innocent young woman to pray for Byron while living , could have the effect of inspiring others with more charity towards his memory , now that he is dead . " Of his feelings , on the death of his daughter Allegra , Madame Guiccioli gives the following masterly picture . 15 // " On the occasion also of the death of his natural daughter , I saw in his grief the excess of paternal tenderness . His conduct towards this child was always that of a fond father ; but no one would have guessed , from his expressions , that he felt this affection for her . He was dreadfully agitated by the first intelligence of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was obliged to fulfil the melancholy task of communicating it to him . The memory of that terrific moment is stamped indelibly on my mind . For several evenings he had not left his house ; I therefore went to him . His first question was relative to the courier he had despatched for tidings of his daughter , and whose delay disquieted him . After a short interval of suspense , with every caution which my own sorrow suggested , I deprived him of all hope of the child 's recovery . I understand , ' said he , it is enough - say no more . A mortal paleness spread itself over his face , his strength failed him , and he sunk into a seat . His look was fixed , and his expression such , that I began to fear for his reason . He did not shed a tear ; and his countenance manifested so hopeless , so profound , so sublime a sorrow , that at the moment , he appeare.d a being , of a nature superior to humanity . He remained immovable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation which I endeavored to afford him seemed to reach his ears , far less his heart . But enough of this sad episode , on which I can not linger , even after the lapse of so many years , without renewing in my own heart the awful wretchedness of that day . " The next day he was more tranquil , and said , It is God 's will-let us mention it no more . ' And from that day he would never pronounce her name . " To the preceding extracts from Mr. Moore 's last volume , might be added many others from Lord Byron 's poems , indicating , with sufficient clearness , what were his religious opinions , and his hopes and fears with regard to a future state of existence . The sentiments uttered in his dramatic works may be considered rather as opinions and feelings , which the author deemed appropriate to his characters , than as being those which he entertained , himself . His enemies have , with great injustice , affected to consider them as his own . In Childe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments may be considered as really those of Lord Byron . Thus , his full belief in the existence of God , the great creator of the universe , is clearly expressed in these lines from Childe Harold . " But lo the dome  --  the vast and wondrous domeWorthiest of GOD , the koly and the true . " " But let me quit man 's works . again to read His MAKER 'S , spread around me . And in the following lines , he distinctly recognizes the providen*e of God , and his punishing his rational creatures on earth . " What is the worst of woes that wait on age ? What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow ? To view each loved one blotted from life 's page , And he alone on earth , as I am now . Before the CHASTENER humbly let me bow , O'er hearts divided , and o'er hopes destroyed . " His hopes , mingled with doubts , in regard to the soul 's continuing to exist after the death of the body , are expressed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas are in strict accordance with those contained in the prose extracts , heretofore given , from his letters and journals . " Yet if , as holiest men have deemed ,  --  there be A land of souls beyond that sable shore , To shame the doctrine of the Sadducee - And sophists , madly vain of dubious lore ; How sweet it were , in concert to adore With those who made our mortal labors lightTo hear each voice we feared to hear no moreBehold each mighty shade revealed to sightThe Ilactrian , Samian sage , and all who taught the right . There thou-whose love and life , together fled , Have left me here to love and live in vainTwined with my heart ,  --  and can I deem thee dead , When busy Memory flashes on my brain ? - Well-I will dream that we may meet again , And woo the vision to my vacant breast . " The prose extracts that follow , regard more particularly the religious practice of Lord Byron ; which , after all , is the best test and commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , Lord ; and do not the things which I say ? " " Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , but he that doeth the will of my Father , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven . " " By theit fruits ye shall know them . " " Thou believest  --  the devils also believe . Shelley , the friend and companion of Lord Byron , when residing at Ravenna , says , in a letter dated August 15 , 1821 , speaking of Byron ,  --  " He lives in considerable splendor , but within his income , which is about ? 4000 a year , ? 1000 of which he devotes to purposes of charity . " Now , for a dissolute young nobleman , residing in a foreign country , with an expensive establishment of servants , &amp;c. &amp;c. to de .. vote 4500 dollars , a quarter part of an income very moderate for one of his rank and disposition , to purposes of charity , is a more faithful compliance with the spirit of the Christian precept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many a dignified prelate with the same income , to say nothing of " your even Christian " of the laity . An Italian family , with whom Lord Byron was on terms of particular intimacy , and some of whom were suspected of being concerned in certain revolutionary movements , were ordered to quit the country . Lord Byron had determined to accompany them . He thus writes from Ravenna , on this occasion , under date of July 22 , 1821 ; " What you will not be sorry to hear is , that the poor of the place , hearing that I meant to go , got together a petition to the Cardinal , to request that ke would request me to remain . " Madame Guiccioli , also , in a letter to Mrs. Moore , after describing his simple mode of life while at Ravenna , previous to his departure for Greece , thus proceeds ; " This sort of simple life he led until the fatal day of his departure for Greece ; and the few variations he made from it may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of occasions which were offered him of doing good , and from the generous actions he was constantly performing . Many families , ( in Ravenna principally , ) owed to him the few prosperous days they ever enjoyed . His arrival in that town was spoken of as a piece of public good fortune , // and his departure as a public calamity ; and this is the life which many attempted to asperse as that of a libertine. ** That he was benevolent and charitable in an eminent degree , not only to the poor of his adopted country , but also to such of his own countrymen as stood in need of assistance , notwithstanding his settled aversion to England and Englishmen , is evident from numerous passages in Mr. Moore 's book . Of his disinterested regard to justice , in his dealings and pecuniary affairs , his letters to his publisher , Mr. Murray , are sufficient proof . Of his ardent love of liberty-his noble and exalted views-his pure and lofty ambition  --  and his disregard of mercenary considerations ,  --  in the latter portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fortune and his life to the cause of Greece , will ever remain an imperishable monument . Thus far , with regard to the religious sentiments of Lord Byron . And here I wish it to be understood , that I do not attempt to defend these , or any other of his opinions . My object is , to show what these opinions actually were ; and that others , which have been unjustly imputed to him in order to fix an odium upon his character and reputation , are such as he never professed or entertained . I do not justify his faults , nor apologize for his vices . With these , a great portion of his life was but too much chequered . I desire only that he may have even-handed juStice ; that his great genius may be acknowledged ; and that his virtues may be remembered , as well as his errors and vices . Lord Byron , indeed , was deeply sensible of his errors . He was conscious that he had been led widely astray by a mind misdirected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely deplored his situation , and made firm resolves to pursue a different course . In this , if he did not wholly succeed , he made great and important progress . His situation was peculiarly unfavorable . An exile in a foreign country , alone , unfriended ; those who should have been his truest friends , and should have extended an assisting hand to raise him from the pit into which he was fallen ,  --  having coldly deserted him , or become - Ids most implacable and persecuting foes ; the strong sense of this desertion and this persecution from his former friends and countrymen constantly weighing on his mind , and lacerating his feelings ; under circumstances so adverse - as these to the amelioration of the heart , and to the formation of the best principles and motives of action , how could it be expected that so rapid and complete a change should be effected , as might have been justly anticipated under more favorable and ordinary influences ? Thus , in Childe Ha.r-. old " T is an old lesson ; time approves it true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - When all is won , that all desire to woo , The paltry prize is hardly worth the cost . Youth wasted , minds degraded , honor lost ,  - -  These are thy fruits , successful Passion , these ! ' " And thus awhile he learned to moralize ; - For meditation fixed at times on him ; And conscious Reason whispered to despise His early youth , misspent in maddest whim ; But as he gazed on truth , his aching eyes grew dim . " // Lord Byron , like most other lofty minds and proud spirits , felt himself an isolated being . In his joys and sorrows , his hopes and fears , he was too much alone ; he could not iinbosom himself to those around him , nor lean for solace and support , for encouragement and direction on any one , in whom his heart acknowledged an unshackled confidence . He was independent in his opinions ; and , right or wrong , scorned to acknowledge the supremacy of others , or to accommodate his sentiments and expressions to theirs . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of those , whose friendship and intimacy might have exercised a beneficial sway over his mind and conduct . Every noble mind , however , can not but respect this lofty independence of thought ; this refusal to truckle to the guidance of power and fashion , though at the sacrifice of his own advancement . This attribute of true genius in times characterised by fawning suppleness , is entitled to esteem even from its rarity . The following passages are strongly expressive of this spirit and its effects . " Yet oft.times , in his maddest mirthful mood , Strange pangs would flaah along Chide Harold 's brow , As if the memory of some deadly feud Or disappointed passion lurked below ; - But this none knew , or haply cared to know ; For his was not that open , artless soul , That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow ; Nor sought he friend , to counsel or condole , Whate'er his grief might be , which he could not control . " " But soon he knew himself the most unfit Of men to herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; untaught to submit His thoughts to others , though his soul was quelled In youth by his own thoughts ; still uncompelled , He would not yield dominion of his mind To spirits , against whom his own rebelled ; Proud , though in desolation ; which could find A life within itself to breathe without mankind . " " I have not loved the world , nor the world me ; I have not flattered its rank breath , nor bowed To its idolatries a patient knee , Nor coined my cheek to smiles , nor cried aloud In worship of an echo . In the crowd They could not deem me one of such ; I stood Ilmong them , but not of them : in a shroud Of thoughts which were not their thoughts ; and still could , Had I not filed my mind , which thus itself subdued . " " Fame is the thirst of youth ; but I am not So young as to regard men 's frown or smile As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot ; - I stood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance is to be made , when a lofty , original mind forms its own independent opinions , and avows them ; though some of them , from the imperfection of our nature , must necessarily be erroneous . The every day character , whose opinions are those of the nursery , or who , by studiously conforming to those which prevail among the multitude , glides smoothly onward without enmity or opposition , needs no such allowance . This seeks a cotemporary reward , such as it is , and // often obtains it . The other looks forward to posterity , or finds a gloriens recompense in the secret gratulation of his own bosom . Any further extracts from the poems of Lord Byron would extend this article beyond its proper length . I will therefore only refer the reader to a magnificent passage in Childe Harold , the 132d to the 137th stanzas of the fourth canto , where the noble poet 's sense of his wrongs , and the spirit in which he will avenge them , are boldly dashed upon the canvas with the hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 22d of January , 1788 ; and he died at Missolonghi , in Western Greece , of fever , on the 19th of April , 1824 , aged a little over thirty-six years . As a poet , his works will remain a permanent portion of British literature ; while the multitudinous productions of his cotemporary rivals and revilers , with a very few exceptions , must soon be forgotten , or only be remembered as having emasculated and corrupted the literary taste of the age . I can not better conclude this imperfect notice of Lord Byron 's opinions concerning religion , and of the unjust aspersions which have been cast upon them , and upon almost every action of his life , as well as upon every line of his poetry susceptible of misconstruction , than by quoting the closing paragraph of Mr. Moore 's interesting biography of his noble friend . " It would not ( says Mr. Moore ) be in the power , even of the most partial friend , to allege any thing more convincingLy favorable of his character than is contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - that , through life , with all his faults he never lost a friend ; - that those about him in his youth , whether as companions , teachers , or servants , remained attached to him to the last ; - that the woman , to whom he gave the love of his maturer years , idolizes his name ; and that , with a single unhappy exception , scarce an instance is to be found , of any one , once brought , however briefly , into relations of amity with him , that did not feel towards him a kind regard in life , and retain a fondness for his memory .
