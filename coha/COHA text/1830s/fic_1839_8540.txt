I saw thy pulse 's maddening play Wild send the pleasures devious way , Misted by fancies meteor ray , By passion driven . But yet the light that led astray , Was light from Heaven  --  Burns . TO CLEMANTHE . " Few love me ; " Oh ! and this from you , Who cause the few to love me less , And you refuse to love me too , And plunge the dagger in that breast , Whose crime , the deep idolatry Of hating all the world for thee ! " Not love me , " I 'd not thought that thou Such prudent watch o'er self did keep , And worship where the thousand bow . But leave the wretch alone to weep . Proud woman know the heart that 's true Will break ere it descends to sue ! Our hearts were fraught with high disdain ; But , ah ! would you have known the whole , In mercy , you would not again With bitter words have pierced my soul . That single night of sighs and tears Atoned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh ! was I deceived When thy sweet hand was clasped in mine . When ' neath thy head my bosom heaved , Say , didst thou not believe me thine ? How passing dear that hour to me  --  I felt that I was loved by thee ! For years of sorrow and suspense , That moment was the recompense ! " Not love me , "  --  like the fitful gale , In the wild waste of woods , Or as afar off shattered sail Upon the angry floods . That voice shall move my sinking heart ; Ah ! why not break it and depart ? The times that we shall meet are few ; But , since it gives thy bosom pain , Like a sick child , I 'll mourn for you , But never will return again . Farewell ; still  --  still , I 'll think of thee , Until this heart shall cease to be ! November 15th , 1839 . DRAMATIS PERSON Harrod , Sharron , Judge , Zula . Ella . Mary .

For he too was unhappy ; and ' t was said , She , whom he loved had died , or wed , or else Had gone afar , he knew not where ; but still She never passed from his remembrance : though He travelled much , yet he returned the same . In the mean time his father died , and he Became the heir of the estates I named : And not far hence he lives alone , and makes Companions of the woods , avoiding all But the unfortunate ; to them , most kind . How could I else but love him ? When mother Died , he gave me and my brother the farm On which we lived : till , bringing fruits to town . You kindly took me into your service . Pardon me , if then I do not think him , Whom you will wed , the first of men . Zula . Zula Such partiality is to be praised , Not blamed .

With your mouth you say you love me , but your Heart does give your words the lie . Zula .

Zula . Zula By Heaven you wrong me . That I love weald . so far as decency And comfort require , is most true ; and that I love honour much , is also true ; but There is an honour more high , approving Conscience and honest pride of purpose , which Bid me love you only for yourself .

Sharron alone in the open air  --  Time , approaching morn . Sharron . Sharron There is a faint smile on the Eastern sky , And buoyant freshness in the balmy air That floats from Alleghanies tops , which tell The coming of the sun , whose rays have given Wings to the dew-drops of the morn , and sent Them long in advance , to warn us of his coming ; And , like holy water , purify our hearts For the worship of that glorious material God . Ah ! not all the balmy dew can sweeten , Nor all the big tear drops of Heaven cleanse The deep pollution of this erring soul . Alas ! that pleasure such as this should be , On being such , should ever be a sin . How sweetly , ah , how swiftly , has this night Passed into the things that were  --  yet I wear The prints of guilt . I feel the leaden press Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh , which tears the heart-strings , Speaks in thunder tones of a most damning Violated conscience  --  that judge more stern Than Rhadamanthus , whom the fates forbid And dread necessity has sworn shall ne'er relent .

Such will the morrow prove on me ; and yet , I would conceal that which the world must know , For , Zula , never shalt thou change thy name To mine . And , though I love thee , and thou art The loveliest form to look upon that e'er Did shut lost man from hope of Heaven , yet Will I not wed thee ; for if thou didst yield Unto a suit enforced with so little Tenderness , in all thy maiden pride and Bashfulness : when the yoke of wedlock wears Heavily on the neck , and the thousand Cares of common place , every day life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpened voice of business , and The irritable retort and piqueing Reply , succeed the turtle notes of love , And satiety merge us in a stagnant sea ; Ah ! then wilt thou resist the reckless thirst For change , and turn a deaf ear to winning Words by some more gallant suitor breathed ? Oh , there 's stain of hot pollution on the Fairest moulds of earth-born beauty , that e'er Did counterfeit the semblance of an angel . O'er the pure cerulean deep of that eye , At times there comes a cloud of low desire , From whence the lightning glance of lust is drawn By some iron-hearted knave , who turns it to his use . Thus a prurient thirst for admiration Will ever drive the sex into mean shifts To light a flame that ever must consume them .

Sharron . Sharron Alone . Thus passion makes us slaves , And pleasure 's silken chords are turned into Coroding iron , which will not be loosed .

I have seen a Shade of melancholy recollection Tinge her radiant features , when mention Of that scene was made , and a stifled sigh Betrayed the yearning of her sinking heart , And her eye was bent on vacancy , and Her thoughts were afar , and lingered among The memories of that first romantic love . But this to me was wormwood , for she knew That I was there and ventured not to save Her life , intent to keep my own secure . But Harrod so o'ercome did note me not .

Sharron . Sharron This time , at least , I hope to prove not dull , For I have that to impart which needs must Concern you , if I may judge from rumour , And some allusions I have from yourself .

And whispering words by seraphs spoken . At such a time , when all my soul was sick With excess of imagining , I flew From the rude contact of society Which rubbed too harshly on my sickly nerves . And musing by the river 's side I dwelt In fancy 's silken tents  --  when , oh ! there came Such vision as I had not conceived , which More than realized my sweetest love  --  You know the rest , since then I 've roamed unblest .

Stripped of accustomed affluence and the ties Of blood and country all her care was merged In the love and education of her sole child . Her name is Zula , so called in token Of her birth-place , for in the woods was born This wild flower of most exquisite loveliness .

And I have tried ambition  --  for they said It was a stronger passion , and could conquer love : And some success did come of my faint efforts , And I became a portion of the thoughts Of other men : but it availed me nought , For glory was an ashen apple to the taste , Unshared by her , whose smile or frown could move Me more than worlds of praise or blame by others Given .

Thy bright rays Are shed , as of youre , upon mute and living thing : The same , as when my boyish footsteps trod The mountains , to my gladdened eyes they gleamed In varied tints , from a thousand streamlets , Which flowed from shelving rocks and mossy caves . The same as when yet more mature I sought The forest shade , to muse on nature 's works . There didst thou nurture many a wild flower By eye of men unseen , of tender frame , And beauty unequalled  --  there was the ant Providing store of food for winter 's dearth  --  The gay fly that basked in thy beams a day And died . There the liquid notes of birds thrilled The still air with tales of love : and the deer Startled not at the coming of her mate , Nor thought of man the destroyer . Vain man , To dream all nature made for thy delight ; Couldst thou live a thousand years , thou wouldst in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , and die . From the smallest Animaleales that cling to ocean rocks , Or feed on the green leaf invisible , To the roaring monarch of the forest , Or the huge elephan. , or mastodon , Whose bones , like some great city in lava Entombed , lie buried in this nature 's most Wondrous and highly favoured land , my home How knowest thou , O man of faculties Imperfect , that the most passive shell-fish . Or microscopic tenants of a leaf , Nay the leaf itself , and seeming inorganic . Lichen , and the mineral world have not A sense of being , and joy , and sorrow ? Hast thou more ? It is worse than vanity  --  ' T is madness in the extreme to claim them As thine own , and thereby argue immortality That principle which in a faithful cur Wills , and loves , and bears respect , and hatred , ' T is something distinct from matter , you grant , Yet it dies ! Can the same in man do less ? Then wherefore contend because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called meaner beings , if the part Can perish why not the whole ? Vain is such Paltry misnamed philosophy . Like them , We but fill our brief space of life , and die ! Dying , give place to new existences , Which spin out their little day of pleasure , And once more the thread of life is severed  --  The greatest good unto the greatest number done . And God not more unjust , nor yet more kind To man , than to the fatted fowl served up To enhance the pleasures of his table . But man has sinned , therefore must die  --  Yet why ? The bird also has sinned if death 's a proof of guilt . Such absurdity should breed inquiry . Sin is but the abuse of nature 's laws : Every passion and appetite known To man , is essential to his being , And conscience sits sentinel to warn us Of coming evil , that we turn and live . Just as sensation protects the body , So does conscience preserve the moral part . I thrust my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain admonish me to withdraw , Destruction would ensue . So has the mind Its own monitor , conscience : and when the Moral or mental law is violated , Remorse bids us hold  --  for preservation , Not for punishment , as fools would have it . Sin is the offspring of a morbid fancy ; There 's nought in nature to fill its meaning . To speak of future punishment then , is Most cruelly absurd . Shall he who falls Into the fire by chance , or by design , In person be forever tortured for his fall ? Why then if the thought of violated law , Ingratitude to friends , or misplaced love , Gnaw on his conscience , or like iron rust , Into his soul , shall he be damned for ever ? No ! we are framed for the most happiness , And the machinery , by design , defect , That we from earth might be alienated Ere death and cold oblivion , feared by all , Should call us to fulfil that last demand Of fate , and to give place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave , As no man knows , so let no man deny .
