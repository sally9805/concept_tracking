txt IN our last article on Europe , we dwelt particularly on the condition and prospects of Great-Britain , giving our first attention to her , on account of her past and present preponderance in the political balance . Let us look next to France , and , in comparing her power , resources , and political influence , with those of Britain , we shall see , strongly manifested , the immense importance of a wise , and , above all , an uniform and permanent system of government . Since the development of the riches and consequent influence of Great-Britain , she has not ceased for a moment to shine with a bright and steady light among the stars of the first magnitude ; except indeed for a season , that it paled before the meteor blaze of France , as she shot , comet-like , along her wild but brilliant path through glory . to ruin . The policy of England has been always selfish , sometimes cruel , hut ever uniform and prudent ; the errors of her government have seldom been long persevered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close scrutiny , and free discussion , and perfect publicity , that the people of England have been able to keep their government from falling into the egregious errors , which have been committed and obstinately adhered to by other cabinets . In France , on the contrary , there has been no such system ; the government has gone on in mal-administration , and the people never had part or lot in the matter , until the weight of evil became too heavy to be borne , and then turning on their drivers in wrath , they hurled them , with the car of state , into utter ruin . They learned not , however , wisdom from the struggle , but let others pick up the reins , and again bore the weight , until endurance became apparent folly . // With a government like that of England ( bating its abuses ) France would be the leading Continental Power ; her position , her resources , and the nationality of her people , would insure it . We say the nationality of her people , for on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern politicians would have it , on the resources of the country , and the riches of the people . Look at the power , and the extent , and the influence of France , " When the gloom of ' her glory , Arose , and o'er shadowed the earth with her name when her flag floated in triumph on every field , and the anti-chambers of the Tuilleries were filled with suppliant ambassadors from every court in Europe . Short as was her enjoyment of power and glory , the possession of it was real and undisputed ; and it requires an effort of the mind now to recall the extent of her dominion . Take a map , not of Europe , but of the world ; mark upon it all the places where French arms triumphed , and where French influence swayed , and Her flag streaming from the summit of the Pyramids startled sleeping Africa into life and into submission ; it was bearing on through Asia Minor and threatening India ; her daring eagle , perched on the Kremlin at Moscow , saw his far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while , from Rome in the south to Amsterdam in the north , every dome had borne her banner , and every capital held out to her its keys . Nor was it the mere sway of conquest ; for the superiority conquered on the field was preserved in the cabinet ; and the power and influence of France was felt in every corner of the world . One day , when the haughty ambassador of haughty Austria was announced as being in waiting at the cabinet door of the Emperor of the French , the latter carelessly answered , " Let him wait ; " and , in those three words , gave proof of the possession of more power than ever man swayed . It is a mistaken idea that France owed her conquests and her power merely to Napoleon ; for she has shown repeatedly that , when her gov ernors will throw themselves upon the nationality of her people , it may become mighty among the mighty of the earth . With no people but the French could Napoleon have effected the tenth of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found the materials at his hand , and his master-spirit worked them into a mighty engine , which he wielded with a giant strength , until he had overturned every thing before him . While Napoleon trusted to the French people , while they considered him as 1 ' Itomme , he was irresistible ; France eagerly poured forth her legions at his beck , and yet her population thinned not ; the bones of her young men were bleaching on every shore , yet their parents loved not her chief the less ; she squandered whole mines of money , yet her treasury was never empty ; and her manufactures , her agriculture , and her general interest , flourished amid the continual peal of war , and the crash of surrounding thrones . But the moment her chief left the ranks of the people , and enrolled himself among the kings of the earth , from that moment , they began to lose interest in his fate ; and when - he *vedded Austria 's imperial daunhter , he put away , not only Josephine , but his devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the adored master . The Abbe de Pradt ( whose splendid essays we would recommend , by the way , to every one who wishes to study European politics , ) says of France , under the restored Bourbons , " with a certain revenue of seven hundred millions ( Francs ) ; an increased produce of thirty millions ; just rid of her enemies ; her fields laden with rich harvests ; an abundant population ; an internal prosperity , growing with a giant 's growth ; a commerce , free to spread its sails for every corner of the globe ; and amid all these means of prosperity a perfect obedience to the laws ; citizens living in brotherly love ; the roads free from danger ; justice unimpeded in her works ; what can such a country fear ? How ridiculous to talk of danger to a crown which is surrounded by such an army , and upheld by the two branches of legislature , which are always ready to put in motion all the powers of the nation to support that throne , from whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the Abbe was mistaken , as all politicians mistake , when they measure the strength of a government , or of a country , by the amount of its riches and resources , or by the degree of its prosperity ; and the people of France , turning upon their government in their wrath , have prostrated the works of all the sovereigns of Europe , and hurled from his throne a king , who seemed upheld by foreign as well as domestic bayonets . The resources of France are immense , and the patriotism , the nationality of Frenchmen , is so sincere , that , in such times and under such excitement as that of the Republic , or under such a leader as Napoleon , or in such a cause as the revolution of July , they are capable , not only of sweeping every thing before them , but of making sacrifices and enduring sufferings before which other nations would shrink . We talk of our patriotism , and devotion to our form of government ; but methinks , if our ports were closed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of an hundred thousand men , it would not be many years , nor many months , before some would begin to cry , " Let a king , or let Satan himself rule over us , but let us be delivered from this load of taxes . " A government is strong or weak , according to the readiness of the people to give to it the sinews of war . The French people are among the most intelligent in the world , and though their boast of being at the head of civilization , is a vain one , there are many circumstances which seem to justify it . But with all their natural intelligence , with the help of that continual blaze of light which has been pouring out from Paris over her departments , her peasantry are exceedingly deficient in acquired knowledge , and far behind those of England in acquaintance with , and enjoyment of , those comforts and conveniences of life , which mark the degree of civilization of a people . There is about the Frenchman , however , of whatever class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from every other man . The Germans , the Dutch , and others , are infinitely better educated than the French ; and in Prussia , particularly , the wide diffusion of knowledge , by the means of public schools , makes the people superior to the French , as far as acquirements of mere school knowledge goes ; but then a Frenchman , with all his ignorance , // is more a man of the world , than the rest of them , and will appear the better . A German will give you a learned account of a hat ; he will tell you its name in all tongues , the origin of its use , the various modes of making it and wearing it in different countries ; yet for his life , he can not wear it gracefully on his head , or take it off without clawing it with both hands ; while the Frenchman , who only knows that his chapeau is a chapeau , handles it and wears it as an ornament , and not like the German , as a burden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance in the different character of the different nations . The French are called the politest people in the world , and justly , too ; it is not , however , that the French gentleman is more , or even so much a finished gentleman as the polished Englishman ; but it is that every Frenchman is a gentleman , and that politeness which in other countries is confined to certain classes , in France extends down to the very canaille . In France one is seldom insulted ; but even if he is , there will be dash of gentility in the manner of doing even an ungenteel thing . the French are vain , sensitive , generous , fickle , and easily acted upon by circumstances ; and the strangely opposite opinions which are held of their courage , can only be reconciled by a study of their character ; for while some , who have seen their fiery charges up to the mouths of blazing batteries , hold them to be the bravest of the brave ; others , with good opportunity of observation , greatly underrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he will not court danger for danger 's sake , nor , like the Turk , stand stubbornly still and be hacked to pieces , when lie might fly or yield . But he is easily animated ; he is full of esprit de corp ; he loves his country-her glory is his own glory ; and , when with his regiment and cheered on by a chief he loves , he will raise his hurrah , and rush heedless upon any danger . But the day is gone by when physical courage or physical force could render a nation great ; a new era has commenced , a new career is opening to greatness , and let us see what are the chances of France for success in the race . She has thirty millions of people , speaking the same tongue , professing the same religion , and all devotedly attached to her welfare and glory ; she has a rich soil , great internal resources , and a flourishing commerce . Henry IV . Louis XIV . and Napoleon have shown what she could do when properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter has been the cause of her degradation and abasement by the other nations of Europe , who can never forgive her for having made them tremble and quail before her , and will never willingly see her great and preponderant ; and , as long as the powers that be , continue to be , France must hold a secondary rank in Europe . When Napoleon fell , France sunk in the scale of importance. ; her population from forty-two millions ( the census under the empire ) was reduced to thirty ; her territory was contracted into dangerously narrow limits ; her capital was left exposed to the north-eastern frontier ; her revenue was reduced from eleven hundred millions to six hundred ; and she was loaded with a shameful tribute to pay the expenses of those armies which had conquered her . // But from 1815 to 1830 , France enjoyed uninterrupted tranquility ; her domestic industry and foreign commerce were greatly developed ; and an immense progress was made in the spread of liberal ideas . The principles of liberty and the manner of representation became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fatal ordonnances of July , the French people were in the enjoyment of as great a degree of liberty as was desirable ; they were slowly but surely gaining more and more concessions from the crown , and the best patriot could not have desired a sudden change , so certain was the final acquirement of completely free institutions . But in a rash moment Charles attempted , by an arbitrary stretch of power , to wrest back from the people the privileges they had been so long in gaining ; they resisted-he brout*ht up his armed force-this was crushed-he was exiled , and France , left without a chief , without the shadow even of authority , had free choice of her future government . There is no doubt that , at that moment , the wishes of the great majority of Frenchmen would have been for the establishment of a federative republic , had they not feared to bring down the wrath of Europe , or to raise up among themselves new Murats and Robespierres ; the remembrance of the horrors of the old revolution hi*ng , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in a situation where the wildest passions might be let loose ; and , listening to prudence rather than inclination , they decided for royalty in the person of the head of the younger branch of Bourbons . Lafayette was mainly instrumental in making this arrangement ; he had the destinies of France in his hands ; he was urged and intreated to declare for the Republic , of which he would have been proclaimed the head . The old hero hesitated-his judgement told him that it would be the safer course for France to declare for Louis Philippe , though his own heart was for a republic ; and when he had concluded that his popularity* would not suffer , he stretched out his hand , and placed the crown on the head of him who has worn it so ingloriously and so unworthily . Here was an error in judgement of which the old general has lived to be convinced , and of which he has heartily repented . He did not even obtain in Europe any credit for the patriotic and disinterested part of his motives ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ; they said , " Behold the man who has preached and fought for liberty , who has always declared himself an admirer of republican institutions , and a republican at heart , and now , at the only moment of his life when he could have made his country a republic , he turns his back on his principles , and declares for royalty . " Had Lafayette been as great as he is good , had he had but half the eye of a Napoleon , he might have foreseen the effects of the Revolution of July upon Europe ; he might have put France at the head of an irresistible torrent of public feeling , and made her the liberator and the benefactor of an enthralled Continent . Had France declared for a republic , the other powers would , or would not , have marched upon her . If they had been rash enough to * Jcfferson , that keen observer of human nature , said of Lafayette- " The m n has a perfectly cas+ue appetite for pspssiarity ; " and this appetite seems Lu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pampered , or less satiated. // have done so , there would have been a rush of half a million of Frenchmen across the frontiers , their hearts burning with the recollections of the former conquest and degradation of their country , and their nerves strung to iron with the thought of the glory to have been gained in such a cause as that of liberty , and the defence of their country . They would have been received with open arms in Belgium , in Germany , in Poland , in Hungary , and in Switzerland ; the flap of a tan-colored flag would have aroused Italy  --  the tap of a drum would have awakened Spain  --  the people of England would have cheered them on with a cry of Bravo ! and every throne of Europe would have shaken , if not fallen , before the shock of the wild torrent , which would have spread northward tow*rd the strong hold of despotism . It matters not that the army was not organized ,  --  there were the men , and the hearts , and the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheering sympathy of every people with them , and a simultaneous eruption , in every part of Europe , would have found the governments totally unprepared . But suppose the powers had not marched upon France , would she not then have had all she has now , when , after being juggled and humbugged into a sacrifice of every thing , even the national honor , for the sake of keeping the peace , she is not yet sure of it ? The great error , however , of Lafayette , was not in declaring for Louis Philippe , but in clinging so long to him . The pro6 ramme of the Hotel de Ville ought to have been followed up by a disavowal of the treaty of Vienna and its consequences ; the Rhine should have been demanded as the frontier boundary of France ; the disgraceful conditions annexed to the treaties should have been rejected ; France should have spoken boldly to the other powers ; she should have said to them , " Do thus , and thus , or I will stretch out over your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible than you have yet known . " She should not have gone to war ; no ! but she should have dictated the peace , and not have begged for it ; and she should not have permitted the storms in Belgium , and Brunswick , and Poland , and Italy , to have passed over without profiting by them . But the powers frightened her , while they were trembling themselves , and made her beg for what they hardly dared to hope she would accede to . Louis Philippe was in terror , and France , who held in her hand the destinies of Europe , was seen demeaning herself to the other powers , humbly begging pardon for having made a disturbance , and promising to keep quiet , provided they would allow her to retain the king she had selected . Lafayette then began to waver ; he could not go heart and hand with the king , yet he would not abandon him ; and , thus fluctuating , he lost his popularity with a great part of the nation , and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old hero was too much of a Frenchman to hesitate long , and he soon declared to the king , that his feelings and his principles would not allow him to give even a tacit consent to measures which were so weak , so foolish , so anti-national , and so completely opposed to the spirit of the Revolution of July ; - in his own words , he " abandoned the king . " vot. us. 4 ! // Since that time his popularity has been increasing ; his candid avowal that he had been deceived , and that he knew his error , and his recent bold opposition in the Chamber of Deputies , have won him back the love of all his old partizans ; and were it not that this returning feeling is accompanied with an idea that he is becoming superannuated , we should say that the measure of his greatness and glory is not yet full , that still higher destinies await him , and that republican France will yet proclaim him the " Chief of her choice . " As we said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave France an opportunity of resuming her stand as a leading power , and of dictating the terms of their existence to most of the other States ; and we believe this will be evident when one considers that the neutrality at least of England was certain ; that her government never would have dared to declare against the cause of liberty ; and that Russia was kept so long at bay by poor Poland , not only without any help , but even when she was so shamefully cheated and persecuted by Prussia and Austria . And who could France have feared but Russia or England ? Would Prussia have dared move a finger ? Her Rhine Provinces would have declared for France in a day , and Polish Prussia would have been made to arm in a month . Would Austria have moved ? There was Italy , and Hungary , and Gallicia , ready to secede from her , and join the cause of liberty at the first call . But the opportunity was lost ; the pusillanimous and avaricious Philippe has sacrificed every thing to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new era and for new events , before she can take the lead in European politics ; and we shall see that there is every probability of such an era soon commencing , and of such events soon occurring ; but let us first look at the internal state of France , and the strength of the present government . Never was revolution less looked for than that of July ; and the astonishment of the perpetrators of it , at their own success , could only have been equalled by that of Charles X. at finding himself shut out of the Tuilleries , or of Philippe on being ushered into it . No party was prepared for the event , and none rallied quick enough to take advantage of it . We recollect the embarrassment of General Gerard and others , when they came out with their uniforms on the third day , and joined the victorious people ; on being pressed to cry Vive la Republique , they parried it , and avoided compromising themselves by shouting , " Vive la Charte . " The cries of Vive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people caught a glimpse of the Column of the Place Vendome , or some other monument of the glory of " THE MAN . " But no one thought of Louis Philippe , and , when they finally united in his favor , it was from a prudential regard to the rest of Europe , and in the belief of a paradoxical and almost absurd doctrine of a " throne surrounded by republican institutions . " When Lafayette embraced Philippe , on the Balcony of the Hotel de Ville , and said , " Voila la meilleure des republiques , " the credulous people believed what their credulous favorite asserted . Seldom has a monarch ascended a throne under more auspicious circumstances ; seldom was one more popular , and never had one a // more glorious opportunity of wreathing his crown with imperishable laurels , than was presented to Louis Philippe . How he has neglected this opportunity , and degraded his country , and entirely lost his popularity , is evident to the observers of the state of France . By his milkand-water policy , the impulse given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely paralyzed , and that great event " Stat nominis umbra . " He is now popular with no party hut the immediate dependants on government ; and all that keeps him on the throne is the subdivision of parties , which prevents any one from gaining the ascendency . The French are fickle , and , it is supposed , delight in political changes ; but this is not the case , and the vast majority of respectable bourgeois , the class which has now the sway , are so fearful of any change that they prefer to bear the arbitrary measures of a government they dislike rather than run the risk of anarchy and confusion . The often recurring disturbances in France , arise not merely from fickleness or political discontent , for , with the exception of the last , they were without political views ; and if the Carlist party has been able to do so much to embarrass the government , was it not a certain proof of the existence of great causes of complaint ? It is ridiculous to say that continual revolts in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be causes of complaint , and grievances to redress . Let emissaries attempt to work among our population , and what would they get for their labor ? When the horizon was illuminated every night in England , by the blazing of the corn-ricks , it was attributed merely to the wickedness of the men engaged , and it was attempted to remedy the evil by dungeons , and transportations , and gibbets , without trying to remove the cause of the evil in the discontent of the people . Let a barn be burned every night in a week in the United States , and see how long it will be before the population turns out en masse , and finds the incendiaries , though they should hide with the beasts of the forests . The w*tch. word of the workmen of Lyons , when they revolted , explains the secret of most of the troubles in France ; they cried , " We will have work and live , or we will fight and die . " There is now in France a degree of misery which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all classes , from the merchant down to the porter ; and its true cause is to be found in the want of confidence in the permanence of government . The political atmosphere is filled with clouds , foreboding a storm ; the people perceive it , and though they now and then get a glimpse of blue sky , they never see their horizon clear . Consequently , no one will untie his purse-strings for mere than the supply of his immediate wants ; and the same feeling , existing in the rest of Europe , re-acts upon the foreign commerce of the country . The expenses of the government are enormously great ; the army which robs the country of several hundred thousand of its best workmen , makes it support them as drones ; the civil list is higher than under the empire even , and there are few departments where the direct taxation does not exceed eighteen per cent . on the capital . Wages are exceedingly low , and every chief town of a department has an immense number of strong , hearty men , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *i day , in order to keep them from // starving ; some towns of fifty thousand inhabitants have fifteen hundred individuals in this condition ; and these not common paupers , but men whom the pressure of the times has deprived of employment and reduced to want . Where there is great political discontent it requires but physical want to create disturbances , and it is this want which has caused them in France . Frenchmen are tired of political changes , they dread anarchy , and it is much to their credit that they have refrained from excesses when they had the power in their hands . The fact is , the people have improved more rapidly within the last twenty years than could be imagined by those who have not visited them . Compare the conduct of the mob who rushed through the magnificent gallery of the Louvre in July , and wrote on the walls , " respect awe chefs d'oeuvres d ' art , " with that of the howling mass of human brutes who brought the unfortunate Louis a prisoner into Paris , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . There is nothing like times of tumult and revolution to brighten the faculties of a nation ; for , by putting all its thinking power into intensely interesting action , it forces men to think of and learn a thousand things , about which they never would have troubled themselves in a state of peace and security . And France has been so constantly on the qui vine , for the last forty years , that her people have learned most useful lessons . The very fear , which they themselves entertain of a repetition of the horrors of the old revolution , is a good guaraiity against their recurrence ; and their rapid improvement in an understanding of the duties of electors is preparing them to perform their duty as republicans , when the course of events shall bring about the inevitable result of the present *vorkings of the European political cauldron . France is at heart republican ; every man , less than forty years of a , e , has a penchant for republicanism , and is fully convinced that , when admissible , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeNing from the earth ; and even were it possible for their chief to return from the shades , or his son to seize his mantle , he xiould find the majority of electors firmly resolved never to support a despotism like his ; they will not be yoked like horses , to draw any car , though it were the car of victory and glory . The Carlists , or Henry Fifth-ists , are few , and would be fewer still , were it not for the great divlike to Louis Philippe ; they consist , however , of the old and uninfluential , and will soon be without influence , unless put into power by a crusade of the allies against liberty . The other parties are not worth consideration , and the temporary success of either of those we have named depends upon events beyond their own control , and independent of their own efforts . There is , however , one thing which we consider inevitable  --  the final establishment of a republic in France ; and it appears to us it can be shown from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making it more and more feasible , and more and more desirable . Louis Philippe has not energy and character enough to make a manly or kin*jy resistance to the spread of liberal principles but he has held back with all his might , and never ceded any thing but through the fear of having it wrested from him . Notxvithstanding hL opposition , however , great advances have been made , arid several // severe blows have been given to the rotten old system . The abolition of the hereditary peerage is one of the most irnportan.t of these , and may be considered as preparatory to the complete annihilation of the whole peerage . We will venture to say , that in ten years the Chamber will not exist , even though the present system should continue . It is now universally understood in France , that a man can no more be born a legislator than he can be horn a lawyer or a physician ; and that itis absurd to confine the choice of legislators to any one class of men ; and the time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn as absurd in theory , can long be continued in practice . The extension of the elective franchise was another important advance , made in the siege of the strong hold of despotism ; an advance , which , while it brought the assailants nearer the point to be won , increased their ranks from eighty to two hundred thousand voters . It is only preparatory , however , to others , for Frenchmen will not long endure that a man shall pay forty dollars direct taxation , in order to be able to vote for his own representative in the Chamber of Deputies ; or that he and his neighbors may not elect the most distinguished , and learned , and patriotic of their fellow-citizens to the Chamber , unless that citizen pays one hundred dollars of direct taxes . They may not indeed call for universal suffrage , but they will ere long demand that every citizen , who has his hearth and his household goods , the Penates of his affections , at stake on the public weal , ( the misnamed potwollopers of England ) should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state . It is apparent from the forbearance of the French people with the illiberal and anti-national policy of a king , the creature of their own creation , that they have made great advances in political prudence ; and , from their steady adherence to the constitutional measures for preserving and extending their own rights , that they have made like advances in political wisdom and reflecting patriotism ; they have borne what they would not have borne forty years ago , in order to preserve the public peace ; and they have done what they would not then have known how to have done , to acquire and secure abstract but important rights . They are every day approaching that state of political soundness which will capacitate them for the exercise of the rights of freemen , and that political discernment which will enable them to guard those rights from usurpers . If France should continue for years in her present state of political uneasiness and anxiety , it will not , perhaps , be eventually disadvantageous to her as a nation , for she is undergoing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viz , a season of uncertainty about the present , and of anxiety about the future . As long as the future condition of a country is uncertain , so long will the thoughts and the energies of patriots be directed to the consideration of it , and so long will the public mind be eagerly seeking for political light , and discussing the advantages of various systems ; but let things once settle down into a state of certainty , let men come to the conclusion that the destinies of their country are fixed , for a century , beyond the reach of any efforts of their own , and they will relapse into political indifference ; and indifference to any subject inevitably begets ignorance of it . Let France become politically wise , and she must become politically great . We have seen what immense resources she has in the Lrreat // nationality of her people ; we have seen to what a height of power and glory she has been raised when these resources were called out by that nationality ; and we may see , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part she will be called to act . It is a common remark that Europe is on the eve of great events , and important changes ; yet it is doubtful whether many of us form to ourselves an adequate idea of the momentous consequences of that strug .. gle , of whose commencement the very next ship may possibly bring us news . Could we crowd all the important events of history into one great question , it would hardly be so interesting to individual man in Europe , or so influential on the future destinies of the human race , as the mighty one now at stake ; it is a question , on the decision of which depends not alone the condition of the Frenchman , the Spaniard , the Italian , or the German ; not alone the interests of the hundreds of millions of Europe , but of the thousands of millions of the habitable globe ; not the condition of mankind , for our short day alone , but during the long ages of futurity . Yes ! the first gun fired in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal for a struggle , on the issue of which will depend the future condition of the Laplander and the Hottentot , of the Malay and the Zealander , and of the myriads who inhabit the wide space between them . It is of mighty moment , indeed , whether Europe shall continue to groan under the load of standing armies , whose numbers are to be stated only by millions of men ; and the burden of standing debts , which can be counted only by tens of thousands of millions of dollars ; but it is of mightier moment still , to decide whether the strength and resour* ces of each country are to be seized upon by governments , who hold the advancement of the peop ! e in knowledge and civilization and political well-being to be incompatible with their own stability-governments , whose armies are supported , and whose revenues are raised , not with a view to the good of the people , but to the security and power of the throne . Such , we say , are the great questions at issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be shall act wisely and hold back the rights of the people only as long as the progress of liberalism will allow them to do it in safety to themselves ; or whether they will boldly unfurl the flag of despotism , and commence a crusade against freedom ; France is destined , in either case , to exercise an immense influence in the struggle . We could wish for her years of peace and prosperity , that she might gather more strength for the contest ; and it might be better for Europe that it were delayed if the powers were not pursuing a system so dangerous , because so able-they remained quiet while the enthusiasm kindled by the Revolution of July was burning in every bosom ; but they have been improving every moment since that event , to throw discredit upon it ; and now that the evil position , into which the abuse of that revolution seems to have thrown France , is apparent to Europe ; now that the Frenchman is quiet , and the Italian despairing , and the German is discouraged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are comino out with their infamous attempts to arrest the march of mind . // When the struggle shall commence , he the first sword drawn in Germany , or elsewhere , France will not be long in putting herself at the head of that great European party , of which , as she was the founder , so she has long been morally the leader ; and if those who manage her destinies shall be adequate to their high post , we shall witness her triumphant progress to the attainment of the first rank in the future order of states . About the final issue of the coming contest between the two great principles which divide Europe , we have little doubt ; for as surely as water runneth downward , or flame riseth upward , so surely shall the light of truth disseminate itself ; but we have misgivings and fears about the beginning of the struggle , ahout the apparent cause of the strife  --  the battle-cry of the parties . If the monarchs can force the liberals of France or Germany to a pitched battle for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally interesting and popular , they will beat them ; but God grant that their hearts may be hardened , and their understandings darkened , and some stroke like the mad ordonnances of Charles the Tenth be attempted , and then shall we see one wide and general resistance ; then will kingdom cry aloud to far-off kingdom , and people echo back the rallying word of people , and nation stretch out the helping hand to nation ; and then shall the Holy Alliance of men be formed against the unholy league of kingsand if God prosper the right , the earth shall be rid of its oppressors.
