txt TEXAS . A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN , PROGRESS AND PRESENT STATE OF THE COLONIAL SETTLEMENTS OF TEXAS ; TOGETHER WITH AN EXPOSITION OF THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE INDUCED THE EXISTING WAR WITH MEXICO . Extracted from a work entitled " A Geographical , Statistical and Historical account of Texas , " now nearly ready for the press . Some of these numbers have appeared in the New Orleans Bee and Bulletin . 1836 . PREFACE . It will be seen that the title of this little pamphlet implies more than it contains . As war is now the order of the day , only a small portion of the political part of the work on " Texas " is here presented . It is hoped and believed that enough is unfolded to convince the most incredulous that the colonists of Texas have been forced into this contest with the mother country , by persecutions and oppressions , as unremitting as they have been unconstitutional . That it is not a war waged by them for cupidity or conquest , but for the establishment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is a curse and man degraded to the level of the brute . If the time-hallowed principle of the Declaration of Independence , namely , " that governments are instituted for the protection and happiness of mankind , and that whenever they become destructive of these ends it is the right , nay it is the duty of the people to alter or abolish them . " If this sacred principle is recognised and acted upon , all must admit that the colonists of Texas have a clear right to burst their fetters , and have also a just claim for recognition as an independent nation , upon every government not wholly inimical to the march of light and liberty , and to the establishment of the unalienable rights of man . CURTIUS . TO AN IMPARTIAL WORLD . No . I. The unconstitutional oppression long and unremittingly practised upon the colonists of Texas , having at length become insupportable , and having impelled them to take up arms in defence of their rights and liberties , it is due to the world that their motives , conduct and causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this it will be necessary to explain the origin , progress and present state of the colonial settlements . Without parade or useless preliminaries , I shall proceed to the subject , as substance and not sound  --  matter and not manner are the objects of the present discussion . It is known at least to the reading and inquiring world , that on the dissolution of the connection between Mexico and Spain in 1522 , Don Augustin Iturbide , by corruption and violence , established a short-lived , imperial government over Mexico , with himself at the head under the title of Augustin I. On arriving at supreme power , Iturbide or Augustin I. found that vast portion of the Mexican government , east of the Rio Grande , known by the name of Texas , to be occupied by various tribes of Indians , who committed incessant depredations on the Mexican citizens West of the Rio Grande , and prevented the population of Texas . He ascertained that the savages could not be subdued by the arms of Mexico , nor could their friendship be purchased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread of Indians , could not be induced to venture into the wilderness of Texas . In addition to the dread of Indians , Texas held out no inducements for Mexican emigrants . They were accustomed to a lazy pastoral or mining life , in a healthy country . Texas was emphatically a land of agriculture  --  the land of cotton and of sugar cane , with the culture of which staples they were wholly unacquainted ; and moreover , it abounded in the usual concomitants of such southern regions  --  fevers , mosquitoes &c.,; which the Mexicans hated with a more than natural or reasonable hatred . Iturbide finding from those causes that Texas could not be populated with his own subjects , and that so long as it remained in the occupancy of the Indians , the inhabited parts of his dominions continually suffered from their ravages and murders , undertook to expel the savages by the introduction of foreigners . Accordingly the national institute or council , on the 3d day of January , 1823 , by his recommendation and sanction , adopted a law of colonization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the following terms :  --  1st . They promise to protect their liberty , property and civil rights . 2d . They offer to each colonist one league of land , ( 4,444 acres ) for coming to Texas . 3d . They guarantee to each colonist the privilege of leaving the empire at any time , with all his property , and also the privilege of selling the land which he may have acquired from the Mexican government , ( see the colonization law of 1823 , more especially articles 1st , 8th and 20th . ) These were the inducements and invitations held out to foreigners under the imperial government of Iturbide or Augustin I. In a short time , however , the nation deposed Iturbide , and deposited the supreme executive power in a body of three individuals . This supreme executive power on the 10th of August , 1824 , adopted a national colonization law , in which they recognized and confirmed the imperial colonization law with all its guarantees of person and property . It also conceded to the different States the privilege of colonizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national colonization law , articles 1st and 4th . ) In accordance with this law , the States of Coahuila and Texas on the 24th March , 1825 , adopted a colonization law for the purpose , as expressed in the preamble , of protecting the frontiers , expelling the savages , augmenting the population of its vacant territory , multiplying the raising of stock , promoting the cultivation of its fertile lands , and of the arts and of commerce . In this state-colonization law  --  the promises to protect the persons and property of the colonists , which had been made in the two preceding national colonization laws , were renewed and confirmed . We have now before us the invitations and guarantees under which the colonists immigrated to Texas . Let us examine into the manner in which these conditions have been complied with , and these flattering promises fulfilled . The donation of 4,444 acres sounds largely at a distance . Considering , however , all the circumstances , the difficulties of taking possession , &c.; it will not be deemed an entire gratuity or magnificent bounty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise of the Mexican government , and freed from the insecurities which beset a wilderness , trod only by savages  --  if they had have been situated in the heart of an inhabited region , and accessible to the comforts and necessaries of life  --  if the government had have been deriving any actual revenue , and if it could have realised a capital from the sale of them  --  then we admit that the donation would have been unexampled in the history of individual or national liberality . But how lamentably different from all thus was the real state of the case . The lands granted were in the occupancy of savages and situated in a wilderness , of which the government had never taken possession , and of which it could not with its own citizens ever have taken possession . They were not sufficiently explored to obtain that knowledge of their character and situation necessary to a sale of them . They were shut out from all commercial intercourse with the rest of the world , and inaccessible to the commonest comforts of life ; nor were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil and privation , and patience and enterprise , and suffering and blood , and loss of lives from Indian hostilities , and other causes . Under the smiles of a benignant heaven , however , the untiring perseverance of the colonists triumphed over all natural obstacles , expelled the savages by whom the country was infested , reduced the forest into cultivation , and made the desert smile . From this it must appear that the lands of Texas , although nominally given , were in fact really and clearly bought . It may here be premised that a gift of lands by a nation to foreigners on condition of their immigrating and becoming citizens , is immensely different from a gift by one individual to another . In the case of individuals , the donor loses all further claim or ownership over the thing bestowed . But in our case , the government only gave wild lands , that they might be redeemed from a state of nature ; that the obstacles to a first settlement might be overcome ; that they might be rid of those savages who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they might be placed in a situation to augment the physical strength and power and revenue of the republic . Is it not evident that Mexico now holds over the colonized lands of Texas , the same jurisdiction and right of property which all nations hold over the inhabited parts of their territory ? But to do away more effectually the idea that the colonists of Texas are under great obligations to the Mexican government for their donations of land , let us examine at what price the government estimated the lands given . Twelve or thirteen years ago , they gave to a colonist one league of laud for coming , he paying the government $30 , and this year ( 1835 ) they have sold hundreds of leagues of land for $50 each . So that it appears that the government really gave us what in their estimation was worth $20 . A true statement of facts then is all that is necessary to pay at once that immense debt of endless gratitude which , in the estimation of the ignorant and interested is due from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffering and danger which attended the redemption and cultivation of their lands by the colonists , and turn to their civil condition and to the conduct and history of the government . It is a maxim no less venerable for its antiquity than its truth  --  a maxim admitted and illustrated by all writers on political economy  --  and one that has been corroborated by experience in every corner of the earth , that miserable is the servitude and horrible the condition of that people whose laws are either uncertain or unknown . I ask , with a defiance of contradiction , if ours is not and has not always been , in Texas , the unhappy condition and miserable bondage spoken of in this maxim ? Who of us knows or can by possibility arrive at a knowledge of the laws that govern our property and lives ? Who of us is able to read and understand and be entirely confident of the validity of his title to the land he lives on , and which he has redeemed from a state of nature by the most indefatigable industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his land all that government exacts , or whether he has not paid ten times as much ? Look at the mere mockery of all law and justice which has always prevailed in place of an able and learned judiciary . Alcaldes , most of them unlearned in any system of jurisprudence , and unconversant with legal proceedings of any description , have been elected to administer a code , scattered through hundreds of volumes and written in languages of which they did not understand one word . Who among us is able to confer with his rulers ; to represent his wants and grievances ; to ask advice , or recommend salutary changes ? Have we had more than one or two organs of communication with the government , and must not they have been omniscient to have always understood the wishes of the people , and incorruptible to have always correctly represented them ? Who of us feels or ever has felt any reliance or can place any confidence in governmental matters , or can predict with any sort of certainty what in this respect a day may bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our present situation , too hourly , universally and bitterly felt to require to be mentioned . Who will say that these things do not exist ? Who will say that we have not suffered the harassing uncertainty and miserable bondage here represented ? When the people of the United States commenced their war for independence against Great Britain , the friends of Britain charged them with ingratitude . They said that Britain had founded the colonies at great expense  --  had increased a load of debt by wars on their account  --  had protected their commerce , &c.; This can not be said of Mexico . Not one dollar has she spent for Texas  --  not one Mexican soldier has ever fought by our side in expelling the savages . She has given us no protection whatever ; and as allegiance and protection are reciprocal , we have a right on this principle to cast off her yoke . However , in my next I pledge myself to demonstrate that the Mexicans are wholly incapable of self-government , and that on that principle we are bound by the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and take care of ourselves . * * * * * No . II . I now proceed to demonstrate that the Mexicans are wholly incapable of self-government , and that our liberties , our fortunes and our lives are insecure so long as we are connected with them . At the onset I can not but advert to the spirit of prophecy and truth with which that unequalled expounder and defender of the rights of man , Mr. Jefferson , spoke more than 18 years ago in regard to this very matter . In a letter to the Marquis de Lafayette , dated Monticello , 14th May , 1817 , he says , " I wish I could give you better hopes of our Mexican brethren . The achievement of their independence of old Spain is no longer a question . But it is a very serious one what will then become of them . Ignorance and bigotry , like other insanities , are incapable of self-government . They will fall under military despotism , and become the murderous tools of their respective Bonapartes . No one I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising self-government . But the question is not what we wish  --  but what is practicable . As their sincere friend , then , I do believe the best thing for them would be to come to an accord with Spain , under the guarantee of France , Russia , Holland , and the United States , allowing to Spain a nominal supremacy , with authority only to keep the peace among them , leaving them otherwise all the powers of self-government , until their experience , their education , and their emancipation from their Priests should prepare them for complete independence . " Jefferson 's works , vol. 4 , page 303 . Mr. Jefferson well knew that from the discovery of America to the date of his letter , the Mexicans had unfortunately been the persecuted , pillaged , and priest-ridden slaves of the kings of Spain  --  a line of kings , with but few exceptions , more inimical to the rights of man , more opposed to the advancement of truth , and light , and liberty , more practised in tyranny , more hardened in crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance , than any other monsters that ever disgraced a throne in christendom , since the revival of letters . Yes , humanity shudders , and freedom burns with indignation at a recital of the barbarities and oppressions practised upon the ill-fated Mexicans from the bloody days of Cortes up to the termination of their connexion with Spain . The produce of their cultivated fields was rifled  --  the natural products of their forests pillaged  --  the bowels of their earth ransacked , and their suffering families impoverished to glut the grandeur and enrich the coffers of their trans-Atlantic oppressors . To make their miserable servitude less perceptible , they were denied the benefits of the commonest education , and were kept the blind devotees of the darkest and most demoralizing superstition that ever clouded the intellects , or degraded the morals of mankind . From this it is evident , that up to the period of their independence , having been so long destitute of education , so long unaccustomed to think or legislate for themselves , and so long under the complete dominion of their liberty-hating Priests , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-government . Let us examine what their subsequent opportunities of improvement have been . At the close of the revolution , Iturbide , by fraud and force , caused himself to be proclaimed Emperor , who after much commotion , was dethroned , banished and shot . After this Victoria was elected President , during all of whose administration the country was distracted with civil wars and conspiracies , as is evidenced by the rebellion and banishment of Montano , Bravo , and many others . Victoria 's term having expired , Pedraza was constitutionally elected , but was dispossessed by violence , and Guerero put in his stead . Guerero was scarcely seated before Bustamente with open war deposed him , put him to death and placed himself at the head of the government . Bustamente was hardly in the chair before Santa Anna , warring , as he pretended , for the constitution and for making it still more liberal , dispossessed him by deluging the country in a civil war , the horrors of which have not at this moment ended . Since his accession we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have overshadowed the land , and that at last he has at one fell stroke , with an armed soldiery , turned congress out of doors , dissolved that body and proclaimed that the constitution is no more . Here , then , we have a lamentable verification of the fears and predictions of that great apostle of human liberty , Mr. Jefferson . His prophecy in relation to the result of their governmental experiment , implies in him an almost superhuman forecast and knowledge of the elements essential to self-government . He knew that they were too ignorant and too much under the dominion of their priests at the period of their declaration , and he but too truly foresaw that owing to the unhallowed ambition of their military aspirants , the country would be too continually distracted with revolutions to admit of their advancement in education or any useful knowledge whatever . Time has developed it . There has been no attention on the part of government to schools or other useful institutions . The present generation are as ignorant and bigoted as the past one , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless some philanthropic and enlightened citizen shall arrive at power with a purity of patriotism and reach of intellect unexampled among his countrymen , and with energies of character sufficiently commanding to emancipate the nation from the thraldom of her priests  --  to curb or kill her countless military aspirants , thereby preventing incessant revolutions , and thereby enabling a new generation to experience the benefits of education and to qualify themselves in other respects for complete self-government . I have now gone through with the administration , or rather mal-administration , of the General Government . It is equally demonstrable that so far as Texas is concerned , there have been equal confusion , insecurity and injustice in the administration of the State governments . Texas , as is known , forms an integral part of the State known by the name of Coahuila and Texas . During the past year there were three persons claiming and fighting for the office of Governor of this State . There was no session of the legislature at the regular period , on account of this civil war , and fifteen officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the head of the one elected by the people . At an extraordinary time the legislature was convoked , and fraudulently sold for a thousandth part of their value , millions of acres of our public domain . This legislature was finally dispersed by the threats of the General Government , and our Governor and one of the members were , on their retreat , arrested and imprisoned by the troops of the permanent army  --  leaving us involved in chaotic anarchy . Do not these facts conclusively demonstrate an incapability of self-government on the part of the Mexicans ? Do they not cry aloud for an immediate dissolution of all connexion with them as the only rock of our salvation ? Yes , the vital importance of a declaration of Independence is as clearly indicated by them as if it were " written in sunbeams on the face of heaven . " * * * * * No . III . ANALYSIS OF THE MEXICAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1824 . It has been wisely remarked by that great illustrator of the machinery of governments , ( Montesquieu ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and judicial powers , or any two of them , are united in the same person or body of persons . See Spirit of Laws , in reference to the English Constitution . If any corroboration of this high authority is needed , I will refer to Mr. Jefferson , and the writers of that invaluable text book , the Federalist . Mr. Jefferson , in his Notes on Virginia , page 195 , says the concentration of legislative , executive and judicial powers in the same hands , is precisely the definition of despotism . And in the Federalist , page 261 , it is said , " the accumulation of these powers in the same hands , whether of one , a few , or many , and whether hereditary , self-appointed , or elective , is the very definition of tyranny . " In the same great work it is clearly demonstrated , that if each department is not so fortified in its powers as to prevent infringement by the others , the constitution which creates them all will be worth no more than the parchment upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the states of the Union to keep these departments distinct , and in different hands , that it has been specially provided for in all their constitutions . See the constitutions of the different States . And yet in the face of all this wisdom and experience , and contrary to every thing that is republican in its nature , the framers of the Mexican constitution have reserved to Congress the sole power of construing the constitutionality of its acts . This , it will be readily seen , is an entire nullification of the judiciary in all constitutional matters , and leaves the rights of the people and the constitution itself without any other security than what is to be found in the virtue , patriotism and intelligence of Congress . What slender reliances , where the liberties and happiness of a nation are concerned ! If in the United States Congress should transcend its powers in the passage of a law , the courts would declare it null and void , and bring back Congress to a constitutional discharge of its duties . But if the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , declare it constitutional , and imprison the judge for his presumption . It appears then , that the Mexican constitution of 1824 contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction ,  --  for the accumulation of legislative and judicial powers in Congress , and the enabling of that body to violate the constitution at will , renders it of no more avail than " a sounding brass or tinkling cymbal . " It will be no alleviation , says Mr. Jefferson , in his work above quoted , page 195 , that in the case of Congress unlimited powers are vested in a plurality of hands . One hundred or two hundred despots are surely as oppressive as one . Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of Venice . In the next place I will show , that independent of this objection , the Mexican constitution contains principles and provisions 500 years behind the liberalized views of the present age , and at war with every thing that is akin to civil or religious liberty . In that instrument the powers of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , and other civilized countries , into legislative , executive and judicial , are divided into military , ecclesiastical and civil , and these two first are fortified with exclusive privileges , and made predominant . It is specially declared that the Roman Catholic religion is , and forever shall be , the established religion of the land . No other is tolerated , and no one can be a citizen without professing it . Can any people be capable of self-government  --  can they know any thing about republicanism , who will , in this enlightened age endeavor to erect the military over the civil  --  to bind the conscience in chains , and to enforce an absolute subscription to the dogmas of any religious sect  --  but more especially of that sect , which has waged an unceasing warfare against liberty , whenever the ignorance and superstition of mankind have given it a foothold ? Can republicans live under a constitution containing such unhallowed principles ? All will say they can not . And if the Texan colonists are willing to do so a moment longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unworthy the sympathies or assistance of any free people  --  they are unworthy descendants of those canonized heroes of the American revolution , who fought , and bled , and conquered for religious as well as civil liberty , and who established the sacred principle , that " all men have a right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their consciences . " Yet bad as this constitution is , it has been swept away by , if possible , a worse form of government , the central . This system , now attempted to be rivetted upon the people of Texas , has preserved most of the bad features of the old constitution , viz : the preponderance of the military and clergy , and has destroyed all of the good features , to wit : the representation of the people through the medium of Congress , and the division of the republic into States . The whole of the States are now consolidated into one , and governed by a dictator and council of about a dozen , who are the creatures of his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico , but Texas , has submitted to this , and she is waging a war against it with all the energies of an infant and much oppressed people . If it be asked , why have the people of Texas submitted so long to such a constitution , I answer , that for the first few years their numbers or wealth did not attract the notice or cupidity of government . 2dly , the incessant revolutions of Mexico kept their attention from Texas for many years more . 3dly , they submitted from physical inability to resist . And 4thly , they were determined to prove themselves a law and oath abiding people , and in case of rupture with Mexico , to show to the world that they were not the aggressors . This rupture has been brought about , and it is folly to think of ever healing the breach . The constitution has been destroyed , and it is idle to think of restoring it . If restored , I have shown that no republican can live under it . We have no right to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be made more republican and more congenial with our wishes  --  for in all their changes and commotions , each party contends for the established religion  --  it is the last thing they will part with  --  believing it to be the anchor of their hope and salvation here and hereafter . But granting that the federal party should triumph  --  that the monster centralism should be crushed , and that the constitution should be amended so as to make it appear , on parchment , the most unexceptionable charter of human rights known to the world , have we any reason to believe or to hope , from their demonstrated incapacity of self-government , and from their incessant past revolutions , that it will be or can be administered for a day ? But , as I before said , it is idle to talk of the constitution now . Texas must be Independent . The tie between her and Mexico is severed , and that by the injustice and violence of Mexico . It can never be re-united  --  for between the colonists and Mexicans there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pursuits , interests , habits , manners , education , language and religion . * * * * * No . IV . In my last I contended that none of those ties which are necessary to bind a people together and make them one , existed between the colonists and Mexicans . That there was an almost total dissimilarity in the soil , climate and productions of the regions of territory they respectively inhabited ; and that superadded to this , there was no identity of pursuits , habits , manners , education , language or religion . I now proceed to show , that these circumstances have engendered towards the colonists in the , mass of the Mexican nation , feelings of unconquerable jealousy and hostility . Yes ! our superiority in enterprise , in learning , in the arts and in all that can dignify life , or embellish human nature , instead of exciting in them a laudable ambition to emulate , to equal , or excel us  --  excites the most hateful of all the passions  --  envy  --  and has caused them to endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oppressive and unconstitutional acts , to retard our growth and prosperity , and if possible , to get rid altogether of a people whose presence so hourly reminds them of their own ignorance and inferiority . Some of these acts I now proceed to enumerate . 1st . With a sickly philanthropy worthy of the abolitionists of these United States , they have , contrary to justice , and to law , intermeddled with our slave population , and have even impotently threatened in the war now pending , to emancipate them , and induce them to turn their arms against their masters . If they would cast their eyes around them , they would find that at home the more wealthy and intelligent of the Mexicans have unjustly imposed upon at least one quarter of their fellow citizens , the most galling and illegal system of servitude that ever stained the annals of human oppression . 2d . Footnote : Have been repealed . Although the colonization law conceded to emigrants to Texas all the rights and privileges of citizens , in 1829 a law was passed confining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless to comment upon the illegality and injustice of this law . It speaks for itself , and clearly indicates the diabolical spirit in which it was engendered . 3d . I pass over many minor grievances growing out of their illegal legislative enactments , and plainly denoting their settled hostility , and come to the law of the 6th Footnote : Have been repealed. of April , 1830 . By this law , North Americans , and they alone , were forbidden ad mission into Texas . This was enough to blast all of our hopes , and dishearten all of our enterprise . It showed to us that we were to remain scattered , isolated , and unhappy tenants of the wilderness  --  compelled to gaze upon the resources of a lovely and fertile region , undeveloped for want of population . That we were to be cut off forever from the society of fathers and friends in the United States of the North  --  to prepare comforts suited to whose age and infirmities , many of us had emigrated and patiently submitted to every species of privation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating . That feature of this law granting admission to all other nations except our brethren of the United States of the North , was sufficient to goad us on to madness . Yes ! the door of emigration to Texas was closed upon the only sister republic worthy of the name which Mexico could boast of in this new world . It was closed upon a people among whom the knowledge and the foundations of rational liberty are more deeply laid than among any other on the habitable globe . It was closed upon a people who would have carried with them to Texas those principles of freedom , and those ideas of self-government in which , from their birth , they had been educated and practised . In short , and more than all , inasmuch as it stamps the Mexican government with the foul blot of ingratitude , it was closed upon a people who generously and heroically aided them in their revolutionary struggle , and who were first and foremost to recognize and rejoice at the consummation of their independence . Nothing but envy , jealousy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have prompted the passage of this most iniquitous law . Simultaneous with it , all parts of Texas were deluged with garrisons in a time of profound peace . These garrisons extorted and consumed the substance of the land , and paid for their supplies in drafts on a faithless and almost bankrupt government . In their presence and vicinity the civil arm was paralyzed and powerless . They imprisoned our citizens without cause , and detained them without trial , and in every respect trampled upon our rights and privileges . They could not have been sent to Texas for our protection , for when they came we had expelled the savages , and were able to protect ourselves ; and at the commencement of the colonial settlements , when we were few and weak , and scattered , and defenceless , not a garrison  --  no ! not a soldier came to our assistance . As another evidence of the hostility of the Mexicans to the Colonists , I will instance the following : On the 7th of May , 1824 , when the Republic was divided into States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being sufficiently populous for a Slate , was united to Coahuila , but it was specially decreed by Congress that whenever Texas was sufficiently populous to figure as a State , she should make it known and be admitted . In 1833 , the people of Texas , knowing that their numbers exceeded those of several of the old States , in solemn convention formed a constitution , and sent on a delegate to the city of Mexico , praying that Texas be admitted as a State . Instead of granting this just and legal request , they imprisoned our delegate in the dungeons of the Inquisition , and detained him without a trial for more than a year , deprived of the common air and common use of his own limbs ! Under all of those multiplied oppressions , the colonists , from a spirit of forbearance , or rather from physical inability to resist , long groaned and languished . Not a voice , not an arm was uplifted . The wheels of government were not retarded in their operation by us . We consoled ourselves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and justice would give to these obnoxious laws a brief duration . While laying this flattering unction to their souls , while indulging dreams of fancied felicity never to be realized , the dictator , Santa Anna , developed his tyrannical course . He surrounded Congress with an armed force , dissolved the body , and declared the constitution at an end . He dispersed our State Legislature by violence , imprisoned our Governor , demanded the arrest of some of the unoffending colonists , to be tried by military tribunals for ( if any ) civil offences , disarmed the militia , leaving only one gun to 500 citizens , and sent an army of mercenaries into Texas to rivet upon us the chains of centralism . When these glaring oppressions were attempted to be practised , the people of Texas felt that the cup of their bitterness was full to overflowing  --  that the rod of persecution had smitten sufficiently severe , and that they could no longer submit without relinquishing forever the glorious appellation of freemen . They struck , and struck with the potent arm of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They wish not to wage a war of cupidity and conquest . They only ask to be permitted to govern the territory they occupy after the republican mode of their fathers . If this , their reasonable demand , is not conceded , they will carry the war into the enemy 's country , and force the tyrant ( as they have the power to do , ) to acknowledge the independence of Texas within the very walls of his capital . After so many descriptions it is useless to discuss the capability of Texas to figure as an independent government . Suffice it to say , that it is larger than France , England , Scotland and Ireland united  --  of more general fertility , and susceptible of a greater and denser population . CURTIUS.
