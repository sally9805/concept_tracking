txt Not many years after the discovery of America , a learned academy of Paris offered a prize for the best disquisition that should be written on the probable influence of the new world . The wise men of the day were profuse in speculations suggested by the pregnant theme ; they presented it in every form that reason or ingenuity could create ; yet not one of them all , in the widest range of their musings , happened upon that means by which America was mo t deeply to affect the history and modify the condition of the old world . It may be supposed that tbey spoke profoundly of the vast stores of natural wealth her endless tracts disclosed , of their importance to the growing commerce of the age , of the impulse given to the awakening spirit of adventure , of the facility of access opened to the Indian seas , of the desirable outlet provided to the teeming population of the continent but not a word was said , nor perhaps was it even ima dined , that this land was destiued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new spirit and on a nex plan , attaining the highest reach of civilization , and ordained to work a thorough change in the structure of European government and social existence . But this was , in the designs of Providence committed to the restless workings of that principle of progression which is incas chief distinction , awaiting the developments of the course of time . How wonderful have been the movements of the principle to which we thus refer . The fly that buzzed in the garden of Eden , on the first morning of creation , was in all respects similar to that which rejoices in the sunbeam now . But man has changed . The progress of events has wrought a complete revolution in all his relations , in his acquirements , arts , laws , institutions , and social arrangements . He has been moving for more than six thousand years , and at each move some alteration has been effected in the conditions of his being . Preserving his essential humanity , how broad the contrast between his earlier and his present state ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously , or in obedience to established and invariable laws . Have they occurred at random , without plan , or in consequence of strict ordinations of Providence ? Is there a c ontrolling spirit beyond the mere visible event , working out for the human race a high , and to us , no doubt , now , an inconceivable destiny l The history of humanity is the record of a grand march , more or less rapid , as it was now impeded by obstacles , and again facilitated by force , // 209 at all times tending to one point  --  the ultimate perfection of man . The course of civilization is the progress of man from a state of savage mdividualisni to that of an individualism more elevated , moral , and refined . Personal separation and independence were the beginning , as they will he the end , of the great progressive movement , with this difference-that in its last and more perfectly developed condition , the Sense of justice shall have supreme control over the individual will . To the acceleration and extension of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed . As portions of humanity , they have taken part in the general onward movement . They have each had a mission to accomplish , special to themselves , though connected with the development of the entire human race . Step by step they have each removed from realms of thick darkness to regions of gradually increasing light . They have singly and collectively emerged from the abysses of ignorance and degradation , to the pleasanter atmosphere of expanding intelligence . We are enabled , by a large view of this career of nations , to group the successive stages of society in the orders of civilization , all tending to improve the social condition of man , to accomplish his destiny , though the latest has always been the purest , the most liberal , and the best . There is always in the latest civilization some element giving it superior worth and excellence . The order of civilization first in point of time prevailed in the infancy of our race , before reason obtained the mastery of impulse , and the souls of men were filled with vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be called the THEOCRATIC , and , being the earliest departure of the race from barbarism , was born among the oldest people in the East , in Judea , Persia , and India . In those countries the idea of what was infinite seemed to absorb and overwhelm every other thought . It pervaded their manners , laws , arts , and institutions , as well as their religion . The greatest , like the minutest , events of life were conducted under its immediate inspiration . Every thing appeared under the theological form . The human being , from its birth to its death , was perpetually reminded , in one mode or another , of his relation to a superior being of infinite power . Priests , of course , were the master agents of society , to whom the multitude bowed down in slavish reverence , and compelling even the obedience of kings . Representing themselve* as the vicegerents and delegated ministers of Heaven , they acquired despotic ascendency , holding a rank in authority second only to that of God . There can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social elevation , and less of personal freedom , could be found under such a dominion ; yet it was a step beyond the condition of barbarism , more desirable and happy in its operations . It substituted holy instincts , divine laws , sacred authority , worship , cultivation , order , art , and domestic ties , for the wild and warring impulses of unrestrained ferocity and selfishness . It habituated the minds of its subjects to some degree of reflection , taught them to act in accordance with known rules , and created the feelirig // of respect for something higher and better than themselves . So far was it an advancement ; but other things were necessary to the full deve* lopment of humanity . The second kind of civilization made its appearance in Rome andi Greece , and the pervading idea of it was the indisputable supremacy of the State . Like the theological element in the East , the political element in these great nations gave form and color to all thoughts . A devotion to the public good was the chiefest of virtues ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and truth , were obliged to give way to the aggrandizement of the State . The arts , science , literature , wealth , education , and religion of society , were matters of State concern , subordinate to its interests , and at all times directed to its elevation . So omnipotent was the State , that there was no evading its requirements , no resisting its behests , no escaping from the tyranny of its pecuniary or personal exactions . Had any one man opposed its wishes , the combined power of millions was ready to crush him . He must live , think , and act , accordingly as his country willed , or die . To what extent this notion of subservience was carried is shown by the writers of those nations numerous and great as they unquestionably were , who , in all their effusions , have uttered no word of individual freedom , have made no attempt to define the rights of society , to trace the origin of governments , or unfold their true and only functions . One towering thought , one master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have swab lowed up all others . What could have been more different in every respect than the Governments of Athens and Sparta ? And yet how this idea of the State prevailed in the institutions of both-as a secret plastic poxver , presiding over the organization of custom and law , and controlling even the volitions of individual choice . No rights , no ties , no retirement too sacred to be invaded by the public power . It was superior to all these ; and , though less tyrannical than the blind superstitions which preceded it , was still unfavorable to any real refinement of social intercourse , or the acquisition of personal virtue . Conquest and empire became the only glory , whilst the gentler arts of peace were despised . The middle ages witnessed the rise of the third or aristocratic order of civilization , the leading feature of which was feudalism , or the spirit of exclusive rank and class . Power was then in the possession of the nobility , an order ( assumed to he from birth better than all others ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy and ambition , long and cruel wars . It was a sad time for the serfs and villeins . Many and grievous were the burdens they were compelled to bear . Driven about like yoked cattle , forced to obey the nods of haughty barons , pouring out in the battle fields their life-blood for causes in which they had no interest , dying in hosts to gratify the rapacity or rage of some puppet of privilege , their condition could not have been other than miserable . Yet it was better than that of the ancient world . All were not serfs . The predominant despotism was relieved and ameliorated by // many circumstances of the age . lit was not universal , but divided and weakened by opposition and restraint , and often softened by the feclings of attachment springing up between the retainer and the lord . That relation gave room for the display of some of the finest traits of human character . It allowed of an intercourse and commerce among men that gradually liberalized the spirit of society , diffused the disposition to free inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set a glorious reformation in its place  --  a reformation enhancing art , literature , manners , arid religion . The last order of civilization , which is the democratic , received its first permanent existence in thi country . Many events , it is true , in the remote history of the world , prepared it for the reception of this principle , yet the peculiar duty of this country has been to exemplify and embody a civilization in which the ri* , hts , freedom , and mental and moral growth of individual man should be made the highest end of all social restrictions and laws . To this result the discipline of Providence has tended from the earliest history of the Anglo-American race . The old world was not the theatre for the development of the new civilization , so different from all that had preceded it , so incompatible with the spirit and hostile to the prejudices of existing things . It needed a broader sphere than institutions founded in exclusiveness could afford , and in which so many elements of restriction and partiality mingled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar in its position , productions , and extent , wide enough to hold a numerous people , admitting , with facility , inter-communication and trade , vigorous and fresh from the hand of God , was requisite for the full and broad manifestation of the free spirit of the new-born democracy . Such a land was prepare in the solitudes of the Western hemisphere . And , then , the men sufficient to accomplish the work needed to be peculiar men . They were not to he striplings nude effeminate by the luxuries of courts , or weak and artificial by corrupt refinement , but stern , resolute , enduring men , ardent worshippers of truth , profoundly penetrated by great thoughts , living by faith in eternal principles , and ready to face death in defence of conscience and right . Such men were the pilgrim stock ,  --  the sires of the busy multitudes that now fill the land . Both the circumstances of their origin and early history , and the relations of equality instituted among them as they set foot in the wilderness , cooperated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation whose bloody wars for years had nourished the manly spirit of courage awl endurance . They lived at a time when unrelenting religious contests prepared all minds for desperate trial , and infused in them the sternest moral convictions . They brought with them none to reverence , none to assert , an unjust domination . Kingly power they scarce recognized , aristocratic pretension they repelled , and priestly supremacy they had long resisted even unto death . They came simply as men with the sacred rights and eternal interests of men . The peculiar hazards of their position placed // them upon grounds of equality . Mutual dangers strengthened mutu&amp; sympathy , whilst a common purpose fired them with a common zeal . Their first act having reached this barren shore , was to frame a constitution whose object was the common good . A singular co sistency pervaded the spirit of the early settlers , and the manifestations of it , in actual customs and laws . They asserted with remarkable directness and force the great doctrines of popular sovereignty , of political equality , of sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be derived not as a divine gift from God , not from the consent of monarchs , nor the concessions of nobility , but directly from the whole body of men . The perception of this truth distinguished them from the rest of the * orld . The same freedom from usurpe authority , which marked their religious career , they carried into their political inquiries . It is true , it is to be regretted it was only comparative freedom , not entire . Many errors were mingled in their conceptions of man 's sacred inalienable rights . Their notions were strong , hut not comprehensive . They allowed truth with limitations . Without being grossly inaccurate , they were strangely confused . They respected private judgment , but confined it to certain subjects of thought . Conscience was sacred only within a circumscribed sphere . The full and ample discussion of certain topics was prohibited by painful penalties . The discipline and doctrine of a church themselves had organized was too high a theme for vulgar approach-too holy to be disturbed by profane touch . Religion , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to leave to his own soul : . It was a thing to be controlled and regulated by the State , for which the arm of civil power was to be invoked , to compel outward conformity and force inward faith . Here was their weakness . Here they departed from their own principles , and , submittin* to the prejudices of the past , brought grievous tyranny on man . Here they were as intolerant and n.arroxv-mmded as the bigots of other nations , and a remoter age . Yet it was impossible for a people of an origin like theirs , or of such convictions as they had , long to submit to oppression of any sort . Much as they were willing to concede to religious injustice at home , they were disposed to yield nothing to political usurpation abroad . The spirit of resistance awakened with the very first assertion of foreign control , and arose as the arrogance of authority grew bold . The more formidable the danger , the more bold and unrelenting became their opposition* Purposes of freedom kept pace with despotic pretension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of their cause , and discovering new means and materials of strength ; when , at last , after expostulation and remonstrance failed , a transcendant expression of popular will severed the chains of allegiance , and made a whole nation free . The Declaration of Independence was a tremendous act of revolution , founded upon the rights and sanctioned by the natural justice of mankind . The history of the world records nothing like it either for sublimity of // purpose or importance of result . It was as peculiar in its design as it has been permanent and extensive in its influence . A nation , poising itself upon the rights of its people , solemnly absolved its political connection , and instituted a government for itself ; - it did more it instituted a government drawn from popular choice , and confessing the equal rights of men . This was the origin of democratic liberty  --  the source of true civilization , lit established the distinct existence of democracy as a social element , and began a reform destined to cease only when every man in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the nature of this Democracy ? What are its claims and objects as a social element ? What its views of government ; and what its means as well as hopes of success ? Simply , it is the political ascendency of the people ; but let us attempt to state in what sense : It is not the government of a people permitted , in the plenitude of their power , to do as they please , regardless alike of the restraiats of written law or individual right . A more terrible condition of society than this , the xvickedest despot could not readily conceive . Wild uproar would make room for fanatic excesses of passion , or the alternate bloody triumph of miserable factions . Nor is it the government of the majority carried into the determination of all questions that concern the rights and duties of men . As a safe and wise arbiter of controversy , the will of the majority is to be respected . Where thought and expression are free , it can seldom become oppressive . Adverse parties watch the movements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manifest violation of right , never fruitlessly invoke the correcting spirit of reform . Nothing is more certain to prostrate even the most triumphant party than the usurpation or unjust exercise of power . Still , to prevent the beginnings of evil , majorities must submit to restraint . There are some things over which they can rightly exert no control . There are personal feelings , domestic ties , social dependencies , commercial rights , too exalted or subtle to be meddled with by human legislation , and which legislation touches only to wither and destroy . They are to be set apart as sacred things , which the ruthless arm of power , though upheld by every letter of law , and directed by the delegated will of overwhelming numbers , should never invade . Democracy , therefore , is the supremacy of the people , restrained by a just regard to individual rights-that condition of society which secures the full and inviolable use of every faculty . Its foundation is the fact of perfect equality of rights among men . It recognizes the distinct existence of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely as a means to be merged in a mass , and controlled as a thing by public caprice or policy . His instinctive convictions , his irrepressible desires , his boundless capacity for improvement , conspire with all the indications of Providence , with all the teachings of history , and all the designs of his internal condition and adjustment , to make the doctrine of individual rights the greatest of political truths . Clearly to dofine and religiously to respect those rights , is the highest , almost the // only duty of government . All its action beyond this tends to gross abuse and wrong When it institutes partial laws , when it creates a superior class , when it erects artificial distinctions , when it grants monopoly , when it lays restraints upon free intercourse and trade ; in short , when it establishes any law or custom of unequal operation , it departs from its true functions , it begins a course of injustice and fraud , it opens the way for any degree of oppression . So severe is even-handed justice , that not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence Governments perfect themselves in proportion as they allow a larger measure of freedom to remain with the people . Their first care should be to expand the sphere of individual action , to loosen the bonds of inequitable usages , to break the fetters of proscription , and to harmonize the interaction of mutually dependent wills , by removing the distance and separation which is the source of jealousy and contest . It is true , a long time must elapse before the point of ultimate perfection is attained ; though , meanwhile , the duty of Democracy is to correct abuses , one after another , until the nature of individual man is thoroughly emancipated . As an element of social progress , the recognition of these principles is of the utmost importance and weight . Until they are widely received and permanently adopted , there can be no complete civilization . If we apprehend it , civilization consists in the establishment of elevated social relations , upheld by lofty and refined personal character ; or , in other words , the development among men of the best powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of a high degree of advancement in social organization and in individual culture . It supposes a condition of prosperous trade , intellectual elevation , and moral development ; but literature , science , politics , and morals , must have reached a considerable progress , and physical comfort , commercial ease , and mental attaiaments* be generally possessed by the people . Now , one proposition is , that the highest degree of civilization can only be reached byn rigid application of the democratic principle . Society can only find its true perfection by a broad recognition of the doctrine of individual and equal rights . As to its influence , in the first place , on outward prosperity merely , can any thing be clearer than that industry will be productive in proportion to the freedom with which its energies are applied and its gains appropriated ? To leave men free in the direction of their pursuits , not only imparts immediate happiness , but gives tenacity to their purposes and strength to their power of execution . They labor more effectively , because they labor willingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a pleasing conviction of usefulness , and the calm assurance of ultimate competence . The stupid inertness of the man-machine is exchanged for the cheerful vigor of the husbandman , and the depressing prospect of endless toil is brightened into a future of seductive ease . For acquisition would be secure from the exorbitant taxes of unrighteous government , whilst no pampered aristocratic class would hang or make weight upon society , or exclusive // interest absorb and impede all the channels of commerce . Such a change introduced into all modes of enterprise would produce results of immeasurable magnitude , and uniformly good . It would tend to equalize the distribution of wealth . Without wholly removing poverty , it would lessen dependence . The strange contrasts created by overgrown affluence and wretched poverty would give place to apportionments of property more equitably adjusted to the degrees of personal capacity and merit ; whilst the poor would be raised* the rich would be made better ; restless heart-burnings would cease to embitter the intercourse or provoke the deadly animosity of classes feeling themselves to be equals ; arrogance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destitution , which is the fruitful parent of crime and misery , would occur only as the retributive consequence of ignorance and vice . All ranks of men would begin life on a fair field , " tbe world before them where to choose , and Providence their guide . " Inclination and sagacity would select the sphere , and dictate the mode and measure of exertion . Frugality and vigilance would compel success , and defeat and ruin be felt only as the requital of ill-desert ; or , if such things be , as vicissitudes inflicted by Heaven among its inscrutable designs . Every kind of labor being thus effectively applied , an abundance of products would compensate its toils . At the same time , means and leisure for nobler pursuits would be provided . Prosperity admits of various employments among men , by augmenting the number and wants of a population , and at the same time commensurately multiplying its resources . As physical comforts increase , the taste for elevated and refined enjoyment sprints up . The demand for artists , poets , and philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made profitable , and all the more delicate and ennobling modes of exerting human faculties receive invigorating rewards . Discovery and invention enlarge the scope , master strok es of genius stimulate the activity , lofty moral instructions refine the nature of thought . A humanizing influence spreads itself through public sentiment . High notions of justice soften while they give dignity to manners . Mind , warm in purposes of generosity , strong in adherence to virtue , takes the control of social movements ; in short , we behold a people rich , powerful , enlightened , and no less happy in self-respect than in the universal regard of the world . Nor less auspicious would be the adoption of the democratic idea to the elevation of individual character . In times past , the greater number of men have been nothing at all , because nothing was made of them . There was little in their circumstances to let them know that they were moral agents . All the influences around them were adapted to produce impressions directly the reverse . Living creatures they were , machines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines of destruction ,  --  things wherewith superior classes might pamper themselves , or ruin and destroy their adversaries  --  but more they // were not . Neither the society of the past , or its governments , could teach men their true nature , or inspire them with self-reliance or cheer them with hope . Were they not the unreasoning tools of power ,  --  were they not curs to be cuffed at will ,  --  chips to be hurled about at caprice * Well might they have said to their heartless oppressors ,  --  we have obeyed like cowering slaves , we have toiled until blood has stood upon our limbs as sweat , we have drained the dregs of life 's bitterest cup , for your gratification ,  --  and what have you given us in return ? Only curses and blows . And all this , because haughty man refused to confess his fellow man ; because the lust of dominion expelled the sense of right ; because the divine impress on each human soul was not read , or if read , despised . Matters have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised , but not altogether removed . Better notions have grown up in the hearts of men , but , alas ! how much is there to stifle and impede full growth . A hateful despotism still too often actuates human will  --  the spirit of exclusion , of scorn , or tyranny , of selfishness , still lingers about the high places , and makes itself felt in the depths of society . Nothing short of the broadest reception of the principles of democracy can regenerate man . There must be something in his circumstances to remind him of his inherent worth ; something that , amid withering and depressing care , will ever bring back the fresh consciousness of his manhood . How can he whose life is perpetual toil , whose existence is lost in that of the many whose highest conception of excellence is fidelity to another 's pleasure , whose only exercise of conscience and freewill is in the stern struggle for subsistence-how can he attain a true insight of his immortal value . Some virtue , it is true , is found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest walks for the sweet play of affection . There are every where friends to be esteemed , kindred to cherish , or a wife and children to love . There are endurance and energy imparted every where by the discipline of life , but how little is all this compared with the perfect stature of a man . No , let it be understood that the same nature is common to all men , that they have equal and sacred claims , that they have high and holy faculties ; that society respects , and the whole force of government is pledged to protect their rights ; and then will they acquire some adequate notion of who and what they are , of their divine origin , and their imperishable being . A feelhig of exaltation and nobleness would pass into their souls , and the humblest person would expand with a sense of innate dignity  --  a sense that would raise him above the dusty , beaten paths of life , give a respite to depressing care , strengthen self-respect , infuse warm and liberal emotions , quicken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblest powers . He would feel at once that be was man , known and honored as such , of higher importance , and more inestimable worth than the whole outward world . In this ennobling influence Christianity and Democracy are one . What , indeed , is Democracy but Christianity in its earthly aspect-Christianity made // effective among the political relations of men . Christianity , in which it accords with every design of Providence , begins with individual man , addressing its lofty persuasions to him , and makes his full development its chief solicitude and care . The obstacles reared by artificial life it throws aside ; the rubbish heaped by centuries of abuse upon the human spirit it removes , the better to unfold man 's inward beauty , and bring forth man 's inward might . A single soul is worth more in its sight than suns or stars . It has a value more enduring than States . The proudest thrones may crumble , the broadest empires contract and become nothing , but the spirit of the meanest man can never perish ; for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence.
