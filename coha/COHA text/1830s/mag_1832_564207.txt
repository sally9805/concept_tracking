txt MEN not only differ from each other with regard to the sort of poetry they prefer , and the individual poet they read with the most pleasure , but there will be minor points , upon which those , who agree in the main , will hold opposite opinions . With regard to their favorite authors , they will dissent as to the relative merit of particular passages ; one may consider some peculiarity in the use of language or the turn of phrases a blemish , and another , a beauty ; a poet may be admired by one reader for one excellence , and by another for another . But in one point , all men of taste and judgement will agree ; that is , whether the author of poems is or is not a poet , or to take the primitive signification of the word , a Maker . Whatever may be the opinions as to the writer 's taste , his judgement , the application of his powers , his choice of subjects , the class to which he belongs , - there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these-Is the man a poet ? Has he the seer 's gifted eye ? Does he create new forms ? Or does he merely weave words into a regular pattern ? On this point , there can be but one opinion about Mr. Percival . He is most certainly a poet . Any one page , of the many he has written , will give proof of this . There are new combinations of thought , picturesque images , a tremulous sensibility to all forms of beauty , an acquaintance with the mysteries of his own mind , a deep love and understanding of Nature , and , above all , that power of creating which the Germans express by the term , Bildungstrieb . Nature then made him a poet . She gave him the heart , the blood and the soul of a bard ; the power to see visions and dream dreams , and to shape the elements of reality into forms of perfect beauty . The flowers of spring , the voices of birds , the sheen of fountains and the clouds of summer awakened , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sowed the seeds of innumerable fancies and analogies in the luxuriant soil of his mind . Nor was his sympathy confined to the beautiful and the soothing ; his eyes followed the dizzy play of the lightning , and his ear drank with delighted awe the music of the thunder ; the fearful voice of the storm-lashed ocean and the wild career of the wintry tempest made his heart only beat faster with the exulting sense of the possession of immortal energies , of which winds and waves were but feeble types . Passions stronger than death , aspirations with wings like eagles , and trembling sensibilities , swayed and possessed him by turns , and he could express all the moods of his mind in tones of melting sweetness or thrilling impressiveness . Add to these an intellect that never tired , an eye that never slept , various and accurate knowledge of books and things , and the most stainless moral purity , and you have all the materials of a first rate poet . Endowed with these ra ( liant gifts , why has not Mr. Percival written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a Prince at // whose birth all the Fairies attended , and bestowed upon him all that was asked by his fond parents , except one malicious sprite , who had taken offence at not being invited , or some such cause , and who , in revenge , bestowed upon the royal infant some unhappy defect , which made his whole life a series of crosses and vexations , and tainted all his shining virtues and graces . Thus , if nature had stopped short with the gifts we have enumerated , she would have been truly kind . But , unfortunately , she did not . She gave him that facility of composition which is so fatal , and that dread of the " limw labor , " without which nothing truly great ever was or ever will be accomplished . Mr. Percival writes poetry , apparently , with as much ease as a man answers an invitation to dinner , and as much pleasure , as he goes afterwards , when he is sure of pleasant conversation and good cheer . When the fit of composition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions till his mind is exhausted , but he shrinks from the second and equally important work of sitting down in cold blood and correcting , condensing , lopping off what is superfluous , and giving that minute finish which requires the chisel and the file . In consequence , he has written a great deal , or rather , a great many times , too much . We have often wished that we could apply the process of distillation to his works , and reduce them to about one-tenth of their present bulk . We are sure that it would be doing much for his fame . These few remarks contain , as we conceive , the key to his excellencies and his defects . But we are not willing to dismiss a man of so much genius with a meagre notice ; and , as there is in his works much to admire and a good deal to censure , we do not know of any better way of stating our impressions of them , than by enumerating , in the good old style , their merits and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reading his poetry , the first thing that strikes us , is his creativeness . The wealth of his mind is unbounded , and he lavishes it with spendthrift prodigality . There is an abundance of dazzling images , gorgeous expressions , and rich pictures . The thoughts may be too much amplified , may be expressed imperfectly , and may run into each other in the most tangled confusion ; but still there is no lack of them . There is none of that barrenness , which awakens no emotion , and provokes no criticism . This is , after all , the distinguishing excellence of a poet . Invention is the surest proof of genius . Where there is good matter , we can put up with a host of defects in manner . In the rose-gardens of Pa*stum we would not quarrel with , here and there , a weed . He is remarkable , too , for a quality closely allied to this power of originating , and that is versatility . He goes from one style to another with perfect ease , and appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a contemplative poem , reminding us of the productions of the Lake School ,  --  as it is called by those critics who abuse those works without ever having read them ,  --  such as " Poetry , " " Love of Study , " " Mental Beauty , " " Mental Harmony , " &amp;c . Here is one which belongs entirely to the affections , such as " Night Watching . " Then we encounter a piece of glowing eloquence which stirs the blood , like the ringing of spurs and the flap of banners , like " New-England , " " The Greek Emigrant 's song , " the " Address to the Eagle , " &amp;c . On // the next page , we are called upon to behold the convulsed workings of dark bosoms , wrung with sorrow and disappointment , and to listen to the moanings of a spirit , whose delicate texture has been crushed by the rude encounters of the world ; as in the " Suicide , " and the " Broken Heart . " We do not mean to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the contrary , we prefer those product.ions of his , which are marked by their fine lyric animation , such as " New-England , " and their vivid imagery , such as the Serenade ' ' and Painting , ' ' to those long musings in blank verse , which express the feelings that lie hid in the depths of the soul and do not describe the storms that agitate its surface . It is in this class of poetry , above all others , that mediocrity is intolerable . Meditative poetry must he first-rate , or it is merely a dull essay in measure . There is great danger that we shall be only cloudy when we mean to be sublime , and muddy when we mean to be deep . There has always been a charm to us in Mr. Percival 's poetry , from its apearing to be so much the natural expression of his thoughts . His mind seems to exhale poetry as flowers do their fragrance . He puts his soul into every line . He seems to love and venerate his noble art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pleasures derived from any other source . He does not write poetry to gain wealth , to attract attention , or to escape from the tyranny of unhappy thoughts , but because he is a poet , and can not help it . Hence , notwithstanding the variety of his productions , they are all imbued with the same spirit . there is no wit , no humor , no satire , no stern Crabbe like observation of men and things . The beauty-giving light of poetry hangs over every thing . Many of his best poems are those upon Greece , either suggested by recollections of her glory when she was in her " palmy state , " when her heroes were as numerous as her men and her history was poetry put into action , or inspired by the enthusiasm awakened by her recent struggles . It is not enough to say of these productions that they glow with the fire of Pindar and Eschylus ; they show the author 's heart-felt admiration of what he commemorates , and his deep sympathy with oppressed men , struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all very creditable to the man , but is nothing , one way or another , to his poetry ; but we do not think so . It is paying no mean compliment to poetry , to say of it that it makes you like its author , and wish to become acquainted with him . And such , we think , is the effect produced by Mr. Percival 's . He is a very picturesque writer . This is a word which every body can understand , and a merit which every body can appreciate . His poetry abounds with it . We may mention , by way of proof , not because it is the most striking instance , but because it happens to occur to us , a beautiful poem entitled " Painting . " In the distinctness of its images , it rivals its subject . Let a dozen painters attempt to illustrate it , and their pictures would necessarily resemble each other very much , because so little is left to the imagination . The eye sees the objects described as it reads the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student of nature . He has observed the outward world in its minutest details . He describes it with the feeling of a poet , and at the same time with something of a scientific accuracy . We can not resist the pleasure of quoting one of his pictures , which is as good as // almost any thing of the kind in the language , and we do it the more willingly , as it occurs in one of his long poems , the " Wreck , " which we suspect has not been generally read . " The sun was setting , and his last rays threw Bright colors on the clouds that hung around The mountains , dimly rising in the west , Over a broad expanse of sheeted gold , On which a ship lay floating . It was calm -- Her sails were set , hut yet the dying wind Scarce moved them , as they trembled on the yard With an uncertain motion . She arose , As a swan rises on her gilded wings , When on a lake at sunset she uprears Her form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far blue ether-so that ship Seemed lifted from the waters , and suspended , Winged with her bright sails , in the silent air . The moral character of Mr. Percival 's writing is almost always uniformly good . He respects all that is respectable . His chief happiness consists in the enjoyment of the refined pleasures of the intellect . With a fervent admiration of the great qualities displayed by heroes and patriots on extraordinary occasions , he exalts into their proper rank the quiet affections that bloom along the daily path of life . He has much of that devotional feeling which no true poet ever was without , though , to our knowledge , he has written no poetry , that can properly be called devotional . But to this praise we must make one slight exception . He now and then , as in the case of the " Suicide , " and the " Broken Heart , " falls into the demoralizing , ( for we do not hesitate to call it so ) misanthropic strain of those , who groan and make faces that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins with the names of misfortunes . Mr. Percival should be above such poor business as this . We presume that he has had his share of the troubles of life , and that his sensitive and poetic temperament has made tbe sting of sorrow sharper ; but who shall be permanently cheerful if the man of genius be not ? He has that within him , which should make him defy a " sea of troubles . " He has the power to look Fortune full in the face , till he forces her to smile . Into his hands is put the key to the book of life ,  --  a book , gloomy to those only who half understand it . One great defect of Mr. Percival 's poetry arises from the discursive peculiarity of his mind , and the readiness with which it yields to the most casual associations . He proceeds but a little way in a train of thought , when some unlucky image , or , may be , word , seduces him from his path-he wanders on farther and farther , and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , we are completely lost in a tangled intricacy of wild-wood fancies . In endeavoring to recall what we have been over , we find nothing but a confused mass of images , shapeless as clouds and indistinct as the recollections of a dream . The brain becomes giddy and aches with the rapidity and abruptness with which he darts from one thing to another . The greatest scope is given to this quality , of course , in his long poems , and consequently they are the most indifferent of all his productions . Take , for instance , the longest of them all , " Prometheus . " Here is the raw material , if we may so say , of a fine poem-abundance of images , no lack of ideas , a copious poetical vocabulary , and single stanzas of great // splendor and beauty ; but it is wrought up in defiance , it would almost seem , of the natural laws of association and the common rules of composition . It is deficient in that crowning merit of interest , without which all others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it . Earth , air , and sea , the past and the present , the world of sense and the world of thought , are ransacked for images which have no relation to each other , but that of juxtaposition . It reminds us of a beautiful landscape covered over with a thick fog . We wait impatiently for the veil to roll away , and strain our eyes to catch a glimpse of the fields , the woods , the habitations of men , and the glittering spires of churches  --  but in vain ; we can not get even a frame to hold the picture which our own imagination would create . Another of his long poems , the " Wreck , " is much better . Here is a story-as slight and simple as any thing can well be  --  but still a connected narrative ; and however far he may wander , he must go back to the point from which he started before he can proceed . But neither of them are to be compared with some of his fugitive pieces . We venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by heart his " Consumption , " and " Coral Grove " as have read through either of the others . Having mentioned these two beautiful and popular little poems , we can not help stopping for a moment to express our admiration of them . We never read them without thinking " 0 si SZC omnia dixisset . " The latter , in particular , is one of the most exquisite pieces of fancy ever wrought in the brain of man . His whole mind , in conceiving it , seems to have " suffered a sea-change . " It is one of those things which have a peculiar power over a reader 's mind , and which throw it into the same track of thought in which the writer 's must have been when he composed it . We forget the land and all its sights and sounds we hear the dash of the waves and see their foamy crests ; our imagination brings up before us all the beautiful images and forms with which poetry and nature have peopled the deep ; shells of rare hues and shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trees of coral , and mermaids , charming the " yellow moonlight sea " with their songs . But Mr. Percival 's great defect is exuberance in thought and diffuseness in style . He repeats the same idea over and over again in different forms , and always at great length . Some of the periods in his blank verse poems seem to have no end to them , and are , after all , nothing more than the excessive amplification of a thought that might have been expressed in three lines . He crowds upon you , image after image , and all in illustration of one idea ; and , in the use of language , he is equally luxuriant . He is master of the wealth of his native tongue , and does not care who knows it . He uses ten words , where one would do , and words , too , of that dazzling , showy character , which draw the attention to themselves , away from what they express . Now there is no kind of reading which a man tires of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him forget the sense . There is no fault more fatal to a poet than this . He must be simple and concise , or he will be merely read and not remembered . Let any man make an experiment for himself . Let him take a writer remarkable for his brevity-let him , for instance , read a page of Dante , either in the original or in Mr. Carey 's excellent translation-then let him read a page of Mr. Percival 's blank verse-and , after an hour , let him com // pare his recollections of the two . This is a blemish arising , no doubt , from his composing with great rapidity , while his miiid is strongly excited , and from that nervous unwillingness , which he doubtless has in common with all men who write only when the fit is on them , to correct their productions after they have grown cold . If this be the case , it may easily be amended , and , indeed , the natural growth of the mind does much towards removing it . There is another defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a careless and slovenly versifier . In his rhymed poems he does not often offend a taste that is not over nice , though he sometimes is partial to his lines in the matter of syllables , and uses rhymes that one would look for in vain in Walker , accommodating as he is . But in his blank verse , he often forgets rhythm , cadence , and every thing else that distinguishes it from prose . It is poetry only to the eye . It has none of that majestic march , and solemn , organ-like music , for which Milton is so remarkable . To be sure , it is difficult , when one writes from an overflowing mind , in blank verse , to pause and give every line a musical intonation ere he can go on ; but let it be remembered , that there is an unassuming sort of dignity about prose , and he , who gives up this advantage , must furnish something better in its stead . We hiss an actor , though he speak as well as the friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must speak a great deal better if , on that ground alone , he claim our admiration . Why has Mr. Percival been so long silent ? Do we live in so prosaic an age and country , that a poet should cease writing as soon as he arrives at years of discretion ? Let no man accuse us of inconsistency , because we now invite him to write more , when , a few pages back , we said he had written too much . Most of his poetry was composed at an age that secures it from severe criticism , and his faults are such as every year will do something towards removing . He can not have left off from want of encouragement . He can not complain that he has not been appreciated by the public , however he may have been patronized by the booksellers . We are certain that he has done nothing equal to what he can do , and we hope he will break upon us , all of a sudden , ere long , with a splendid poem . Our criticisms relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be unappropriate to mention that he is a profound and elegant scholar , and of the most diligent habits of study . He has been , we understand , engaged for some time past , in a new edition , or rather re-translation , of Malte Brun 's Geography  --  a work of Herculean labor , and which , we hope , will be a source of as much profit to him as of advantage to the community.
