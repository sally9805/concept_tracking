txt I GREATLY love , and I may say too , respect , the art of Music . It enters very largely , more largely than we are apt to think , iifto our enjoyments . From the highest to the lowest in the land , from the church to the cobbler 's stall , from the theatre and the concert room to the sidewalk and the cellar , every where , and at all times , we hear the sound of music ; and few sing but the happy . It is rare to meet with those who do not relish and understand this art , in some of its forms . We are all ready to acknowledge our obligations to it for many a pleasant hour . Yet there are not many who will allow it to be any thing more than the source of a momentary , perishing enjoyment-at most , and at best , a mere luxury , doing little in any condition of society to advance or secure its more valuable and permanent interests . To this opinion , however , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better praise . For my own part , I can not but think that the cause of civilization , of intellectual progress and refinement , even of morals and religion itself lie under serious obligations to the science and the art of music .. We may say of music , that , like poetry , its foundation is laid in the nature the Creator has given us . The earliest literature of a people is poetry ; partly because poetry is the language of feeling and affection-and these sentiments possess the mind long before it learns to reason and compare  --  and partly because poetry , by the music of its cadences , serves as an important aid to the memory . But music is the instrument , by which poetry has , from the beginning , wrought its chief effect ; it is the language which , even at the present day , it uses when it would make the deepest impression upon the heart . Wherever poetry has been found , there has music been found also , her inseparable companion . We can not , therefore , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , when music was not ; we can not , with them , refer it , for its origin , to the imitation of the warbling of birds , or of the wind , sighing among the reeds by the river 's side . Men , constituted as he now is , was never without music in his soul . He never , surely , wanted the organs for uttering melody . Can we with more pr* 58 // priety deny him a soul capable of those emotions which can find vent only , or best , in song ? If he has ever had an eye to see the beauties of creation , a mind to comprehend them , a heart to feel , and a tongue to utter them ,  --  and this is poetry ,  --  so has he ever had an ear tuned to catch all the harmony of sound which nature pours from a thousand sources , a heart to feel it , and organs capable of returning that harmony with the increased effect of nature 's finest instrument , the human voice ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never has been apeople without music . Among the rudest barbarians of the present day we hear of the war-song and the death-song . Our earliest notices of the earliest tribes of the earth , show that this divine art has always existed among men . We may refer , in proof of this assertion , as far back as to the remotest period of the Jewish record , even to Jubal , " the father of all such as handle the harp and the organ . " Throughout the whole course of the Jewish history , we meet with those who were skillful to play upon divers instruments . The Psalms of David were sung to solemn chants , of correspondent excellence , we have a right to suppose , to the beauty and grandeur of the poetry whose sentiment they were to express . In Egypt , music found an early home ; as the forms of musical instruments-were there no other proof-painted upon her everlasting monuments in her undying pigments abundantly testify . The poems of Homer , we well know , were sung ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the verse . Anacreon and Sappho sang their odes to the lyre . Pindar , it is said , sang himself to airs his own soul prompted , those magnificent odes which have immortalized him ; and that in the poetic contests in which he engaged , he so often bore away the palm , is , perhaps , in part at least , to be ascribed to the related fact , that he excelled his competitors in the power , compass , and command of his voice . We may hence with confidence maintain , that the first steps of the human race in the path of civilization and intellectual culture , are to be referred , as to other causes , so in part , to the power of music over the human soul . Who will believe that the ancient poetry which , before the invention of alphabetic writing , it was necessary to communicate orally , would have wrought the wonders ascribed to it , had it been recited in the rigid style of declamation ? It was music which imparted to it its popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to melt , to win . It was the Phrygian mode which roused the martial spirit of the fiery Macedonian , and soft Lydian " measures , that soothed his soul to pleasures . " Upon the philosopher in his retirement , poetry might , indeed , have had equal power , had it been simply rehearsed ; or , after writing had become an art , when read from the leaves of the papyrus . But upon the rude and uncultivated populace , the choicest strains of the moral and descriptive poet would have died away in emptiness , had not melody won for them a way to the deepest recesses of the soul . We arrive at the same conclusion when we look at the revival of music after the overthrow of the Western empire , and the weaving together of new nations out of the materials furnished by the breaking up of the Roman power , and the irruption of the Teutonic tribes . It is from Provence we hear the first breatbings of the poetic muse ; but // they are borne to us upon the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his instrument the wild legends with which he entertained the knights and ladies of the Castle Hall ; or he was attended by the Songleur who accompanied him with his harp and voice . Indeed , the path to poetic fame was entered at the gate of music . He who aspired to be a poet , first followed the Troubadour in quality of musician . Nor do we often hear , at that period , of poetry being offered to the world otherwise than through the medium of song . Even so late as thelifteenth century we find the celebrated Pulci singing-not reading or reciting  --  but singing , his Morgante Maggiore at the table of Lorenzo de Medici . Let it not be thought that because I claim for music this close alliance with poetry , and contend that the poet has been , and is still , indebted to this art for much of his power over mankind , I would therefore crown it with an equal honor . It needs not exaggerated praise to give it a very enviable rank among polite arts and the undisputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly , can fail to assign to poetry the first place among those arts whose chief end is to please . No one , unless borne away by a mad enthusiasm , would dare to raise even Handel , Haydn or Mozart , to a level with Homer , Dante and Milton , or say that the sublime compositions of those remarkable men can be compared with the divine strains of these monarchs of the poetic art . But although we cheerfully yield to poetry this supreme excellence , it may not be so easy to determine to which of the other fine arts , sculpture , painting , architecture , music , shall be allowed precedence in the next degree . The most impartial might , perhaps , find it difficult to decide between the amount of intellectual pleasure derived from gazing upon the faultless proportions of the Pantheon , upon the beauties of the Venus or Apollo , upon the master-pieces of Raffaelle or Domenichino , or from listening to the choicest strains of Beethoven , Mozart , or Cimarosa . If from the union of music with poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part it has taken in the early refinement of our race , we feel warranted to regard it as something more and better than a mere luxury , a mere parlor ornament . we are strengthened in the conclusion when we view it in connexion with intellect and genius . Music , con*idered as a science , presents a study among the most subtle and profound with which the human mind is ever called to cope . In all its learned details , it tasks the most acute and philosophic mind to discover , arrange and define its principles . There are few , even of those who excel in the various departments of practice , who are competent to master the science of their art , or reach a thorough comprehension of its deep laid principles . And even considered as an art , music is an accomplishment , which , in its highest excellence , can never be dissociated in our mind , from truly exalted talent and a soul touched by the finest sensibilities . It implies and demands the *exactest perceptions , the most rapid intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discrimination a rare feeling , and that power of throwing the whole soul , as it were , into an instrument , or pouring it out in the voice , which is better denominated genius than anything else . Who will deny genius to Catalani , Malibran , or Paganini ? And when we see united , in an individual , the knowledge of music as a science , a profound acquaintance with the // whole doctrine of harmony , the inventive mind which records upon immortal pages its original conceptions of melody and harmony , and that manual dexterity which wields the most difficult instrument with a perfect mastery , we are presented with an example of intellectual power , hardly surpassed in any other department of knowledge or art . 1*Lead an overture of Haydn or Mozart , or listen to it , simply as a study of human intellect , and you will confess that the mind which could invent those airs and harmonies , could , in each note , as it was written , calculate the precise effect of an orchestra of an hundred instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interweave , separate and reunite them , so as to produce that matchless result by which you are entranced , is of the rarest order of human genius . Who can listen to the almost more than earthly strains of the Messiah , or the Creation , and not feel that the intellect which composed them would , under other circumstances , have controlled senates by the power of eloquence , stamped its immortality upon the canvass or the marble , or recorded its glowing thoughts in imperishable verse ? Genius , as it has shone in music , is of a nature as ethereal and rare , as when it astonishes us in any other branch of learning or art ; and it c*annot be that nature will reproduce her Handels , her Haydns , her Mozarts , in greater profusion than her Homers , her Titians , or her Canovas . When we see how much genius has been poured into modern music , that minds full of power , and hearts full of sensibility , have invented the melodies and the harmonies which delight us , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within itself , the springs of an immense moral influence ? I believe its influences are , for the most part , healthful and invigorating . History and observation combine to represent those as benefactors of a community , who introduce and cultivate a taste for this agreeable art . Its undoubted tendency is to soften , refine , and elevate . If , indeed , it be viewed only as it exists in the great theatrical establishments of the corrupt capitals of Europe , it may seem , and it may be , rather the pander of a debilitating luxury , than the minister of true refinement . Or , if it be considered only in the disastrous effects its practice has so often had upon the characters and habits of those who make music their profession , it may be thought an art that brings mischief rather than profit to a community . But , turning from at least so partial a view , look at this art as it contributes to the pure , quiet , fire-side enjoyments of almost every family throughout Europe and America , affording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , withholding the young by its charms from many a pleasure and many a vice , to which ennui would otherwise impel them ; look at it in its connexion with the rites and services of our holy religion , and you will be constrained to admit that , if it sometimes issues in evil , it exerts , in a much greater proportion , a pure , wholesome , saving influence . The tendency , the natural tendency of music , as of poetry , is to soften and refine . Who would not rather expect to meet with gentleness , urbanity , kindness of heart , and a certain general air of refinement and elegance , among the lovers and disciples of music , than the opposite traits of coarseness , rudeness , incivility , and cruelty ' ? The world has ever been of this opinion , and facts show it to be well founded . The characteristic cruelty of the inhabitants of Cyn*thmn , wu a.ttributed , by the Greek writers , to their neglect and contempt of // music . And a learned historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivation of music would have power to counteract the effects of a harsh and wintry climate upon the character . Had the Romans been lovers of music , had it been a national taste , is it possible their early traits of barbarism should have clung to them as they did , even to the last ? Would a people with music in their souls have delighted in the savage spectacles of the circus , in the fights of gladiators , and the destruction of captives and malefactors , by wild beasts ? In moderirtimes , we have the well-attested story-remarkable for the testimony it bears to the moral power of music-of the hired assassins , sent in pursuit of the unfortunate Stradella , melted to tears , and changed to very women in their purposes of blood , by the moving strains of their victim . And do we not notice effects in ourselves , upon our own dispositions and affections , wrought by the sorcery of this art of arts , which render perfectly credible every account that has reached us of its almost miraculous influences ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos of many of the ancient ballads ? Who can hear the touching melody of " Auld Robin Gray , " from the lips of one whose soul glows with sensibility , and who can throw that sensibility into the voice , and not confess himself a very child , to be moulded at will , by the power of this siren muse ? The effects of music through the national airs of different countries are not less astonishing . The exile of Switzerland , never hears , without tears , the song of his native valleys ; and so potent has been its spell upon her soldiery when engaged in foreign service , filling their minds with sweet images of home , that it has been found necessary to forbid the singing of it , under the severest penalties . The streets of Paris have again and again borne witness to the moral power of her songs of freedom . What Frenchman , whose patriotism during the " three days , " did not leap to the barricades , roused by the spirit-stirring notes of the sacred hymn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , and seclusion , and peace , whose pulse beats not quicker as he hears , now the low and wailing tones which speak of sons , and daughters , and wives , slain by tyranny , and anon the triumphant shout , which calls upon the sons of freedom to march to victory or death ? Let the metaphysician ascribe as much of this power as he may to the principle of association , and the charms of verse ; enough will be left to prove the residence of an immense moral power , a beautiful and a sacred power , in the art we love . Music has ever been in close alliance with religion . In the Pagan and the Hebrew religions , the power of music was well understood by the priest , and acknowledged by the worshiper ; and in Christianity , from the first hymn sung by the Savior of the world , in company with the ehosen twelve , to the present moment , music has boasted a divine power to cheer , to comfort , to support , and excite the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music fled for shelter , during those ages of uproar and barbarism , which succeeded the first establishment of Christianity upon the throne of the world , and the subsequent overthrow of that throne ; and it was there , in the quiet of monastic se* clusion , that her lost honors were gradually restored , and the founda. tions laid for those grand developments of musical genius , which have conferred an enduring celebrity upon the last century . Were not the // investigation too extensive for these pages , it would be equally interesting and instructive , to trace this art from its first dawnings in the discoveries of Flavianus , bishop of Antioch , in the fourth century , through Ambrose of Milan , in the fifth , Pope Gregory the seventh , Guido Aretino , in the eleventh ,  --  the supposed inventor of counterpoint ,  --  the monk Hubald , John de Muris , and others , to the meridian splendor of the close of the eighteenth , when the works of the great modern composers broke upon the world , and the art seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music owes something to the church , the church owes more , infinitely more , to music . It makes a large part of the religion of Christians of almost every communion ; and it is the religious power of music , its power to kindle the feelings , to raise devotion , to calm the passions , to subdue the will , for which the Christian will ever chiefly honor and love it . That vast religious power is lodged in this art , no one can doubt who is familiar with its history . The Catholic church has long known how to avail herself of the services of this potent ally . That church has not been more famous for the gorgeous pomp of her numerous rites , the magnificence of her temples , her painted ceilings , her sculptured marbles , than for the unrivalled excellence of her mu* sic ,  --  unrivalled for its power to melt and subdue the heart . Other communions have by no means kept pace with that of Rome in this department of worship . Yet , even in our own churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there goes forth from it an influence which , as religion could ill spare , so she longs to see clothed with all that power which of right belongs to it . For I would say that , if there are " tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stones , " so there are homilies of surpassing eloquence , read to the feeling heart , in those solemn strains of vocal harmony which rise from the assembled congregation , or flow from the well instructed choir . I have often thought  --  and I believe my own is the experience of many-that I have received a more salutary impression from the music of the choir , than from the wisdom of the pulpit . The young are particularly open to these influences . How much then is not lost to religion by the very imperfect , nay , almost rude and barbarous style in which the music of the church is so often performed ? But how much soever may be said in commendation of music , as an innocent amusement , a principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion , I am aware that by many moralists , it has been condemned , with the other fine arts , as unworthy the man whose mind is influenced by the high considerations of philosophy , much more penetrated with a sense of his religious duties and relations . But , for myself , I can not subscribe to a judgement so indiscriminating and sweeping . I would not , indeed , contend that to all or either of them , the same rank should be assigned , in which we place , by common consent , the pursuits of literature and science , philosophy and religion ; nor allow that the mind is innocent which finds , in either of them , its chief and only good . But then , on the other hand , they are neither of them in oppoSition to Heaven , or Heaven 's will . They all spring , as necessary results , from tastes , desires , and capacities , which the Creator // has implanted . And they can not be condemned by the reasonable man-except in their abuse-till HE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly , spreads over the heavens the purple hues of sunset , and tunes the voice of the nightingale . Where Heaven has originated , man surely may imitate without guilt . As a people , it may be regretted that we have displayed no musical genius , and not much musical taste . We not only have no national music ,  --  we have scarcely a single composer . Thus far we have done nothing in this art , to correspond with what has been achieved in the related arts of poetry and painting , or even in architecture and sculp .. ture . We have poets whom we are proud to call ours , and whose genius the literary world of Europe as well as of America , has not been slow to acknowledge . We have produced , and do still produce , painters , whose works are esteemed and sought wherever there is a taste for art . But the niche of music is vacant . We have no composers whose names are familiar household terms , like those of West and Copley and Trumbull , Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not that there is reason for mortification or discouragement . In other lands , the birth and growth of this art has been almost equally late and slow . If Germany , that land where music now springs indigenous from the soil , had nothing that could be called music before the time of Keyser , if France had none before Lulli , or England before Purcell , we surely need not blush for the state of the art among ourselves , however low it may be . As for Italy , that home of brilliant genius , it seems always to have been in advance of the rest of the world , in all that relates to the elegant arts . If Petrarch and Dante were the fathers of modern poetry ; if Da Vinci and Raffaelle have given lessons to the world in painting , Bramante and Palladio in architecture , M. Angelo and Canova in sculpture , Scarlatti , Cavaliere , and Pergolese have , in the same way , been our masters and guides in music . The opera , and sacred oratorio , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the Euridice of Rinuccini-was not performed till the year 1690 , yet so rapid was the progress of the art among this gifted people , that , in Venice alone , in the space of a little more than twenty years , a hundred original operas were performed ; and , throughout Italy , in the period of less than a century ,  --  the seventeeuth ,  --  more than seven hundred . Still I would not exchange our own national character for that of the Germans , or that of the Italians . But I wish we had more of the passion , which distinguishes them for that delightful and I must add , useful art , in whose praise I have said these few things.
