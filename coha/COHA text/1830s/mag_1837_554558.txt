txt ON one point , unfortunately , Miss Martineau could have been at no loss , from the moment of deciding to write a book of Travels in this country . America her theme , satire was to " be her song ; " the bookseller and his patrons are to be satisfied with no less than a pungent piquancy of remark , and this they stand ready to compensate with no stinted bounty . To an Englishman with the advantage of some notoriety at home to start with , and some shrewdness in the selection of materials which any journey in a foreign country will supply , a tour in America is a pretty fortune . Thus the nests of the respectable line of the Fearons , Fidlers , Halls , Hamiltons , and Trollopes , are understood to have been comfortably feath // ered . XVhen Mrs. Butler , in the exuberance of her *vanton spirits , and the petulance of her unmanageable wit , had thrown off a mass of pleasantries about her future home , some of which her maturer judgment disapproved , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which deform her page to the reader 's eye , gave far more annoyance to the parties concerned in the money investment . No wonder . As often as those lines of stars stand in the place of some wellturned jeer , they probably represent a good golden guinea on the wrong side of the account of sales . The more praise is due to the honest and womanly feeling that made the sacrifice . The point of view , from which Miss Martineau should look upon tl ) is country , was dictated to her in advance by her position in her own . A vine clasping the gnarled oak of the Westminster Review ,  --  a Benthamite economist , - a radical of the radicals , - she was bound to commend , in general terms , the democratic spirit of our institutions , even if it should he found that , when she came to specifications , she was playing , with an English instinct , into aristocratic hands . With these obvious considerations in view , we were able in part to escape a perplexity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first comments on Miss Martineau s work . It so happened , that , appearing just after the completion of our last number , and other matters being then upon our hands , some weeks elapsed before we found a convenient time to satisfy such curiosity as we had respecting it . Meanwhile , we could not but observe the fact , that , while all readers found much in it to be vehemently condemned , most found something to be strongly praised . Everybody 's prejudices , loves , hates , dreams , seemed to be " cottoned to " somewhere in these two compendious volumes ; everybody 's tastes and feelings to be outraged somewhere else . There could be no mistake about it ; for the newspapers , of all inclinings , held the same ambiguous language as the drawingrooms . We listened to all , with a very moderate degree of surprise . We said to ourselves , If a good-natured report were what was wanted , we can understand how a liberal should write upon our national character , at least upon our national institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , being the inspiring Muse , Church and King the key-note , we n ) ight safely enough guess ,  --  but that some experience has spared us the need of guessing , - how bruised and black-balled we were to come out of a tourist 's hands . // But the present case is neither the one nor the other . The position is peculiar . The wholesale democrat is to act the satyrist in a democratic country . Friends and foes across the water are both to have their portion in due season . The rdle is a difficult one to play . Rather , it would be so , to any one who should see its difficulties , and care for them . But the preliminary question disposed of , a single course remains . There must he a free giving and taking , from beginning to end of the book ; and if any reader is at the trouble of ohserving that the parts do not hang well together , he can have the reconciling of them for his pains . Moreover , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received with a very cordial hospitality in most parts of the country . Hers have not been merely the opportunities for collecting facts and opinions , which the public house and public conveyance furnish . Except when in transit , she has hardly seen the interior of our hotels . With that friendly welcome which happily a respectable woman may here command , she has been admitted to the unsuspicious confidence of very many a fireside . If there prevails to any extent , a sentiment which she has not heard expressed ; if there exists so much as a singularity , in any class of minds , which has escaped her knowledge ; if there is any misapprehension or exaggeration even , that haunts the musing and the wayward , which has not been mourned over in her hearin if there is any one of those morbid vagaries , into which weak heads are impelled by sour or restless tempers , that in some t*te-&amp;-t*te has not been commended to her patronage , of course some unaccountable accident must have been the cause . If , among the unlucky oddities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , is rife , there are any which she has not marked , she is not the observing person we had been led to take her for . Undoubtedly , if she has been careful to pack as she went , she has put up another Pandora 's box , full of discordant mischiefs , such as an inexperienced antiquity had not the art to feign . If she have been a mere credulous listener , careful only to reflect honestly from her own mind the various views which have been held up to it by different parties , and cliques , and confidants , no marvel that her readers , belonging severally to the same classes as her several informers , should each encounter now and then that which precisely suits , as well as often that which vexes them . So much for our poor theory by way of accounting for a // rather peculiar fact . An examination of the book has only so far convicted us of error , as that we find the inconsistencies , which we had been led to look and account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he no less apparent in the treatment of questions of a more ahstract and philosophical character . Here , of course , the fault is no longer in the author 's " stars , hut in herself . " It is unpleasant saying it of one , whose mind has been exercised in such studies as those of Miss Martineau , hut a sense of truth extorts from us the declaration , that only one thing has struck us more , in reading her volumes , than the extreme inexactness and confusion of ideas which pervades them . True it is , that philosophical tours are not to he satisfactorily written , like picturesque tours , by the road-side ; and we are ready to believe that this work would have been reduced to more consistency , but for the haste in which it is understood to have been at last tossed to the press . As it is , it is out of the question for us to undertake either to controvert all of its doctrines which we account erroneous , or select what we find reason to approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed on a large variety of subjects , from a heap of tangled ravellings of thought ; and we have no courage for a task so much like that of the fairy tale . Should we attempt the former , when we were flattering ourselves that we had made out our case in opposition to one part of the book , we should but make ourselves liable to be referred to some other page , and told that what we had been urging was precisely what was there illustrated . Jortin , we believe it was , who said of Ecclesiastical History , that it was a Briareus , with a hundred hands , each smiting against the rest . Miss Martineau is no Briareus , nor a giant of any kind ; hut assuredly , her fair palms do smite against each other , most spiritedly , from beginning to end of her book . We have said , that there was one thing in Miss Martineau 's work , which had struck us even more than its want of clearness and consistency of thought . It is a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are enforced by high authority to look on it as an alarming prognostic of permanent misuse of her . decidedly uncommon powers . " Seest thou , " said the Jewish sage , " a man wise in his own conceit ? There is more hope of a fool , than of him . " Miss Martineau is no fool ; - we have been looking over some of her earlier // writings to renew the satisfaction of our minds upon that head ; - there would be more hope of her , if she were . She has talent enough to embolden her in her perversities ; to make her imagine , that she sees the bearings of an argument , and the merits of a system , as clearly as she certainly does the features of a landscape , and the common springs of action in society ; and to win commendations for her , which she too hastily interprets into a warrant for a very boisterous proclamation of very suddenly formed opinions . Lively talent there is no denying her , and skill in writing . Her " Traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Times of the Saviour , " the work which introduced her to the American reading public , we have not seen since its first appearance ; but we well remember to have read it then with uncommon pleasure . We have heard the " Five Years of Youth , " called her best production , but we can not profess to be ourselves of that opinion . An agreeable tone of gentle and just feeling pervades it , and the moral is of the first importance ; but this , after being indicated somewhat too roundly , as it strikes us , at the beginning of the tale , is then made to wait too long for fiii'ther inculcation . The story lags , and the lesson is scarcely helped along , till the reader has been conducted to the last scenes , when it is impressed , powerfully it is true , but by means of rather improbable incidents . Of the Prize Essays on Religious Subjects , we have seen but one ; and that , we must own , appeared to us decidedly crude and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , composed of contributions to periodical works , we find several pieces which appear to us to be entitled to preservation in this form , though the work has failed to meet the taste of our American 1 ) urchasers . Miss Martineau would , however , probably prefer to rest her reputation on her series of writings , ostensibly illustrative of the principles of Economics ; the " Illustrations of Political Economy , " " Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated , " and " Illustrations of Taxation . " We have no doubt , that in this preference she is right , though our high estimation of the books in question would be founded on different merits , from what give them value in her eyes . Some of them*are charming fictions , - disclosinb a shrewd observation of life and character , and often no little dramatic power . As to the economical doctrines which they were intended to enforce , - true or false , - it was neither any novel nor any marvellously // striking character which they possessed , that gave the writings popularity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was any , was , that they had installed themselves in a young woman 's brain . Like Pope 's grubs in amber , " The things , we know , are neither rich nor rare , But wonder how * * * they got there . " We are not about to contest their truth . We have too much consideration for our twenty or thirty faithful South Carolina patrons , the whole number , that , from a very respectable roll , our former lucubrations on the subject have left us . We say no more than that the ' heartiest friend of a protecting system , and the related doctrines , may read those works without always having his pleasure in any degree alloyed by what he might account their heresies . We have just risen from the perusal of one . " Albeit unused to the melting mood , " it made us weep , so pathetic and well-imagined was the story . But as to any theory therein exhibited , we declare ourselves to have been utterly innocent of so much as a suspicion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summaries of Principles , " so judiciously placed at the end , ( like the prudent painter 's subscription , " this is a house , " ) to illustrate to the reader , what it was that had been illustrated . But whether these little books were somewhat better or somewhat less good , they by no means sufficed to justify the egregious self-complacency , in whose halo their writer was revealed to the " wondering upturned gaze of mortals , " on this side of the water . " That degree of self-confidence , " says Miss Martinean , since her return , ( Travels , Vol. ii . p. 164 , ) " which is commonly called conceit , grows in favor with me perpetually . " We are incredulous . Till we have some more disinterested corroboration of the statement , we shall adhere to the opinion , that that sentiment had reached its height in this lady , long before her departure from the United States , and that it was scarcely capable of any accession of strength from the time when her first footstep was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman , in whom it appeared to have reached such a morbid developement . Her coming was an Avatar . Her progress through the country was a Visitation and Inspection . Had any thing recalled her suddenly , she would doubtless have addressed a letter to the President , like the young Frenchman , Louis Buonaparte , to explain the ap // parent disrespect of not repairing to Washington , to wait upon the head of the nation . Sooth to say , this delusion of fancied importance was a phenomenon . It was not laughable ; like one of Matthews 's best exhibitions , it was absolutely too liidicrous to laugh at . So perfect was it in its kind , as to reach the point of a sort of sublimity . . Iliiiror magis . We tell no tales , when we say this . We should have known it equally well , had we enjoyed no opportunity of personal observation . The hook before us is only the last act of the play , in which the consistency of the character is well kept up ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should he , but still the same . If the conceit had been all , the pleasure throughout might have heen mutual . The one party might have been happy in the complacency which it diffused , the other in the amusement which it afforded . But as there is a good-natured , so there is a froward and contemptuous , and therefore offensive vanity . Miss Martineau has a word in very free use , when any thing is said or done , which does not meet her views . We do not mean " disgusting , " though that also unduly ahounds ; but " insolent . " To " thank her for teaching us that word , " would be to be thankful for a small favor , and we will not do it . We can not so much as make acknowledgments for any pleasure which her own liberal applications of it have afforded us . It is language commonly thought to indicate neither good sense , good temper , good manners , nor good taste ; especially coming from an accomplished young lady , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least for the meekness , of wisdom . But if it has been even oftener in our minds while we have read the book , than it has been before us on the page , the fault is none of ours . In short , Miss Martineau 's rash and worthless judgments are too often expressed in terms , having an unpleasant character of rude assumption . Captain Hall was not bashful . Captain Hamilton played the " bold dragoon . " Miss Kemble was a brilliant hoyden from the greenroom . Mrs. Trollope , though , in some matters , not wanting in sagacity to see what she was about , was on the whole decidedly and confidently all-knowing and free-spoken . But , in this ungracious peculiarity , the last of the tourists must be owned to be " fairly worth the seven . " We do not care to make a separate point of our author 's facility of belief . Credulity is the almost necessary foible of travellers . If they are to see and hear nothing abroad which // is novel and peculiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ; and particularly if they intend to write a book , the more extraordinary the information which is given them , the better will it serve their turn . One is often , however , cornpelled to observe , that Miss Martinean s easiness of faith is great beyond the common measure . She visits , for instance , the prisoners in the Philadelphia Penitentiary , and pleasantly records , " sooner or later , all told me their stories in full . " It would have been worth while to hear " those sweet confidings of the past " ; only that most persons would have had their satisfaction qualified by the thought , that the inmates of state prisons are not exactly the sort of people , most given to reposing a perfectly ingenuous confidence . Let LIS try some of the issues we have raised , and perhaps one or two others which may fall in our way , by a few extracts from the first Part , of the four into which the work is divided . It is entitled " Politics . " Now Politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious experiments have been trying ( or been being tried , as our author would phrase it , ) make a high theme in the judgment of some discerning minds ; a theme , which , it might be thought , would be approached with some djffidence , by a stranger of a moderate degree of modesty . The poet commemorates a description of persons , who , he says , " rush in , where angels fear to tread . " We certainly do not class Mrs. Trollope with the angelic company , and we have already said , that we are equally far from assigning Miss Martineau to the other class indicated in this antithesis . Yet Mrs. Trollope , in her feminine timidity , was fain to say ; " I am in no one way cOml ) etent to judge of the political institutions of America ; and if I should occasionally make an observation on their effects , as they meet my superficial glance , they will he made in the spirit and with the feeling of a woman , who is apt to tell what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack from effects to their causes . Such observations , if they be unworthy of much attention , are also obnoxious to little reproof ; " and again ; " Both as a woman and a stranger , it might be unseemly for me to say , that I do not like their government ; and therefore I will not say so . " Miss Martineau has no such misgivings . Hear how she despatches two such small matters as the upper house of the national legislature , and the independence of the national judiciary . // " The principle of the general government is , that it governs the entire people as one nation , and not as a league of States . There ought , in consistency with this , to be no state representation at all ; and the Senate is an anomaly . An anomalous institution can not be very long-lived . A second chamber , on a more consistent principle , will probably be established in its place , to fulfil its functions as a Court of Review , and as a check upon the precipitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the encroachments of the executive . There is yet more of compromise involved in this institution of the Senate ; as might be expected , since there is no end of compromise when princi. ple is once departed from ; yet there are statesmen who defend it on other grounds than that its establishment was necessary to the foundation of any federal government at all . One observed to me , Some things look well in theory , and fail in practice . This may not be justifiable in theory ; but it works well . ' If this last sentence be true , the well-working of the Senate is only a temporary affair ; an accident . Its radical change becomes a question of time merely ; and the recent agitation of the question of Instructions seems to indicate that the time is not very far distant . " The appointment of the judges for life is another departure from the absolute republican principle . There is no actual control over them . Theirs is a virtually irresponsible office .. Much can be and is said in defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerfully enforced by the weight of character possessed by the judiciary , up to this day . But all this does not alter the fact , that irresponsible offices are an inconsistency in a republic . With regard to all this compromise , no plea of expediency can alter the fact that , while the House of Rep. resentatives is mainly republican , the Senate is only partially so . being anomalous in its character , and its members not being elected immediately by the people ; and that the judiciary is not republican at all , since the judges are independent of the nation , from the time of their appointment . " - Vol. i. pp. 41 , 42 . Miss Martineau doubtless knows how these things are , hnving given the days and nights of so many years to the study of the masters of political wisdom , and having so signalized herself by the writing of some dozens of agreeable little books . It perplexes one , however , to remember , that there were three persons , not without knowledge and prudence , named Ilamnilton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of thinking , and that the views set forth by them , on these heads , in a book which they put together , and which has ever // since been regarded by us as our manual of constitutional law , were approved with an extraordinary unanimity of assent by the sages of our Revolution , he whom we call the * Father of his country , " being unsurpassed in the cordiality of his attachment to them . It was the fancy of such dreamers , that , - xvhereas it was an uncjuestionahle inference from the history of representative governments , that the law-making power ought to he committed to two assemblies constituted upon different principles , - the natural and fit basis for this arrange ment already existed among us , in the relation which the American citizen *stained on the one hand to the united nation , and on the other to some one of the several States , which hitherto had been to all intents independent communities , and still were to continue such for certain purposes ; and that again , the only security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as against domestic usurpation , - was to he found under the iEgis of a judicial administration , the ministers of which should not be allowed to feel , that the swaying of justice to conciliate the tyrant few , or the tyrant many , was the condition of their places and their livelihood . Little as we think of Miss Martinean 's capacity for perceiving the bearings of such a question , still the ignorant flippancy , with which she treats it , would have satisfied us that she had never seen " The Federalist , " if she had not happened to make a long quotation from one of its numbers . She has seen it , however ; and the knowledge of that fact forbids us to take any pains towards her " enlightenment . " If she has seen it without caring to read its expositions of what , in the muddy infatuation of her vanity , she undertakes so summarily to dispose of , she has little curiosity for information which would do her good . If she has read those expositions , and yet finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain she would be proof against our feebler arguments . - As for the rest , it has not escaped the reader 's observation , that she finds that official competency , moral and intellectual , which we take to be contemplated as the great end in the arrangement of official functions , to have beef ) , in fact , secured by what she accounts the present faulty organization of the judiciary department . Nor is the actual result materially different , it seems , in respect to that crying theoretical evil , the constitution of the Federal Senate ; for , forgetting herself , perhaps , she says , a few pages further on // " The honor in which the Senate is held must depend on its preserving the character , which , on the whole , it has hitherto maintained . A nobler legislative body , for power and principle , has probably never been known . Considering the number of individuals of whom it is composed , its character has , perhaps , been as remarkable as that of the noble array of Presidents , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst its indirect mode of election , and lonr term of office , it should prove equally stable in principle , and flexible in its methods of progress , it may yet enjoy a long term of existence . " Just now , it could not " be very long lived . " - Vol. t. p. 54 . As against the chief executive functionary , Miss Martineau assures us that we are safe enou " It does not appear as if the President could work any permanent effect upon the mind and destiny of the nation " " He can do little urdess he acts , on the whole , in accordance with the mind of the people . If he has any power , it is because the people are with him : in which case he can not be very destructive to their interests . " - Vol. i. pp. 55 , 56 . Amen . We too are hopeful patriots , and we hope and think that no President is likely to undo us . But we like to have better reasons for our thought than that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have read , " in our sad and philosophic youth , " of one Jttlius C*sar and one Cromwell , who had the people with them , but neither the people nor the people 's liberties fared particularly well at their crimson hands . There is a deal of detail and speculation in this part of the work , about the mixture and antagonism of aristocrats and democrats in this republican society of ours , the origin of the distinction , the causes , extent , and acrimony of the existing mutual repugnancy , and other kindred things . It all sltows nothing else than that our author , bringing with her an English radical 's notions of our American liberty , - notions having about the same clearness , except in the best informed , as an oyster 's dreams of lark-catching , - had her ear abused by statements , some of which it is likely that her prejudices too eagerly welcomed , and others were apparently designed for experiments on that credulity of hers , to which we just now referred . One of these experiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of republican tone in different States , strikes us as having been particularly bold . // Within the memory of middle-aged men , the governor of New Hampshire used to travel in a coach and six , while the governor of the much more important Massachusetts went on a horse , with his wife on a pillion. " - Vol. i. p. 33 . The connexion indicates , that the anecdote here vouched for Miss Martineau by some " middle-aged man , " is to be understood of ante-revolutionary times ; and she received and reports it , forgetting that New Hampshire and Massachusetts having passed into independent commonwealths sixty years ago , it is not in the course of nature for any middle-aged man to have seen the state , - grander or more sordid , - of their respective provincial governors . If she will take the other side of the dilemma , though we do not see how this can be , considering the place where the remark occurs , the case is made little better . That middle-aged man , - with sorrow we say it , - was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Martinean , that within his memory a republican governor of New Hampshire bad made his circuit with a turnout of six in hand , while the august representatives of the sovereignty of the old Bay State sat bolt upright before Mrs. Hancock , Mrs. Adams , and Mrs. Bowdoin , when they took the air upon a pillion . The truth is , that peculiarities which we have mentioned exposed Miss Martinean to erroneous information . We know a young person , - it is little to his credit , - who exercised himself largely in this way . It was not the same , who told Captain Hall , that it was our habit to accommodate the companies of strolling players with the use of our churches ; but it was one of a like wanton wit . The thing was alto*ether wrong ; but the confidence with which other things were re-pertinacious peated in his hearing , which he knew to be equally unfounded with what he was inventing , offered a temptation strong enough to overcome his usual good sense . Miss Martineau was too frequently a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it was without any perception of it on her part that was prevented by the very foible which was practised on . Yet the naiveti , with which she sometimes becomes herself the narrator of such doings , can not but strike one with surprise . Who , for instance , would have believed , on any third person 's wor ( l , that , with her perspicacity , she could have failed to l ) ut the right construction on such an incident as this which follows ? She relates it as an instance of " the solemn pedantry // of which the extremest examples are to be found " in the United States , and , with a perfect unconsciousness that her colloculor , more merry than well-mannered , was entertaining the by-standers with a caricature , - which was scarcely a caricature , - of her own too frequent style of remark . We ought to say that we know nothing of the circumstances , except from her own record , which stands in these circumstantial and graphic terms " I was solemnly assured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , because I differed from him . Everybody laughed : when he went on , with the utmost gravity , to inform us that there had been a time when he believed , like other people , that he might be mistaken ; but that experience had convinced him that he never was ; and he had in consequence cast hehind him the fear of error . I told him I was afraid the place he lived in must be terribly dnll , - having an oracle in it to settle every thing . He replied , that the worst of it was , other people were not so convinced of his being always in the right as he was himself . There was no joke here . He is a literal and serious-minded man . " - Vol. ii . p. 207 . But we have suffered ourselves to be lured from the scent . Let us go back to our Politics . And since here we must select , and wish to do it fairly , let us see with what degree of clearness and consistency Miss Martineau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her book . The majority are right , " she says ; " the majority are in the right ; " an ( l so on , with very frequent repetition ; only that when the majority , not doing as she would have them , do what she thinks is wrong , another doctrine of similar sound , but rather different sense , comes to her aid ; " the majority will be in the right . " Of the meaning of this principle , as a sound part of the republican theory , - shrilly clamorous as she is for it , - Miss Martineau seems to have no perception . We will try to help her , through the medium of her own more accustomed language . Her country is a monarchy ; that is , ( for " monarchy " as well as " aristocracy " is Greek , and since she flings about the latter word , in respect to our American relations , in a way to show that she has no acquaintance with its sense , it is possible that she may guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lodged in one person . Did she ever hear it said , in England , that " the king can do no // wrong " ? Probably sbe has heard it said ; for it is a principie of the English constitution . And what did she understand those words to mean ? If she took them in their whole possible latitude of sense , - if she took them otherwise than as a fiction of theory , supplying however a rule for practical observance , - she had better go encamp under the wing of the Khan of Tartary , for his government has no principles , and therefore none so horribly absurd . We suppose , that she understood them to mean , that he can do no punishahie wrong ; and that whatever he shall do , in the exercise of his kingly function , and through the constitutional channel of action , will be right in the contemplation of the English law , in the discretion of the inferior English officer , and in the obligation of every Englishman . It will be the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the subject kingdom and individual must not dispute . Such a rule will it he , until the king shall incline , or be persuaded , to a different course ; and then that other course will be equally , that is positively and indisputably right , in the view of the law , though it should be diametrically opposite to what was right just now . So in pure republics . " The majority is right . " " Tb majority can do no wrong . " Its will , expressed through that constitutional mechanism which gives it the only voice the citizen can hear , is absolute law . It is , for the time being , indisputable right ; nor even if they who have composed a majority should afterwards be outnumbered , may they be punished for what they did in the use of a majority 's prerogative . They exercised a legitimate discretion , and a discretion which they had a right to make felt by others ; and even though , in the view of higher intelligences , they should , at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no earthly power to call them to account . If this had been all which Miss Martineau meant to say , she would have been , so far , a very sound republican of the school of Washington and Hamilton , Madison and Jay . But had this been all which she meant , or fancied she meant , - for all this strain of thought is mutable and vapory as a cloud , - she would neither have T ) roclaimed what is our alphabet of the political theory , with such noisy repetition , nor made applications of it to such numerous results of minor and questionable speculation . If we read her rightly , she is much of the time l ) ossessed with the idea , that the preference of the larger number in a community of persons determines // the fact of the abstract right ; that is to say , if a million of men , less one , be divided into two parts , as nearly equal as possible , the larger of the two will infallibly select the more wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any possibility , be found in the wrong scale . We believe , on the whole , that we will not try to argue that question , inasmuch as the logicians say , that to support an argument , there must be some common ground , and between a champion of this theory , and any one who should be scrupulous about a character for common sense , we do not at once perceive where the common ground is to he looked for . In this country , where people , when they announce their political maxims , are apt to consider what those maxims mean , we suppose it to be the prevailing opinion , and therefore ( Miss Martineau being the judge ) the right one , that no human administration can be depended on to do " always that which is right . " Abraham thought , of old , that this moral infallibility was the distinguishing attribute of a higher government ; and the same , as far as we are informed , is the general sense of the American people . They are of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a new truth comes to be perceived , so far from being simultaneously snatched at by just enough voters to give it at once practical efficacy , - ballot in hand , - it is , in the common course of things , first in the possession of one or a few , then of more , and by and by , through their exertions , of a sufficient number to invest it with legal authority ; and that if circumstances cause it to be politically dealt with , before this last-named consummation arrives , the temporary decision will perforce be abstractly wrong . If meanwhile any principle could be adopted , by which the rightlythinking minority could be recognised as such , and accordingly placed in power , the consequence would be the speedier adoption of the better view ; and this is the attempt which all goveruments , except pure democracies , have perpetually made . We republicans think that they have always made it in vain ; and that the experiment has been so long unsuccessfully tried , and at such cost , that now it ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abstract right of having their judgments become operative , as in other rights , we can not find , as others have thought they did , that political history furnishes any good reason for invading it . Actually , of two men , one will have more wisdom and rectitude than another , // and accordingly is a more trust-xvorthy depositary of power . Of ten men , the five wisest and best have not the same sense and honesty as the residue , but more ; that mi ht seem a safe proposition . Of five men it may well be , that the two who differ from the others may think more correctly . Let them convince the others , then , if they can . But if they can not , - if both parties insist that they are right , - what umpire is there to decide which is so ? There is none , we of this country think , who can be trusted to do it . One private man 's judgment is as good , and must be esteemed so , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; and , of course , by plain principles of figures , the judgment of the greater number must be regarded more than the judgment of the less . We will not , however , do Miss Martineau 's under tanding the injustice of attributing to her the deliberate opinion , that on eacn and every occasion the greater number will do precisely what they ought , though she has repeatedly done herself the injustice to use the quoted words without limitation , and in connexions , where , if they mean any thing , it would seem that they can mean no less . In other parts of her work , she not only shrinks from the principle , as expressed in general terms , but either categorically , or by direct implication , goes to a length of contradiction , in respect to particular applications of it , which strikes us as decidedly harsh . We have this at one time in the form of a sort of counter-maxim . " No student of the ways of Providence will * * expect , that any arrangement of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the less gifted should be enabled suddenly to overtake those of the more gifted . " - Vol. ii . p. 151 . Again , it comes in the shape of a remark , which , occurring in a different connexion , and relating in form to a special case , does not appear to have occurred to our author 's mind as virtually a strenuous denial of what she had been at such pains to impress . This majority , whose every action is pure , unquestionable right , strict , veritable conformity to the truth and equity of things , obtains and welcomes the information , upon which it so securely and happily proceeds , in the following manner and spirit . " Of all newspaper presses , I never heard any one deny that the American is the worst . Of course this depravity being so general throughout the country , it must be occasioned by some overpowering force of circumstances . " - Vol. i. p. 109. // While the population is so scattered as it now is , throughout the greater part of the Union , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a question ; few things are easier than to keep from them altogether the knowledge of any particular affair ; and , worse than all , on them may easily be practised the discovery that lies may work their intended effect , before the truth can overtake them . " It is hard to tell which is worst ; the wide diffusion of things that are not true , or the snppression of things that are true . It is rio secret , that some able personage at Washington writes letters on the politics and politicians of the general government , and sends them to the remotest corners of the Union , to appear in their newspapers after which , they are collected in the administration newspaper at Washington , as testimonies of public opinion in the respective districts where they appear . it is no secret , that the newspapers of the south keep out of their columns all information which might enlighten their readers , near and afar , as to the real state of society at home . " It is no secret , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every candidate coming forward on the other , is the cause of many honorable men , who have a regard to their reputation , being deterred from entering public ife ; and of the people being thus deprived of some better servants than any they have . " " The worst of it is , that the few exceptions to this depravity ,  --  the few newspapers conducted by men of truth and superior intelligence , aren ot yet encouraged in proportion to their merits . It is easy to see how a youth , going into the wilds , to set up a newspaper for the neighbouring villages , shoul4 nieet with support , however vicious or crude his production may be ; but it is discouraging to perceive how little preference is given , in the Atlantic cities , to the best journals over the worst . " - Vol. i. pp. 109 , 110 , 111 . Nor is there any hope for the newspapers in any supervision or example of the higher literature of the country , nor in a reforming public sentiment . " There will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers till the literature of the country has improved . Their moral character depends upon the moral taste of the people . The demand lies with the many . Whenever the many demand truth and justice in their journals , and reject falsehood and calumny , they will be served according to their desire . " - Vol. i. p. 111 . Of course , " the many " have not demanded " truth and justice " yet . So much for Miss Martineau 's complimentary // estimation of them . But the unkindest cut of all is behind . Montesquieu , the subject of a royal government , thought that the judicious choice of rulers was a kind of public action in which republicans might be allowed to excel . He gave them little credit for capacity to decide upon measures , but held them to he altogether competent to the selection of men . * Miss Martioeau thinks less well of us . The great theory presumes , that the majority not only will the best measures , but choose the best men . This is far from being true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people more behind their theory than in this . " " It has become the established method of seeking office , not only to declare a coincidence of opinion with the supposed majority , on the great topics on which the candidate will have to speak and act while in office , but to deny , or conceal , or assert anything else which it is supposed will please the same majority . The consequence is , that the best men are not in office . The morally inferior who succeed , use their power for selfish purposes , to a sufficient extent to corrupt their constituents , in their turn . I scarcely knew , at first , how to understand the political conversations which I heard in travelling . If a citizen told another that A. had voted in a particular manner , the other invariably began to account for the vote . A. had voted thus to please B. , because B. 's influence was wanted for the benefit of C. , who had promised so arid so to A. 's brother , or son , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a vote , or other public proceeding , must always be fouhd ; and any reason seemed to be taken up rather than the obvious one , that a man votes according to the decision of his reason and conscience . I often mentioned this to men in office , or seeking to be so ; and they received it with a smile or a laugh which wrung my heart . Of all heart-withering things , political skepticism in a republic is one of the most painful . " " The most learned men , generally speaking , devote themselves , in preference , to professions . The most conscientious men , generally speaking , shun the snares which fatally beset public life , at present , in the United States . " " There seems to be no expectation whatever that a candidate for the presidentship , or his partisans , should retain any simplicity of speech , or regard to equity , in the distribution of places and promises . " - Vol. m. pp. *24 , 25 , 84- 86 . Et in , Brute ! // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " That is the resource , in exi*encies which the other form of the maxim does not so well suit . They " will be in the right " ; - " man never is , but always to be hlessed . " To he sure they will but when , and in what matters , and with what conditions ? The sentiment , properly regarded , is a sound one . It is the same which is sometimes expressed in less sycophantic , or d Miss Martinean pleases , more aristocratic forms . VYill she have it in Latin ? Long ago it was said , and is now sometimes repeated ; " Opinionum commenta delet dies , naturm judicia confirmat . " Will she have it in English ? Then it reads " The truth is great and will prevail . " Give time , and secure attention , and open a fair field , and the truth on any given point will make its way , till k. converts the greater number . For the mind of man has an affinity with truth , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened the truth and its opposite to long and heavy trains of happy and disastrous consequences , by which their respective characters come at last to be known . There are , meanwhile , many things which ought to be settled rightly , but which the greater number of men , having affairs of their own to attend to , do not care about , and will not trouble themselves to obtain the information requisite for so deciding . Such are most private controversies ; upon them the majority , if brought to act at all , would for the most part act too ignorantly to act with a sound discretion . There are other practical questions , in which it does take a strong interest , but which it is not therefore sure of settling in the right manner , inasmuch as , if it should proceed to act upon them , it might act under a present impulse of strong passion , preventing a discernment of what the right is , and even forbidding a solicitude to ascertain it . Then occurs that phasis of the majority 's action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the sterner voice of history entitles it the people 's brutal madness . The French history about 1794 will furnish Miss Martineau with some incidents to explain what we mean ; or we may refer her to a shocking occurrence , which she mentions , in the State of Missouri , in respect to which the ground of the majority 's will being the highest law was actually taken by a magistrate , before whom the question came , in a breadth , and with a decision , which it would seem Miss Martinean ought to be greatly pleased with . " The majority will be in the right , " doubtless , upon all such // things , but the better opinion appears to be , that it is not right when such things are done ; and , to prevent their being done , it has been thought best to institute courts of justice , to anticipate , for present action , that right sentence of the majority , which , for present purposes , it is not enough to be persuaded that some future time may bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements in society are merely so much useless trouble ? Does she think society should do nothing , when a question arises , but ring the hell and call the voters to town-meeting ? So it seems , if she thinks at all , when she writes , " The majority are right ; any fears of the majority are inconsistent with this maxim . " This is her language . Yet we venture to doubt whether , if it were not for disloyalty to her principles , our author herself , rather than trust her cause to this arbitration , would not choose to carry it into a court of justice , where it might be passed upon by persons hound to attend to its merits , trained and habituated to such investigations , selected for their competency , and occupying a position to be secure against the influences of fear or favor . And though we have taken the simplest case , in order to expose the folly of the principle when viewed in the aspects in which it appears to have bewildered her mind , the same is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security and well-being of its citizens . Granted , that the majority of men will sometime or other arrive at the knowledge of whatever truth is within the reach of man ; they have not arrived at it yet , and till they have , it will not do to call them infallible . Granted , that howsoever intricate a question of law , whether relating to principle or administration , may he , the majority of a nation will settle it rightly , when they have had their attention turned to it , and have ccnsidered it long enough ; still the people of America remember , that the majority has a great deal to think of , and is not likely to trouble itself much about every individual 's small affairs ; that many questions both of rule and of application , are of such a nature as to demand much previous inquiry in order to their right solution ; and many demand to be settled without delay for practical use , inasmauch as the days of the individual 's years are only three score years and ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions to the care of chosen men in legislative and judicial trusts , believing that the decisions of such men , pre // sumed to be selected for their integrity and competency , will be the same decisions which the majority themselves would eventually arrive at , if they would give themselves to such investigations ; - that , in short , that judgment of the majority , which Miss Martinean says will be right , will be anticipated by the majority 's representatives , and announced in time to be of use . And as even this is but an approxtmation , - though the best , in our American thought , which has been devised , - to a perfect administration of government and justice , we believe the American people are content to have any one thuink , that upon any given point , the majority are as yet in the wrong , though , sooner or later , in some age of the world 's life , they will be in the right , upon any matter which remains upon their minds ; from which further it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , in some given case , is not ( as far as fear can be justified at all ) so very unreasonable a feeling . The confusion of our author 's mind on this subject of the affinity between the majority 's will and the right , is absolutely unfathomable . Her hobby limps round its mill till the whirl completely dizzies her . " Nothing , " she says , " Nothing can be more striking to a stranger than the experience gained , after some residence in the United States , of the ultimate ascendency of the will of the majority , - i. e. of the right , - in defiance of all appearances to the contrary . " - Vol. x. p. 44 . How can this experience " of the ultimate ascendency of the will of the majority " be so very " striking " to a stranger , when he knows beforehand , if he knows any thing of the characteristic institutions of this country , that they provide for the will of the majority going into effect with small delay ? What " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? The right , " if Miss Martineau chooses so far to contradict herself , may be , for the time being , maintained by a minority and as long as it is so , it would indeed be " striking " to see the right obtain ascendency , inasmuch as the thing is impossible . But as soon as it becomes that " will of the majority , " with which she expressly identifies it , in the same sentence , the wonder would be that it should not obtain ascendency , inasmuch as it could not fail to do so . Again ; " There is a spreading dislike of Associations for moral , while there is a growing attachment to them for mechanical , objects . // The majority will show to those who may be living at the time what is the right . " - Vol . Ii . p. *299 . " Those who may be living " at what time ? There is a majority in respect to the question , favorable or unfavorable , now . There will be a majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years hence , fifty years , a hundred . What generation is it , " living at the time , " to which the majority will show what is the right ? - It is recorded of a barrister , that he opened his argument by begging the Judge to observe , that " if ever there was a case which beyond all other cases brought to view the principles to be applied in such a case , this case is that case . " " Which case , brother A ? " was all that his Lordship , in his helplessness , could reply . And , worst of all , a view to " the time , " may demand to be retrospective rather than prophetic ; for " Many excellent leaders of the democratic party - Vol. i. p. 319 . We have been as impatient as our readers can be to get out of this speculative slough . We would have trusted to Miss Martinean to contradict herself , - we could not trust the work to better hands , - were it not that the boldness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the caution of the other . But we can not pass on to the few words , which we have to say upon other matters , without a remark or two upon the freedom , with which , professing to be a friend to free institutions , she has held up the operation of them among us to the view of their enemies in her own country , and whereever her book may find readers . If the representations which she has ventured to make had come from some different quarters , we should have felt no surprise , whatever sorrow and indignation they might have excited . As things are , the best we have to hope is , that the incoherence between the theory with which she declares herself so possessed , and her statements respecting us of this nation , who have gone furthest in applying it to practice , will create a wholesome distrust on the part of her foreign readers respecting her capacity for making observations . All institutions of civil government , being human , are subject to some dangers . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of dangers affecting us , we suppose that all wise men see two to be chief ; viz. the danger , // that law , which embodies the deliberate popular will , will not , on all occasions , be strong enough to overawe or control sudden outbreaks of popular feeling , of a criminal and mischievous character ; and the danger that , where every man is every other 's equal , and accordingly has something to hope and fear from the favor and displeasure of every other , there will be a universal mutual restraint on freedom of opinion , speech , and action , which will do more subtilly , hut if not counteracted , may in some respects do more effectually , the enslaving work , which republicans are apt to charge upon apparently severer forms of government . Of course , this is the ground which skilful assailants of our institutions would choose to take . It is precisely the ground , which again and again they have taken . But no writer , that we know of , has gone any thing like the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually manifested among us in destructive operation . They occupy the foreground of her picture . The dangers are real . No patriotic American can shut his eyes against them . As to the latter , the extent to which the influence operates upon individual minds is an endlessly complicated question , which no one , - certainly no stranger , - is competent to solve ; and wholesale charges may be as foolish and false , as they are confident and violent . The protection to he looked for is in a clear sense of the danger , and , in great part , in other influences upon society and the citizen , which republican institutions are calculated to exert . The former danger , whenever it takes effect , speaks for itself for the present , and may well inspire the most painful apprehensions for the future . We have no words of qualified abhorrence , with which to speak of riots , - of illegal combinations of any kind ,  --  whether more or less wickedness he perpetrated by them for the time being . We can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as can countenance them on any occasion , for any pretence , to any end . Those of which this country has been the scene , are undoubtedly , by eminence , the portion of its history to call up distressing and humbling recollections . We mourn over them in the hitterness of our spirit . But we do not therefore despair of the republic . We know that , in the course of any people 's history , times of strong excitement are likely to occur ; and when they do occur , we know of only two perfect securities against the vio // lence of mobs . The one is , strong principle in the people ; the other is , cold iron over them . The Emperor Nicholas has an effectual way of dealing with such movements ; so effectual , that his subjects never put him to the trial . But though it has the advantage over ours in point of certain efficacy , we would rather trust to our own than take his , along with its disagreeable concomitants . True it is , that ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more is the pity . We must try to make it work better for the future . We must make it work better , not so much for our credit 's sake , as for the sake of our safety , of our continued being , as a free community . And we expect to do so . The existence , and the peace , and the fame of England have survived Lord George Gordon 's mob ; and we shall yet , if we he but staunch for the future , have a strong and an honored place upon the nations , for all that has come and gone . But the present wonder is , that a professed champion of free institutions should have dealt in such an offhand and such a one-sided way with the topics we have named . She has not been insensible , indeed , of the awkwardness of her position , and meets the difficulty by pleading , in her section entitled " Allegiance to Law , " that mobs in America are composed of " gentry , " or " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that figure of speech , which is sometimes called throwing dust in the eyes . She knows well enough , that to apply such expressions to any class of our citizens is merely to use a license of rhetoric ; and that if she can make it out to the satisfaction of English readers , that law has no power here to restrain outrage , they will feel little curiosity to learn whether the generality of our rioters wear green baize roundabouts , or fasten their broadcloth with gilt buttons . The majority is always right ; but nevertheless , in republican America riot and outrage are the order of the day . Selfgoverned America is a fine free country , but it is a country where every man is the miserable slave of every other ; where , " to think what you will , and speak what you think , " is a misdemeanor on which the unmitigated weight of popular displeasure falls . So much for Miss Martineau s amiable zeal for our institutions . There is only one thing more , for which the friends of Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must wait for , till they get towards the close of her book ; but the connexion of the subject is such , that we will rather // advert to it now . The advocates of the English ecclesiastical establishment urge no other argument with so much confidence in favor of the rich livings of a portion of the clergy , and the independence of all on popular election , as the necessity of their being in this situation in order to an honest discharge of their functions . The clergyman , say they , who depends upon the public favor , will be sure to lower his standard of doctrine and duty to meet the demands of the popular will . If he is to " rebuke with authority , " he must rebuke from an independent position ; and to this end , there must even be those of this body , who shall be on a level with the highest subject . To the friends of this theory , Miss Martineau 's assurance , that " the American clergy are the most backward and timid class in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with true knowledge , the least efficient in virtuous action , " can not fail to afford the most lively pleasure . It is not worth *hile for us to stop , to appeal to any who are competent to form a judgment , whether it can be reasonably pretended that ever , since Christianity came forth from the primitive purity of her persecuted days , she has commanded the services of a more self-denying , indefatigable , and faithful body of clergy , than the existing clergy of all denominations in America . It xvould be a presuming folly in us , to affect to be their champions against such a charge from such a source . But what , in the name of all that is credible , does their deluded traducer mean , we do not say by such sorry extravagances , but by extravagances of fact , so at war with her own extravagances of theory , as here , and elsewhere that we have pointed out , she is thrusting on the credulity of her readers at home , as if in vengeance for the hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no aim ? How could she undertake to write ; and then , too , how can such representations be accounted for ? Has she an aim ? What is it ? Is she , in American phrase , on the fence ? Is she coquetting between Orangeism and Reform ? Has she that conceit of her powers , that she means to try her hand at mystifying ministers , those who are , and those who may be ? She was used to call the fair Majesty of England her " pupil , " on the ground , we believe , of some of her little books being supposed to have been put into the princess 's hands . Has she conceived the lofty hope of standing in some nearer relation to that illustrious personage ? Has she lifted her aspiring eye to one of the places // now held by the " gorgeous dames " of the houses of Petty and Leveson-Gower ; and would she plant on our reri ) OtC soil , the foot of her young ambition 's ladder ? " Should the prospects of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her strong-hold in the common places of radicalisrn , which she has scattered broad-cast over her pages ? Should his grace of Wellington see better days , is she intending to call his attention to xvhat she has so vigorously written of the predominance of mob law , and the universal slavery of the mind , in republican America ? When she thinks of the fair prospects of the Agitator , does she propose to hang on his skirts by force of her remarks on " the danger of a careless , ambitious , worldly clergy , in the richer priests of the church " of England ? If the star of Derby should come into the ascendent , is what she has said of the depravity of the American clergy , under the Voluntary Principle , the tide which is to " lead on to fortune " ? Let who can propound . We assume not to interpret the ambiguous words which she has dispensed with such large alternate liberality . We must pass lightly over other discussions of Miss Martineau , touching our politics , which can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory she does not propose to serve . Our " apathy in citizenship , " particularly as exhibited in being " afraid to vote , " she represents as extreme . Our sectional prejudices she understands to be of the most malignantly aggravated character , such as she rightly , though somewhat daintily , declares , " can not coexist with a generous l ) atrlotisni . " We have had opportunity to make some observations on most of the six-and-twenty states , and in no one of them ( though we have certainly listened to ill-natured remarks ) did we ever happen to hear language of exactly the strength , which it seems was addressed to her . We but set down her representation for what it may he worth , having expressly declined the office of contradicting any of those views of hers , in this connexion , which she has happened to leave uncontradicted under her own hand . " 1-latred ' is not too strong a term for this sectional prejudice . Many a time in America have I been conscious of that pang and shudder which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question whether the enmity between the British and the Americans , at the most exasperating crisis of the war , could ever have been more intense than some that I have seen flashing in the eyes , // and heard from the lips , of Americans against fellow-citizens in distant sections of their country . I have scarcely known whether to laugh or to mourn when I have been told , that the New England people are all pedlers or canting priests ; that the people of the south are all heathens ; and those of the west all barbarians . Nay , I was even told in New York , that the Rhode Island people were all heathens , and the New Jersey folks were no better . " - Vol. i. pp. 137 , 138 . On the other hand , our institutions are in fault , because of what she entitles , the political non-existence of women , " and because ( except in Rapp 's settlement , and those of the Shakers , neither of which , however , for other reasons , meets her idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severalty . On the former point she is very strenuotis , devoting a stirringly polemic chapter to the defence of what she entitles " the principle of the equal right of both halves of the human race , " as " the true democratic principle which can never he seriously controverted , and only for a short time evaded . " * Upon the fallacy of a supposed acqtiiescence of the sex in existing political arrangements she is particularly explicit . " This acquiescence is only partial ; and , to give any semblance of strength to the plea , the acquiescence must be complete . I , for one , do not acquiesce . I declare that whatever obedience I yield to the laws of the society in which I live is a matter between , not the community and myself , but my judgment and my will . Any punishment inflicted on me for the breach of the laws , I should regard as so much gratuitous injury ; for to those laws I have never , actually or virtually , assented . I know that there are women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that there are women in America who agree with me in this . The plea of acquiescence is invalidated by us. " - Vol. mm. p. * What her views are about community , or , as we presume it should rather be called , abolition , of property , is not made altogether clear . " There is , " however , " no way of securing perfect social liberty on democratic principles , but by community of property ; " and the Shakers are , in this matter , to he regarded as the pioneers of society . * In connexion with this subject , Miss Martineau ( Vol . II . p. 229 ) warmly resents a supposed want of respect on our part , on a former occasion , when nothing was further from our minds . We really supposed ourselves to he using the most harmless and civil pleasantry in the world . // " If there had been no celibacy among them , they would probably have been far more wealthy than they are ; the expenses of living in community being so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much greater than in a state of division into families . The truth of these last positions can be denied by none who have witnessed the working of a coöperative system . The problem is to find the principle by which all shall be induced to labor their share . Any such principle being found , the wealth of the community follows of course . " Whether any principle to this effect can be brought to bear upon any large class of society in the old world , is at present the most important dispute , perhaps , that is agitating society . It will never now rest till it has been made matter of experiment . " - Vol. i. p. 312 . We congratulate ourselves , at least , that the experiment is to he tried in the " old world , " instead of this . We are content here , for the most part , with living in the good old Christian way of " a state of division into families , " with our own wives , children , and household stuff . The economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the expenses of living in community " are " much less , and the produce of cooperative labor much greater , " would hardly have satisfied us that it was best to give up the advantages of domestic association , and be turned into one great work-house . We should be pained to hear that Miss Martinean 's recommendation had even prevailed to a trial of the experiment in the other continent . It would be unreasonable to expect that Miss Martinean 's gifts at theorizing , as exhibited in the production of such fruits as these , will secure the confidence of intelligent minds to her partial recommendation of some of our institutions , as agreeing with her notions of what a frame of society ought to be . And should they turn , unwarned , from these to her statement of facts , a precious chance for continuing united or free , will they find reason to conclude that we of this nation have . With a country composed of sections inveterately hostile to one another , - mobs habitually overbearing law , - newspapers and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupted , ( for , - a point to which we did not advert in its place ,  --  the people may have " honest orators as well as newspapers , " if they choose to demand to hear the truth , " ) - a clergy poisoning by their easy doctrine , and their sycophantic example , the sources of all sound principle ,  - -  every citizen standing in fear of every other , and especially // the better apprehensive of the worse ,  --  it will be pretty safe to say , that our days are not only numhered , but that it will cost small waste of figures to count them . Our comfort is in the hope , that such persons will consider a little the evidence which they have already had of a mind incapable of making satisfactory observations of any kind ; and if they will be patient , we will give them a little more . We will take a few instances from the last part of the book , where it seems to us , that , perhaps through the haste of coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Religion , according to Miss Martineau , is in a low condition in America , consisting mainly in hatred to Catholics , to Infidels , and to Christians professing some different belief from the hater . But what was she looking for , which not being able to find in proper measure , she laments the absence of religion ? Her standard of judgment being the wise one which follows , one perceives xvhat degree of reliance is to be placed on the skill of her inquiry , and the justness of her conclusion . " Religion is , in its widest sense , the tendency of human nature to the infinite ; and its I ) principle is manifested in the pursuit of perfection in any direction whatever . It is in this widest sense that some speculative atheists have been religious men . " - Vol. n. p. 314 . " Perfection in any direction whatever . " What in shipbuilding , tobacco-planting , kite-Hying ? " Atheists have been religious men . " Let our author be again advised to look to her Greek . Atheism signifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion is a God or gods . A person denying a God may be a just man , if you will ; a temperate , a generous , an humble man ; hut we diffidently submit that he would make an odd sort of religionist . Such uses of language are merely a subject for Sir Hugh Evans ' reproof , as applied in that same scene of the " Merry Wives of Windsor , " from which Miss Martineau gives a quotation in her Appendix . She will find it couched in the following concise and unequivocal terms ; " Leave your prabbles , oman . " What is written above , it seems we are to take for an account of the principle of religion . For its practice the following is the recipe ; " The morality and religion of the people of the United States have suffered much by their being , especially in New England , an ostensibly religious community . * All tkey have to // do is , to assert their birth-right of liberty ; to be free and natural . They need have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 347 . And this substantially , we are told , and more like it , she got some one else to agree to . In a conversation with " a most liberal-minded clergyman , a man as democratic in his religion , and as genial in his charity , as any layman in the land , " he spoke of the existence of " strong religious sensibility in the children of the Pilgrims , " and asked Miss Martineau what she " thought should be done to cherish and enlarge it . " Among other measures to this end , respecting which they found themselves d'accord , were the following ; We proposed , that new temptations to walking , driving , boating , &amp;c. should be prepared , and the delights of natural scenery laid open much more freely than they are : that social amusements of every kind should be encouraged , and all religious restraints upon speech and action removed : in short , that spontaneousness should be reverenced and approved above all things , whatever form it may take .

We ourselves never happened to fall into company , where the removal of " all religious restraints upon speech and action , " and the approval above all things of what Miss Martineau pleasantly calls " spontaneousness , ' ' " whatever form it may take , ' ' was recommended as a specific for the culture of the religious character . - Shall we tell our poor thought upon this matter ? It serves us on other occasions , which occur in these volumes . It is , that this liberal-minded clergyman was less of a Solomon than a Job . Does Miss Martineau remember a spirited design of Westall , prefixed to the poem entitled " Conversation , " in Sharpe 's edition of Cowper ? Nobody can better vouch than herself for the truth of the attitude , in which the poet sits in that print , so frequently must it have been exhibited to her during her visit to this country . It illustrates the following lines ; " I twirl my thumbs ; fall back into my chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I hope his blunders are all out , Reply discreetly , to be sure , ' - no doubt .

They are indeed written with great spirit and liveliness , showing very favorably what she can do , when she is content to let alone the philosopher and statesman , ( or stateswoman , if she will have us learn to say so , ) and be her graceful and quick-witted self . Other sketches , of the same nature with those which are here brought together , occur in different parts of the work . They look like leaves of a journal kept at the time ; and though sometimes introduced a little apropos des bottes , never fail to be welcome , as well for their own beauty , as for the inferior attractiveness of the different sort of matter which they displace or relieve . In the third Part , entitled " Civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . Here is a theme , on which it is reasonable to promise one 's self that a cultivated woman will be entertaining and instructive . There is on the whole , a smooth surface , skin-deep , over this portion of the work , but altogether too free a circulation of discoloring bile beneath it . The topics here separately treated are , the " Idea of Honor , " under which are arranged " Caste , " " Property , " and " Intercourse " " Woman , " to which division belong Marriage , ' ' Occupation , ' ' and Health Children " Sufferers " ; and " Utterance . " Since " the degree of civilization of any people corresponds with the exaltation of the idea which is most prevalent among that people , " and since " the worship of opinion is , at this day , the established religion of the United States , " and certainly takes precedence of that of wealth , " Miss Martinean inclines to prefer the civilization of the new world to that of the old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then the best ; and a page or two further on , as usual , she takes occasion to gratify gainsayers of this view with its opposite , allowing that " where the honor is to be derived from present human opinion , " - which was the very case in hand , - " there must be fear , ever present , and perpetually exciting to , or withholding from , action ; in such a case , as painful a bondage is incurred as in the pursuit of wealth . " - Under the bead of " Caste , " she is particularly severe upon the metropolis of New England , and especially upon its " aristocracy " ; an ungentle expression , which in this connexion commonly // denotes those , who have not treated one with sufficient attention , and whom , therefore , one is desirous to affront . Wishing her as well as we do , we regret that she should ever have been afflicted by feelings of the painful nature which dictated the remarks in question . Such remarks are always better let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they are in possession of a commentary on the tone that has been taken . If , while , in single cases , our author received , in that city , attentions by which any traveller might feel gratified and honored , her acquaintance was not as extensively sought as she may have allowed herself to expect if there were those , who , having figured her to themselves as an esprit fort , to say the least , or thinking they had had enough already of English jobhers in the hook-wright line , did not care to go out of their way to seek her ; if there were any who , rightly or wrongly , were displeased at what they thought the bad taste of a stranger 's public interference in matters of delicate and agitating controversy ; if there were any , who chose , even under embarrassing circumstances , to exercise that freedom of judgment in which , it seems , Americans are so deficient , and decide for themselves on questions belonging to the obligations of hospitality , this should not have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though doubtless the rebukes , now that they are uttered , have inflicted a grievous wound , as did of old those ohjurgations of our fair fellow-citizen , whom the French ambassador assured , that it would occasion the Emperor , his master , infinite distress to learn what a poor opinion she entertained of him. - " Property* ' is a nuisance , which Miss Martinean hopes bids fair to be ultimately abated in this country . in England , it is following the same course " as monarchy , which was once necessary , and is now useless , if not pernicious . " " In America the process will be more rapid . " We are getting " ready for the inquiry whether this tremendous incubus be indeed irremovable. " - As to " Intercourse , " " the manners of the Americans ( in America ) are the best " she " ever saw " ; which is not improhable , though there are also good manners to be seen elsewhere , if one looks in the right places . We are further " the most good-tempered people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is no more than we need to be . What she found chiefly to object to , was the flattery which everywhere pursued and distressed her , and against which , now that she is // out of hearing of it , she remonstrates with the strongest aversion . " The most common mode of conversation in America " exhibits a combination , which we should have guessed beforehand was rare in any place ; it is " prosy , hut withal rich and droll . " " In the capitals of States , men rank according to their professed intellect ; " " it is refreshing in the cities to see how the veriest fops and the most solid capitalists readily succumb before men and women who are distiuiguished for nothing hut their minds " ; - a state of things which , on the one hand , is not so very had , and on the other , not so very easy to reconcile with the facts , that " it is in the commercial cities that the aristocracy form and collect " ; that " wherever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must arise from wealth " ; and that " an aristocracy of mere wealth is vulgar everywhere . " As to " Women " in America , " their beauty is very remarkable , and their wit , no less . " " They have , within the range of their activity , good sense , good temper , and good manners . " " Their charity is overflowing , if it were hut more enlightened . " They are selfish , timid , and rude , when travelling , and at public places ( the New England women least so ) ; too often intemperate ; stately , when waiting upon guests at inns ; not to be trusted to live in boarding-houses ; interested in religion to the prejudice of their attention to " morals , politics , and philosophy " ; and visited for " lapses " with disgrace , " temporary and superficial , " when compared with English retribution . Their enunciation alternates " between a whine and a twang . " " The most numerous and the worst pedants are middle-aged ladies .

" She marries at her own pleasure , but too early , and too often with mercenary views ; and " any one must see , at a glance , that , if men and women marry those whom they do not love , they must love those whom they do not marry . " On the other hand , she is not easily enough divorced , the beau id&amp;zl of " marriage arrangements " being found in the canton of Zurich , where " the parties are married by a form , and have liberty to divorce themselves , without any appeal to law , on showing that they have legally provided for the children of the marriage .

But here there is hope .

" Withal , they are the subjects of a lenient discipline , and are remarkable for " dexterity , fearlessness , and presence of mind . " In respect to children , as to other things , " the good people of Boston , " are in several particulars especially at fault , being " more fond of excitement than of consistency .

Lamartine ( if she does not disdain such an antagonist ) , who has just been instructing the French Chamber of Deputies , to the effect , that the foundations of knowledge ought to be laid , and an elementary intellectual discipline prosecuted , substantially alike for all . " There is not even any systematic instruction given , " - it is the Northern States particularly that are spoken of ,  --  " on political morals . " Is there not ? We wonder what caused , for instance , such a multiplication of copies of that excellent work , the " Political Class Book . " " Some persons plead , that there is less occasion for school instruction in the principles of politics , than for an improved teaching of some other things ; because children are instructed in politics every day of their lives by what they hear at home , arid wherever they go . But they hear all too little of principles . What they hear is argumentation about particular men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning details elsewhere , the more necessary it is that they should here be exercised in those principles by which the details are to be judg. ed and made available as knowledge . They come to school with their heads crammed with prejudices , and their memories with words , which it should be part of the work of school to reduce to truth and clearness , by substituting principles for the one , and annexing ideas to the other . // " A Sunday-school teacher asked a child , Who killed Abel ? ' General Jackson . ' " - Vol. 1 ' . pp. 270 , 271 . We should have taken for granted the authenticity of this anecdote , as well as been struck with its aptness to illustrate the point in hand , if we had not been accustomed from our youth to hear a different version of it , to the effect that a scion from a noble stock , who had presented himself for holy orders , was addressed by the examining clergyman , who wished to be indulgent in his scrutiny , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? " to which he replied , The Archbishop of Canterbury . ' ' Under the head of " Sufferers , " Miss Martineau specifies criminals , paupers , lunatics , the . blind , and the intemperate and , like other intelligent travellers , speaks in a strain of general commendation of methods of reformation and relief , originated in this country . By " Utterance , " - who would have thought it ? - the Bentham word-mint must be working still ,  - -  she means neither more nor less than Literature , in which she gives good and sufficient reasons , why the Americans should as yet be only beginning to begin . Particularly , she takes care to mention , that " there is no contribution yet to the Philosophy of Mind from America , " Jonathan Edwards of course never having handled a pen ; " no light has been given to society from the American press on the principles of . politics , " the Declaration of Independence , " The Federalist , " and the " Defence of the American Constitutions , " being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no creation in the arts , " Washington Alston 's pictures , for example , being all among things still future .

" So is Abulfeda better known in England than the Times newspaper . Mrs. More 's " Practical Piety " has had a large circulation ; but the idea of comparing the familiarity of our countrymen with her works to their acquaintance with Shakspeare , is of the most preposterous kind ; and if our use of the religious writings of England , on the one hand , and of its older literature , on the other , was to be brought into question , Miss Martineau , had she taken care to inform herself at all upon the subject , could hardly have failed to mention a book in many more American hands , than either Mrs. More or Shakspeare . We speak of Bunyan 's " Pilgrim 's Progress , " of which more than five hundred thousand copies have issued from the American press .

" The next name is decidedly Mrs. Jaineson 's . " " At a considerable distance follows Mrs. Hemans . Byron is scarcely heard of . " Had the study been to make this climax face precisely in the wrong direction , it could not have been more skilfully disposed . Byron scarcely heard of ! Tell it not at the Trade Sale . Publish it not by the side of the advertisements . We wonder what the three sets of stereotype plates of his works , in large octavo , which we know to have been cast in this country , were made for ; to say nothing of the multitudinous editions , of which one everywhere sees specimens , on almost all shades of paper , and suited to the capacities of all shelves and all purses . If there be one writer , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins of our young people for the last twenty years , it is that same unheard of George Gordon , Lord Byron . From whom else were learned that skepticism unable to render a reason , that scowling gloom perpetually and sorely tasked to keep up its character , that admiration for persons sustaining to society the reputable relations of the bandit , and the bandit 's unwedded love , which a few years ago , - for we grant that the fashion is rather pass // ing by , - were professed by so many youth , brought up by sober parents , in an honest way , and having not an enemy nor a trouble in the world , to make a reasonable subject for their lugubrious looks and verses ? We happen to know , that one publisher alone has issued between thirteen and fourteen thousand copies of Lord Byron 's works . Of Mi 's . Hemans 's poems , there are also two or three sets of stereotype plates , and more than thirty thousand copies have been printed while the circulation of Mrs. Jameson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best information we can obtain , has amounted to about five thousand copies . " No living writer , however , " continues Miss Martineau , " exercises so enviable a sway , as far as it goes , as Mr. Carlyle . " There is much virtue in that clause , as far as it goes , inasmuch as , to supply this nation of fifteen millions , over which the author of the " Sartor Resartus " " exercises so enviable a sway , " that work , - a work , too , which they have " taken to their hearts , " and which " is acting upon them with wonderful force , " - has , according to information on which we have the best reason to rely , been printed in but two editions , the first consisting of five hundred copies , and the second , after an interval of more than a year , being only twice as large . Indeed , a writer , who meant to make facts the foundation of general strictures , was hound to use much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited . Sometimes the inaccuracy appears in such a way , as ludicrously to expose the folly of her pretensions to any acquaintance with the general subject under discussion ; as where , in a chapter entitled the " Apparatus of Government , " she represents Mr. Kendall , while " a member of the cabinet " as " giving sanction to an audacious stoppage of the post-office function , " in order to get himself advanced to the office of Postmaster-General . One so wise respecting the theory of our institutions , might have been supposed to know who were the President 's advisers . Any clerk , in or out of Washington , could have told her , that , except by a departure from the usage of the government , Mr. Kendall could not have been in the Cabinet before he was at the head of the Post-office , unless he had been Attorney-General , or one of the four Secretaries of State , War , the Navy , and the Treasury ; neither of which offices Mr. Kendall has ever filled . - At other times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out // a single fact with prominence for rhetorical effect . Still , if the fact was worth putting to that use , it was worth ascertaining first . Miss Martineau writes like a guide-book about the antiquities of Plymouth . " We mounted Burial Hill ; and when I trod the turf , after some weeks ' walking over crisp snow , I began to feel that I might grow superstitious too , if I lived at Plymouth . Upwards of half the pilgrim company died the first winter . Fifty-one dropped in succession ; and the graves of most of them are on this hill . Burial Hill was probably chosen to be a memento morz to the pious pilgrims ; its elevation , bristling with grave-stories , being conspicuous from every part of the town . But , lest it should exhibit their tale of disaster to their foes , the Indians , the colonists sowed the place of their dead with corn ; making it , for honest purposes , a whited sepulchre . " - Vol. i. pp. 101 , 102 . Such things are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plymouth could have told our author what she here records . There is but one tradition , on the spot ; and that is , that the sufferers of the first winter were buried in a quite different place from Burial Hill , viz , in a bluff by the water 's edge . - The misrepresentation is made particularly offensive , when it subjects exalted private character to unmerited reproach , as in the coarse charge against the author of " Home , " of what is qualified as " a surrender not only of the author 's noblest prerogative , hut of his highest duty ; " an accusation , on which , for obvious reasons , we do not dwell , and which has already been exposed in the public prints , with a particular statement of the circumstances . But what are we to expect from the memory of a writer , who , while she studies that pointed expression , which is apt to fix a thought ,  --  be it good or bad ,  - -  in the mind , does not remember it well enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few pages or a few lines further on , as the case may happen to be ? At the beginning of her book , Miss Martineau is on stilts high enough , one might imagine , to give her some advantage for seeing what course she was about to travel . She there lays it down very solemnly that , at the early period of independence , " Republicanism , like that which now exists in America , was a thing unheard of , - an idea only half-developed in the minds of those who were to live under it . Wisdom may spring , full4ormed and accomplished , from the head of a god , but not from the brains of men . The Americans of the Revolution looked round // upon the republics of the world , tested them by the principles of human nature , found them republican in nothing but the name , and produced something more democratic than any of them ; but not democratic enough for the circumstances which were in the course of arising . * * * They planned something far transcending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not to be wondered at , or blamed , if , when their work was done , they feared they had gone too far . They had done much in preparing the way for the second birth of their republic in 1789 , and for a third in 1801 , when the republicans came into power ; and from which date , free government in the United States may be said to have started on its course . " - Vol . I. pp. 17 , 18 . " Washington was absolutely republican in his principles , but did not enjoy the strong faith , the entire trust in the people , which is the attendant privilege of those principles . " - Vol. i. p. 19 . There is a page or two more of this sorry trash , ( in which , by the by , our quiet , exemplary little neighbour State of Rhode Island must be amazed to find itself adduced as an illustration of " the fickleness and turbulence of very small republics " ; ) but all is lost sight of before the chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn that the danger of the Americans is , that they will not keep close enough to their first imaginations . " Their first idea was loftier than some which have succeeded ; " and " the older they grow , the more must they reverence the dreams of their youth . " - The later President Adams 's " lot " is described as having been " that of all good Presidents in the quiet days of the republic " ; and yet , - quiet as they were , to the degree of affording a solution of a President 's lot , - we learn , after two more lines , that General Jackson , elected , of course , towards the close of his predecessor 's administration , was " brought into office by an overpowering majority , and after a series of strong party excitements . " - Nor are the principles of judgment with this lady , - unconsciously to herself , of course , - less mutable than its results . Thus she was indignant at a hostess of hers , who spoke of respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a white " ; and at New Orleans , she scarcely " refrained from walking out of the church , " because the preacher instituted a similar assuming comparison ; but she finds no difficulty in complimenting some of her friends , by declaring , in several abodes in which I resided , for a longer or a shorter time , the routine of the house was as easy and agreeable // as any Englishman's. " - So she is infinitely merry , in one place , at an admonition given to a friend of hers , to " think of the example , " and at the notion itself of " the effect of actions upon people 's minds " ; yet none the less , when she comes to treat of the American clergyman , does she urge his obligation to " discharge the duties of a citizen all the more faithfully , for the need which the public show themselves to be in of his example . " - " Nothing , in American civilization , " she declares , " struck me so forcibly and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing since my return to England has given me so much pain as the contrast there . " But at Rockaway ,  --  where we are quite sure that something must have gone sadly wrong , - she not only finds the evil existing , hut recommends the repetition of it as the proper retribution and remedy . We are bound , however , in candor to say , that , in the latter case , the contempt prescribed is to be visited by the better upon the worse , and upon the bad thing done , rather than upon the doer ; - that is , we suppose , if a way can be devised to show such a nicely discriminating contempt . " The brand of contempt should be fixed upon any unprincipled or false-principled style of manners , in a community based upon avowed principles . The contempt thus inflicted upon the mode may possibly save the persons who would otherwise render themselves liable to it . The practice of ostentation may be lessened in America , as that of suicide was in France , by ridicule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old admiral , in the novel , drew a character thus ; " I assure you he is a clever fellow , - that is , when I say , clever fellow , I mean nothing of the sort ; - but you comprebend . " Is Miss Martinean proposing a similar compliment to the intelligence of her readers ? Or is it simply , that not exerting , as she writes , that attention , on which the philosophers say that memory depends , her memory plays her false ? When the retrospective glance of man 's " large discourse , looking before and after , " is so dim , its forward ken is not commonly found altogether sure and searching . Miss Martineau , doubtless , values herself most upon the latter faculty , both because it is of a higher order , and because its errors are not commonly subject to such easy and decisive correction . The eminent modesty and exactness of her prescience have chanced to be most seasonably illustrated together in one re // mark , on a subject long familiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of the last war , she records , that the " local banks out of New England came to the agreement ( too senseless to be ever repeated ) to suspend specie payments . " " Ever " is proverbially a long day ; but the oracular sentence which declared what it was , which that long day would not bring about , was landed at New York not many days from the time of the universal crash of the banks from Maine to Louisiana . " Fears , " it was long ago known , " are oft prophetic of the event " ; alas , that as much may not be said of prognostics in so much pleasanter a strain . We heartily wish Miss Martineau length of days , to grow wiser in , and write better books . Happy would it have been for her , - happy for her really well-endowed mind , and ( at bottom , we still incline to believe ) good heart , - if that flattery which so distressed her in America had not first so befooled her at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she but known what was its sphere , would have enahled her to write an uncofl ) monly attractive book of travels . In undertaking subjects so much out of the beat of her capacities , she has but committed herself , and given pain to judicious readers . We have heard her , strangely enough , commended , for not using more , than she has done , her opportunities for collecting a scandalous chronicle . Let those thank her for that , who will . Is it so great a merit , to turn from a hospitable dwelling , and forbear to assail its peace with weapons which its hospitality gave the means to collect ? On the contrary , we are compelled to say , though we have not cared to dwell upon the remark , that this want of respect for the sanctity of character is one of the painful peculiarities of Miss Martineau 's work . Certain principles which she supposes to be sound , in this relation , are set forth in the last paragraph but one of her preface . They are guardedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be received as a lawful rule of procedure in such cases , there is an end to any meeting , in a man 's own house , between one who is master of it , and a book-writing stranger . Miss Martineau has abounded in the imputation of reprehensible motives to men and bodies of high standing , for acts and practices , which only by arbitrary construction are liable to any such charge ; and , to the best of our recollection , the unenviable distinction is hers , of having presented the first instances of this kind of assault . She professes to hold candor // in high estimation . But candor is not the only virtue in the world . It is no virtue , it has no place , when it has not for its basis carefully ascertained truth ; and , besides , there are moralists who would tell our loquaciously frank friend , that an unbridled tongue is a fierce chafer of a troubled spirit . that her book will in the end do much mischief of any kind , we are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this western world , rightly or wrongly , with a force , and in a direction , which an imperfectly informed stranger 's observations will do very little to check , change , or discredit . Besides , it is never worth while to ascribe great influence of any kind to incoherent writing . Plausibility without consistency , there is none an author 's inconsistencies are , to a tolerably careful reader 's view , his own exposures of his own incompetence . There will he , we dare say , some young women of both sexes , who will think they have got hold of some transcendental political philosophy , in Miss Martineau 's dogmatical abstractions ; and the epigrammatic character of her rhetoric , when she thus plays the sage , may add something to its effect ; for not only with habitually undiscriminating readers , hut with most readers , using only the negligent attention with which books of travels are commonly perused , pointed expression is apt to create some presumption of knowledge and sense on the part of the writer . But the intelligent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an altogether ambiguous sign ; since , besides those who see the whole of a subject , there are no less than two other classes of writers addicted to the use of pointed language ; viz , those who see nothing whatever beyond one side of a subject , who write when " so ignorant as not to know how ignorant they are , " and those who assume a blustering tone , to disguise that deficiency of information and indefiniteness of thought , the embarrassing consciousness of which they can not themselves escape . Crabbe tells us of one of his characters , who " put his anger on to hide his shame " ; so many a fair-seeming philosopher puts on a swaggering positiveness of phrase , to hide the faintness and tenuity of his mental apprehensions . As to the present instance , it is obvious enough , that , with great parade of thinking , Miss Martineau does not think . Thought issues in generalizations ; and the generalizing process finds congruities of some kind between independent facts . A thinker concludes something . His conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude , that nothing can be concluded // ; but Miss Martineau 's mental habits allow her the singular privilege ( if her representations have been accompanied by thought at all ) of believing a proposition , and equally believing its opposite . She finds no difficulty , on the one hand , in recommending to us , who had long ago taken some sound lessons in the school of a regulated and beneficent liberty , a system of politics , which forty years ago was fully tried and found wanting , in France , making that beautiful country for the tune a den of savages ; while on the other hand , she enters into elaborate statements , for the benefit of the friends of hereditary and military rule , showing that the experiment of free institutions , which the good and wise of the world have been watching with intense hope , has with us shamefully and desperately failed . Bad advice to us must come with some more winning adjuncts , and a bad report of us must be sent abroad in some less " questionable shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal injury.
