txt THE discovery of the lost work of Milton , the treatise " Of the Christian Doctrine , " in 1823 , drew a sudden attention to his name . For a short time the literary journals were filled with disquisitions on his genius ; new editions of his works , and new compilations of his life , were published . // But the new-found book having , in itself , less attraction than any other work of Milton , the curiosity of the public as quickly subsided , and left the poet to the enjoyment of his permanent fame , or to such increase or abatement of it only , as is incidental to a sublime genius , quite independent of the momentary challenge of universal attention to his claims . But , if the new and temporary renown of the poet is silent again , it is nevertheless true , that he has gained , in this age , some increase of permanent praise . The fame of a great man is not rigid and stony like his bust . It changes with time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easy to remark an altered tone in the criticism when Milton re-appeared as an author , fifteen years ago , from any that had been bestowed on the same subject before . It implied merit indisputable and illustrious ; yet so near to the modern mind as to he still alive and life-giving . The aspect of Milton , to this generation , will he part of the history of the nineteenth century . There is no name in literature between his age and ours , that rises into any approach to his own . And as a man 's fame , of course , characterizes those who give it , as much as him who receives it , the new criticism indicated a change in the public taste , and a change which the poet himself might claim to have wrought . The reputation of Milton had already undergone one or two revolutions long anterior to its recent aspects . In his lifetime , he was little , or not at all , known as a poet , but obtained great respect from his contemporaries as an accomplished scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his countrymen . His prose writings , especially the " Defence of the English People , " seem to have been read with avidity . These tracts are remarkable compositions . They are earnest , spiritual , rich with allusion , sparkling with innumerable ornaments ; but , as writings designed to gain a practical point , they fail . They are not effective , like similar productions of Swift and Burke ; or , like what became , also , controversial tracts , several masterly speeches in the history of the American Congress . Milton seldom deigns a glance at the obstacles , that are to be overcome before that which he proposes can be done . There is no attempt to conciliate , - no mediate , no preparatory course suggested , - but , peremptory and impassioned , he demands , on the instant , an ideal justice . Therein they are discriminatVOL . XLVII . - NO. c. 8 // ed from modern writings , in which a regard to the actual is all but universal . Their rhetorical excellence must also suffer some deduction . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , the learning , the subtilty and pomp of the language ; but the whole is sacrificed to the particular . Eager to do fit justice to each thought , he does not subordinate it so as to project the main argument . He writes whilst he is heated ; the piece shows all the rambles and resources of indignation ; but he has never integrated the parts of the argument in his mind . The reader is fatigued with admiration , but is not yet master of the subject . Two of his pieces may he excepted from this description , one for its faults , the other for its excellence . The " IDefence of the People of England , " on which his contemporary fame was founded , is , when divested of its pure Latinity , the worst of his works . Only its general aim , and a few elevated passages , can save it . We could be well content , if the flames to which it was condemned at Paris , at Toulouse , and at London , had utterly consumed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should not have taken counsel of his own lofty heart at this , as at other times , and have written from the deep convictions of love and right , which are the foundations of civil liberty . There is little poetry , or prophecy , in this mean and rihald scolding . To insult Salmasius , not to acquit England , is the main design . What under heaven bad Madame de Saumaise , or the manner of living of Saumaise , or Salmasius , or his blunders of grammar , or his niceties of diction , to do with the solemn question , whether Charles Stuart had been rightly slain ? Though it evinces learning and critical skill , yet , as an historical argument , it can not be valued with similar disquisitions of Robertson and Hallam , and even less celebrated scholars . But , when he comes to speak of the reason of the thing , then he always recovers himself . The voice of the mob is silent , and Milton speaks . And the peroration , in which he implores his countrymen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just spirit . The other piece , is his " Areopagitica , " the discourse , addressed to the Parliament , in favor of removing the censorship of the press ; the most splendid of his prose works . It is , as Luther said of one of Melancthon 's writings , " alive , hath hands and feet ,  --  and not // like Erasmus 's sentences , which were made , not grown . " The weight of the thought is equalled by the vivacity of the expression , and it cheers as well as teaches . This tract is far the best known , and the most read of all , and is still a magazine of reasons for the freedom of the press . It is valuable in history as an argument addressed to a government to produce a practical end , and plainly presupposes a very peculiar state of society . But deeply as that peculiar state of society , in which and for which iMilton wrote , has engraved itself in the remembrance of the world , it shares the destiny which overtakes every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , on which a battle of principles was fought , have already passed , or are fast passing , into oblivion . We have lost all interest in Milton as the redoubted disputant of a sect ; but by his own innate worth this man has steadily risen in the world 's reverence , and occupies a more imposing place in the mind of men at this hour than ever before . It is the aspect , which he presents to this generation , that alone concerns us . Milton , the controvertist , has lost his popularity long ago ; and if we skip the pages of " Paradise Lost * where God the Father argues like a school divine , ** so did the next age to his own . But we are persuaded , he kindles a love and emulation in us , which he did not in foregoing generations . We think we have seen and heard criticism upon the poems , which the bard himself would have more valued than the recorded praise of IDryden , Addison , and Johnson , because it came nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the praise of intimate knowledge and delight ; and , of course , more welcome to the poet than the general and vague acknowledgment of his genius by those able , but unsympathizing critics . We think we have heard the recitation of his verses by genius , which found in them that which itself would say ; recitation which told , in the diamond sharpness of every articulation , that now first was such perception and enjoyment possible ; the perception and enjoyment of all his varied rhythm , and his perfect fusion of the classic and the English styles . This is a poet 's right for every masterpiece of art goes on for some ages reconciling the world unto itself , and despotically fashioning the public ear . The opposition to it , always greatest at first , continually decreases and at last ends ; and a new race grows // up in the taste and spirit of the work , with the utmost advantage for seeing intimately its power and beauty . But it xvould be great injustice to 1'Jilton to consider him as enjoying merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to stand at this hour foremost of all men in literary history , and so ( shall we not say ? ) of all men , in the power to inspire . Virtue goes out of hind into others . Leaving out of view the pretensions of our contemporaries ( always an incalculable influence ) , we think no man can be named , whose mind still acts on the cultivated intellect of England and America with an energy comparable to that of 1'Iilton . As a poet , Shakspeare undoubtedly transcends , and far surpasses him in his popularity with foreign nations ; but Shakspeare is a voice merely ; who and what he was that sang , that sings , we know not . Milton stands erect , commanding , still visible as a man among men , and reads the Jaws of the moral sentiment to the newborn race . There is something pleasing in the affection with which we can regard a man who died a hundred and sixty years ago in the other hemisphere , who , in respect to personal relations , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual makes us jealous for his fame as for that of a near friend . He is identified in the mind with all select and holy images , with the supreme interests of the human race . If hereby we attain any more precision , we proceed to say , that we think no man in these later ages , and few men ever , possessed so great a conception of the manly character . Better than any other he has discharged the office of every great man , namely , to raise the idea of Nian in the minds of his contemporaries and of posterity , - to draw after nature a life of man , exhibiting such a composition of grace , of strength , and of virtue , as poet had not described nor hero lived . Human nature in these ages is indebted to him for its best portrait . Many philosophers in England , France , and Gerr*any , have formally dedicated their study to this problem ; and we think it impossible to recall one in those countries , who communicates the same vibration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beauty , which the name of Milton awakens . Lord Bacon , who has written much and with prodigious ability on this science , shrinks and falters before the absolute and uncourtly Puritan . Bacon 's Essays are the portrait of an ambitious and profound calculator , - a great man of the vulgar // sort . Of the upper world of man 's being they speak few and faint words . The man of Locke is virtuous without enthusiasm , and intelligent without poetry . Addison , Pope , Hume , and Johnson , students , with very unlike temper and success , of the same subject , can not , taken together , make any pretension to the amount , or the quality , of Milton 's inspirations . The man of Lord Chesterfield is unworthy to touch his garment 's hem . Franklin 's man is a frugal , inoffensive , thrifty citizen , but savours of nothing heroic . The genius of France has not , even in her best days , yet culminated in any one head , - not in Rousseau , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the attributes of humanity , as to entitle it to any rivalry in these lists . In Germany , the greatest writers are still too recent to institute a comparison ; and yet we are tempted to say , that art and not life seems to be the end of their effort . But the idea of a purer existence than any he saw around him , to be realized in the life and conversation of men , inspired every act and every writing of John Milton . He defined the object of education to be , " to fit a man to perform justly , skilfully , and magnanimously all the offices , both private and public , of peace and war . " He declared , that " he who would aspire to write well hereafter in laudable things , ought himself to be a true poem ; that is , a composition and pattern of the best and honorablest things , not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities , unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature a more noble outline of a wise external education , than that which he drew up , at the age of thirty-six , in his Letter to Samuel Hartlib . The muscles , the nerves , and the flesh , with which this skeleton is to be filled up and covered , exist in his works and must be sought there . For the delineation of this heroic image of man , Milton enjoyed singular advantages . Perfections of body and of mind are attributed to him by his biographers , that , if the anecdotes had come down from a greater distance of time , or had not been in part furnished or corroborated by political enemies , would lead us to suspect the portraits were ideal , like the Cyrus of Xenophon , the Telemachus of Fenelon , or the popular traditions of Alfred the Great . // Handsome to a proverb , he was called the lady of his college . Aubrey says , " This harmonical and ingenuous soul dwelt in a beautiful and well proportioned body . " His manners and his carriage did him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " his deportment was affable , his gait erect and manly , bespeaking courage and undauntedness . " Auhrey adds a sharp trait , that " he pronounced the letter Ii very hard , a certain sign of a satirical genius. ** He had the senses of a Greek . His eye was quick , and he was accounted an excellent master of his rapier . His ear for music was so acute , that he was not only enthusiastic in his love , but a skilful performer himself ; and his voice , we are told , was delicately sweet and harmonious . He insists that music shall make a part of a generous education . With these keen perceptions , he naturally received a love of nature , and a rare susceptihility to impressions from external beauty . In the midst of London , he seems , like the creatures of the field and the forest , to have been tuned in concord with the order of the world ; for , he believed , his poetic vein only flowed from the autumnal to the vernal equinox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts whether , in the fine days of spring , any study can be accomplished by young men . " In those vernal seasons of the year , when the air is calm and plea*ant , it were an injury and sullenness against nature , not to go out and see her riches and partake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth . " His sensibility to impressions from beauty needs no proof from his history ; it shines through every page . The form and the voice of Leonora Baroni seem to have captivated him in Rome , and to her he addressed his Italian sonnets and Latin epigrams . To these endowments it must be added , that his address and his conversation were worthy of his fame . His house was resorted to by men of wit , and foreigners came to England , we are told , " to see the Lord Protector and Mr. Milton . " In a letter to one of his foreign correspondents , Emeric Bigot , and in reply apparently to some compliment on his powers of conversation , he writes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common conversation and intercourse have betrayed no marks of sublimity or genius . But , as far as possible , I aim to show myself equal in thought and speech to what I have written , if I have written any thing well . " // These endowments received the benefit of a careful and happy discipline . His father 's care , seconded by his own endeavour , introduced him to a profound skill in all the treasures of the Latin , Greek , Hebrexv , and Italian tongues and , to enlarge and enliven his elegant learning , he was sent into Italy , where he beheld the remains of ancient art , and the rival works of Raphael , Michael Angelo , and Correggio ; where , also , he received social and academical honors from the learned and the great . In Paris , he became acquainted with Grotius ; in Florence or Rome , with Galileo ; and probably no traveller ever entered that country of history with better right to its hospitality , none upon whom its influences could have fallen more congenially . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not count it the least , that it contributed to forge and polish that great weapon of which he acquired such extraordinary mastery , - his power of language . His lore of foreign tongues added daily to his consummate skill in the use of his own . No individual writer has been an equal benefactor of the English tongue by showing its capabilities . Very early in life he became conscious that he had more to say to his fellow-men than they had fit words to embody . At nineteen years , in a college exercise , he addresses his native language , saying to it , that it would be his choice to leave trifles for a grave argument , - " Such as may make thee search thy coffers round , Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound Such where the deep transported mind may soar Above the wheeling thuaderous throne doth lie . " Michael Angelo calls " him alone an artist , whose hands can execute what his mind has conceived . " The world , no doubt , contains very many of that class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose minds teem with images which they want words to clothe . But Milton s mind seems to have no thought or emotion which refused to be recorded . His mastery of his native tongue was more than to use it as well as any other ; he cast it into new forms . He uttered in it things unheard before . Not imitating , but rivalling Shakspeare , he scattered , in tones of prolonged and delicate melody , his pastoral and romantic // fancies ; then , soaring into unattempted strains , he made it capable of an unknown majesty , and bent it to express every trait of beauty , every shade of thought ; and searched the kennel and jakes as well as the palaces of sound for the harsh discords of his polemic wrath . We may even apply to his performance on the instrument of language , his own description of music " - notes , with many a winding bout Of linked sweetness long drawn out , With wanton heed and giddy cunning , The melting voice through mazes running , Untwisting all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , xvhilst *Iilton was conscious of possessing this intellectual voice , penetrating through ages , and propelling its melodious undulations forward through the coming world , he knew also , that this mastery of language was a secondary power , and he respected the mysterious source whence it had its spring ; namely , clear conceptions , and a devoted heart . " For me , " he said , in his " Apology for Smectvmnuus , " " although I can not say , that I am utterly untrained in those rules which best rhetoricians have given , or unacquainted with those examples which the prime authors of eloquence have written in any learned tongue , yet true eloquence I find to be none but the serious and bearty love of truth ; and that whose mind soever is fully possessed with a fervent desire to know good things , and with the dearest charity to infuse the knowledge of them into others , when such a man would speak , his words , by what I can express , like so many nimble and airy servitors , trip about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would wish , fall aptly into their own places . " But , as basis or fountain of his rare physical and intellectual accomplishments , the man Milton was just and devout . He is rightly dear to mankind , because in him , - among so many perverse and partial men of genius , - in him humanity rights itself ; the old eternal goodness finds a home in his breast , and for once shows itself beautiful . His gifts are subordinated to his moral sentiments . And his virtues are so graceful , that they seem rather talents than labors . Among so many contrivances as the world has seen to make holiness ugly , in Milton , at least , it was so pure a flame , // that the foremost impression his character makes , is that of elegance . The victories of the conscience in him are gained by the commanding charm , which all the severe and restrictive virtues have for him . His virtues remind us of what Plutarch said of Timoleon 's victories , that they resembled Homer 's verses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living were austere . He was abstemious in diet , chaste , an early riser , and industrious . He tells us , in a Latin poem , that the lyrist may indulge in wine and in a freer life ; but that he , who would write an epic to the nations , must eat beans and drink water . Yet in his severity is no grimace or effort . He serves from love , not from fear . He is innocent and exact , because his taste was so pure and delicate . He acknowledges to his friend IDiodati , at the age of twenty-one , that he is enamoured , if ever any was , of moral perfection . " For , whatever the Deity may have bestowed upon me in other respects , he has certainly inspired me , if any ever were inspired , with a passion for the good and fair . Nor did Ceres , according to the fable , ever seek her daughter Proserpine with such unceasing solicitude , as I have sought this ioi *a*oi* i*xv , this perfect model of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was charged with loose habits of living , he declares , that " a certain niceness of nature , an honest haughtiness and self-esteem either of what I was or what I might be , and a modesty , kept me still above those low descents linesdeleted // up and stirring , in winter , often ere the sound of any bel awake men to labor or devotion ; in summer , as oft with the bird that first rouses , or not much tardier , to read good authors , or cause them to be read , till the attention be weary , or memory have its perfect fraught ; then with useful and generous labors preserving the body 's health and hardiness , to render lightsome , clear , and not lumpish obedience to the mind , to the cause of religion , and our country 's liberty , when it shall require firm hearts in sound bodies to stand and cover their stations . These are the morning practices . " This native honor never forsook him . It is the spirit of " Comus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is in any language . It always sparkles in his eyes . It breathed itself over his decent form . It refined his amusements , which consisted in gardening , in exercise with the sword , and in playing on the organ . It engaged his interest in chivalry , in courtesy , in whatsoever savoured of generosity and nobleness . This magnanimity shines in all his life . He accepts a high impulse at every risk , and deliberately undertakes the defence of the English people , when advised by his physicians that he does it at the cost of sight . There is a forbearance even in his polemics . He opens the war and strikes the first blow . When he had cut down his opponents , he left the details of death and plunder to meaner partisans . He said , " he had learned the prudence of the Roman soldier , not to stand breaking of legs , when the breath was quite out of the body . " To this antique heroism , Milton added the genius of the Christian sanctity . Few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar in the Christian ethics , and the precise aid it has brought to men , in being an emphatic affirmation of the omnipotence of spiritual laws , and , by way of marking the contrast to vulgar opinions , laying its chief stress on humility . The indifferency of a wise mind to what is called high and low , and the fact that true greatness is a perfect humility , are revelations of Christianity which Milton well understood . They give an inexhaustible truth to all his compositions . His firm grasp of this truth is his weapon against the prelates . He celebrates in the martyrs , " the unresistible might of weakness . " He told the bishops , " that , instead of showing the reason of their lowly condition from divine example and command , they seek to prove their high // preeminence from human consent and authority . " He advises , that , in country places , rather than to trudge many miles to a church , public worship be maintained nearer home , as in a house or barn . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to temples , we may be well assured , that he who disdained not to be born in a manger , disdains not to be preached in a barn . " And the following passage , in the " Reason of Church Government , " indicates his own perception of the doctrine of humility . " Albeit , I must confess to be half in doubt whether I should bring it forth or no , it being so contrary to the eye of the world , that I shall endanger either not to be regarded , or not to be understood . For , who is there , almost , that measures wisdom by simplicity , strength by suffering , dignity by lowliness ? " Obeying this sentiment , Milton deserved the apostrophe of Wordsworth ; " Pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free , So didst thou travel on life 's common way In cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart The lowliest duties on itself did lay . " He laid on himself the lowliest duties . Johnson petulantly taunts Milton with " great promise and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in danger , and then opening a private school . Milton , wiser , felt no absurdity in this conduct . He returned into his revolutionized country , and assumed an honest and useful task , by which he might serve the state daily , whilst he launched from time to time his formidable bolts against the enemies of liberty . He felt the heats of that " love " which " esteems no office mean . " He compiled a logic for boys ; he wrote a grammar ; and devoted much of his time to the preparing of a Latin dictionary . But the religious sentiment warmed his writings and conduct with the highest affection of faith . The memorable covenant , which in his youth , in the second book of the " Reason of Church Government , " he makes with God and his reader , expressed the faith of his old age . For the first time since many ages , the invocations of the Eternal Spirit in the commencement of his books , are not poetic forms , but are thoughts , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profession , and choice in marriage , equally expect a divine leading . Thus chosen , by the felicity of his nature and of his breeding , // for the clear perception of all that is graceful and all that is great in man , Milton was not less happy in his times . His birth fell upon the agitated years , when the discontents of the English Puritans were fast drawing to a head against the tyranny of the Stuarts . No period has surpassed that in the general activity of mind . It is said , that no opinion , no civil , religious , moral dogma can be produced , that was not broached in the fertile brain of that age . Questions that involve all social and personal rights were hasting to be decided by the sword , and were searched by eyes to which the love of freedom , civil and religious , lent new illumination . Milton , gentle , learned , delicately bred in all the elegancy of art aud learning , was set down in England in the stern , almost fanatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the zeal of his fellowship , make us acquainted with the greatness of his spirit , as in tranquil times we could not have known it . Susceptible as Burke to the attractions of historical prescription , of royalty , of chivalry , of an ancient church illustrated by old martyrdoms and installed in cathedrals , - he threw himself , the flower of elegancy , on the side of the reeking conventicle , the side of humanity , but unlearned and unadorned . His muse was brave and humane , as well as sweet . He felt the dear love of native land and native language . The humanity , which warms his pages , begins as it should at home . He preferred his own English , so manlike he was , to the Latin , which contained all the treasures of his memory . " My mother bore me , " he said , a speaker of what God made mine own , and not a translator . " He told the Parliament , that " the imprimaturs of Lambeth House had been writ in Latin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous and foremost in the achievements of liberty , will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory presumption . " At one time , he meditated writing a poem on the settlement of Britain ; and a history of England was one of the three main tasks which he proposed to himself . He proceeded in it no further than to the Conquest . He studied with care the character of his countrymen , and once in the " History , " and once again in the " Reason of Church Government , " he has recorded his judgment of the English genius . Thus drawn into the great controversies of the times , in them he is never lost in a party . His private opinions and // private conscience always distinguish him . That which drew him to the party was his love of liberty , ideal liberty this therefore he could not sacrifice to any party . Toland tells us , " As he looked upon true and absolute freedom to be the greatest happiness of this life , whether to societies or single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the utmost misery ; for which reason he used to tell those about him the entire satisfaction of his mind , that he had constantly employed his strength and faculties in the defence of liberty , and in direct opposition to slavery . " Truly he was an apostle of freedom ; of freedom in the house , in the state , in the church ; freedom of speech , freedom of the press , yet in his own mind discriminated from savage license , because that which he desired was the liberty of the xvise man , containing itself in the limits of virtue . He pushed , as far as any in that democratic age , his ideas of civil liberty . He proposed to establish a republic , of which the federal power was weak and loosely defined , and the substantial power should remain with primary assemblies . He maintained , that a natio*'may try , judge , and slay their king , if he be a tyrant . He pushed as far his views of ecclesiastical liberty . He taught the doctrine of unlimited toleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no power on earth can compel in matters of religion . He maintained the doctrine of literary liberty , denouncing the censorship of the press , and insisting that a book shall come into the world as freely as a man , so only it bear the name of author or printer , and be responsible for itself like a man . He maintained the doctrine of domestic liberty , or tbe liberty of divorce , on the ground that unfit disposition of mind was a better reason for the act of divorce , than infirmity of body , which was good ground in law . The tracts he wrote on these topics are , for the most part , as fresh and pertinent to-day , as they were then . The events which produced them , the practical issues to which they tend , are mere occasions for this philanthropist to blow his trumpet for human rights . Tbey are all varied applications of one principle , the liberty of the wise man . He sought absolute truth , not accommodating truth . His opinions on all subjects are formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation of Miltons . He would be divorced , when he finds in his consort unfit dispositioii ; knowing that he should not abuse that liberty , because with his whole heart // he abhors licentiousness and loves chastity . He defends the slaying of the king ; because a king is a king no longer than he governs by the laws ; " it would be right to kill Philip of Spain making an inroad into England , and what right the king of Spain hath to govern us at all , the same bath the king Charles to govern tyranically . " He would remove hirelings out of the church , and support preachers by voluntary contributions ; requiring , that such only should preach , as have faith enough to accept so self-denying and precarious a mode of life , scorning to take thought for the aspects of prudence and expediency . The most devout man of his time , be frequented no church ; probably from a disgust at the fierce spirit of the pulpits . And so , throughout all his actions and opinions , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiritual laws . He wished that his writings should be communicated only to those who desired to see them . He thougbt nothing honest was low . He thought he could be famous only in proportion as be enjoyed the approbation of the good . He admonished his friend " not to admire military prowess , or things in which force is of most avail . For it would not be matter of rational wonder , if the wethers of our country should be born with horns , that could batter down cities and towns . Learn to estimate great characters , not by the amount of animal strength , but by the habitual justice and temperance of their conduct . " Was there not a fitness in the undertaking of sue ha person , to write a poem on the subject of Adam , the first man ? By his sympathy with all nature ; by the proportion of his powers ; by great knowledge , and by religion , he would reascend to the height from which our nature is supposed to have descended . From a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be was . He beholds him as be walked in Eden : " His fair large front and eye sublime declared Absolute rule ; and hyacinthine locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering , but not beneath his shoulders broad . " And the soul of this divine creature is excellent as his form . The tone of his thought and passion is as healthful , as even , and as vigorous , as befits the new and perfect model of a race of gods . // The perception we have attributed to Milton , of a purer ideal of humanity , modifies his poetic genius . The man is paramount to the poet . His fancy is never transcendant , extravagant ; but , as Bacon 's imagination was said to be " the noblest that ever contented itself to minister to the understanding , " so Milton 's ministers to character . Milton 's sublimest song , bursting into heaven with its peals of melodious thunder , is the voice of Milton still . Indeed , throughout his poems , one may see under a thin veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poet 's life , still reappearing . The sonnets are all occasional poems . " L'Allegro " and " Ii Penseroso " are but a finer autobiography of his youthful fancies at Harefleld . The " Comus " is but a transcript , in charming numbers , of that philosophy of chastity , which , in the " Apology for Smectymnuus , " and in the " Reason of Church Government , " he declares to be his defence and religion . The " Samson Agonistes " is too broad an expression of his private griefs , to be mistaken , and is a version of the " Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce . " The most affecting passages in " Paradise Lost , " are personal allusions ; and , when we are fairly in Eden , Adam and Milton are often difficult to be separated . Again , in " Paradise Regained , " we have the most distinpt marks of the progress of the poet 's mind , in the revision and enlargement of his religious opinions . This may be thought to abridge his praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakspeare , that they do not appear in their poems ; that those prodigious geniuses did cast themselves so totally into their song , that their individuality vanishes , and the poet towers to the sky , whilst the man quite disappears . The fact is memorable . Shall we say , that , in our admiration and joy in these wonderful poems , we have even a feeling of regret , that the men knew not what they did ; that they were too passive in their great service were channels through which streams of thought flowed from a higher source , which they did not appropriate , did not blend with their own being . Like prophets , they seem but imperfectly aware of the import of their own utterances . We hesitate to say such things , and say them only to the unpleasing dualism , when the man and the poet show like a double consciousness . Perhaps we speak to no fact , but to mere fables of an idle mendicant , Homer ; and of a Shakspeare , content with a mean and jocular way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genius and office of Milton were different , namely , to ascend by the aids of his learning and his religion , - by an equal perception , that is , of the past and the future , - to a higher insight and more lively delineation of the heroic life of man . This was his poem ; whereof all his indignant pamphlets , and all his soaring verses , are only single cantos or detached stanzas . It was plainly needful that his poetry should be a version of his own life , in order to give weight and solemnity to his thoughts ; by which they might penetrate and possess the imagination and the will of mankind . The creations of Shakspeare are cast into the world of thought , to no farther end than to delight . Their intrinsic beauty is their excuse for being . Milton , fired " with dearest charity to infuse the knowledge of good things into others , " tasked his giant imagination , and exhausted the stores of his intellect , for an end beyond , namely , to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to his strain . Jts reality is its force . If out of the heart it came , to the heart it must go . What schools and epochs of common rhymers would it need to make a counterbalance to the severe oracles of his muse . " In them is plainest taught and easiest learnt , What makes a nation happy , and keeps it so . " The lover of Milton reads one sense in his prose and in his metrical compositions ; and sometimes the muse soars highest in the former , because the thought is more sincere . Of his prose in general , not the style alone , but the argument also , is poetic ; according to Lord Bacon 's definition of poetry , folloxving that of Aristotle , " Poetry , not finding the actual world exactly conformed to its idea of good and fair , seeks to accommodate the shows of things to the desires of the mind , and to create an ideal world better than the world of experience . " Such certainly is the explanation of Milton 's tracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea for freedom of divorce ; an essay , which , from the first until now , has brought a degree of obloquy on his name . It was a sally of the extravagant spirit of the time , overjoyed , as in the French revolution , with the sudden victories it had gained , and eager to carry on the standard of truth to new heights . It is to be regarded as a poem on one of the griefs of man 's condition , namely , unfit marriage . And as many poems have been written upon unfit society , commending // solitude , yet have not been proceeded against , though their end was hostile to the state ; so should this receive that charity , which an angelic soul , suffering more keenly than others from the unavoidable evils of human life , is entitled to .

For are we not the better ; are not all men fortified by the remembrance of the bravery , the purity , the temperance , the toil , the independence , and the angelic devotion of this man , who , in a revolutionary age , taking counsel only of himself , endeavoured , in his writings and in his life , to carry out the life of man to new heights of spiritual grace and dignity , without any abatement of its strength@@183058637.txt FoR many years it has been the custom of the Indians , residing within the territories of the United States , to send delegates to Washington for the purpose of making treaties respecting their lands , and transacting other affairs , in which they and the United States are mutually concerned . This custom has been encouraged by the government , as affording a favorable opportunity of communicating to the Indians just ideas of the condition , resources , and power of their civilized // neighbours , which , on account of their remote situation and ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expenses of these embassies have generally been borne by the government ; and every facility has been rendered to the Indians , which could contribute to enlarge their knowledge and promote their comfort during their journeys through the country . Among those , who have thus visited Washington and our principal cities within the last twenty years , have been the most renowned chiefs and warriors , and other personages of distinction , from nearly all the great tribes inhabiting the western and southern borders of the United States . Proud of their national manners , and disdaining to accommodate themselves to new and strange modes , farther than the necessity of circumstances required , they have generally appeared in their native costume , and adhered to the same habits of painting their faces and decorating their persons , which they practise at home ; thus exhibiting not only the original features peculiar to their race , but all the outward characteristics of their savage state . As early as 1824 the practice was begun , of taking portraits of the principal Indians , who came to the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department . The project was approved and aided by the Executive , and , under the active management of Colonel McKenney , then Superintendent of Indian Affairs , the number rapidly increased , till a very interesting gallery was formed . They were chiefly painted by Mr. King , an artist of high repute in this branch of his profession , who , by his long residence in Washington , and frequent opportunities of studying the subjects of his pencil , has been remarkably successful in transferring to his canvas the strong lineainents of the Indian countenance . Having this rare and curious collection before him , Colonel McKenney conceived the plan of making it more valuable to the world by publishing a series of engraved portraits , exactly copied and colored from these paintings , and accompanied by biographical sketches and historical facts . This enterprise , the first of the kind that has been undertaken in this country , and indeed in any country on so comprehensive a scale , and with such a completeness of design , he has carried forward with a perseverance and success , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , who knows the difficulty of such a task , and properly estimates its importance . The North American Indians are a strongly marked race of men , constituting a distinct class , and maintaining their identity as such , and their peculiarities in every vicissitude of existence , which neither circumstances nor time have conquered . Wasted by wars , consumed by want , driven by the iron arm of civilization from his native soil , and the places endeared to him by hallowed associations , the Indian is the same that he was when the white man first invaded his forests ; unchanged and unchangeable in his nature , his habits , his physical constitution , and distinctive traits of intellect . If he has yielded too easily to the vices of his unwelcome neighbours , yet even these have not subdued his indomitable spirit , nor weakened his sense of dignity as a man , nor worn off the deep traces of his original character . Colonel McKenney 's design , therefore , of collecting and presenting to the world authentic memorials of this race , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is fast dwindling away , is as praiseworthy as it is arduous and difficult in the execution . And , fortunately , no person living is better qualified for this task , both from the opportunities he has had of personal observation and inquiry , and from the genuine enthusiasm with which he has overcome , and continues to overcome , the many obstacles that obstruct his progress . In his official capacity , besides his frequent intercourse with the chiefs and warriors , who have visited the seat of government from time to time , he has travelled much among the Indians , holding treaties at their council fires , discussing with them their political relations with the United States and with each other , and examining minutely into their social condition and manner of life ; thus accumulating a rich store of facts , which he is enabled to use to the greatest advantage in illustrating this work. * With each portrait is connected a biographical sketch of the individual , whom it is intended to represent , drawn from original materials , and interspersed with anecdotes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonel i*IcKenney made a tour to the Upper Lakes , of which he published an account , in a volume entitled , " Sketches of a Tour to the Lakes , of the Chacacter *nd Customs of the Chippeway In. dians , and of Incidents connected with the Treaty of Fond du Lac . " A notice of this volume may be found in the North American Review , Vol . XXV. pp. 334 et seqq. // are spirited and strikingly graphic . Eight numbers , constituting the first volume , have already been published . Some of the first numbers of the work , in addition to the biographical sketches , contain a historical account of the various tribes of Indians within the borders of the United States , and particularly of those situate to the eastward of the Mississippi River . This essay forms a rare and valuable contribution to Indian history . It describes the situation and extent of the territories , which the tribes respectively inhabit , their population , their affinities with each other , their forms of government , and their general and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable and curious , as affording an instructive comparison with what has been written by the early travellers , and showing how completely the Indians have preserved all their original features of character , modes of existence , and habits of thought and action . Colonel McKenney has also an accomplished coadjutor in Judge Hall , of Cincinnati , who is associated with him in the literary part . of the enterprise . Judge Hall 's well known grace and liveliness of style , and his knowledge of events in the West , and of the Indian character as unfolded in the wars of recent times , besides the advantage he derives from his proximity to the scenes he describes , enable him to make contributions , which will adorn and give additional value to the work . These biographies have an interest beyond the simple narratives . They give us general views of Indian life and Indian character , of no little importance . We see to what a point the aboriginal intellect has advanced , and what have been apparently the stern boundaries fixed by nature to its progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same since their first intercourse with Europeans . The principle of advancement , which has been developed in the earliest periods of all nations , who have carried forward the arts of civilization , has never shown itself among the children of the American forests . There have been of course individual exceptions to this remark ; but they are much fewer than xve should at first sight imagine . There seems to be an inherent antipathy to the forms of civilized life among them . The progress which the Cherokees are supposed to have made recently can not as yet be considered as a departure from the general course of Indian affairs . The voL. xLvII. - NO. c. 18 // labors of missionaries , - of such men as Eliot and Brainerd , - have caused a temporary change , and to a limited extent , in the aspect of Indian life . But where are now the villages they formed , the churches they gathered , the schools they opened for the red men ? And what permanent consequences have followed the toils and sufferings of the thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same holy cause ? They have refused to blend themselves with their conquerors , as if there had been some natural repugnance between the white man 's and the red man 's blood . They have rejected the habits of civilized life , though , in some individual cases , they have proved themselves capable of adopting them . It seems as if they were born to be hunters , and hunters they were determined to die . The Christian religion has made a temporary progress among some of the tribes , but time has always removed the last traces of it from the savage mind ; as if the traditions of the Great Spirit , and the hunting-grounds of the departed warriors , had their origin in the natural feelings of the savage heart , and could never be replaced by a purer and sublimer faith . All other people , who have been overrun by a foreign race , have submitted to the common law of conquest , and intermingled with the conquering tribe ; but the Indian has maintained his surly independence , looking upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites with abhorrence , and his own inevitable disasters with a mournful , but unbending , haughtiness . Poets and novelists have given the rein to their imagination , in descrihing the poetical life , and picturesque eloquence , of the Indians . The representations they have given are utterly false . There is nothing pleasing to the imagination in the dirty and smoky cabin of the Indian chief ; there is nothing romantic in his custom of sleeping away the days of leisure from the perils of war or the adventures of the chase ; there is not a particle of chivalry in the contempt with which he regards his squaw , and the unmanly cruelty by which he binds upon her burdens grievous to be borne . His whole life is surrounded by the dismal accompaniments of poverty , sensuality , ignorance , and vice . In the arts , he has never learned to do more than supply his coarsest animal wants . His taste for ornaments can not well be more despicable . He rings his nose , as farmers ring their pigs , to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous colors , // which give him the appearance of a devil ; he puts horns upon his head , or sticks it all over with gaudy feathers ; and then he is a finished specimen of the Indian fine gentleman . In his amusements , his taste is equally refined with his taste in dress . His war dances and funeral dances are mere contortions , exhihiting every form of ungraceful bodily action and these are accompanied by a species of music consisting of a rude movement in time , and certain unmeaning howls , compared with which , the harking of wolves and the growling of bears are melody itself . His warfare is a compound of cruelty and cowardice . His point of honor is , to entrap his enemy unawares , and with no danger to himself ; his glory , on returning to his native village , he places in exhibiting the greatest possible number of scalps , torn bleeding from the heads of his murdered victims . His treatment of a captive enemy , is horrible heyond description . His highest enjoyment consists in taunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercest death-agonies , which his diabolical skill enables him to invent . His sagacity is bounded to the discovery of a trail or track ; his wisdom consists in a few wise saws handed down from his ancestors , and treasured up by the old women of the village . When in council , he dresses these scanty ideas with a touch or two of forest rhetoric , and that is his eloquence , and his statesmanship . How can it be any thing more ? To what circle of experience , to what treasuries of knowledge , can lie resort for the enlargement of his mind and the cultivation of eloquence ? What occasion has his simple life for any thing more copious in thought , and more polished in language ? His religion is founded upon the simple conception of a Supreme Being , and that is always sublime ; but what attributes belong to this conception of the Supreme Being , can easily be inferred from the Indian 's customs and his conduct . How unworthy of a God , his notions of him are , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His views of another life are distinct enough , hut utterly insufficient to produce any exalting tendency in his conduct and character in this . They are low , gross , sensual . They have scarcely a glimmering of the light of imagination to redeem them from the most deplorable darkness . We have said , the circle of Indian knowledge is extremely narrow and confined , and the materials of his eloquence scanty . Still , he sometimes gives utterance to a brilliant thought , which would be applauded , coming from a cultivated // 140 July , mind . Living in the midst of primeval forests , gazing upon the stars of heaven , witnessing the succession and touching phenomena of the passing seasons , his mind is sometimes filled with emotions of the beautiful and sublime , to which he gives utterance in bold and figurative language . A sentiment imbued with natural feeling , an image borrowed from external objects , a comparison snatched from the tree , the bird , the mountain , the waterfall , occasionally impart to his discourse the air of poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Indian makes no sustained efforts . His thoughts come out in single flashes ; his eloquence is concentrated in a single point . Logic , properly speaking , he has none . When he reasons , he reasons from analogy ; his arguments are tropes ; his conclusions are metaphors in disguise . The summit of his philosophy is , to bear tortures unmoved . When among the monuments of civilization , his motto is , or would be , JVil admirari . Gazing , with immense multitudes , upon the balloon that ascended from the Battery in New York , he merely said , the man was a fool for his pains . In short , he looks with stupid insensibility upon all the marvels of art to which civilization has given birth . Some Indians have been educated by the whites , not many ; and what has been the consequence ? In nearly all instances , they have gone back to their savage customs , and utterly renounced the strange civilization thrust upon them . Many Indian names are mentioned , to be sure , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all , of them belong to the halfbreeds , to whom , we fancy , the greater part of Indian civilization has been and will be confined . What might have been done , had our treatment of them been such , as to recommend civilization and Christianity to their good-will , it is now too late to say . We have gone on wrong principles from the beginning . We have bought the Indian lands for a song , and made treaties , which we have constantly broken . We have regarded them as independent nations , and yet have taken them under our pupilage . We suffer them to remain under solemn guaranties , within our State territories , a separate race , with habits , manners , principles , utterly averse from our own ; and , when the teeming population of the borders overruns their territories , we insist upon buying out their lands and driving them away . The whole proceeding of treaty-making with Indian tribes , turns out to be a solemn farce . If a white man kill an Indian , do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with according to Indian principles of justice ? If an Indian kill a white man , do we not demand his surrender , and persevere until we obtain it ? In point of fact , the amount of the whole matter is simply this . We regard the Indians as independent nations , just far enough to subserve our own interests . We are willing to treat with them for their lands , and hold them to their concessions ; so far they are independent nations . But when we want more , we take another position ; and , as they are not independent nations , and have no standing armies , and can not enforce their rights and compel us to maintain our own stipulations , we proceed to wrong them , by force or fraud , into other treaties , with similar concessions , to be observed with a similar good faith . We get a few half-breeds on our side , we bribe a few recreant chiefs to make their mark on the parchment , and thus we have another treaty of concession to our avarice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulations on our part , sanctioned by pledged national faith ! What trouble we are in at the South ! We are marching our troops down upon the poor Cherokees , and commissioning our veteran generals to force that independent nation to quit the homes of their childhood , and tbe graves of their fathers , for unknown lands far off in the West . And we are doing it , by way of carrying into effect a treaty extorted by the most infamous means ; a treaty against which the Cherokee nation rise up almost in a mass , and will probably carry their resistance to bloodshed . But our regard to the faith of treaties is so delicate , that we persist in driving away , at the point of the bayonet , the plundered inheritors of the soil , careless of all the ties we break , all the lives we shorten , all the scenes of woe we cause . In fact , we started wrong at the outset , and we have probably gone wrong too far to retrace our steps . We ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of submitting to our laws , and supporting our institutions ; and , if they refused , we might , with a clearer conscience , have let civilization take its course . The savage tribes , who held this continent by an uncertain occupancy , roaming over its vast regions as hunters , or in deadly warfare with each other , had no right , in the nature of things , to shut this half of the world against the introduction of civilized life . TTo say , that they had such a right , would involve the monstrous conclusion , // July , McKenney and Hall 's History that this immense continent might be for ever closed , in obedience to principles sanctioned by the Providence of God , against intellectual culture and pure religion ; that it might and ought to be for ever filled with the most revolting barbarism , the most heathenish ignorance , the most degrading superstition . Such a conclusion , it is needless to say , is against the most manifest designs of Providence . But , even if this position were supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained in point of fact . Men will not be controlled by unintelligible refinements and wiredrawn theories . The moment the new world was discovered , the doom of the savage races who inhabited it was sealed ; they must either conform to the institutions of the Europeans , or disappear from the face of the earth . The ardent and uneasy spirits of the old world , driven by religious zeal or discontent at home , could have been restrained from throwing themselves upon the American shore , by no cobweb trammels of speculating civilians . Barbarism and civilization were set up , face to face , and one or the other must fall in the encounter . The history of two hundred years is a perpetual commentary upon this text . But our purpose was not to discuss the general subject of our Indian relations , so much as to bring together a few traits and anecdotes which these lives supply . We shall take them as we find them , without much regard to order or arrangement , with the single remark , that they will illustrate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and intellect . The editor is entitled to our warmest commendation for the abundant matter he has placed within our reach , to aid us in forming a just estimate of the Indian tribes . The series of Portraits is very properly introduced , by an admirable likeness of Red Jacket , the celebrated Seneca war-chief . He was a man of remarkable abilities , measuring him by Indian standards . His policy , - a policy sustained by uncommon perseverance and eloquence , - was opposed to civilization in every form . He " hated the missionaries and cold water , " and remained a dogged Indian to the last , adopting from the whites nothing but a love of strong drink . He fancied , that the Indians might still save themselves by adhering sternly to their own languages , religion , and habits ; with all his boasted sagacity , he had not comprehension enough to see , that , in the battle of the Indian and the civilized man , the Indian must suffer a total rout , // and that the only way of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invaders in their own arts . When it was proposed in council to establish a mission among his people , he replied , with no little shrewdness , " Your talk is fair and good . But I propose this ; Go , try your hand in the town of Buffalo , for one year . They need missionaries , if you can do what you say . If in that time you shall have done them any good , and made them any better , then we will let you come among our people . " On the differences of Indians and whites , he remarked , upon another occasion , that " He had no doubt that Christianity was good for white people , but that the red men were of a different race , and required a different religion . He believed that Jesus Christ was a good man , and that the whites should all be sent to hell for killing him ; but the red men , having no hand in his death , were clear of that crime . The Saviour was not sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the Bible given to them , and , therefore , the Christian religion was not intended for them . If the Great Spirit had intended they should be Christians , he would have made his revelation to them as well as to the whites ; and , not having made it , it was clearly his will that they should continue in the faith of their fathers . " - No. 1 . p. 11 . This is a pretty fair specimen of Indian logic ; the whole force of it depends upon a sophism , which a common schoolboy would be at no loss to refute . One of the most interesting portraits in the whole collection , is that of Mohongo and her child . The face of the mother is marked by a regular , placid , and thoughtful beauty , far from common in aboriginal physiognomy ; and both figures remind one of the Madonna and Child , - the favorite subject of the Italian artists . This woman was one of a party of seven , decoyed from their homes by a crafty Frenchman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a lucky circumstance , that this shrewd trick was not played by a Yankee . If it had been , we should never have heard the last of it . They visited Holland , Germany , and other parts of the continent ; but , on their arrival at the capital of France , their deceiver was detected by his creditors ; and the Indians found in Lafayette a kind friend , who immediately took measures to restore them to the United States . Speaking of the superior intelligence displayed in this interesting countenance , the writer says , // stantly in his society , sharing with him the perils , the vicissitudes , and the emotions incident to the novel scenes into which they were thrown , and released from the drudgery of menial occupation , she must have risen to something like the station of an equal . Perhaps , when circumstances of embarrassment , or perplexing objects of curiosity , were presented , the superior tact of the female mind became apparent , and her companion learned to place a higher estimation upon her character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . Escaped from servile labor , she had leisure to think . New objects were continually placed before her eyes ; admiration and curiosity were often awakened in her mind ; its latent faculties were excited , and that beautiful system of association , which forms the train of rational thought , became connected and developed . Mohongo was no longer the drudge of a savage hunter , but his friend . " - No . I. p. 23 . In the same number with our Indian Madonna , are the portrait and life of Push-ma-ta-ha , the famous Choctaw warrior . The regimentals of an American general on this red officer , form a strange antithesis to all our notions of Indian costume . He made himself famous both in savage and civilized warfare , - pretty much the same thing , - and raised himself , from a humble station , to a distinguished rank . Among other peculiarities , he was an advocate of polygamy . To the question , whether he did not think the custom wrong , he replied ; " No . Is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can that be , when there are more women than men , unless some men marry more than one ? When our great father , the President , caused the Indians to be counted last year , it was found that the women were most numerous ; and if one man could have but one wife , some woman would have no husband . " - No . I. p. 33 . This argument was perfectly satisfactory to Push-ma-ta-ha . Being a reasonable man , however , he confined himself , with exemplary fidelity , to two wives . An unusual number of his speeches are preserved ; but the most striking one of all , is that addressed just before his death , in Washington , to his Indian friends . " I shall die , but you will return to our brethren . As you go along the paths , you will see the flowers and hear the birds sing ; but Pushmataha will see them and hear them no more . When you shall come to your home , they will ask you , Where is Pushmataha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more . ' // They will hear the tidings , like the fall of a mighty oak in the stillness of the woods . " - No . I. p. 34 . This simile is among the noblest ever conceived by orator or poet ; at the same time , it could have come only from a son of the forest . One of the most remarkable Indians , that we have any knowledge of , was Tecumth6 , of whom an interesting account is given in connexion with his brother , the Prophet . This chieftain appears to have shown his superiority at a very early period of life , except on one occasion , when , being a youth of fifteen , he ran away from the enemy in battle , and brought a temporary cloud over his good name . But this did not long continue . His subsequent brilliant exploits restored him to an ascendency almost unrivalled in Indian annals . About the year 1806 , he began his operations for expelling the whites from the valley of the Mississippi . He proposed a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them with unwearied perseverance , and urged them to lay aside their petty feuds , and wage a general warfare against the common enemy . His labors in this cause , the partial success that attended them , and his final overthrow , are matters of history . Tecumtht* maintained a very plausible theory of Indian rights , and argued stoutly against the validity of treaties , ceding lands to the whites . It was in substance , that , as the Great Spirit had given them to all the Indians for huntinggrounds , - and as each tribe bad a right to certain tracts of country while they occupied them and no longer , so that one might take possession when another moved away , - no tribe had a right to alienate that of which they had only a temporary possession ; and , consequently , treaties made without the consent of all the tribes were void . These propositions he maintained with no little ingenuity and power . On one occasion , ridiculing the idea of selling a country , he exclaimed , " Sell a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the great sea , as well as the earth ? IDid not the Great Spirit make them all for the use of his children ? " The following anecdote is told of Wan-pa-shaw , a Sioux chief . A quarrel took place between the Winnebago Indians and the inhabitants of a little village at Prairie du Chien , during the last war . The villagers immediately claimed the interposition of this chief , on account of his inVOL. xLvII. - No. c. 19 // 146 July , fluence , not only over his own tribe , but among his neighbours . He responded to the request , and went immediately to the village , with but one attendant . Seeing him approach without his customary train of warriors , the villagers gave up all for lost . In reply to their expressions of alarm , he said nothing , but sent a message by his attendant , requiring the Winnebagos to meet him at an appointed time and place that day . The Winnebagos obeyed , and Waapashaw took his place among them . After a few minutes silence , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed upon the chiefs with a threatening look . He plucked a hair from his head , held it up before them , and said , " Winnebagos do you see this hair ? Look at it . You threaten to massacre the white people at the Prairie . They are your friends and mine . You wish to drink their blood . Is that your purpose ? Dare to lay a finger upon one of them , and I will blow you from the face of the earth , as I now blow this hair with my breath , where none can find it . " Having uttered this bold defiance , he turned upon his heel and left the council , without waiting for a reply . Nothing more was heard of Winnebago hostilities . Sequoyah , the inventor of the Cherokee Alphabet , is a most interesting personage , but would be still more so , were he a full-blooded Indian . He is the son of a white man and a half-breed woman , and this circumstance essentially detracts from the wonderful character of his discoveries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant one . Instead of joining the rude sports of Indian boys , while a child , he took great delight in exercising his ingenuity by various mechanical labors . He also assisted in the management of his mother 's property , consisting of a farm , and cattle , and horses . In his intercourse with the whites , he became aware that they possessed an art , by which a name , impressed upon a hard substance , might be understood at a glance , by any one acquainted with the art . He requested an educated half-blood , named Charles Hicks , to write his name ; which being done , he made a die , containing a fac-simile of the word , which he stamped upon all the articles fabricated by his mechanical ingenuity . From this he proceeded to the art of drawing , in which he made rapid progress , before he had an opportunity of seeing a picture or engraving . These accomplishments made the // young man very popular among his associates , and particularly among the red ladies ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . At length , however , he was prevailed upon to join his companions , and share in the carouse , which had been supplied by his own industry . But he soon wearied of an idle and dissipated life , suddenly resolved to give up drinking , and learned the trade of a blacksmith by his own unaided efforts . In the year 1820 , while on a visit to some friends in a Cherokee village , he listened to a conversation on the art of writing , which seems always to have been the subject of great curiosity among the Indians . Sequoyah remarked , that he did not regard the art as so very extraordinary , and believed he could invent a plan by which the red man might do the same thing . The company were incredulous ; but the matter had long been the subject of his reflections , and he had come to the conclusion , that letters represented words or ideas , and being always uniform , would always convey the same meaning . His first plan was to invent signs for words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be too cumbrous and laborious , and soon conceived the plan of an alphabet , which should represent sounds , each character standing for a syllable . He persevered in carrying out this invention , and attained his object by forming eighty-six characters . While thus employed , he incurred the ridicule of his neighbours , and was entreated to desist by his friends . The invention , however , was completely successful , and the Cherokee dialect is now a written language ; a result entirely due to the extraordinary genius of Sequoyah . After teaching many to read and write , he left the Cherokee nation in 1822 , on a visit to Arkansas , and introduced the art among the Cherokees who had emigrated to that country ; and , after his return home , a correspondence was opened , in the Cherokee language , between the two branches of the nation . In the autumn of 1823 , the general council bestowed on him a silver medal in honor of his genius , and as an expression of gratitude for his eminent public services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi . Whether he continues to cultivate aboriginal literature , we have not heard . It is to be hoped , the first attempts at Indian epistolary writing , in an Indian language with Indian // characters , will not be lost . They would be objects of great curiosity to philologists . It would be easy , to go on collecting interesting anecdotes and traits from these well executed volumes , but perhaps we have already given enough to excite the attention of our readers to the work itself . The portraits are a noble monument of skill and art , and a most becoming tribute to the memory of the departing tribes . Their lineaments ought to be thus preserved from oblivion , so that , if the time should come , when the red men are only known by tradition and history , their successors may be able to form a lively idea of the races , with whom the first settlers had to contend for the soil of America . In closing our remarks , we can not refrain from expressing our unfeigned thanks , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise ; second only to that of Audubon . It is a work in every respect honorable to the nation . As both the design , and the execution thus far , have merited the applause of the public , so we heartily wish it success to the end . We are glad to learn , moreover , that its circulation is not confined to one hemisphere , and that it is already attracting the attention of the curious and the enlightened in various parts of Europe . Under the energetic management of Mr. James M. Campbell , the publisher in England , a large edition is sold in that country . As a proof of the patronage it receives , it is enough to state , that the entire work , the plates , coloring , and letter-press , are executed anew in London for the British market , and that there is encouragement for an extensive sale on the continent.
