The scene lies in the Ager Damascenus , and in the City of Damascus , at the close of the siege A. D. 634 . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in Damascus .  --  Time , sunrise . ( Enter Lucretius and Decius . ) Dec . Decius And is there then no hope , Lucretius ? Luc . Lucretius Yes , such as looks from out the headsman 's eye , When the axe gleams before a malefactor . Dec . Decius What 's to be done ? Luc . Lucretius Murder and sacrilege ! Dec . Decius And then to starve ! Luc . Lucretius What can the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waked The boa from his slumber , but he lies Gorged with his Persian victories , as if Sleep were the best security . Dec . Decius Heaven 's wrath Unvials on the earth  --  the plagues are out For Syria 's overthrow . Luc . Lucretius It is but just ; We have offended heaven ! Dec . Decius But know you not , Heraclius is entreated for our aid ? Luc . Lucretius What signifies his aid at such a pass , When like the scorpion , we are girdled in , And scorched to suicide ? To hear these wolves Howl for their Paradise ! as if the wretch That fixed the seal of hell upon their foreheads , Would cheat that hell of its own sensual slaves ! Dec . Decius It is a weary siege !  --  Damascus reels Even to her downfall . Should Heraclius fail To send us speedy succour , we are lost . Luc . Lucretius What say the Senate ? Have you yet proclaimed Last night 's determination ? Dec . Decius When retired , We were again convoked to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For some important matter . Luc . Lucretius Heaven forefend Greater calamity !  --  the times are bad When soldiers prompt the Senate . Dec . Decius Were you going On to the Senate-House , Lucretius ? Luc . Lucretius Yes . Dec . Decius Let us then go together ,  --  ' t is so dull In such a time to be companionless ! Exeunt . SCENE II . The Senate-House ; Euphron , Decius , and other Senators seated . Calos standing in the back ground . Euph . Euphron Fathers , I have convoked you at this hour , To reconsider last night 's resolution . There have been spies on your deliberations . The morning watch challenged a cowled foe , Who shouted ' Allah akbar ! ' and escaped On wings of lightning . We have tracked his path Even from this chamber , where he must have lain Treacherously hidden : Howe'er that be , Our weakness is betrayed . It now remains To scan our desperate purpose . Senators , Let us receive your views in this emergence : Only remember , moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , in this foul mischance , Which scourges so our negligence , that we Should change the resolution we have made . It is impossible for us to hold The city two days more :  --  we starve already , Though the extent of her necessity , Damascus does not know ;  --  she little dreams How certain is her ruin . I advise , Even as I did last night , to sue for peace , And leave the rest to heaven . Euph . Euphron Let him who controverts what Decius says . Speak to the Senate . ( A pause . ) Have you all one mind !  --  Know then  --  I summoned Calos among you In apprehension of this same restraint : For in a matter of such deep concern , A soldier 's sphere may stir the stagnant blood , And give it healthy action . Calos , speak , The Senate asks your free , untrammelled mind ! ( Calos comes forward . ) Cal . Calos For this unusual honour  --  had I power Commensurate with gratitude , I 'd bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , conscript fathers ! all I have is yours , A life devoted to the public weal . In early days , midst Rome 's exalted pride , ' T was deemed no mean occasion to decree The highest honour that a soldier loves , That he did not despair of the Republic . For me  --  I hold no commerce with despair . Damascus may be , shall be free again . Could I have had a voice with yours , last night , I had protested strongly ' gainst your vote . Do ye not know , that they who sue for peace , To such a foe as ours , can hope no more ? Had they one christian feeling , like our own , Some bond of human brotherhood , that extends Self-love unto a neighbour , then indeed , The dove might bear the olive-bough to them ; Not now ;  --  no , fathers ! we must fight or die ! And better to do both , to fight and die , Than sue to them for peace . No ; conscript fathers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your chances of success are multiplied ; Even now , while they expect your suppliant suit , Astonish their base hopes ,  --  and when the bell Strikes as a signal , let the ready gates Pour out a flood of war upon their camp , And crush them with its weight . Meanwhile , perhaps , The imperial forces may fresh succour bring , And seal our great endeavour to be free . Fathers ! I am for liberty or death . Euph . Euphron We thank thee , Calos ;  --  Senators , you hear : Shall we adopt our counsellor 's advice ; Say ; shall the vote be " liberty or death ? " ( Several voices . ) Voices Death or Liberty !  --  Liberty forever ! Euph . Euphron ' T is done :  --  and when the dial feels the sun Steal o'er the hour of noon ,  --  let the great bell Strike from the Martyr 's Tower for liberty ! When next we meet , may peace be with Damascus . ( The Senators rise and disperse  --  Euphron follows Calos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere you quit this room . Cal . Calos I wait your pleasure  --  but be brief , I pray you . We have no leisure now for idleness . Euph . Euphron Athenia !  --  Cal . Calos Is't then of her you 'd speak ? Euph . Euphron It may seem strange , in times of such calamity , To mingle private thoughts with public business ;  --  But there are secret springs within the breast , Which , when disordered , clog the whole machine . You love Athenia ! Cal . Calos If ever man loved woman . Euph . Euphron Calos , you have a treasure in that heart , Of golden fruit , that Croeesus had not bought , Though he had hewn his Lydian mountains down , And turned Pactolus from his shining sands , To bribe the Hesperian dragon . Yet you deem Your love equivalent to such a gain ! Cal . Calos If ever such unworthy thought were mine , How could I know the happiness of loving ? A heart that feels the immortal glow of love , Knows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long been known to me ; but if you think To wed my daughter , you must give me proof , Like Curtius , who would leap within the gulf His country wished to close :  --  and coulds't thou stand O'er such a verge as that which Marcus saw Before assembled Rome , and plunge within , Reckless of all things but the public good ?  --  Cal . Calos Ay ; though it were to grapple with the Sphinx , Or headlong dive where Typhon breathes the fires Locked in his rock-ribbed sepulchre ;  --  so long As Honour points the way , and Love 's fair hand Beckons me onward  --  name the desperate deed , And for the heavenly guerdon promised me , The Fates shall bow before ennobling will , And resolution o'erleap destiny ! Euph . Euphron And could you bear the hisses of the people , The execrations of distempered men  --  For making some unheard-of sacrifice ;  --  Say , could you immolate a noble name , But for a day  --  forego your reputation  --  Assume the villain  --  wear a traitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Within an hour , on your devoted head , And all to wed Athenia ! Cal . Calos Senator ! Well might I say I 'd grapple with the Sphinx , For never did cimmerian riddle wear So dark an aspect  --  prithee , sir , explain ! Euph . Euphron What if the popular breath should damn the sun , In his meridian glory  --  do'st thou think , His beams would fall less brightly ? Cal . Calos And what then ? Euph . Euphron Reputation is but idle wind Blown against character , which when unstained , With an immortal vigour may upbear Against the slanderous world its angel face , And fix its gaze on Heaven ! Cal . Calos Let me drink The Clarian waters that invest thy soul , Though I imbibe my death ! unlock the spring  --  And if the revelation blanch my cheek , The Sibyl whisper must propound some deed , Too horrible for human utterance . Euphron whispers him . Cal . Calos What do you mean , my lord ? Euph . Euphron Patience !  --  Whispers again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calos I am a very coward in all deeds Where honour dares not mingle .  --  No ! I dare not ! Euph . Euphron Yet the archangel when he folds his wings , Veils , not destroys , his glory ; think of this . Cal . Calos My lord , I can not think of degradation , And link the foul imagination , too , With the immaculate image of my love  --  Nature revolts at such dire contraries . Methinks you task my virtue in strange wise ; Or standing in such delicate relation To my respect and sufferance  --  you presume More than becomes you to inflict on one Disarmed by his affections , and your own ! Euph . Euphron Were my intent , dishonourable , Calos ! Thy serpent-twisted armour would strike dead The base assailant of thy character  --  But I would build up honour for thy name , And make thee heir to higher , richer treasure , Than the sun-worshipper of Persia lost , If thou wouldst only reach thy hand to take it ! Cal . Calos I have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my presence  --  Shouts of " Liberty forever ! " without . The senate 's last decree has found a tongue In every heart  --  and , " Liberty forever ! " Rings through the iron phalanx , and inflames With heavenly ardour ;  --  welcome , oh , thrice welcome Death-daring Hope !  --  Shout , shout again , brave soldiers ; Your eagles strain their golden wings once more For victory  --  and the red vultures cleanse Their clotted beaks to banquet on the foe ! Euph . Euphron Onward to battle then , for liberty ! Cal . Calos For liberty ! Exeunt . SCENE III . An apartment in Euphron 's house . Athenia and Ada . Ath . Athenia Poor sufferers ! would that my means were greater ! Ada . Ada They were so grateful , lady , that their tears Mixed with their supplications for thy blessing . I could not help weeping to see them weep . Ath . Athenia Oh , my poor bleeding country ! for thy sins , How terrible this judgement of high Heaven !  --  They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada Yes ; but the little infant that you saw , Died at its mother 's breast  --  and would you think it ? The mother laughed out loud  --  weeping and laughing  --  And then she shuddered so , in anguish , lady , I ran and brought the pretty flowing mantle You gave me on my birth-day , which she took , And , sighing , folded round her lifeless child :  --  It was a trifling present  --  nay , not so  --  Yet , pardon me  --  look , here she comes again ! ( Enter Ophira . ) Ath . Athenia Merciful Heaven ! what a sight is this ! Oph . Ophira Hush !  --  sh ! you will wake my child  --  so ! softly ! softly ! We shall have food enough when the moon changes  --  They say the grave is not so cold , neither !  --  Ath . Athenia What wouldst thou have , thou poor unfortunate ! Oph .

SCENE IV . An opening in a range of mountains ( the Libanus . ) The river Barrady breaking out from the opening  --  Damascus in the distance with gardens . A high precipitous rock surmounted by a castle overhanging the river . The scene lies below in the Ager Damascenus . The tent of Kaled discovered .

Kaled . Kaled Well Dera , with thy business !  --  Dera . Dera Sleep had fled The fearful people  --  o'er their pallid brows The night-torch spread a hue of ghastliness  --  Some bowed themselves in tears , and kissed the cross , While I stood by and smiled :  --  ' t was murmured there , The trunkless head of one they call divine , Parted its bloodless lips and whispered " wo !

Athenia I will not pluck thee from thy parent tree , Sweet rose of beauty ! while the raindrops hang O'er thy clear blush their modest ornaments  --  Another hour shall glory in thy smile , And when the daylight dies , the queen of heaven Shall fold thee in a silver veil of love , Forgetting her Endymion . Foolish heart ! As if I loved !  --  Yet truly , as I live , I fear I love the very thought of love ! Oh , childish joy  --  indefinite delight !  --  That I should dream so sweetly  --  and at morn Find my eyes wet with tears !  --  Enter Calos . Cal . Calos Embracing her . Athenia ! Ath . Athenia Thank thee , Heaven ! Cal . Calos What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much bliss At once should dissipate his darkest gloom , And make a noon of midnight ! Ath . Athenia Thank thee , Heaven ! Cal . Calos Say then , thou lovest me still , Athenia ! Ath . Athenia Love thee ! indeed I know not if I love .  --  When thou art nigh , I fain would be alone  --  And when away , I 'm sad and desolate :  --  Beshrew this maiden fickleness of thought ! I would not give the treasure of my love , For all the wealth that earth or ocean covers :  --  And thou wilt save our altars , Calos ! The holy cross , and every dear remain Of sainted martyr , still inviolate ! So shall we wander in our hours of joy , On the green margin of life 's sunny stream , With more delight than ever  --  shall we not ? Cal . Calos What grief can throw a shadow o'er our way , When love is cloudless ?  --  let thy heart be still , Young Halcyon , on its marble resting-place ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can harm Damascus ;  --  though his arm is strong , The arm above is stronger  --  even now , The victory is ours .

Athenia His ways are dark , and deeply intricate  --  When Heaven was kindest , innocence was lost , And Paradise gave birth to Misery . Cal . Calos Let not such thoughts plant lilies on thy cheek , My own Athenia ! all will yet be well  --  Come , let me bind a chaplet of fresh flowers To deck thy temples  --  I will steal an hour From anxious Care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nursed for thee .  --  Not always thus shall be our wayward lot , To wander here and steal from Love 's rich store , These precious moments of sweet ecstacy !

Oh , horror , horror , horror ! Cal . Calos Stay these fantastic thoughts , strange excellence ! I love thee more , Athenia , for that mind , So capable of wild imaginings !  --  Ath . Athenia But why Can truant Reason thus desert her throne , And suffer Truth and Falsehood , hand in hand , To conjure such conceptions in the brain ? Cal . Calos The mind is ever wakeful  --  when the spirits Grow weary , nature calls for their repose ; And thus our animal being slumbers nightly ; Yet the mind moves in its eternal course , Thought following thought , by that association , Which governed them by day  --  but like a king Throned with his vassals slumbering at his side , Its counsellors are gone  --  Perception 's messengers Lie mute before their monarch  --  whose mistake Leads on to such a labyrinth of errors , That bright Aurora , with her threads of light , Must be its Ariadne , or ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mysterious Nature ! strange Philosophy , That reads its true relations ;  --  Calos ! It is because of their reflex conditions , Matter and mind thus imaging each other , That I am led away by fantasy . Pray Heaven you fall not in this cruel strife ! Cal . Calos I prithee do not play Cassandra 's part , And prophesy of dying ;  --  I have here A fairer Paradise than Moslems have , With such an Houri  --  Come , away with this ;  --  How can this dull cloud pass before the sun , And turn our spring to winter ?  --  There , I knew , The dimpling bud of my Damascus rose Was only folding its sweet leaves awhile , To garner up more beauty !  --  Ath . Athenia Flatterer ! How well you coin Love 's silver currency  --  Beshrew me that I so should like its chime !  --  My bosom is a hive  --  whose winged thoughts Steal honey from the Hybla of your tongue , That when its absence brings their wintry hour , They may retire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

Cal . Calos If angels ever leave their pure abodes , They could not live more spotless than with thee ! Ath . Athenia Hush ! they will hear thee , and offended Heaven Blast us for sacrilegious vanity . Calos ! I fear I love thee more than Heaven ! Cal . Calos Love such as thine may strike its roots below , But ' t is a plant that blossoms in the skies . Look ! how the dew of heaven upon this flower Drinks up the sunbeams ! do'st thou think that they Were sent so many million miles to shine , Except to bless the petals which they warm ? Oh , would I were a pencil of that light , To live an hour with my Damascus rose ! Ath . Athenia Oh , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That every tear which lonely night distils , Might dance with gladness , when you brought the morn ! Calos embraces her . Oh , how the heavenly alchemy of Love , Turns every thought to golden blessedness ! Ada , Ada without . What , ho ! my lady !  --  Ath . Athenia It is my Baya 's voice  --  the innocent bird , That bears our dearest messages of love ! Enter Ada . Well , minion , thou hast found me  --  art afraid ? What hast thou there ? An arrow , by my life ! Has Cupid sped a shaft at thee so soon ? Cal . Calos Where didst thou find that instrument of death ? Ada . Ada I hope , my lord , it is no evil sign . E'en now while standing by the marble spring , Listening to hear two sweet birds sing together , That arrow rustling through the fruit-tree leaves , Pierced one of those poor birds , which fell down moaning , Even to my very feet . I plucked it out , And in exceeding sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird 's dying music , And its poor broken-hearted mate lamenting . During Ada 's speech , Calos takes the arrow from her , and breaks it ; a paper falls out , which he takes up , and reads . Cal . Calos " To Euphron , Prefect of Damascus ! "  --  Athenia , I must leave thee ! Stay here , Ada ! Where is the Prefect gone , Athenia ? Ath . Athenia What can this mean ? Ah me , some new distress ! Cal . Calos In sooth , ' t is nothing , love !  --  where is your father ? abstractedly . Yes ! it shall be done ! Ath . Athenia What shall be done ? Cal . Calos What Heaven ordains  --  Leave me , my love , awhile ! Ath . Athenia Leave thee awhile ! alas , alas , Damascus ! I hear the death-bird screaming on the wind , Wo to Damascus !  --  Leave thee awhile !  --  Farewell ! Going . Cal .

If I give up this city , they will think Calos the worst of traitors  --  though the end Must show the deep fidelity I bear her . Another day would find Damascus fallen : Why then delay ?  --  when sudden death impends , The direst medicine is not amiss . But , should I fail ! just Heaven , what wo were mine ! If I succeed  --  thy smiles , my rescued country ! Thy brighter smiles , Athenia , will repay This conflict between duty , love , and fear . It shall be done !  --  dry up your tears , Damascus !

" The very words ! Cal . Calos Had you another like it ? Euph . Euphron Even to the very folding in a reed Shot as an arrow o'er the garden wall , I found it ere I saw you in the morning , And this is but its fellow to secure Communication . May it be the last !  --  Had I your youth  --  Cal . Calos Speak not to me of youth  --  I have resolved upon the sacrifice ;  --  Yet how shall it be done ?  --  That is the question . Euph .

They could not find a motive for the crime , To satisfy astonishment . In truth , sir , My better nature shrinks.  --  Euph . Euphron Why should it so ? Cal . Calos The Christian precept , it would seem , were only A matter of convenience ! I have learned To deem it universal in its meaning . And I confess , my conscience does not like To view this strange transaction .  --  Euph . Euphron As you please ! Your country , nay , Athenia , has no claim Upon your pity . When Damascus falls ,  --  As fall she must , should the impending blow Strike as it threatens ,  --  how can you behold The flames  --  the sacrilege  --  the foul pollution , You might have once prevented !  --  look you there  --  They drag my daughter from me  --  she is dead !  --  No !

Teach me to make the treachery probable ! Euph . Euphron I have it , but it tasks thy virtue further  --  Thou shalt be superseded in command , And then revenge were natural ! Cal . Calos Excellent ! Euph . Euphron I 'll pull the strings that move those dancing jacks , The hangers-on of Government for office ; And they will wag their venal tongues at thee , And lash the rabble public into foam , E'en while you save them . ' T is an easy thing To open the light flood-gates that hedge up Public opinion , and let scandal work On reputation . Are you satisfied ? Cal . Calos Methinks Lucullus asks me to a feast , To banquet all the senses  --  I am lost In mere imagination of such bounty . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I could wade through blood for honour 's sake , But to seek glory in so rank a path , Shames me in doing . May we trust Athenia ? Euph . Euphron No , not a living soul . But I must act The hypocrite and liar for her sake , And curse thee to my daughter !  --  Cal . Calos Horrible , That love should mask in livery of hell ! Euph .

They are the men , Who , if they find a man too honourable To be a fellow-gleaner of the spoils , When faction 's sickle sweeps the public wealth , Lift up their angry voices to the crowd , And breathe around their pestilential breath , Till virtue 's self is tainted by its touch : So has it been with him ; the people cry " Down with the Greek ! Give us a Syrian leader . "  --  And for the good which he has done to them , They pelt him with hard curses  --  hiss at him  --  And call him General of their misfortunes .

How will she endure This outrage on affection , she whose mind High overtops all selfishness ? Luc . Lucretius Yet know , Her love is but the blossom of a tree Of most luxuriant verdure ; in her heart , The love she bears her country is supreme To all affections ; and her Christian zeal So shames the false and meretricious colour That mantles our deep-grained hypocrisy , That I have sometimes gazed on her with awe , As an angelic substance .

Do'st thou think so ? Euph . Euphron I know so , my dear daughter . Ath . Athenia But , my father , I dreamed an angel touched my lips with fire , And bade me prophesy ! Euph . Euphron It was thy fancy . Ath . Athenia ( Solemnly . ) Father , his wings were like a summer cloud Touched with the sunset ; and they veiled his face , Which streamed such dazzling brightness , I fell down , Stunn 'd with unearthly splendour . While I lay , Like Saul , God-smitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melody that floats From choral song and instrumental breath , Bade me arise . And as I rose , a hand Immortal , touched my quivering lips with fire .

Her sins are scarlet , and they cry aloud In blasphemy !  --  her day of doom is come . Wo to Damascus ! wo to the head of Syria ! " Raving . Merciful Heaven , suspend this retribution ! Hold thou death-angel ! take another bolt , That will bring madness ! Let me not go mad ! I would not die in madness !  --  Euph . Euphron Oh , my daughter ! Ath . Athenia My mind ! my mind !

Smiling unnaturally . Thou see'st I yet can think , my dear , dear father ! Such is the power of my most strenuous will . Now I will go and say my evening prayers , And then to bed . Good night ! good night , dear father ! As she goes out . Wo to Damascus ! wo ! Exit . Euph .
