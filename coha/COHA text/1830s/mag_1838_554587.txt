txt TrHIs last volume of the published decisions of the Supreme Court of the Union is one of unusual , and , in certain respects , even of singular interest . Such it must surely be to those , who as general jurists , and as lovers moreover of constitutional jurisprudence , - those , that is to say , whose pur // suits or inquiries are not confined to any mere professional round , - have yet been accustomed to observe the train of judgments of that eminent tribunal , for the last more than third of a century ; and who have been instructed out of them , if from no more intimate acquaintance , to reverence the great and venerable name of the late Chief Justice Marshall . Nor can there be more ample means of knowledge of his mind and character , than are supplied by these authentic materials . His saltem accumulem donis et fungar inani munere is the more than melancholy sentiment inscribed by the present volume , m a variety of expressive significations , to his judicial memory . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional topics , which are manifested throughout the principal cases reported , may he reckoned to be among the recorded honors , that already thicken round it with no unmeaning tribute ; all mingled at the same time , as they most unquestionably are , with a sincere sense of his virtues . And although drawing , as these differences do , their various hues from previous casts of mind and turns of thinking , or from peculiar circumstances , and perhaps somewhat opposite points in the present composition of the court , yet as they are touched by the mild and mellow glories of the just sinking orb , they equally blend , in a living though saddened beam , that may long continue to shed its salutary radiance , and send the cheering and sustaining influence of its reflection through the solitary night-watch of the constitution . Although this was not the first meeting , it may be mentioned , of that august tribunal , whose opinions are annually given to the public through this regular channel , since the disappearance of that illustrious luminary of law and equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to whom we have just referred , and whom we follow with so much regret ; yet , we may allow ourselves to say , that no night had fallen . And we were only admonished of some indefinite approaching change , by circumstances which began to cast their coming shadows . The indications were of a nature not to be unheeded ; nor could they fail to make an impression in regard to the uncertainty , in which the condition of that tribunal was suspended . We allude to that dense mass of vapors continually rising , and gathering around our highest seat of judicature , which assumes the endless and ever-shifting shape of constitutional questions . Cases of that now familiar denomination , - // for they have long created a distinct class , and compose a large chapter in American jurisprudence , involving principles of the utmost moment , - were understood to be lying over without any progress . No arguments had been allowed , for a year or two , upon such questions . Former arguments in questions depending before the court went for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued , were ordered to stand for further hearing , when the bench should again be full . This state of things had commenced , it is well known , before the decease of the late chief justice . Then , the vacant central chair , needing no crape to cover it ; auguries of various kinds , in the political state of the community , filling and affecting the mind with a solemnity corresponding to their importance , ( in the apprehension of those who could comprehend the crisis , ) to an extent beyond the mere conflicting interests of litigant parties ; signs and omens of alteration in the system , all but organic in their tone and character ; - all these things together conspired to produce a species of portentous pause , as it were , in the elements that were involved in the pending questions , and to prepare the way , by a gradual process , for the reversal of that powerful charm , which had hitherto held and controlled them in their civil combination , and which had served to communicate a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can hardly have failed to strike the dullest observation , after a survey of the present volume , that some considerable change has come over the spirit of our supreme national judicature , upon this great class of questions ; and conclusions press themselves upon the mind , which we are loth to assume as entirely foregone , which we may not disregard , and which we can not quite dismiss as without significance and force . This , we confess , is the last quarter to which we should have looked for any cause of concern . Perditio ex te would indeed be the deepest sigh of the constitution . But as the prospect is charged , perhaps to our too anxious apprehension , with shades which have not hitherto seemed to rest upon it , and we find ourselves insensibly using a tone to which neither the public ear nor our own is altogether accustomed , and are dealing , moreover , with topics with which we may well presume all our readers are not entirely familiar , we may be called upon to go further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misgivings ; so as to be able to decide whether // they have any just and serious foundation . We certainly feel some hesitation how to proceed with due respect to the important interests , and proper deference to the distinguished individuals , concerned in this discussion . We did propose to pause before entering particularly upon the themes presented by this last volume , in order to take a cursory retrospect , as well as to survey the present condition also , of the most admirable structure , of a judicial character , of which the world , as we believe , has ever seen the example . But we are admonished of the limited space that can be allowed , in a publication like this , to subjects even of the most acknowledged importance , - too limited to permit the scope to which our remarks would he necessarily extended ; and we must therefore reserve those remarks for a fitting opportunity . We may premise to the further observations which we propose to make , upon the principal matter of the present volume , that among the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , in its present advanced state of civilization and freedom , were those which related to commerce , contracts , and currency . Next to that instinctive sense of the intrinsic value of union , in and of itself , to the peace and prosperity of the community , which comprehended intuitively all the interests which that union intended to secure , these main points were seized as having most immediate bearing upon the general concerns of the social league , and were made the subjects of distinct and specific provisions . Union may be said , indeed , to have been one broad , comprehensive term , for all these interests . These important provisions may be considered among the direct details of its obvious principles . They may be regarded , in fact , as among ' the cardinal points of the Constitution . They extended , in the first place , to commercial intercourse in all its relations , whether with foreign nations , or among the different States , as well as with the interior native communities . They included , also , the coinage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion with the general power to establish a universal standard of value , may be mentioned the further authority given , of a similar character , to regulate weights and measures . Besides the express investiture of Congress with control over these concerns , its powers were supported and guarded against encroachments , or even approaches to interference , on the part of the States , by special and decisive interdicts upon the // local legislatures , in regard to the principal part of those special objects . The States were forbidden , for example , to meddle with the business of tariff , or to disturb the uniformity of duties . No State , again , was permitted to coin money , emit bills of credit , tamper with the payment of debts by means of tender laws , or in any manner to impair the obligation of contracts . In scanning the web , Sc ) carefully wrought , of union , it is at once observable how far these provisions go to form warp and woof ; and it is worth while to notice , how they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , of the Constitution . It is perfectly obvious how essential they are to the proper character of a civil government , professing to secure the ends of its establishment ; and one *vliich , while possessing the general powers of war and peace , and of forming foreign treaties , should be endowed , above all , with sufficient authority to prevent civil discord and confusion , and to protect the interests of all the parts , and the rights of the whole community alike . And it is more than matterof curiosity ,  --  it is a source of inortification ,  --  to tiace the incessant attempts to evade the force of these prohibitions upon the States , and to impeach the peculiar and pre*rninent powers given to Congress over subjects intended to be placed altogether beyond their control . Nothing can be more remarkable , in fact , than the constant course of argument against constitutional powers , of which the present volLime furnishes abundant example , by attempting to give such a definition to each , as would exclude almost every case that would be apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional provision . Plausible pretexts , it can be easily perceived , would never be wanting for such ingenious purposes ; and invention could never be at a loss , either for expedients or glosses . But we believe it to be impossible , within the reach of human language , to use terms at once more significant , specific , and comprehensive , for the objects intended to be accomplished , than those which are employed by the Constitution ; and all precautions must prove vain , all language ineffectual , all provisions in fact abortive , if such as these can be successfully avoided or defeated . Take , for example , the power to regulate commerce , which is granted to Congress in the most general and absolute terms . Now , in seeking for a definition of this power from the nature of the * rant , from its subject , its objects , ifs design , and character , it must be evident , that it is intended to be entire and // exclusive , or that it is none ; or , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effectually in one depositary , and at the same time have a repeated existence , or coexistence , elsewhere , and that in a number of distinct , and , as to this point , equal authorities . The power is broken down under any process that shall impair its unity , or destroy its solidity- . Again , it can not reasonably be contended that the power , if used , though not to its full extent , is to be considered as being used but in part only , and abandoned for the rest , and thereof left derelict to the several States . It is apparent , that , at this rate , we should not have any general regulation of commerce whatever ; but that we should have as many customs of the sea , if we may borrow that ancient phrase , to deal with , as there were legislatures upon land . The power is not one that consists of l ) arts thus detached , and parcelled out ; but it exists as an integer , and forms a simple sum total . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is just as much exercised in respect to what it leaves unregulated , as in what it purports to regulate , whether by positive enactments or inhibitions . The legislative power given to Congress over this subject is as large , and as liberal , and appropriate , as the tuaritirne jurisdiction granted by the Constitution . It spreads alike over the whole ocean ; and flows into every bay and indentation of the coast , as fully and as forcibly as it swells upon the deep . Neither does the character of the element alter by its own mere ebb and flow . A different doctri*ie would let in , or rather would let out , the legislation of all the States upon the subject , wherever the wave receded , or space was left unoccupied , or any opening whatever afforded . At this rate , again , there would be no room allowed for the favorite maxim of political economy , laissez faire , in commerce , although it should be within the very purview of legislative intention . There would indeed be no end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from every quarter , each having its own particular interest in view , or some sectional policy to promote , by which the whole subject would he encumbered , and liable to be overwhelmed . It would be admitting the independent , and probably conflicting , legislation of the States , if not quite tip to the discordant spirit of the old confederation , at all events , to the limit of every actual and positive provision of Congress . The idea of admitting State legislation as a complement to that of the Union // on the subject , would be next to the annihilation of the constitutional power . Even if Congress should not have seen fit to exercise the power in any shape , it does not follow that it would have been competent for the several States to have ossumed it . Such has , accordingly , been the construction given to this power by the judgments of the Supreme Court . And it has been considered , further , that it did not stop at the water 's edge , so as to be marked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut that an internal State regulation , actually interfering with its integrity , and crossing the path of its provisions , was equally proscribed by its principle . This was determined in a case arising in Maryland , after much debate and the question has again occurred in New York , in relation to a local regulation of what is termed the passenger trade . The city of New York forms , as it were , the tunnel which receives the influx of emigration , amounting now almost to a torrent , from foreign shores ; and which , turned the other way , pours it out upon the wide west , and over the whole field of the Union . A law of the State , not of recent enactment , requires the master of every vessel , whether citizen or foreigner , on his arrival from a foreign voyage , to make report , within twenty-four hours , of the passengers on board , as well as those that have been landed in the course of it , under a penalty , which it inflicts on the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question upon which the court finally divided was , whether this was a regulation of commerce ; for , notwithstanding a sort of middle ground was taken by Mr. Justice Thompson , very consistently , to be sure , with his former sentiments , the judgment was not left to stand upon this intermediate kind of isthmus ; and that was the exact point upon which the decision turned . Mr. Justice Barbour maintamed , with great talent and ingenuity , in an opinion carrying with it the majority of the court , that it was not to be regarded as a regulation of commerce , but merely one of police . We are quite ready to say , that if the subject could be taken up and considered entirely free from the just influence of former decisions of the same tribunal , both in regard to principle and precedent , constituting the established doctrine of the court , in consonance with the tenor of the Constitution , and with that habitual respect for the decisions of a majority of that court , of which we can not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that would be persuasive , and perhaps prevailing . Without conceding that as a regulation of commerce it would have been void , or that the power in Congress was exclusive , or that the legislative action of a State was forbidden unless it came in conflict with an act of Congress , it was denied , and upon that the opinion rested , that the provision of the State of New York in question could be properly regarded as a regulation of commerce . When we recall , however , the reverence that is due to the authority of Chief Justice Marshall , which still forms part , in a moral sense , of the character of the same court , and are led to look back to the former opinions expressed and delivered by hini upon the same subject , and when we learn that his concurrence was claimed , in the grounds of the dissenting opinion devolved upon Mr. Justice Story , and come to listen to the clear and cogent conclusions drawn from the precedent and doctrine of those antecedent decisions by this last distinguished judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted with more signal force than upon this and the subsequent occasions , which we shall refer to in the course of this volume , we are necessarily led to pause , and suspend not only the expression of our own judgment , hut the judgment itself , for that just , final opinion , which remains to be formed . In our impression of the argumentative power displayed in the report of this whole case , we should do injustice not to combine the bar and the bench . And it would be equally unjust to confine that acknowledgment to the argument in the present case . The whole question we conceive to be fairly and comprehensively stated , and the difference of opinion to be very clearly defined and marked , in the following passage from the dissenting opinion of Judge Story . " But how can it be truly said , that the act of New York is not a regulation of commerce ? No one can well doubt , that , if th' same act had been passed by Congress , it would have been a regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only , would it be a constitutional act of Congress . The right of Congress to pass such an act has been expressly conceded at the argument . The act of New York purports on its very face to regulate the conduct of masters , and owners , and passengers , in foreign trade ; and in foreign ports and places . Suppose the act had required , that the master and owner of ships should make report of all goods taken on board or landed in foreign ports , and of the nature , qualities , and value of such goods ; // could there be a doubt that it would have been a regulation of commerce ? If not , in what essential respect does the requirement of a report of the passengers taken or landed in a foreign port or place , differ from the case put ? I profess not to be able to see any . I listened with great attention to the argument , to ascertain upon what ground the act of New York was to be maintained , not to be a regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain any , from the reasoning of either of the learned counsel who spoke for the plaintiff . Their whole argument on this point seemed to me to amount to this that if it were a regulation of commerce , still it might also be deemed a regulation of police , and a part of the system of poor laws ; and therefore justifiable as a means to attain the end . In my judgment , for the reasons already suggested , that is not a just consequence , or a legitimate deduction . If the act is a regulation of commerce , and that subject belongs exclusively to Congress ; it is a means cut off front the range of State sovereignty and State legislation . " - p. 157 . The idea of any dormant power , or unexpended balance of authority , to be used as a sort of remainder by the States , so long as it was not exercised by Congress , - or of considering this legislation of the States as a regular complement of that of the Union , to which we have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , by the Act of Congress of 1819 , regulating passenger ships , &amp;c . " This last suggestion is peculiarly important in the present case ; for Congress has , by the act of the 2d of March , 1819 , oh . 170 , regulated passenger ships and vessels . Subject to the regulations therein provided , passengers may be brought into the United States from foreign ports . These regulations , being all which Congress have chosen to enact , amount , upon the reasoning already stated , to a complete exercise of its power over the whole subject , as well in what is omitted as in what is provided for . Unless , then , we are prepared to say , that wherever Congress has legislated upon this subject , clearly within its constitutional authority , and made all such regulations , as in its own judgment and discretion were deemed expedient , the States may step in and supply all other regulations , which they may deem expedient , as complementary to those of Congress , thus subjecting all our trade , commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double operations of distinct and independent sovereignties ; it seems to me impossible to maintain the doctrine , that the States have a concurrent jurisdiction with Congress on the regulation of commerce , // whether Congress has or has not legislated upon the subject ; but a fortiori when it has legislated. " - pp. 158 , 159 . The Supreme Court had acted effectually upon the subject of one State undertaking to interfere with the commercial rights and intercourse of its sister States , in the well-known case of Gibbons and Ogden . It can not quite escape observation , that under the shape , not to say pretext , of internal regulations of police of the protective kind , on the maritime side of commercial States , to go no further , for the purpose of guarding against the introductions of such persons as a State may think proper to exclude , the fundamental principle , common both to the Confederation and the Constitution , communicating to citizens of each State , the rights of citizens of all the States , may be bro*ight in question . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some physical sense , with a certain gloomy exception , be true . But the freedom of commercial intercourse , even for forei0ners , it will be remembered , was secured by one of the most famed and familiar clauses of Magna Charta , - referred to with almost as much frequency , among the few that have been found worth preserving in modern times , as that relating to trial by jury . The rule itself was an early triumph of civilization , in advance , it would seem , of the age that established it , which has wrought itself into the operation of the jus gentiurn ; and the regulation , as well as protection of it , properly belongs to the general province of a national government , which may well exercise it with a due reference to all its proper concernmeats . In connexion with this subject , the power of establishing a uniform rule of naturalization has been expressly assigned to Congress . Few powers will he found more delicate in the operation of the federal government , to judge from experience , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to say , furnished her contribution to swell the present volume . We say this with sorrow , because whatever may be thought of the merits of the question , it is undeniable , that the tone and character of the decision chime in with doctrines , which tend , or may be urged , deplorably , to the subversion of the principles of law and property . This cause went before the Supreme Court of the United States under the double disadvantage of a compromising division , in the first place , of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth , and secondly , of a denial in effect , // by its judgment , that the Act incorporating the Warren Bridge , was any violation of the principles either of the State or National Constitutions . It is to he allowed , at the same time , that much of the argument , on behalf of the new bridge , on the final hearing , proceeded upon grounds quite consistent in themselves with the general principles of justice . And the opinion of one of the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the majority of the Court in affirming the formal judgment of the Massachusetts Bench , fully adopted the course of that portion of the argument , which was apparently intended to form in fact the condition of his own concurrence ; namely , that property was not to he sequestrated by the public , upon any occasion , without compensation . But this , unfortunately , it was confessed , when it came to be sifted , could afford no ground for any relief by judgment of the United States Supreme Court , and that the only form in which this tribunal could deal with it was , whether the act impaired the constitutional obligation of contract . A suitable reverence was thus , to be sure , manifested for the essential idea of justice , the principle of which was acknowledged , while the injury itself was left to seek its own redress . But this is a discussion , into which we own we have not much spirit to enter . The point , on which alone it could come before the national Supreme Court , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that at the same time , it is not easy to comprehend the ground , or understand the logic , upon which , if the Court considered the act to be one impairing the obligation of contract , while t was at the same time in the exercise of the right of eminent domain , it could be possible to avoid the force of the constitutional prohibition . But it is possible we do not quite clearly , or fully , comprehend that portion of the juridical argument , which was presented upon this head . And upon the main point of the opinion , we may decently copy the language of becoming obedience , and we may add , dignified submission , used by Mr. Justice Story , in another prominent case in the present volume , which will form a subject of distinct and further notice . It is proper to notice the statement at the bar , that the point of the constitutionality of this act has been already decided by this Court . If so , I bow to its authority . I am not disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions of this Court // upon any great principles of law , and , a fortiori , not that which respects the interpretation of the Constitution itself . " In the review , which we rather omit than incline to make , of this very important cause , it is impossible not to feel and to allow the surpassing power of this last most able and eminent judge , over all the materials of the cause , and the prevailing strength of reasoning brought to bear upon the subject , whether in relation to the force of precedent , or the weight of principle . Passing however from the tale of things that were , and considering the case itself to he settled , so far as it can be considered as settled , salvo jure in regard to the general authority of the constitutional clause which was brought in question , no further interest may remain attached to the result , or involved in the argument of this memorable decision , - at least none of so much consequence and solemnity as the bearing of any established rule of construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn into authority for the support of doctrine contained in the present . Such a rule and guide of construction , it seems , was deemed to be found in the prior decision of the same Court , in the case of the Providence Bank . The case , and the comment , are contained in the following passage , from the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Taney , pronounced in the name of the Court . " But the case most analo* , ous to this , and in which the question came more directly before the Court , is the case of the Providence Bank v. Billings &amp; Pittmann , 4 Pet . 514 ; and which was decided in 1830 . In that case , it appeared that the legislature of Rhode Island had chartered the bank , in the usual form of such acts of incorporation . The charter contained no stipulation on the part of the State , that it would not impose a tax on the hank , nor any reservation of the right to do so . It was silent on this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all banks in the State ; and the right to impose this tax was resisted by the Providence Bank , upon the ground , that if the State could impose a tax , it might tax so heavily as to render the franchise of no value , and destroy the institution ; that the charter was a contract , and that a power which may in effect destroy the charter is inconsistent with it , and is impliedly renounced by granting it . But the Court said , that the taxing power was of vital importance , and essential to the existence of government ; and that the relinquishment of such a power is never to be assumed . And in delivering the // opinion of the Court , the late Chief Justice states the principle , in the following clear and emphatic language . Speaking of the taxing power , he says , as the whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished , that community has a right to insist that its abandonment ought not to he presumed , in a case in which the deliberate purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case now before the Court is , in principle , precisely the same . It is a charter from a State . The act of incorporation is silent in relation to the contested power . The argument in favor of the proprietors of the Charles River Bridge , is the same , almost in words , with that used by the Providence Bank ; that is , that the power claimed by the State , if it exists , may he so used as to destroy the value of the franchise they have granted to the corporation . The argunient must receive the same answer ; and the fact that the power has been already exercised so as to destroy the value of the franchise , can not in any degree affect the principle . The existence of the power does not , and can not depend upon the circumstance of its having been exercised or not . " - pp. 546 , 547 . Giving all the effect to an argument of this kind , that might be asked for it , if addressed to the mere authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong , and before which they could hot fail of atidience , one can not but be struck with the broad use arid bold character of the inference drawn from the expressions borrowed from the case of the Providence Bank , as creating or affording , that is to say , a general legitimate principle of constitutional interpretation . The point contended in defence of that case was , that a State had no power to tax a bank , inasmuch as such *i power might be employed to its destruction . It was nothing but the old and stale argument that had been employed from the beginning of time , against the lawfulness of a thing from its liability to abuse ; and which , like the argument frntn what is termed in the vocabulary of the law , inconvelilence , or the objection arising from showing and catwyrng out a proposition to its extreme and violent conseis i'ea*onably conclusive against no more than the x Peflhi*y of the abuse , or the misapplication of a principle , nay be sound and even salutary within its proper cirinference . Bot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying or limiting the force of a sophistical exceplion , to maintain the competency , upon any moral gwunds of reasoning , of thus carrying the thing out to such // extreme consequences ,  --  and to set up on the principle to justify*the inconvenience , or to vindicate the abuse , to its utmost conceivable extent , to to pervert the purport of the answer to a false and specious subtlety ; it is to misconceive the wholesome economy of providence and society ; it is to confound all the rules of right reasoning , with the instruments and absurdities of a spurious and artificial logic . The argument , again , that a power given in general terms , is liable to be abused , and that its exercise is therefore to be interdicied , repugnant upon the face of it , has been met and refuted , with a respect it hardly deserved , a thousand times . But who ever thought of building up , on such a power , or on any kind of legal or moral power , the faculty , in ally reasonable sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent extremity ? Such an attempt can only originate or end in a confusion , we will not say of mind , but of language . Take the power we have mentioned to regulate commerce , for example . This may be used to lay an embargo on shipping . To lay an unlimited embargo , was undoubtedly a strong and extraordinary exercise of that power . But such an act , although indefinite in its duration , and exposed to such an apparent objection , might he truly and in reality a conservative measure for the actual security of commerce , and its ultimate protection and promotion ; although exhibited under the harsh aspect of a general and unlimited suspension . Yet who would maintain the justifiableness of such a power , that should he attempted to he exercised , either in that or in any other form , under the profession of regulating , hut for the actual and intended purpose of annihilating commerce Suppose that Congress should , by an absolute act , undertake to establish upon the face of it a perpetual interdict of commerce , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever , - could such an edict be considered as coming within the scope of the constitutional power ? We think the answer must be that it could not . It would be a most dangerotis and extraordinary ground to take , that because a power might be so used as to operate injuriously or destructively , it might therefore be justifiably used upon its own principle , for the very purpose of destruction . The power to regulate the currency may be so used as to derange , and possibly be fatal to the currency ; but who would therefore maintain , that Congress , under that authority , to say nothing of its duty , had // the power to destroy the currency ? Powers bearing on State governments , and intended in fact to be exerted beneficially , for the preservation of the State governments , might be employed at this rate legitimately for their destruction ; or powers given on the other hand , for the support of the national government , might be exercised for its subversion and dissolution . We must doubt , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigious an extent . Its ultraism , if we may be pardoned the expression , is of a new stamp in the annals of the administration of justice . Principles of such extensive import and bearing , deserve to be profoundly considered before they are adopted ; and should be such as to carry their convictions home to the conscience and understanding . We are sensible of the delicacy of impugning an argument coming with the weight of authority from a majority of the Judges , including the Chief Justice of the Union ; hut we can not help looking with more apprehension upon the establishment of a pernicious principle , than even an erroneous precedent . Such a conclusion , we feel morally sure , could not have been in the contemplation of the Court , in the opinion given in the Providence Bank case . It could not , we are quite confident , have commended itself to the judgments of the members of the tribunal at that time ; nor received the sanction of the sage and sound , circumspect and forecasting spirit , which then presided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in that case was well and wisely considered , that the reasons were discreetly and carefully weighed , that the rule there laid down also was in regard to a vital and indispensable power of government , the power to tax , which is essential to the support and existence of government , and which can not be parted with , nor presumed to be impaired , except by some clear and positive expression , we can not feel the cogency of any inference drawn from this opinion in regard to other powers , although high and important , in which these predominant conditions do not concur and , on the contrary , we can not but express our surprise and pain , at perceiving the extent into which it is permitted to be drawn . It can not , we think , be justly considered , that the power of general improvement , according to the advance of arts , or the economy of society , is equally essential and vital , as that which belongs to its existence and preservation ; and // that it should be equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , at all events , mere matter of speculative utility . To say that each must receive the same consideration , - that the objection to the exercise of each must receive the same answer , - is strong and decisive language but we do not think it is equally satisfactory . And to lay down a universal rule of interpretation , founded on the strict principle , or the just analogy of that case , is , it appears to us , still iriore robust and extraordinary . It will be observed , that it was not shown , in the former case , that the Providence Bank either was actually destroyed , or like to be so , by the exercise of that power . The argument was a wholesale one , urged against the exercise of the power at all , either in regard to that , or any other bank ; and it was one which might as well be employed on behalf of the exemption of any other corporate body , enjoying the protection of society , and hound to participate in its burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the Providence Bank case , that the sure tendency or intent of the taxation , was to effect the destruction of the institution , then the remark , which has been commented on , might have been drawn into direct authority . Government becomes subversive of its own end , when its purpose is bent to destruction . The social system is distinct in essential respects from the political , and its rights are not left dependent on mere political expediency . Whatever apparent analogy might have been found for any general application of the principle maintained in the case of the Providence Bank , in the circumstances of the Charlestown Bridge case , if it had been plainly shown at the former hearing , that its franchise would have been utterly destroyed , that was a point upon which we not only fully believe the mind of every member of the bench must have paused ,  --  but we are firmly persuaded , moreover , that such as supposed , in this last opinion of the Court , could not have been the answering judgment of Chief Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same mind with Cicero , that every public act of an agrarian nature , went directly to undermine the foundations of the republic , that it could be marked only as a measure of violence , to snatch away that which had been justly enjoyed for years or ages ; and that all civil rights otight to be protected by a comprehensive equity .

" * But another , and by no means the case of the least claim , contained in the present volume , to a concluding share n our notice and reflections , is that of the Bank of Kentucky . Upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should extend them to the whole scope and compass of the case , they would not exceed our sense of its importance . When this case was formerly argued before the court , as it had been , we are informed that a majority of the judges , who then heard it , were decidedly of opinion , that the act of the legislature of Kentucky , establishing this bank , was unconstitutional and void , as amounting to an authority to emit bills of credit , on behalf of the State , within the prohibition of the constitution of the United States ; and among that majority was Chief Justice Marshall . The principle was considered to be decided in the case of the State of Missouri , which is found in an earlier volume . The first question naturally presenting itself in the case was , what was the meaning of the clause of the constitution , that " no State shall emit bills of credit , " or , in other words , what is a bill of credit , in the sense of that instrument ? Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case of Craig v. The State of Missouri , J had not supposed , that this was a matter which could be brought into contestation , at least unless the authority of that case was to be overturned , and the Court were to be set adrift from its former moorings . The Chief Justice , in delivering the opinion of the Court upon that occasion , in answer to the very inquiry said ; To emit bills of credit , conveys to the mind the idea of issuing paper , intended to circulate through the community for its ordinary purposes as money , which paper is redeemable at a future day . This is the sense in which it has been always understood . ' Again : The term has acquired an appropriate meaning ; and bills of credit signify a paper medium , intended to circulate between individuals , and between government and individuals , for the ordinary purposes of society . ' Again : If the prohibition means any thing , if the words are not empty sounds , it must comprehend the emission of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of common circulation . ' One should suppose , that this language was sufficiently exact and definite to remove all possible doubt upon the point ; and it has the more weight , because it came from one , who was himself an actor in the very times when bills of credit constituted the currency of the whole country , and whose experience justified him in this exposition . " But , it seems , that this definition is not now deemed satisfactory , or to be adhered to ; and a new exposition is sought , which , in its predicaments , shall not comprehend the bills in question . The arguments of the learned counsel for the bank , on the present occasion have , as it appears to me , sought for a definition , which shall exclude any perils to their case ; rather than a definition founded in the intention and language of the constitution . " - pp. 3529 , 330 . We can rdlow ourselves to do no more than refer such of our readers , as are not already acquainted with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very able arguments of the eminent counsel on both sides , and the opinion of the court delivered by Mr. Justice McLean , together with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Story ; which , in our view , we do not hesitate to say , is r4plique sans r*ponse , and which we can not refrain from referring to as exhausting the merits of the question , and establishing the construction which had been given to the clause in controversy , by the roost conclusive proofs of historical and logical induction , and superadded weight of judicial authority . It would not comport with the character of this journal , nor the purpose of this article , to go into a critical legal analysis of any of the important cases in this volume ; and we would here willingly dismiss a portion of the subject which gives rise to a variety of reflections , upon some of which we will task the patience of our readers to detain them a moment longer . It can hardly be doubted , we are inclined to believe , that the original object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded , concerning the power of the government over the circulating medium , was to take from the States the control over the currency of the country ; and that all paper issues , moreover , of every description , were included in the prohibition . A common currency is as important to the convenience , and well-being , and even to the social existence of a community , it is no extravagance to say , as a common air or langi.iage . The question has lately been started in // an important form from a high quarter , for the first time after the usage and practice of half a century , - or more singularly still , it is hardly admitted to he any question at all , - whether the government , that is to say Congress , is under any obligation to provide a medium of Exchange for men in business . It had been previously remarked , in a published communication from the same distinguished source , of a less grave and weighty character , that the inquiry , whether the founders of the constitution also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate banks , would now he more curious than useful ; as that matter , so far as relates to the mere question of power , must be regarded , it is observed , as settled in favor of the continued authority of the States . And we have no disposition to controvert this proposition . It is stated , to be sure , and admitted as a necessary consequence in delivering the opinion of the court , by Mr. Justice McLean , in the Bank of Kentucky case , that if the entire control of the currency , paper as well as metallic , was intended to be given to Congress , and that if , moreover , the conclusion is a sound one , that a State can not do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly , it must follow , that all banks incorporated by a State are unconstitutional . But the idea is considered at once so startling , as striking a deadly blow against the State banks , which contained a capital of near four hundred million of dollars , and supply in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , that the court shrunk , not without reason , from coming to so sweeping a conclusion and they well say , that a uniform course of action , involving the right to the exercise of so important a power by the State governments for half a century , and that , as they observe , almost without question , is no unsatisfactory evidence , that " the power is rightfully exercised . " But while stating this prudent result with this laudable caution and discretion , they judiciously avoid pressing it into the service of their final decision in this immediate case then before them . In point of fact , however , it is certain that this power had been drawn in question with great weight both of intellectual and constitutional authority . But on the other hand , as no seasonable means were employed to arrest this exercise of power on the part of the States until it had got to such a head , and the matter had become of so much magnitude , and the habit so much fixed in the actual condition of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ate , and the interest created under it so vast and universal , and its ramifications extended so far and wide into all the concerns of the community , - that the theoretic problem was obliged to be regarded , in its political sense , as having received this practical solution ; and those who strove in vain to reconcile it to the text and spirit of the constitution , looking at its positive provisions and prohibitions upon the subject , despaired of reducing the practice to the prescription . It was one of those strong kinds of cases which finally make their own law , and which sustain the sturdy Saxon maxim of the law , cornmunis error facit jus . All this must be acknowledged at the present day , whatever might once have been the true course of action and opinion , to have been equally the just dictate of good sense and of patriotic submission , which consoles itself for an unquestionable departure from the intention of the constitution , by the reflection , that it can not now be altered and recalled without a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vain to say , that the States have not thus legalized a currency , other than what the constitution proposed ; and counter in fact to what it contemplated , as legitimate . But at the same time it is manifest , that the constitution did contemplate the providing of some currency more comprehensive and manageable than coin . And under the combined and self-adjusted system of national and State institutions for this purpose , - similar and congenial in some measure to our general political institutions , - it is now pretty universally confessed , that we have hitherto realized as sound and wholesome a currency as any country has ever enjoyed . Still there is some point at which departure should stop . And we may read a lesson , if it be not too late , in this very decision of the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky , of the proclivity which error acquires , and the power by which it propagates itself , when it abandons the polarity of principle , and wanders from its magnetic path , - both from the difficulty of recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural tendency to go on and increase a divergency that has once commenced . The transition again from a mere State government institution , establishing a vicious currency , to a pure national government system of finance having nothing to do with currency , and simply providing for all payments in which the government is concerned in gold and silver , may not be very violent ; and both equally wide from the genius and object of // the constitution . To abandon the currency to the States may well be one step to the government 's confining itself to coin in its own operations , and detaching its own interests and sympathies from those of the whole community . But things that are so thoroughly knit together in the economy and habits of society , can not he either prudently or safely put asunder . We do not exactly know how far it may be liable to be considered more curious than useful , to advert here to the political history of another great kindred constitutional question ; but our reflections are unavoidably called , in this connexion , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of the financial concerns of the country , at the distant and dispersed points of the Union , over which the government was to spread , and one essential in its qualities and functions , of whatever modification it may be proved susceptible in its form and organization , to the operations and success of the government itself . This institution was , in fact , originally a vital organ of the government , established by the First Congress of the United States , by a legislative act almost coeval with the constitution , in perfect accordance with its character and provisions , upon the clearest convictions of its consistency and of its necessity . The conclusion on this last ground was then , and must now be admitted to have heel ) , irresistible . It was directed also , with special reference , as the act itself recites , to aiding and benefiting the commerce and industry of the country ; and it was finally adopted , as is well known , upon the slow , cautious , deliberate , and conscientious consideration of the first Executive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most profound veneration ; and to which was added , by this act , a new title to the appellation of Father of his Country . It has received the confirmation of successive Congresses , under all the administrations of the federal governments , together with an ample and entire renovation of its existence and faculties , after all the varied , instructive experience of peace and war ; and this upon the recommendation of the most calm and sage of the succeeding chief magistrates , who was a sincere convert to its accordance with the instrument of which he was one of the most effective framers and authoritative expounders . And it has enjoyed a duration , - with but a temporary and most eloquent interruption , bating also the present expressive period to it , - almost equal to the whole time of the government . It // may be deemed to impart something also to the force of this statement , even in the way of fact , that the constitutionality of the establishment , being drawn into direct judicial examination , was strengthened by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , after the most strenuous arguments in opposition , and upon the fullest consideration of all the grounds , which could hear upon the question . If any further test could he required , after all these solemn and conclusive determinations , to the wisdom and essential fitness of such an establishment to the constitution of the country , it is furnished by the present condition of the community , laboring under the total disorganization of the currency , xvhich'prevails throughout the Union , and which has produced almost a social disorganization of the Union itself . It fixes a seal to the prophetic and statesmanlike prudence and sagacity , in which the scheme was conceived and originated . It amounts to a demonstration , derived from universal suffering under the practical consequences of the abrogation of this constitutional authority , which all other argument and authority in the world could not have afforded beforehand , and which nothing short of this disastrous and overwhelming result could have produced . The consequences speak for themselves , and they speak volumes . It may he said , that human reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but be permitted , if we are not obliged , to pause and behold where we are upon this point . A common and universal currency , we repeat , is as important to the social existence of a community as the element we breathe , or the language in which we communicate and interchange our sentiments with our fellow-beings . The power to regulate and control the representative medium of value , which circulates through the veins , and even the nervous filaments , of society which runs along with the minuter capillary threads , while it fills and sustains the grand arterial veins of the system ; is one most assuredly of a vital character at once to the organs of the government , and to the active functions of the community , in all the various concerns of life and commerce . It " Lives through all life , extends through all extent , Spreads undivided , operates unspent . " This is a power which we both admit and affirm to be analogous , in a general sense , to that which was maintained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the Rhode Island Bank , referred to in the decision of the Charlestown andiWarren Bridge question ; to the power , that is to say , to assess the portions of the community with the expenses necessary for the support of government . In regard to such a power it may well he said , in the language of Chief Justice Marshall , that , as the whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished , that community is entitled to the strongest presumption in favor of its preservation , and against its abandonment . Akin to a power of this description , in its nature and importance to the well-being and intercourse of society , and to the carrying on of government itself , we maintain , is the employment of a faculty of some kind , we say not how similar to , or nearly the same with , the institution which has been tried and swept away , to aid in conducting the finances , and equalizing the exchanges , and compensating the industry of the country . And we can not but perceive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of the country , in the first place , when the power to create a United States Bank , - a question that was settled in the outset of the government , when the spirit of the constitution was fresh and active , and when was the time to determine the point at once and for ever , and settled with the sanctions of all the branches of government , and the benefits derived from an experience of forty years , not only it may be said with the general acquiescence , but almost the universal gratitude of the community , - for those who have not ceased to question its speculative constitutionality , have not refused to acknowledge its beneficence , - we have arrived , we repeat , at a remarkable pass in this respect , when this power is politically repudiated , and the power not merely to create State banks , but to allow States to issue their own paper , through their own corporate offices , or whatever instrumentality or machinery , whether with or without vaults for the precious metals , - but through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its most unlimited extent . We say unlimited , for although the Court do not deal in unmeasured terms , still it is obvious how consecutively and deductively one decision of this nature becomes the foundation and precedent of another and this last decision does undoubtedly furnish a simple recipe for the establishment of a State institution for issuing bills of credit , under which all the real effect of the former judgment // against this practice in the case of the State of Missouri , must necessarily melt away . By this determination , the Court has undoubtedly contributed to weaken and relax the obligations of the constitution upon Congress to make effectual provision for the currency of the Union ; and has testified its concurrence in the existing economy and policy on this subject , on the part of the States . We do not absolutely say , although there would be a good deal to support the conclusion , that the two powers canpot coexist , to wit , in Congress to establish a national bank , and in States to establish banks entirely their own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court has not discarded its decision upon the prior point of an United States Bank , and there is nothing in terms to prevent Congress from exercising what remains of its authority upon this head , yet it must be felt , that what is left is mutilated and impaired , and that the original power of Congress over the subject , is virtually paralyzed and prostrated . It must be obvious , it appears to us , that there may be some inconsistency in the two powers , on the part of Congress and the States , to establish such institutions in immediate relation to their own governments . For if there be such a power in a State to establish a pure institution of its own , upon its own credit , it must necessarily exist as a sovereign power , which the State itself again is interested in maintaining undiminished , and against which , no presumption can operate ; and which the State may claim to exercise , therefore , independently of any control of Congress over the currency . - But we are not anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize the final force of the conclusion to which it leads . We must he blind indeed to the signs of the times , not to perceive the cooperation of a variety of unfavorable causes to the preservation of the constitutional power of Congress on this subject , or what has hitherto been regarded as such . We have observed the reported declaration of a respectable Senator from Virginia ( Mr. Rives ) , that the provisions of the constitution upon this head , had become incapable of execution . It has been proclaimed , also , as we well know , from high political authority , as a matter of sincere belief , that the public funds can be as safely and conveniently transported from one portion of the Union to another , that domestic exchanges can be as successfully and cheaply effected , and that the currency was at least as sound , under the existing system // of State banks , as these objects could be accomplished by a national one . And this declaration has been followed by another in quite as authoritative a form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals in the transfer of their funds , except through the post-office , any more than there was to provide means for the conveyance of merchandise . None of these things can escape common observation . But it is matter of painful regret , to perceive how fatally the two principal powers of the government , independent of the legislature , namely , the executive and the judiciary , have recently concurred , we are very far from saying conspired , in legitimating the catastrophe which has been brought about , to the currency of the community . We can not but see here , that the spirit of the constitution has been rebuked within its own temple ; and if it is not subdued and reduced to the ancient spirit of the revolutionary era , how near we are again brought back to the verge of it , when States may not only establish and legalize a local currency , but when it becomes , in effect , under the prevailing practical interpretation of that instrument , the only true and constitutional currency . We may be pardoned to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the vestiges of the olden time . We mean to refer to the curious mutation which has taken place in regard to the precedent of the old Bank of North America , which took its charter first from the old Congress under the Confederation , and then quietly accepted one from the State of Pennsylvania . The original sanction derived to a federal institution , from the authority of the old confederation itself , in the first place , has gone for nothing . The State principle of power upon that point , has again prevailed ; and the instance of the old bank of North America , under its Pennsylvania charter , is adduced with that of the old Massachusetts Bank in Boston , by the Supreme Court of the United States , in their late opinion in the Kentucky cases , as establishing the foundation of their opinion of the practical constitutionality of State banks . While now , on the other hand , we see the late United States Bank , which has retreated back and sought shelter under the ancient covert , pursued ad internecionern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not refrain from adding a further remark touching // the singular oscillation in respect to the final prevalence of the majority principle . And it certainly comes to a strange conclusion , that the concurrence of a succession of majorities , through a Iong series of years , upon one point , manifested through all the organic forms of the government , and even the long course of popular elections , and ratified by every species of representative expression , should all go for nothing , and be considered as defeated by a sudden outbreak and burst of public favor towards an eminent individual . It is strange doctrine , certainly , that the extreme exercise of an extraordinary power , the executive veto , should have the effect of deterinining , or even opening a long-settled constitutional question ; and that such an issue should he considered as decided by the result of a single , or a short course of electioneering campaigns . - Again , we will briefly observe , that it is a very different original question , whether Congress should be considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all purposes within the grand scope of its general powers , and whether it shall be deprived of this faculty for carrying into effect an essential principle , of the governmQnt , and to the welfare of the community . We fully agree in all the importance attributed by the present Chief Justice of the Court in regard to the maintenance of such a general principle . Nothing can be more sound in its proper application . Nothing more salutary and conservative in its legitimate operation . - So far as questions of the kind agitated in this volume may be considered as determined by regular and " stated appeals to public approbation , " it might perhaps be regretted , that the Court could not have waited a while longer for public opinion to rally its moral force , and arouse itself to the rescue . It is too plain to escape observation , that the volume before us exhibits a remarkable diversity of opinion among the members of the Court , not only as to the extent of former decisions , but even as to the very grounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a more than usual difference , perfectly amicable and respectful certainly among themselves , not only as to the consequences , but as to the character , of prior judgments , to which some of the same members of the Court had heen parties , and others had not . And we are here led to venture a remark in regard to a point upon which we have long been pondering . We believe that // the professional part of the public , and all critical jurists especially , have been struck with a novelty and peculiarity in the manner of Mr. Peters ' marginal notes , or abstracts , as they are denominated , of cases determined in his reports . These notes are not the pure chemical extracts of the cases decided , if we may use that expression . They are not confined to those mere statements of points , either actually decided , or essentially involved in the judgments , and which constitute the placita of the elder books and abridgments . But they are large and copious extracts , in the literal sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frequently in the very phraseology , ipsissimis verbis , and that not always the most purely judicial diction , the sentiments of the Court , and not unfrequently the identical train of reasoning of the individual judge , who is called upon to deliver the opinion of the Court . The inference which we have rather been led to draw from this habit of the reporter , is , that there is nothing strictly extrajudicial understood by him to be contained in the opinion pronounced in the name of the Court ; that the premises are settled as well as the conclusion , and that deliberate expressions , gravely adopted and approved , are not to be treated as mere obiter dicta , in any future discussions on the same subjects . We are not disposed to insist absolutely , or very strongly , on the soundness of such a deduction . But in this mode , it is very obvious , that supposing the train of opinion coming from the Court , to be uniform and consistent , the most elaborate and authentic exposition would be obtained of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its general municipal system . Such a work , it is evident , might be in a great measure made , if , indeed , we might not already deem one completed , by the employment of such materials ; and by this means , were there no signs nor circumstances to the contrary , we might now be deemed to he already in possession of a very respectable system of constitutional her* meneutics . It must be owned , that the idea of such a constitutional harmony , must be a good deal marred by the appearance of the present volume . Nor is it to be inferred , that there has been any absolute monotony to the present moment . There are some general remarks , of Mr. Justice Baldwin , in one of the reported cases , touching a diversity , which he conceived to exist between certain decisions of the Court , on which // we have here no occasion to comment , that it may not be out of the way to quote . " I freely admit that a court may and ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration , they are convinced of their error . It is often done , though never without the fullest investigation ; even then , one decision does not settle the law ; when they are contradictory , the matter is open for future research . There is no more certainty that a last opinion is more correct than the first . Generally speaking , a construction of a law nearest the time of its passage , is most respected ; and is adhered to , though there may be doubts about it , on the principle of stare decisis . ' But it is believed to be unprecedented , to consider a subsequent decision that omits any reference to prior ones , and from some cause overlooks them , though they are in point , and by a court of the last resort , as having settled the law . If , however , such is the rule , it necessarily follows , that it can only remain until another last decision shall be made , restoring the old law , or making a new version of it . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a last construction of a law , is certainly as free in 1837 , as he was two years before . The very principle of this case is , that the prior decisions , though unanimous , are not binding ; the next , in point of time , by a divided court , can then be of no more authority ; and afortiori , one such opinion can not outweigh three contrary ones , unless every last decision has the same effect , whenever a present majority may think fit to make one . " - p. 400 . It can not be concealed in point of fact , that we have fallen under a new dispensation in respect to the judiciary . It can not be disguised that it has taken a new and decided direction , or rather departure . The difference amounts to something more than ordinary variation . The loadstone has lost something of its polarity . New points of observation have been discovered and pursued , distinct from the astronomical north . Whether the judiciary has any proper volition or not , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse . What was the law of the court upon some important points remains so no longer . Within a brief space we have seen the highest judicial corps of the Union wheel about in almost solid column , and retread some of its most important steps . It is quite obvious , that old things are passing away . The authority of former decisions , which had long been set as landmarks in the law , is assailed and overthrown , by a steady , destructive // aim , from the summit of that strong-hold , within which they had been entrenched and established . For it is a notable feature in this judicial revolution , that it goes not merely to shake the authority of former opinions , but to subvert that of former judgments in constitutional cases . A single , or perhaps a second decision , of a somewhat different type or complexion from that of former opinions , might not be considered as settling the question concerning a positive change in the character of the court upon these points ; but consecutive opinions , within so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all at least of the same aspect , all certainly imbued with one spirit ,  --  seem to give a determination to the doings of the tribunal , for the tune being , that leaves little room for further doubts or conjecture . Upon one or another of the opinions upon constitutional points contained in the present volume , there might be more or less possible variety of individual impression entertained , how far it involved the necessary conclusion of a final abandonment of the former fixed and established constitutional doctrines of the court ; but taking them all together , the matter is left in very little doubt . Whatever difference of judgment there might be as to the detail , there can not he much in regard to the sum total . From either two of the remarkable decisions in this volume there would be no difficulty in deducing the third ; that is to say , in divining , if it would require any divination , what it would be . It is very remarkable , also , that all the principles yielded by these decisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to the very essence of social obligation . There are obvious reasons enough for not exaggerating inferences of an unfavorable kind , in regard to the present or future condition of the judiciary , but we can hardly avoid the reluctant impression , that it has already capitulated to the spirit of the old confederation ; and that we are fast returning , among other things , to an old continental currency , and to what were once denominated , moreover , anti-federal doctrines . Under the progressive genius of this new judicial administration we can see the whole fair system of the constitution beginning to dissolve , like the baseless fabric of a vision ; and we may well seem to say , in view of all the toil , and service , and sacrifice of the past , ibi omrtis effusus labor ! Nor can we regard it as greatly relieving or consoling this conclusion , that the new set of doctrines , thus broadly pronounced from the same constitu // tional oracle , should have been enunciated with the dignified weight derived not only from elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellectual and moral worth , with large accessions of legal and literary talent , and all the varied accomplishments of polished and profound learning . It can not of course escape notice and remembrance , that in two , out of three constitutional judgments in this volume , if no more , as it appears upon the face of them , that of Chief Justice Marshall was different ; and had he survive ( l , it would have been in all probability , and we may indeed say certainty , only to have delivered the dissenting opinions . This duty devolved , in regard to all three of those leading cases , principally upon Mr. Justice Story , to whose lot it*thus fell , with a most appropriate felicity , to pay at once this parting tribute to the cherished memory of that great and spotless magistrate , and to pronounce their common sentiments in respect to the cardinal principles of that beneficent and beautiful system , which they had so long and so cordially cooperated together in the same sphere to uphold , and establish , and preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sufficient modesty , and yet firmness , as well as feeling , in the concluding , and as it were valedictory portion , of the dissenting opinion in the Kentucky case ; in which he touches upon the circumstances under which he was left to perform this mournful , but not silent duty , in the following emphatic and expressive strain . " I am conscious that I have occupied a great deal of time in the discussion of this grave question ; a questiofl , in my humble judgment , second to none which was ever presented to this Court , in its intrinsic importance . I have done so , because I am of opinion , ( as I have already intimated , ) that upon constitu. tional questions , the public have a right to know the opinion of every judge who dissents from the opinion of the Court , and the reasons of his dissent . I have another and strong motive ; my profound reverence and affection for the dead . Mr. Chief Justice Marshall is not here to speak for himself ; and kno*ving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I concurred , that this act is unconstitutional , I have felt an earnest desire to vindicate his memory from the imputation of rashness , or want of deep reflection . Had he been living , he would have spoken in the joint names of both of us . I am sensible that I have not done that justice to his opinion , which his own great mind and exalted // talents would have done . But with all the imperfections of my own efforts , I hope that I have shown that there were solid grounds on which to rest his exposition of the constitution . " - p. 350.
