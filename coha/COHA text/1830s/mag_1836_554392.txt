txt A VERY peculiar interest attaches to this little volume , both as it is a narrative of extreme and otherwise extraordinary // individual suffering , and as it introduces us to a condition of life , in some respects without a parallel in the annals of nautical discovery . The account of what its author saw and learned must be owned to be not so copious and detailed as could be wished . That it has not , as yet , been made so , is no matter of surprise . He is an intelligent young man , but modest , and not sufficiently aware of the importance of many particulars of information , which it is likely a judicious questioning would draw from him , to produce them of his own accord . He has not had the habit of composition , nor advantages for becoming trained to the power of generalization , or even of exact expression in speech ; nor has he means which would authorize a large speculation on the fearful uncertainties of the book-market . We intend no reflection upon his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the limited scale which was proposed ; but now that repeated editions of the work are called for , we can not but hope that he will place himself in the hands of some one who is qualified , and who will take pains , to extract from him many more of the curious particulars which can not but be stored in his memory , while as yet it may be fully trusted . The following statements embrace a few facts obtained from him in conversation , along with others recorded in his work . Horace Holden , a native of the towu of Hillsborough , in New Hampshire , and now about twenty-six years old , entered for his first voyage , in the year 1831 , on board the whaleship Mentor , of New Bedford ; Edward C. Barnard , master . The ship 's company , officers and men , consisted of twentytwo persons . The Mentor doubled the Cape of Good Hope , traversed the Indian Ocean , was prevented by adverse winds and currents from touching at Ternate , and on the twenty-first night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , and laboring with a violent storm , while running for the Ladrones , struck on a coral reef , which afterwards proved to make off from one of the Pelew Islands . Here was the beginning of sorrows . Ten of the crew took to a boat , and were never heard of more . Another was drowned before morning by the swamping of a boat in which the captain with three hands was attempting to leave the wreck . At daybreak , land was seen at the distance of twenty or thirty miles ; and this the eleven survivors , with a few arms and a small stock of provisions , in their only remaining // boat , decided to attempt to reach . They left the vessel , and , after rowing three miles , landed 01 ) a rock , presenting a surface of fifteen or sixteen rods in length . here they remained over night , and refreshed themselves with food and sleep . At sunrise the next morning , a canoe , containing twenty-two natives , cam3 off to them from the next island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were entirely naked . Each one was armed with a spear and tomahawk ; some had battle-axes . They were fantastically tattooed on different parts of their bodies . Their hair , naturally coarse and black , like that of the Indians of America was very long , and hung loosely over their shoulders , giving them a singular and frightful appearance . Their teeth were entirely bUick ; rende red so , as we afterwards found , by chewing what they call ( Ibooak. " - p. 32 . The seamen were fortunate enough to open a friendly communication with their visitors , who gave them cocoa-nuts , and bread made of that fruit , and boiled in a liquor extracted from the trunk of the tree . Their friendship , however , though , under the circumstances much better than their hostility , proved to he of a very qualified character . They took possession of all of the small stock of rescued property which they could find , part having been secreted in a crevice of the rock , and then , returning to their boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck . The latter had , however , by this time , deterniined to drop the acquaintance , if possible , and with this view , as soon as the savages were gone , took to their boat , and steered for the open sea . They were interrupted in their purpose by the appearance of about thirty other canoes , filled web natives , from whom however , they succeeded in extricating themselves after a little skirmish with those in one boat , the rest seeming to be more intent on an examination of the wreck . Rowing all that day and night , they reached another island on the following afternoon . Here they were discovered and visited by two savages from a neighbouring point of land , whom , exhausted and dispirited , they consented to follow to a harbour within si* , ht . Approaching this , they were met hy a large nun ) her of canoes , and taken on shore in triumph , and not without some violence , of a kind and degree , however , which seemed not so much intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they were now prisoners , one of the Pelew group , they were treated , on the whole , with no great severity . They were first conducted into the presence of the dignitaries of the island . These they found seated on a platform , on a rising ground , at a little distance from the harbour . " This platform was twelve or fifteen feet square , and was situated between two long buildings , called pyes . ' These , as we afterwards learned , were used by the chiefs as places of carousal , and as a sort of harem for their women . They were constructed in a rude manner , of bamboo sticks , and covered with leaves . They were sixty or seventy feet in length , and about twenty-four in width . " That something like a correct conception of this scene may be formed by the reader , it may be well to give , in this place , a brief account of the appearance , manners , and customs of the natives of this island . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group of the Pelew islands . It lies not far from the eighth degree of north latitude , is about one hundred and twenty miles in length , and contains probably not far from two thousand inhabitants . " The men were entirely naked . They always go armed , in the way before described , and carry with them a small basket , containing generally the whole amount of their movable property . The women wear no other clothing than a sort of apron ( fastened to the waist by a curiously wrought girdle ) extending nearly to the knees , and left open at the sides . The material of these garments ( if such they can be called ) is the bark of a tree called by them karamal . ' This tree grows from thirty to forty feet high , and is two or three feet in circumference . The hair of both males and females is worn long ; it is coarse and stiff , and of a color resembling that of the natives of North America . They make free use of the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , considering it the extreme of gentility to have the skin entirely saturated with it . Their arms , and sometimes the lower parts of their body and legs , are ingeniously tattooed . Their complexion is a light copper . Their eyes have a very singular appearance , being of a reddish color . Their noses were somewhat fiat , but not so fiat as those of the Africans ; nor are their lips so thick . They are excessively fond of trinkets . It xvould cause a fashionable lady of America to smile , to observe the pains taken by those simple daughters of nature to set off their persons . In their ears they wear a sort of ornament made of a peculiar kind of grass , which // they work into a tassel ; this is painted and richly perfumed . In their noses they wear a stem of the kabooa leaf , which answers the double purpose of an ornament and a smelling bottle ; and their arms , in addition to being tattooed in the manner above mentioned , are adorned with a profusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were amused , on finding that the copper-colored females of the island cut up our old shoes into substitutes for jewelry , and seemed highly delighted with wearing the shreds suspended from their ears . " - pp. 46 - 49 . A block for beheading stood before the platform , and the question discussed seemed to be whether it should do its office for the strangers . The wailing of the women , which before long became obstreperous , was perhaps decisive of the issue . After an hour 's suspense , a large bowl , richly ornamented with shells , was brought to them , out of which they drank sweetened water from a wrought cup of cocoa-nut shell . They were then conducted to another village , the residence of a prophetess , who , they afterwards learned , had interfered in their behalf , and from whose house , on arriving , they received a sufficiency of palatable food . Here " An interesting incident occurred . Just at the time when the servant of the prophetess brought out the materials for our repast , we observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . His appearance was that of a man of sixty . His hair was long and gray , unlike that of the natives . His legs , arms , and breast were tattooed . His step was quick and firm ; his motions indicating that lie felt himself a person of not a little importance . IJis teeth were entirely gone , and his mouth was black with the use of kabooa . ' Judge of our emotions on hearing this strange being address us in broken English ! His first exclamation was - " My God , you are Englishuien ! " He immediately said , " You are safe now ; " but he gave us to understand , that it was next to a miracle that we had escaped being killed on the water . " This person was by birth an Eiiglishman , and had been on the island about twenty-nine years . He told us that he had been a hatter by trade , and that his name was Charles Washington . He had been a private in the British naval service , on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , while on duty , been guilty of some triflincr offence ; and , apprehending that he should be severely punished for it , had left the ship , and taken up his residence upon the island . He seemed // to be contented with his situation , and * had no desire to return to his native country . He had attained to great celebrity , and was the sixth chief among them . His authority seemed great , and he exercised it with exemplary discretion . " Observing the provisions before us , he told us that they were for our use , and desired us to partake of whatever we preferred . Seeing that we were likely to be somewhat annoyed by the crowd of young persons who had collected around us , he swung his battle-axe over their heads , and giving them to understand that we belonged to him , immediately caused them to disperse . " - pp. 55-57 . From this time , things went on by no means amiss . A pye , ' with mats and other accommodations , was appropriated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied with plenty of provisions , such as hogs , goats , fish , yams , cocoanuts , bread-fruit , preserved almonds , and sweet potatoes . At length , having acquired some tolerable knowledge of the language , they naturally used it to open a treaty of emancipation , and , in the sequel , succeeded in persuading the natives , that it would be for mutual advantage to release them in consideration of a ransom which was promised . The stipulation was , that , should they reach their homes , they would send out two hundred muskets , ten casks of powder , a corresponding quantity of balls and flints , and an accompaniment of beads , belts , combs , and trinkets . These prelitninaries arranged , no difficulty remained , except in making provision for the voyage . The natives ( having consulted their prophetess , implored the aid of their divinity , and held a solemn feast on the occasion , ) entered cordially into the plan ; and , with their help , the ship 's boat was repaired , and a large canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men collected the timber , and wrought it with a few old inch chisels , having neither augur nor gimlet , while the women made mats for sails . Meanwhile a quantity of fish had been obtained for the voyage , and the women brought abundance of bread-fruit , cocoa-nuts , and yams . An old compass , belonging to a ship wrecked fifty years before , had most fortunately been preserved on the island , and this they obtained . So furnished , they put to sea on the 27th of October , 1832 . The boats proved leaky , and they returned the same night . Another month having been employed in refitting , they tempted the treacherous deep once more . Four were in the boat , and as many in the cauoe* // In the latter were also three natives , two of them chiefs , who , in their confiding simplicity , were leaving their homes , to go they knew not whither , and bring back the stipulated reward . The remaining three of the crew stayed behind on the island as hostages . Tbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope of falling in with some vessel in the China trade . Bad weather soon came on . The rudder of the canoe was unshipped , and rudely and with difficulty replaced ; the boat was dismasted , and , apparent comble de maiheurs , the canoe sprung a leak , which was hardly kept in check by baling , and stuffing clothes into the seam . After five days of such gloomy fortune , a sudden gust overset the canoe , and , having vainly attempted to right it , the whole party crowded into the boat . The provisions and water , which were not thus lost , were now mostly exhausted , and distribution was made of what remained . At the end of nine days they were still alive , and , with good weather , might have hoped in two days more to reach a place of safety . At this juncture , however , they unexpectedly discovered land . What follows , is best given in extracts from the volume . " When within six miles , we saw , approaching us , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small island we were approaching . At first the small canoes came near us , for the purpose of ascertaining who and what we were . The appearance of these natives was such as to excite at once our astonishment and disgust . Like the inhabitants of the island we had left , they were entirely naked ; and , as our subsequent experience proved , they were infinitely more barbarous and cruel . Very soon the large canoes came up , when the wretches commenced their outrages . They attacked us with brutal ferocity , knocking us overboard with their clubs , in the mean time making the most fricrhtful ctrimaces , and yelling like so many incarnate devils . They fell upon our boat and immediately destroyed it , breaking it into splinters , and taking the fragments into their canoes . While this was going on , we were swimming from one canoe to another , entreating them by signs to spare our lives and permit us to get into their canoes . This they for a long time refused , beating us most unmercifully , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking . " After they had demolished our boat , and kept us in that condition for some time , they allowed us to get on board . They then compelled us to row towards the land . They stripped us of all our clothing immediately after we were taken in ; and the // reader may form some idea of our distress in this condition , under a burning sun , from the fact , that before night our shoulders were blistered by being thus exposed to the beat . On approaching land we discovered no habitation ; but after going round a point of the island , we saw near the beach a row of small and badly constructed huts . We were compelled to jump from the canoes into the water , and wade to the shore . By this time the beach was lined with women and children , who caused the air to resound with the most horrid yells and screams . Their gestures and violent contortions of countenance resembled the frantic ravings of Bedlamites . " The reception we met with on land was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment we had received from the females of the island which we had left , it was hoped that the gentler sex would extend to us some proof of their commiseration ; but in this we were sadly disappointed . If possible , they were more cruel than their inhuman lords and masters . We were soon separated from each other , and dragged about from place to place ; our brutal captors , in the mean time , contending with each other to see who should have us as his property . Frequent contests of this kind occurred ; in one of which , during the first day , I was knocked down . The question of ownership was at length settled , and we were retained by those into whose hands we had at first fallen . Some of us were taken to their house of worship , called by them Verre- Yarns , - literally , God 's house , where they went through with some of their religious ceremonies , and we received a few mouthfuls of food , which was the first we had tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small piece of land called by the natives To'bee , but known to navigators by the name of Lord North 's Island , situated between the third and fourth degrees of north latitude , and in longitude one hundred and thirty-one degrees twenty minutes east . It is also known by the name of Nevil 's Island and Johnston 's Island ; and it has been hitherto considered by navigators and others as uninhabited . This is not surprising ; as we were told by the natives , that no white man had ever visited the place ; though it seemed , from the pieces of iron in their possession , and from other circumstances , that they had had some communication with the Spaniards and Portuguese iii that quarter of the world . Like many other islands in those seas , this is surrounded by a coral reef , which is from an eighth to one half of a mile wide ; but outside of the reef , the water is apparently fathomless , the water being as blue as it is in the middle of the ocean ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a mile of the beach . // The whole island rises so little above the level of the sea , that the swell often rolls up to a considerable distance inland . It is about three quarters of a mile in length , and not far from half a mile in width . " - pp. 77-8*3 . " The complexion of these islanders is a light copper color ; much lighter than the Malays , or the Pelew islanders ; which last , however , they resemble in the breadth of their faces , high cheek bones , and broad flattened noses . They do not color their teeth , by chewing any thing , as many of those islanders do ; but their teeth are so strong that they can husk a cocoanut with them instantly . " Their principal food is the cocoa-nut . They occasionally succeed in procuring fish , though the supply obtained during our residence there was exceedingly small . Their fish-hooks are made of turtle-shell , and not well contrived for the purpose ; but we could not induce them to use our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form so that they would not hold the fish . They did this , because they said that Yarns ( God ) would be angry with them , if they used our hooks without preparing them according to their fashion . Sometimes they are so fortunate as to obtain a sea-turtle . It has , I may add , something of a sacred character with them . They also raise small quantities of a vegetable somewhat resembling the yam ; but while we were with them they were unsuccessful in cultivating it . These constitute the slender means of their support ; and they are thus barely kept from actual death by famine , but on the very verge of starvation . When any one of them begins to fail for waiit of food , so that his death is pretty certain , they inhumanly turn him off from among them , to starve to death . " - pp. 84 , 85 . While we were on the island several earthquakes happened , and some of them pretty severe . On those occasions the natives were much terrified ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said among themselves , - zaltbec'too Yarns , Tobec ycttah'men , that is , Yarns ( God ) is coming and Tobee ( the name of the island ) will sink . ' They were also very much alarmed at thunder and lightning ; and used to say at such times , Yarns tcc'trce , God is talking . I do not know how they would be affected by an eclipse , as none happened , that I noticed , while we remained there . " - Pl* 87 , 88 . " They kindle their fires , as they informed me , by rubbing two pieces of wood together , as is common in the islands of the Pacific ocean ; and they cook their turtle or other meat , ( when they are so fortunate as to have any , ) as well as their vegetables , by covering them with heated stories . I should state , however , that during the whole time we stayed among them , fire was // always preserved in some part of the island , so that there was no necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take pride in their hair , and are particularly careful about it , washing and cleansing it almost every day . They do not color it , however , as the natives of some islands are said to do ; but they moisten it with the juice pressed out from the cocoa-nut , which gives it a very glossy appearance ; and it is frequently so long as to reach down to their waist . " Their mode of salutation is to clasp each other in their arms , and touch their noses together , as is practised in many other islands . " In their names , I could not find that they had any thing like a family name , hut only a single one , ( corresponding to our Christian natnes , ) as is the case , I believe , throughout the islands of the Pacific . I could not learn that the names were significant either of animals or other objects , as the Indian names of America are , and I never found any two persons of the same name . The names of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows ; " Pahrahboo'ah , the father of the family . " Nah'kit , the mother . " Buhwur'timar , the eldest child , a son , ten or twelve years old . " Koba*v'ut , the second , a daughter . " Kobahnoo'uk , the third , a daughter . " Wah'reboo , the fourth , a son . " The children do not address their parents by any word corresponding to father or mother , papa or mamma , but by their names . Their parents treat them on the footing of equality ; they are gemierally well behaved , and are never punished , except occasionally , when impatient for their food . " This island , unlike the Pelews , is one of the most horrible and wretched on the face of the globe . The only product of its soil worth mentioning is the cocoa-tree ; and those are of so dwarfish and miserable a growth , as to bear but very few nuts . These few , however , constitute the food of the inhabitants , with the exception of a species of fish caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants much resembles that of the islands itself . Cowardly and servile , yet most barbarous and cruel , they combine , in their habits , tempers , and dispositions , the most disgusting and loathsome features that disgrace humanity . And , what may be regarded as remarkable , the female portion of the inhabitants outstrip the men in cruelty and savage depravity ; so much so , that we were frequently indebted // 216 July , to the tender mercies of the men for escapes from death at the hands of the women . The indolence of the natives , which not even the fear of starvation itself can rouse to exertion , prevents their undertaking the least toil , although a little labor , well apj ) lied , might be made to render them infinitely more comfortable . " - pp. 88 - 9*3 . In this miserable spot , Holden and one of his companions remained nearly two years . Four of the party , and two of the Pelew islanders who had accompanied it , died meanwhile of the shocking hardships to which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the hands , succeeded , after having been about two months on the island , in prevailing upon the savages , by the promise of iron and other articles of value , to put them on board an English ship . The vessel which took them off , the Sabina , Captain Somes , was three hours in sight , during which time those who were detained on shore were vainly hoping that some effort would be made for their relief . The dissatisfaction occasioned among the natives by the small quantity of iron sent back from the ship , brought upon the captives still more barbarous treatment . When Holden , after his escape , reached Lintin , he found that the captain of the vessel had excused himself for making no further exertion , on the grounds , that it would have caused a detention of twenty-four hours ; that his men were already on an allowance of water ; and that the crew , being composed partly of Spaniards , and partly of Malays , were afraid of the natives , and only imperfectly under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his human nature , we hope that he is able to substantiate the last of these reasons . And we can not but think that Captain Barnard oxves to his own character fuller explanations of his course on this occasion , than have as yet , as far as xve can learn , been given to the public . We have no prepossession against that gentleman . We do not presume that he is unable to clear himself from all question . But if he can do it , he ought . No one will read the story of this poor sailor 's horrible captivity , without wishing to know three or four things which he can not tell ; as whether his captain did all that was possible to prevent the person who rescued himself from abandoning his companions in misfortune ; how he came to suffer the natives ' boats to return with presents so trifling , as to bring further cruelties upon those still in their power ; and above all , what he did , after he got back within the borders of // civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which most of them were only delivered by death , and the rest , after two weary years , hy a merely singular and unhoped-for good fortune . These are questions , we say , which it concerns his credit to ansxver , and we persuade ourselves that he is able to do it . He knows , as well as we do , that New England does not expect to commit her sons to hands , which will not be careful to render an account of them . The community of men , if they are to be called so , into which the unfortunate mariners were thus thrown , was insulated from the world , on a spot , as was mentioned above , three quarters of a mile long , and half a mile broad ; about half as large , we suppose , as the peninsula of Nahant . The number of inhabitants , distributed into three little villages , Holden thinks might amount to between three and four hundred . Here , apart from the rest of the race , they had lived , generation after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no traditions touching the first settling of their island . For aught they had beard , their ancestors may have occupied the spot for thousands of years , the increase of population being kept down by the recurrence , at intervals , of a like pressure of famine to that which reduced it , not much less than a quarter , ( as was thought , ) during the time our seamen were there . As far as could be learned , they knew nothing of any other human beings , except from some rare communications with European ships under sail , in bartering cocoa-nuts for iron , and from three visits of strangers , the memory of which was preserved by tradition , as having taken place at distant times . One of these was of a man , copper-colored like themselves , and named by them Peeter Kart , who , they declared , came anciently to their island from Terrtate , as he said , taught them their religion and arts , and closed his life among them . Another of these stories related to an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different island at the north-west , bringing a basket of the tarrow root , which he taught them how to cultivate . He too finished his days on the island . The third tradition commemorated three men and three women , who came in a canoe from yet another direction , and after a time departed , taking three of the islanders in their company . The island is a coral rock , with only a sprinkling of sandy soil . In this grow some trees of the bread-fruit and cocoa // nut . During the time that Holden and his companions were on the island , the supply of food from the former source was entirely cut off by the trees ' dying , and that from the latter was much diminished , by a storm which blew the trees down . Fishing , which had generally been a great resource , had , for some unknown cause , almost entirely failed . Five or six turtles were taken at different times . The only thing cultivated was what the natives called correi , an inferior species of the tarrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole region of Polynesia . This was principally raised in an artificial cavity in the centre of the island , into which was conveyed such soil as could be obtained , mixed with brakes and leaves . It was irrigated by water , which reached it through crevices in the rock ; and the labor of Holden and his companions consisted in conveying this compost in baskets of cocoa-nut leaves , and , when the root was planted , turning up the mud about it with their hands . It was cooked in a smothered fire , made in a kind of oven , in a shallow cavity , scooped out for the purpose . Fuel was laid at the bottom , and kindled ; and upon this was spread a layer of stones . When these had been heated , and fell upon the embers , the pieces of root were placed upon them , with a little water , in cocoa-nut shells . Over these were spread mats of the leaves of the same tree , and over all a layer of sand . Fish was simply broiled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . There were no animals on the island except rats and lizards , neither of which were eaten in any extremity . There was abundance of musquitos , flies , and more odious vermin , the last of which made a favorite article of food . Sea-birds were sometimes seen , but nothing winged larger than a fly was known to breed upon the island . The chief drink was the milk of the cocoa-nut . Some brackish springs percolated the rock . Rain-water they took no care to save . Huts are constructed in two ways . The better sort are built on a frame begun by two pieces of timber , each consisting of a stock and two branches , somewhat in the form of a Y. These are placed upright in the ground , opposite to each other . Then from the arms of one to the corresponding arms of the other , timbers are extended , fastened at both ends by cords , twisted from the cocoa-nut husk . From these lionzontal timbers descend others to the ground to make the side . From the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in // an angle at top for the roof , which roof is generally continued at the same angle , so as to reach within two or three feet of the ground , admitting the free passage of the air beneath it . It is covered with a rude thatching of leaves . The smaller huts are constructed of two rows of stakes , driven slanting towards each other in the ground , and seized at the tO* to a ridge-pole . The ends are closed in the same manner , an opening being left at one , sufficiently large to creep in and out . These dwellings are thatched in the same manner as the better sort . Canoes are hollowed from the bread-fruit tree , and another tree resembling it in appearance , which is not a native of the island , but often drifts on shore . Sails , of a triangular shape , are made of mats of the leaf of a tree called the sook . The mast is secured by cordage twisted from fibres of the cocoanut husk , one rope extending from the mast-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third to one side . The halliards of the sail are of the same material . No weapons are in use , except clubs in a state of nature , without finish or ornament , and spears with points rudely set with sharks ' teeth . The dress of men is merely a kind of sash , about a fathom long , which they call vetivet , fastened round the loins . It is made of the fibres of the bark of a tree called curramtoig , which admit of being separated into tl1reads , then tied together and wound in a ball . This done , the women weave ft into a flexible fabric , on a wooden frame , *vhieh may not unfitly be called a loom . What corresponds to the shuttle is not thrown , and rather resembles the reel of a fishing line . The women wear an apron of platted leaves . Both these draperies are dyed with a light yellow coloring substance obtained from a root . Neither sex wears any tl ) ing on the head . Holden , with a sailor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm-like leaves of the sook tree , sewed together with threads of the curramzoig , by means of a needle of fish-bone . But , as often as he finished them , the natives would take tl1em away , and tear them to pieces , as soon as the novelty was over . Yet they have both the Spanish and French names for hat , learned , no ( loubt , from passing vessels . Bracelets of turtle-shell are a choice article of female finery . The nose is not ornamented with any pendant . Necklaees are in fashion , made of polished pieces of cocoa-nut shells strung together ; sometimes these alternate on the cord with pieces of keeiim shell , ( which the // shore supplies , ) so as to show two white and two dark rings successively . The cartilage of the ear is bored , and the orifice , enlarged with much pains to a monstrous circumference , is filled with grass and leaves , and often with an ornament of wood , painted on the face presented to the beholder . Wreaths of flowers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahout the body . There was little like division of labor , though persons remarked for particular skill in some handicraft , as the building of canoes , would sometimes get the name of seurtup , or master-workman . When a hut was to he huilt , the meeting of neighbours , to join their forces in putting together the frame , under his direction , was not unlike an old-fashioned NewEngland raising ; and their civility was acknowledged in like manner , hy the provision of a repast of cocoa-nuts . There were no musical instrumeuts ; a conch-shell was sometimes used for a summons to the place of worship . The natives could not he taught to whistle a tune , but they had a low monotonous chant , uttered sometimes together , and sometimes apart . They had dances , consisting more in motions of the body than in changes of place . As to their religion , no indication was seen of a belief in a future life . They seem to speak of hut one God , whom they call Yarns ; but they have twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in or ahout every house , which is not always treated with any degree of reverence . These are rude imitations of the human form in wood , always in a standing posture , and ahout four feet high . The name Yarns is also given to whoever is thought to he visited with the inspiration of their divinity . It was observed to be habitually given to a priest of high consideration , but who appeared to have at least one superior in sacerdotal rank . The Yarns now in question had a son-in-law , who was also a person of special note , being generally the arbiter in disputes , and the adviser in cases of supposed malversation . Laws , sheriffs , scaffolds , prisons , stocks , judges , trials even , - it would seem they have none . The social system is as near as may he to an anarchy . The right of property seemed to be recognised , and that even in laud ; for individuals had their own he ( Is of correi parted off by houndanies ; but when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such forms and measures as seemed meet in the neighbours ' eyes . // Lord North 's Island is , in short , the very pattern realm of " Lynch law . " If the offence is of sufficient aggravation , the transgressor is forced into an old canoe , and pushed off to sea , without a paddle , and sometimes with his hands tied , to choose between drowning and starving . Burning has not been introduced . The word taboo is found among these people , and in the same sense of religious consecration or separation , as in the other Australian islands , thus confirming the tradition of the religious ceremonial 's having been brought hy some coppercolored visitor . It is applied , as elsewhere , to places and to other objects . As to the latter , a person who touches a dead body , for instance , and he who conveys one to sea , is taboo fully for four days , and less strictly for three more , and lives apart in a hut fenced round with stakes , his food being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The places under taboo are , the burial-place of infants ; the women 's lying-inhospital ; a grove of cocoa-nut trees , where a kind of worship sometimes took place ; and the great temple itself . This hut , called the Vennee Yarns , was distinguished from the private mansions by its size and its floor . Women were never admitted . The men met in it , in larger or smaller numbers , to eat together , every new moon ; and once in about every five months , it was the scene of a protracted meeting of three days , the occasion being celebrated with dancing . Here , as often as a particularly solemn act of worship was intended , an offering of six cocoa-nuts , with a wooden howl to receive them , when broken , was laid beside an altar suspended from the roof . The people sat by , apparently without any feelings of awe , carrying on their conversation in loud tones , till the priest seated himself in a mat on the floor , and began with fierce contortions of frame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be charged . When he had ceased and retired from the altar , a few trifling ceremonies were gone through by an assistant , with the breaking of four of the cocoa-nuts into the bowl . Upon this , one of the assembly , designated it did not appear how , hut ostensibly full of the God , advanced with gestures and outcries of tremendous fury , drank part of the milk , poured the rest on the floor , and threw two or three pieces of the nut towards the priests , who ate them . The unbroken nuts were then presented to the officiating priest , the murmur of the assembly // directly began again , and they departed each at his own pleasure . rro these ceremonies the prisoners were freely admitted . But no one was allowed to approach after the priest 's evolutions began . In such a place , time has not very many uses . Eating , sleeping , fishing , lounging , and the Neapolitan benevolence of a mutual examiuation of the head , for the most part make up the variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or skill , or athletic exercises , were in use , though a wrestling , which might better be called scuffling , was sometimes witnessed . Time was reckoned by lunar months . There were words for to-day , yesterday , to-morrow , the day after to-morrow , and the day next further on , hut not , as far as could be ascertained , any seven , or other number of names , answering to a less cycle of days , like our division of the week . There were no measures of quantity or surface . There was no money , or medium of exchange of any kind . Polygamy was fully authorized , though not usually practised . The Yarns above mentioned had two wives ; his inJinential son-in-law had three . Chastity in single , or in married life , was unknown and unlooked for , though infidelity in wives was rather conuived at , than consented to .

For want of a Lord Chancellor to oversee it , they resorted to a permanent rule , which had the advantage , in their view , of committing it to a higher disposal . It was , that children of different sexes , born at the taboo at the same period , were to be looked on as betrothed , and they were consequently brought up with that mutual understanding . Nothing appeared in the nature of a marriage ceremony . rho process of tattooing as here practised is thus described . *C We were in the first place securely bound down to the ground , and there held fast by our tormentors . They then proceeded to draw with a sharp stick the figures designed to be imprinted Ofl the skin . This done , the skin was thickly punctured with a little instrument made of sharpened fish-hones , and somewhat resembling a carpenter 's adz in miniature , but having teeth , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held within // an inch or two of the flesh , and struck into it rapidly with a piece of wood , applied to it in such a manner as to cause it to rebound at every stroke . In this way our breasts and arms were prepared ; and subsequently the ink , which was made of a vegetable found on the island called by them the " savvan , " was applied . The operation caused such an inflammation of our bodies , that only a small portion could be done at one time ; as soon as the inflammation abated , another portion was done , as fast as we could bear it , till our bodies were covered . It was effectually done ; for to this day the figures remain as distinct as they were when first imprinted , and the marks will be carried by us to the grave . They were exceedingly anxious to perform the operation upon our faces ; but this we would not submit to , telling them that sooner than have it done we would die in resisting them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tattooing , and the younger class less . " - pp. 102 , 103 . Holden escaped with being tattooed on the breast and upper arms only . The coloring is a blue , lighter than what we see on the arms of our mariners , who have tattooed themselves , from choice , with India ink . The figures on the arms are alike . That on the breast is different , part of it being composed of wedges , spreading in breadth from a point , like a fan a little opened . Unlike the practice in the Tonga and other islands , the pattern of figures tattooed is here in all instances the same . In all cases , if we remember ri* , ht , except that of the widening stripes , in which , of course , there will be a little variation , the angle , at which the lines of different width meet and cross each other , is either of 9O* or 45O* By all means , there should be given in another edition a print of the figures .

It is said in Cook 's Third Voyage , that tattooino in the New Zealand group is done in spiral volutes , while in the Sandwich islands the lines are always straight , and meet or cross at right angles . * It has been thought that in these regions alone the face was tattooed ; btmt there was one old man on Lord North 's Island distingtmished in the same manner . To be tattooed was looked on as a religious obligation . Only infants were buried . Other bodies were pushed off in an old canoe to sea . // The Vocabulary , given in the Appendix , is , for its extent , of great value and curiosity . We desire much to see it enlarged in a future edition . There is no appearance of any infiexion of verbs or nouns ; in which defect we believe we are correct in saying , that there is a correspondence with the New Zealand dialect , with the Tonga and the Malay . Of course the variations of meaning , which the more skilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here expressed , as far as expressed at all , by contiguous words . The word peepee , many , for instance , is prefixed , where the plural number is intended , and prepositions serve the use of cases . Something like a grammatical sign of the feminine gender may be thought to appear , in the fact that the men 's vestment is called vetivet , and that of the women , vetivetee . A person , who has cast a glance on the vocabulary , has not failed to observe , that it exhibits only the pronouns of the first and second persons singular . Holden is positive that they had no other , and accordingly that when they wished to say , lie , we , or they , a specification of the individual persons referred to was indispensable . Even the place of possessive pronouns was supplied by personal pronouns , preceded by the preposition alt , " of " ; as , ahnang , " of me , " " mine . " These are the peculiarities of a speech inartificial , perhaps , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of abstraction in this tribe appears remarkably in their having no less than three sets of numerals to count up to ten ; one employed in numbering fishes , one in counting cocoa-nuts , and the third in more general use . There were three different names for the cocoa-nut , in different stages of its ripeness . This has , however , an analogy with some of our own distinctions , as calf , steer , ox . They had but one or two words in common with the Pelew islanders , who accompanied the American party , and could no more converse with the former than with the latter . The sufferings of our unfortunate countrymen were of the most cruel description , constantly kept at work , under a broiling sun , at no one time having a sufficiency of food , at different times reduced to all hut the last extremity of famine , and at all times groaning under other inflictions , some of which it would not be good taste in us to specify . Under these hardships , three of the six who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , Sedon , Boukett , and Hewlett , // pined to death . The two first named , when so exhausted by hunger and suffering as to be unable to move , were each set adrift in a canoe , while yet alive . Another , Andrews , for some trifling offence , was beaten to death ; and , in the excitement against him , Holden and Nute were pursued , and very narrowly escaped , the former being protected by his master , the latter by the women . One of the three Pelew islanders died by starving ; another , charged with stealing food , was set adrift in a canoe with his hands tied ; the third , to whom the surviving Americans had become much attached , was left behind by them on the island . Having become so enfeebled as to be past labor , and not worth feeding , their masters began to suffer themselves to be persuaded that their release might he for the common benefit , and agreed for a promised present of iron , to put them on hoard some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1834 , when the British Barque Britannia , Captain Short , hove in sight , bound to Canton river . The details of the escape , which are not sufficiently pursued in the book , are of the most touching interest . This part of the narrative ought by all means to be expanded in a future edition . Captain Short says that Nute came on hoard in such a condition , that two or three days more of captivity would probably have terminated his life . The weather was calm , the Americans looked enough like savages to he very suspicious subjects , and the captain , being short of hands , was naturally quite uneasy about his situation . The consequence was , that , notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of our men , he refused to receive their Pelew fellow-captive on hoard , and there is small reason to hope that he has not , long before now , come to his dismal end .

Fair winds and fresh , speed its gallant course rich be the contributions it brings home to the scientific wealth , the common treasury of man . But still more , let its proud // flag fly , on every remotest wave , the sign of justice and fidelity . Our government lately thought itself under a dismal necessity to show itself to the poor barbarians of those seas in visitations of its angry might .
