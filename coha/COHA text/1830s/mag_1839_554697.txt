txt WHITEFIELD has enjoyed a traditional reputation in some respects , no doubt , resembling that of a great player ; and , as he has left nothing behind him , in theology or literature , to // justify his celebrity as a preacher , it has seemed that he was to remain a traditional wonder of pulpit acting , and nothing more . He was to have that popular , but not wholly desirable kind of fame , which is perpetuated by anecdotes , pointed sayings , and ingenious and amusing exaggerations . We might read , that Hume thought it well worth one 's while to go twenty miles out of his way to hear him ; and that Dr. Franklin , on one occasion , instead of listening to the sermon , walked from street to street in the neighbourhood , to make some exceedingly characteristic calculations of the reach of his voice . His pathos and thunders were proverbial . There was something picturesque in his preaching to thousands under the open sky , and turning every incident and object to his purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errand of love to human beings . Surely here was material enough for stories and descriptions of the wonderful preacher . Whitefield had evidently made a deep impression on the imaginations of the men of his day ; for , in every account they gave of his preaching , there was a distinct image of the man , of his look , his action , his fervor ; and some particular point was remembered , that he had made in his discourse . It seemed as if there was , every time , some new effect or uncommon incident , to fix the sermon in every mefrtory , to be transmitted to at least one generation . We remember hearing two of our public men describe Whitefield many years ago . They were then aged , and disposed to value the solid more than the showy . They were of ripe years and judgment when they heard him , and , though of strong passions , yet good masters of themselves and disposed to sce the whole of things . And the imagination of the one was filled with his preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing the new-born day with a glory the eye had never seen ; it became a religious memorial . The other dwelt upon the flight of the dove towards heaven , and gave Whitefield 's action as his soul seemed to follow the waving of its wings . They had probably forgotten much of the doctrine , but the image was fixed for ever . But what can narrative and description do to give us an idea of a great speaker ? If fond himself of contemplating renowned and useful examples , that are never to perish , he may think it a hard fate , that so much power must cease for // ever with himself , - that the subtile essence of oratory , its life and virtue , are as evanescent as a beautiful cloud or a grand thunder-peal . Roscius has a classical immortality , but it is only a name to be called and given . He is celebrated by those whom we venerate , and thus has a sort of life , and yet it is nothing . The Hermit of the Crusades has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conceive his eloquence , yet we know that it set the heart of Catholic and chivalrous Europe on fire , and drove countless multitudes upon expeditions that have left their mark on all ages since . We may read descriptions of pictures , buildings , and statues , and , if we have an eye or mind for such things , we may obtain distinct , and perhaps just ideas . But how is the orator to be brought before us ? How is the ear to gather the lost note that thrilled living masses , and made them as one man ? This music can not be written and reproduced through ages . How is the look , the movement , or even the attitude of passionate or graphic eloquence to be preserved in words ? Cardinal Maury has descrihed Massillon . From another writer we have an elaborate account of Lord Brougham 's manner . It is no matter that their descriptions are exaggerated . This may be necessary for true effect . The colossal need not be monstrous . But it is observable , that each has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a good idea of a result , while all the painful minuteness of description was intended , and we think in vain , to acquaint us with the means . it must always be so . The best descriptions will fail of what we most want . Without pursuing this familiar topic , we repeat , that Whitefield may be thought to have died with his voice . And why lament it ? He had his day of glory . He had the pleasure of ceaseless activity . He had his battles and victories . He drew all eyes and ears to himself . He was not shut up in the theatre of a city , like Garrick , but sent forth his voice over the earth , day and night , in the wilderness and in the streets , amidst the hlasphemies of sailors and the howling of the ocean storm , - in old , populous England , and along the scattered settlements of the new world . It is enough to have made such a stir in his own time . It need not be regretted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not left us one great sermon . But this very obvious view of Whitefield 's case is also a // very imperfect one . He has many claims to present notice . His character is original , his course original ; his errors are useful , and his sacrifices memorable . To an American it is of some account , that he made seven voyages to this country to do good , and , moreover , that his name is closely associated with the great religious movements here about the middle of the last century . It may he of some interest , that he died and was huried here . And , further , it should be considered , that , though we hear of him chiefly as an eloquent man , yet his power as an orator included qualities of mind and character , which might have made him remarkable , if he had chosen quite a different line of life . The charm was not wholly in voice and gesture . His invincible spirit , the fruit of religious faith and ardor , and not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new results , and desire to see a changed face put upon the religious world ; his prodigal benevolence , which is seen at its height when he is in peril , or denouncing woes upon the impenitent , and which gives a reasonable air to his romance , and almost a respectable one to his " mad pranks and splendid irregularities as a field-preacher ; his recklessness as to all temporal consequences to himself , and his absorption in the saving of souls ; his consuming desire , that others may enter into his rapture and his peace ; and , almost above all these , a childlike simplicity , an humbler sense of self , and a groxving gentleness in his deportment towards his adversaries , as he lived longer among men ; these are points of character , that may well give a man figure among his contemporaries , and a higher distinction than mere eloquence could obtain . But we are asked , Where then are his monuments ? Could all perish of so much power , ardor , and effort , and in less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Whitefield was not a wise man for himself . He was lavish of his resources . He seems to have had not one selfish or ambitious object , - no pride of a leader , no forecast to provide for organizing a party , with institutions , codes , badges , and rulers , which might perpetuate his name , and sustain the interest which his presence had excited . Instead of seeking to break up episcopacy or presbyterianism , or religions societies of any name , that he might bring the dispersed flocks into his fold , he sought only for hearers ; it mattered not what were their opinions or forms , or their places and seaSons // of worship . If he could wake up the languid preachers of the time to more effective ministration , they might keep their titles , cathedrals , revenues , and congregations . God 's purpose would be accomplished , and he knew no other . But he has his monuments . One of them is , that with Christians at the present day , differing from each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equal affection , respect , and gratitude . There are even churchmen , who delight to trace to Whitefield a change in preaching among no small portion of their body ; there is more of sound doctrine , it is thought , more of the ThirtyNine Articles , and more solemn and fervid delivery , since he , a priest of their own order , shook the pillars of their ancient temples with his new mountain-trumpet . Again , it is his monument , that he was foremost , even when a stripling , among those godly men , in and out of the Establishment , laymen and clergy , who set themselves against the skepticism and indevoutness of the age . It was a time to come out and speak ardently to high and low , as if they had hearts and consciences , and an endless future , and business , and pleasures , and woes that were not of this world . We doubt not , that the secret influence of his character and preaching has descended and now rests on thousands who never heard his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the Orphan-House in Georgia . The popular London preacher , the eloquent youth , whom old and young were following with love or hate , some trembling for their salvation , some for the safety of the church and the good order of society , and some to mock at the fanatic , - in the midst of all this public ferment and personal importance , and fond as he was of society and of crowds , and deficient , as he acknowledges himself to be , in natural bravery , - is preparing to leave all and follow the Wesleys to an infant settlement upon our southern shores , with the wild Indian and the hostile Spaniard for his neighbours , and a few rich and a few poor people for the objects of his Christian exertions . There were poor people at least , and it was enough . To build a house for a few orphans , where they might be fed and clothed and taught , was enough . He could preach in every town along our coast , he could return again and again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratefully receive in half-pence the donations of // his Moorfields ' thousands . Here was no boyish passion , that died in the first pulsation . It was a great and darling object of his life . He could count at his death but one hundred and eighty-three children who had been regularly educated and provided for at this school for thirty years ; but the insignificance of the establishment gave him no uneasiness , if good was done to any . If the charity had expired with him , it should still be remembered as an interpreter of his mind and purposes . It survives , we believe , in its primitive humility . How far the numerous societies which Whitefield formed , may be brought forward as his present memorials , we can not say . We are told , that , " in general , they have subsided into other churches , especially in America . " It is certain , that he did not covet the care and superintendence of them . He thought it would make him appear as the head of a party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a ruler over a particular class of Christians . It is no mean monument to have such a fact on record . In what follows , we would direct the reader 's attention to Whitefield 's eloquence ; both because of itself , and because it was the chief instrument of his power , and the main outward sign of his whole character and resources . Though we can but faintly conceive it , yet we may , without much hazard , attempt to distinguish its peculiarities , and name some of its results . If the inquiry effects nothing more , it will at least serve to illustrate Whitefield himself . He set out in life with very humble prospects . He was the son of an innkeeper , and , when the establishment was itself decaying , he served as a common drawer in the tavern , at the age of fifteen , and continued in this employment for nearly a year and a half . According to his own account , he was an idle and wicked boy , passionately fond of reading romances and plays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private theatrical representations , as early as his twelfth year . At times , however , he longed for a liberal education ; and , by the kindness of friends , his wish was gratified . At nineteen he was admitted a servitor in Pembroke College , Oxford ; and here began that remarkable change in his character and life , which distinguished his whole subsequent course . He fell into the society of the Wesleys and others , who were // known at Oxford , as they now are through the world , as Methodists . His religious experiences and conversion , his severe self-denial , and mental agonies and aberrations ( they are all upon record ) , will of course be regarded differently by different minds ; but , in his own never-changed conviction , he was made a subject of spiritual regeneration ; he had passed through an entire renewal of his nature into the image of God . His whole soul was now given to the salvation of others . At the age of twenty-one , and before taking his bachelor 's degree , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the poor youth , so exalted were his views of the sacred office , and so humble his estimate of himself . He says , " When I went up to the altar to receive ordination , I could think of nothing but Samuel 's standing , a little child , before the Lord , with a linen ephod . When the bishop laid his hands upon my head , my heart was melted down , and I offered up my whole spirit , soul and body , to the service of God 's sanctuary . " - " I gave myself up to be a martyr for him who hung upon the cross for me . Known unto him are all future events and contingencies . I have thrown myself blindfold , and , I trust , without reserve , into his Almighty hands . Only I would have you observe , that , till you hear of my dying for or in my work , you will not be apprized of all the preferment I expect . " - pp. 42 , 43 . This is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted upon it to his death 's day . We come now to his first sermon . He had not one to begin with , except a discourse which , he says , I made for a small Christian society , and sent to a neighbouring clergyman , to convince him how unfit I was to take upon me the important work of preaching . He kept it for a fortnight , and then sent it back with a guinea for the loan of it , telling me he had divided it into two , and had preached it , morning a ad evening , to his congregation . With this sermon I mean to begin , God willing , next Sunday . " * p. 43 . He accordingly preached it at his native town , in the church where he had been baptized , and had first received the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper . Though so young , and in a crowd of those who knew him in his infant and childish days , he spoke with authority and effect , and says , he soon found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public speaking when a boy at school . He adds , " I have heard that a complaint had been made to the bishop , that I drove fifteen mad by the first sermon . The worthy prelate , as I am informed , wished that the madness might not be forgotten before next Sunday . " - p. 44 . His preparation for his profession will appear very moderate to those who know that learning and reflection were as much needed by a preacher of those days , as now ; and especially , if he set up for a reformer both in doctrine and manners . But we are speaking of one who is not to be estimated in any respect by ordinary rules , and who always trusted chiefly to his power over men 's hearts and wills . If Oxford did little for him as a scholar , yet while there he had sought out the poor and the prisoner as objects of spiritual influence and , at the very commencement of his preaching , his thoughts were fixed upon his American voyage , with a like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that , in a spiritual sense , the poor and the prisoner make up the great mass of mankind in all places and conditions . So that the rudest part of his early training was no small part of his preparation for the great work of his after life . We have full statements , from his own pen , of the firstfruits of his preaching in Bristol and London . He says , " Last week , save one , I preached ten times in the different churches , and the last week , seven , and yesterday , four times , and read prayers twice , though I slept not an hour the night before , which was spent in religious conversation . " ( p. 51 . ) And it is important to remember , that the preacher is a clergyman of the established church , and not an erratic , highflying Dissenter in conventicle , chapel , or tabernacle . He proceeds thus ; " Last Sunday , in St. Dunstan 's , at six in the morning , when I gave my farewell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no end of persons corning and weeping , telling me what God has done for their souls . Others , again , beg little books , and desire me to write their names in them . " - ( p. 51 . ) At Bristol , such was the pressure in every church , that he could hardly make his way to the reading-desk . He says , " Some hung upon the rails of the organ loft , others climbed // upon the leads of the church , and altogether made the church so hot with their breath , that the steam would fall from the pillars like drops of rain . " - p. 50 . Such was the commencement of his memorable thirty years ' preaching . A new power was in action ; a new voice among lethargic hearers and prenchers ; a spiritual energy , that seemed ready to sweep away forms and rituals , and even to bring the decencies of worship into disrepute . He held nothing in respect , which , as he thought , lulled men 's consciences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart and life to God . And , though he comes forth under the wing of the ancient hierarchy , his whole bearing is that of a fearless reformer , fixed upon acting out an idea of his own . No one ever thinks of asking , whether this young man was not seeking preferment , and making trouble to be bribed to peace . If he were a machine , he could scarcely be less conscious of self , either as to his power or his objects . He is , on the contrary , too much absorbed in the concerns of others . He has not studied himself enough . He meets the world with affections , strong desires , ardent sympathy . His heart is poured out like water . Calculation , discrimination , safe judgm*nt , are not in him . He estimates men , and the power of improving them , by his wishes , and not by a wisely-applied experience . He brings the homeliness and ardor of the Reformers into a very different age . And , whatever his error , he owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's hearts . We should try to conceive how Whitefield 's new method of pulpit eloquence struck the London population . His doctrine was in no respect new ; but we know , that to insist strongly upon a single old topic is almost making it new . He insisted upon change of heart , wrought by the Holy Spirit , as essential life . There was none other . He cared not for rites , as having any virtue in themselves . Every man must be converted or perish ; and he was set to urge this fact upon high and low , till they should feel what perishing and what conversion meant . To this work he went with the fire of heroism , but with none of its selfishness and ambition . lie went with the avowed consciousness of power swelling almost to inspiration , but all the time heightening his sense of responsibleness , and calling forth more intense effort . There is no room or motive for extiggeration in describing this // higher than romantic enterprise . It may cost us some pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we can conceive of consummate oratory , a burning spirit of devotion and benevolence , and horror at the degradation and ruin in which sin plunges the soul , all acting together to kindle religious feeling , or produce some undefined spiritual movement , in the masses of a thronged town , till scoffers were silenced , the indifferent aroused , and the most abandoned moved to call for mercy , we shall understand the language in which he sounded his London triumphs , and feel little surprise that the effect , for the time at least , was overwhelming . No doubt , the traits of character we discern and admire in Whitefield , may be found in others . Ardor , enthusiasm , devotion to a single point or cause , terrifying or melting appeals , addressed with effect to the obdurate , the stupid , the grossly wicked , - these , certainly , are not strange facts or qualities in the history of orators . He was by no means the only one , among churchmen or Dissenters , who set himself zealously against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first , and eminently the great fieldpreacher , since the apostolic time , this is but an accident in the case , and scarcely an explanation of the interest and celebrity that are still attached to his name . The singularity of his adventure could do little more than distinguish him as one of the most remarkable of eccentric men . We may better account for his influence then , and his present importance , by his fearless example of devoting the whole of his life and strength to the support of a vast spiritual interest , in any way that gave promise of success . It was not a popular cause , nor a worldly good , that he was engaged in . The same power and devotedness , turned in another direction , might have brought him present profit . He certainly might have avoided contempt and personal outrage . But we see every moment , that what he sacrificed or endured is always a second thought with him , if considered at all . His eye is ever upon his object . The turns of popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those with whom he first took counsel in Christian fellowship , in the days of bitter trial , the dull hardships of his frequent voyages , his many painful journeys to collect money for his Orphan-House ( and which he was charged by his foes with not accounting for ) , and all this expenditure of labor for an obscure charity , which could // give him no name in the world , and offer no worldly excitement ; - these , certainly , were things to exhaust the spirits . But with him they were as nothing to break or weaken his purpose , though he weeps for a sundered friendship , and repels an assault upon his reputation , with as warm a human feeling as if he had lived upon the breath of opinion , and the sweet solaces of home . This , then , is the explanation of his power , - the subduing and forgetfulness of self , that he might give all to the spiritual advancement of others . He seems to have no home , no possessions , and no prospect or desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Edinburgh , he said , " I will not admit of any such thing . I make no purse . What I have , I give away . Poor , yet making many rich , ' shall be my motto still . " ( p. 236 . ) He must be for ever at work ; and Foster names him , " as a noble instance of that attribute of the decisive character , - the intense necessity of action . " And action with him requires change of place , succession of objects , public scenes . His consuming zeal admits of no repose , and is fed by agitation . He says , " Every thing I meet with seems to carry this voice with it , - Go thou , and preach the gospel ; be a pilgrim on earth ; have no party , or certain dwelling-place . ' My heart echoes back , Lord Jesus , help me to do or suffer thy will . When thou seest me in danger of nestling , - in pity , in tender pity , put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " ( p. 348 . ) His itinerancy , or ranging , as he called it , was his delight . Others might adopt it , after deliberating upon the general utility of the practice , and its efficacy as part of a scheme of ecclesiastical tactics . But he followed it from some uncontrollable impulse . Is the occasion for such devotedness wholly gone ? Does the case alter with the creed a man subscribes , or the character of the church he addresses ? We do not ask , whether a preacher is to show his zeal in the same way with Whitefield ; but is equal zeal less wanted now , or will it be ever less wanted , till sin has passed off from the earth ? If not , then Whitefield , the Calvinist , the Methodist , the itinerant , the field-preacher , " the hunter of souls , " as he styles himself , is , in one point at least , an example for all who preach what they believe to be the word of God . We are prepared now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and , as many think , most questionable , exhibition of himself ; that is , as a field-preacher . This practice he began soon after his first return from Georgia in 1739 , when he was twenty-five years of age . The history of this adventure may be given in few words . He had already discovered his power over others , and over himself , in extemporaneous preaching and prayer . He saw , that " myriads of people , who never troubled any church , nor were likely to do so , " were glad of an opportunity to attend the private , devotional meetings of the Methodists . So long as he was permitted to preach in the churches , multitudes pressed to hear him , for whom there was no room ; and even this privilege was soon withdrawn , as his course was considered altogether against the canons of the church . He was not allowed to collect money for his Orphan-House in those very churches where he had often preached with success for the London charities . These things , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open air . But there is good reason to think , that he rejoiced in the temptation to go out to the multitude . He loved large audiences , for they excited him . He loved a mode of preaching which dispensed with form , and suffered the orator to come to his thousands at any hour of the day or night . He was animated by the sense of freedom which this bold , unlicensed preaching inspired . With a religion , designed to be popular , for his message , he was attached to the most popular form of communicating it . He had a voice of such power and flexibility , that he found it not only easy , but , it should seem , most natural and agreeable to him , to address multitudes in the open air . He finds more than an apology for field-preaching in the example of the Saviour , who , in Whitefield 's words , " had a mountain for his pulpit , and the heavens for his sounding-board ; and who , when his gospel was refused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He would , most probably , have made his way to the fields , if every church in the three kingdoms had been open to him day and night . He was nothing daunted by the strangeness of the measure ; but the more excited by what would have dismayed a man of fastidiousness and calculation . When the wealthy stopped in their coaches to hear what the madman had to say , or the mischievous assembled to annoy him by the grossest devices , or if he saw in his hearers nothing but vacant wonder , yet he // was well aware , that there was no indifference in this . Vhatever the motive , he was the object of attention , and all that remained for him to do was to turn the interest , of whatever kind , to his purpose . And here his skill was matchless . He always retained his self-possession perfectly , and apparently without making those efforts to preserve it , which must in some degree lessen one 's natural ardor . So that all his resources were at hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , and excelled in the art of drawing arguments and motives from present incidents and objects ; and , then , his voice and action of themselves arrested the mind , and soon set it at work in the speaker 's service . A look or a motion was a picture . Call him mountebank , or fanatic , or what we will ( he often deserves a hard name ) , it is no less the fact , that he could keep his immense and various audience together , by night or day , in rain or sunshine , and spread an awful silence far and wide , till he could address every one in a tone as if he were speaking earnestly to a neighbour . Is it strange , that such a man loved his " field-pulpit " far better than to preach to an accustomed and select audience , in lazy seats , and hemmed in by narrow walls ? Is it even strange , that he should have been so carried out of himself , and beyond all the monitions of prudence , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of their revels , and get upon the very stage erected for the wrestlers , to preach against the profane sport ; or set up his pulpit in Moorfields on Whit-Monday , " the great gala-day of vanity and vice , " in the neighbourhood of " drummers , trumpeters , merry-andrews , masters of puppet-shows , exhibiters of wild beasts , players , &amp;c. , " who , he might be sure , would make their game of the preacher , as the best part of the day 's entertainment ? If it had been always so with Whitefield , he would have had reason to say , " We shall never know what good field-preaching has done , till we come to judgment . " But it was not always nor often so , even when he met the mob of cities . And the fabled power of art is scarcely to be compared with his sway over the rude colliers at Kingswood . However we may explain the origin of his field-preaching , it soon became an essential exercise to him . When the severity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks with regret of retiring into winter-quarters . He pines for the return of good preaching weather . " Field-sickness was his home-sickness . " During an illness , occasioned by his many labors and exposures , his physicians prescribed several remedies , - silence , warmth , and , one of them , a perpetual blister . But he preferred his own remedy , " perpetual preaching . When this grand catholicon fails , " said he , " it is all over with me . " Sometimes his impatience was such , that he would go forth in spite of bail and rain ; and his spirits returned , objects resumed their old look , and he was again at home and himself . He thus speaks of his preaching in the cold season . " At seven in the evening , I preached in the open air , to a great multitude . All was hushed , and exceedingly solemn . The stars shone exceedingly bright . Then , if ever , I saw by the eye of faith , Him who calleth them all by their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I longed to he one of those who shall shine as the stars for ever and ever . My hands and my body were cold ; but what are outward things , when the soul within is warmed by the love of God . Oh , that I may die in the field . " - p. 392 . In a mild climate , beneath a soft moonlight , or the shadow of mountains or trees , with a population accustomed to be in the open air for amusement , society , or business , and affected from early years by the soothing or romantic influences of natural scenes , we should see nothing extraordinary in out-ofdoor preaching , any more than in music upon the lake or river side . There would be no profanation , and no violation of taste in either ; but rather a gracious harmony , between the purest of sentiments and the religious beauty of nature . Even the vision of Jacob seems to gain something from the place and hour , - " Dreaming by night under the open sky , And waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rite of baptism , by immersion , no doubt has a more imposing ( why not a more spiritual ? ) influence , upon spectators , if it be performed on the margin of pure running water , or by the ocean side , and under a soft sky , than in foul docks on a raw day , or in a stagnant reservoir under cover . Whitefield was often favored by the scene and hour of his ministrations . He says , " The open firmament above me , the prospect of the adja // cent fields , with the sight of thousands and thousands , some in coaches , some on horseback , and some in the trees , and , at times , all affected and drenched in tears together , - to which was sometimes added , the solemnity of the approaching evening , - was almost too much for me , and quite overcame me. " - pp. 105 , 106 . With a little exercise of the imagination , those who are most scrupulous with regard to the proprieties of worship may find their objections subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , in a romantic spot , intent upon holy thoughts . Those who were present at the consecration of Mount Auburn will understand this . Suppose the assembly swelled to fifty thousand , seated on rural benches , round the wooded hill , on a day like that , when shadow and light , and the air itself , harmonize with a sober , yet elevated sentiment , in all ; and then suppose every eye and heart turned to one eloquent man , whose voice penetrates every nook , as easily as the tide seeks every inlet of the coast , - and we may have some idea of Whitefleld and his audience . We may say , that this is mere exhibition , a gratification of the senses , or at best a source of poetical meditation and rapture ; and that the religious part of the occasion is but one of the circumstances . This is possible . But the important consideration is , and the only one we have in view , - how easily the devout sentiment may be made predominant and overwhelming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly religious direction , and when in after life the clear image of such scenes as we now speak of , is readily associated with devout feelings . We are far from recommending fleld .. preaching , as a general practice . We do not recommend it at all ; but would speak fairly of its advantages , and remove fallacious objections against it . No one can say , that we have discovered the only true or the best method of communicating religious instruction . And few will doubt , that Whitefleld accomplished more good in this way , than he would have done in churches alone . It brought him into connexion with more hearers ; and , which is more important , with the ignorant , poor , and vicious , whom he would have sought in vain within the walls of a church . If it he objected , that a riotous mob , swarming from the foul dens of a large town , is not a fit audience for a preacher of divine truth , and that he is to be // blamed for exposing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of the power of oratory , but of the power of the religious principle in all men , and of that spiritual striving in the dark , which needs only a ray from heaven , however imperfectly and accidentally it may come , to be changed in to rapture , and at last into pcaceful assurance . Whitefield ran very little risk of bringing religion into dishonor by offering it to his wild audience , except when he grossly violated prudence and decorum , and became as much a rioter himself , as those whom he denominates the instruments of Satan . But , though field-preaching has its advantages in certain hands , and in peculiar circumstances , we can not overlook the obvious inconveniences and dangers , that would follow from its coming into general use . it would introduce a violent and rudely passionate style of oratory , partly from the necessity of the case , where so many are addressed in the open air , and partly from the reaction of listening and agitated throngs upon the speaker himself . From the promiscuous assembling of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , and of course unrestrained by daily intimacies and familiar objects , and by common habits of thought and feeling , we may expect excessive and false agitation ; and vast immediate results will be looked for , and unduly estimated . We lose what many deem the incalculable good of the orderly meeting of households in one church . We must , in a great measure , lose the undoubted assistance which worshipping in the same place affords , by recalling the religious feelings that we have associated with familiar objects . And , finally , we put in jeopardy the support of stated worship , to which much importance is reasonably attached , as upholding good habits and cherishing calm sentiments . Whitefield 's triumphs were not limited to the poorer classes and to field-preaching . In Scotland , least liable of all to give way to impulse , he was sought after by all conditions , and by divided Christians . In America , toward which his heart yearned to the end , he was received with delight by ministers , rulcrs , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through it again and again , as a religious agitator and an asker of alms for his school , and apparently without the charm of his appeals being broken or weakened . He preached before the colleges , and at the // tables of magistrates ; in the churches , and sometimes in the fields ; and , in his own view , with such success , that his hope for Scotland is , that she may be like New England . The business of common life seems to have been suspended , that the whole population might go forth to hear the young stranger . That he was opposed by many , and deserved rebuke , is not disputed . Our object is to show , that he had power in different spheres . If we turn now to high life in England , we shall find him no less successful there in drawing attention . As chaplain of the Countess Dowager of Huntingdon , who was one of his most determined proselytes , he was brought into the society of people of fashion . Wits , accomplished infidels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless as they would seek out any odd thing to relieve their dull , jaded lives , - these are among his hearers , and some are his disciples . They attend upon him once , and desire to hear him again . Chesterfield thanks him , and Whitefield preaches at his chapel , or rather in Bretby park , for the chapel was soon found to be too small . Bolingbroke comes and tells him , if the Bible is true , Whitefield 's views of Christian doctrine are incontrovertible , and his Lordship is ready to vindicate the Methodist against all his revilers . Even the king is apprized of the new power , that is at work among the nobles and wits , and has his jest at Lady Chesterfield , one of the converts , for the simplicity of her dress . It is needless to say more of his successes among the highborn and learned , whether in London or in the rural chapels . We do not refer to them as being much in his favor . The dignity of a convert is of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise from those who in any way excel us ? It is social as well as selfish in us to be pleased with it . Whitefield was safer in the wilderness and among the weeping colliers . He feels his danger . When the nobility graciously accepted copies of his sermons , he said , " Thus the world turns round . In all time of wealth , good Lord deliver me . " He says , it took him twice seven years of pretty close intimacy with contempt , to make contempt an agreeable companion ; and he discovers , that a love of power and distinction sometimes intoxicates even God 's dear children . We have no reason to think , that Whitefield preached very // differently before his fashionable , and his less educated audiences . He would have risked much , if he had been careful to adapt his discourse and manner to particular tastes ; and he knew the secret of his subject and of his power too well , to stand in awe of his hearers , or even distrust his own poorest matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rambling and empty rhapsody , was sustained and borne to the heart by a voice that prepared a way . The hearer was soon transported far above the sphere of criticism . Whether he listened to denunciation , appeals , or invitation , or to question crowding on question , and whether clothed in language of Scripture , or of the market , or of polite life , a power he could not resist kept him always in advance of the speaker , with a conscience ready to tremble and a heart to break , while the word yet hung upon the lips of the prophet . What mere lover of art would not rejoice to have been present , when Whitefleld , after he had ruled his vast audience in the fields , paused , and , as in a whisper , conimuned with the multitude upon the awful silence and the falling tears ? We have room but for one or two of the reports which have been transmitted of his manner . The first is from Hurne . He says , " Once , after a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel is just about to leave the threshold of this sanctuary , and ascend to heaven . And shall he ascend , and not bear with him the news of one sinner , among all this multitude , reclaimed from the error of his ways ? To give the greater effect to this exclamation , Whitefield stamped with his foot , lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven , and cried aloud , Stop , Gabriel , stop , ere you enter the sacred portals , and ) ret barry with you the news of one sinner converted to God . ' This address was accompanied with such animated , yet natural action , that it surpassed any thing I ever heard or saw in any other preacher . " * To what a height must he have carried his art , how perfect a master must he have been of natural expression , if his ut * A less showy but more striking testimony to his eloquence may be found in the following anecdote , which we take from Southey 's " Life of Wesley . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think ! he replied , I tell you , Sir , every Sunday that I go to my parish church , I can build a ship from stem to stern under the sermon ; but , were it to save my soul , under Mr. Whitefield , I could not lay a single plank . ' " // most extravagances , so far from offending , could bear away a cold , fastidious , and irreligious hearer . Mr. Philip says , " He left nothing to accident which he could regulate by care in his delivery . Foote and Garrick maintained , that his oratory was not at its full height , until he had repeated a discourse forty times . " Franklin 's testimony is as follows " By hearing him often , I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly composed , and those he had preached often in the course of his travels . His delivery of the latter was so improved by frequent repetition , that every accent , every emphasis , every modulation of voice , was so perfectly well turned and well placed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not help being pleased with the discourse ; a pleasure of much the same kind with that received from an excellent piece of music . " - p. 527 . According to Southey , in his " Life of Wesley , " these repetitions were far from being in precisely the same words . He recited instead of reading his sermons . " Had they been delivered , " continues Southey , " from a written copy , one delivery would have been like the last the paper would have operated as a spell , from which he could not depart ; invention sleeping , while the utterance followed the eye . But when he had nothing before him except the audience whom he was addressing , the judgment and the imagination , as well as the memory , were called forth . Those parts were omitted , which had been felt to come feebly from the tongue , and fall heavily on the ear ; and their place was supplied by matter newly laid in , in the course of his studies , or fresh from the feeling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fanaticism , remember and ponder this well . Let those who think it enough to be sincere , and well provided with pertinent matter , remember , that Whitefield was as sincere as they can be , and felt the authority of his high credentials , and the dignity of his message , and that it was his duty to preach , and that words and matter and an ardent nature would never fail him ; and yet that , to the end , he studied oratory with the diligence of a novice , and brought the vast power within him to a perfection , and a prompt use , which probably have never been surpassed . Hence , his equal sway over the ignorant and the cultivated . It was not the strangeness of the thing , that // amazed people ; nor yet his stamping , and sobbing , and tears , and shrieks , and thunders ; but the perfect skill with which he could bring these , and every other sign of emotion , to hear upon the heart and conscience of another man , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unnecessary to name the many topics connected with the life of Whitefleld , which , as not entering into the limited notice we proposed to take of him , have been entirely passed over . As the view we have given of him may not have placed his defects and errors in a sufficiently clear light for a full understanding of his character , we will dwell upon them for a moment in closing . Near the beginning of this article we observed , that his errors were useful . But , upon considering them in connexion with the peculiar temper of his mind , we are inclined to doubt the justness of the remark , except , possibly , in relation to the few cases , where we may be called upon to check the irregular sallies of young minds , similarly constituted to his , and in which extravagance in opinions , desires , and enterprises , has not yet become a habit and fixed disease . Without adopting the perilous notion , that the tendencies of genius , or of strong original temperament , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to save one from painful deviations , and a mad expenditure of strength , we yet think , that men generally are not willing enough to let remarkable persons be useful instruments , without insisting that they should also be useful examples . We demand a perfection of character , because we behold a miracle of important action . A well-balanced mind , where there is a great deal to be balanced , is expected , instead of being wondered at . If we judge Whitefleld in this way , we apply an unreasonable test . He was in a fever from the time of his conversion . To restore him to health , as it is called , would have been next to making another man of him , and most probably at the sacrifice of his energy and ardor ; for these evidently belonged to a confirmed proneness to run into excesses in every thing , and to make experiments in the dark , and at great hazard , from which a prudent and vigilant mind would have shrunk . Even his most deliberate actions , his care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oratory , are means or signs of a spirit strongly tinged with extravagance . To propose such a man , then , as an example or warning , // generally , or to treat seriously the questions , whether he should have been suffered to go at large , and whether he would not have been happier if reduced by a physician to sound reason and lethargy , would show , that we did not enter fully and heartily into the case . Here is a man , exercising an extraordinary influence over numberless minds in all classes , for more than thirty years , and ceasing only with his life ; and the fact , when we take all the circumstances into the account , is an exceedingly curious one . Let it then be considered by itself ; and let his deficiences be examined , chiefly that we may the better understand his whole character and course . He was in many respects a weak man . He wanted soundness of mind , and the disposition to think and compare before determining . He wanted that self-mastery , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outset , what faculties and what processes are needed and will profit him in a new enterprise , and which enables him to apply correctives in the midst of the severest and most ardent exercises of his mind , and to do this with instinctive readiness and fitness . With Whitefield , a sudden movement of his heart stood in the place of all reasonings or prudence , and was of higher authority . He took it for a sign from heaven ; and a man who , in his sense of the words , " throws himself blindfold into the hands of God , " is very little disposed to distrust the grounds of any determination , or the sources of any impression . Hence , perfect confidence in himself , and the power to gain the perfect confidence of all whose hearts he could reach ; while the sober-minded would incline to look on him with pity or contempt , or , at best , with admiration of his eloquence as a remarkable specimen of art . He had abundant talent and resource for every contingency which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of feeling . And , strange as it may seem , the very eloquence which he so deliberately and diligently studied , and with so clear a sense of its importance as a means , was as heartfelt as his spontaneous raptures and agonies in his private hours . Everybody felt that it was so . The oratorical devices practised by him , time after time , before multitudes , were , at the moment of repetition , as sincere as a child 's tears , and had the effect of sincerity . His power was always from passion . He had little or nothing of that dry sagacity and shrewd notice of others and of* himself , which are not p // unfrequently associated with the grossest fanaticism and selfdelusion . He was under the control of impulse in all things ; and , though we call him madman , or child , or seraph , we all have equally in view this single characteristic of the man . We have instances of his weakness in his uniting spiritual pride with professions of humility , and in his violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see his weakness , in the importance he attached to impressions , impulses , dreams , coincidences , and the drawing of lots . One would think , that he was always on the look-out for something preternatural ; or that his experience was so far above that of common mortals , that he lived in the midst of miracles , as his ordinary state . A wrong estimate of self leads naturally to a wrong judgment and treatment of others . He was sure , that he had the living witness of the Spirit to the truth of his favorite doctrines , and , as might be expected , he held the convictions of another who differed from him , as nought . He begs his old master , Wesley , not to be strenuous in opposing the doctrines of election and final perseverance , and adds , as an argument for the other 's silence , " My doctrines I had from Christ and his apostles ; I was taught them of God ; and , as God was pleased to send me out first , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " We may imagine how the founder of Methodism would regard such language from his eager and confident disciple . And yet the Wesleys themselves are chargeable with the weakness of holding those to be unconverted who do not think as they do . They wrote upon the tomb of their excellent mother , that she had " mourned a legal night of seventy years " ; that is , she was not brought to a true sense of Christianity till that late period of a most exemplary religious life . Whitefield records his meeting with a clergyman nearly eighty years of age , who had lately preached three times in one day , and ridden forty miles ; but , he adds , " He is not above one year old in the school of Christ . Dear Hervey laid the blessed foundation , whilst a curate here . " A gain , he comes to New England to convert the ministers , and to tell the students of our college , with no small grief , that their light was darkness , and this too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pilgrims , a little more than a century from the landing of the Fathers . But he had re // proved even Wesley , and separated from him , for what he deemed his errors in doctrine . He had said , that Archbishop Tillotson knew no more about religion than Mahomet . And could less exclusiveness have been expected from him towards the dignitaries of Yale and Harvard ? His presumptuous appropriation of truth is seen in the declaration , that " if Jesus Christ he not very God of very God , I would never preach the Gospel of Christ again ; for it would not he gospel . It would only be a system of ethics . Seneca , Cicero , or any of the Gentile philosophers , would he as good a Saviour as Jesus of Nazareth . " " If Jesus Christ he no more than a mere man , if he he not truly God , he was the vilest sinner that ever appeared in the world ; for he accepted of divine adoration from the man who had been horn hlind. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesley for " pawning his salvation , in a late hymn-hook , if the doctrine of universal redemption he not true . " Thus it is with men of hot and inflated minds , who are possessed with an idea of their own light , which makes all dark beyond their limited vision . We might in this way take separate instances of weakness and self-ignorance , till Whitefield should appear to many as little better than a hypocrite , or a driveller , or one drunk with self-conceit . And yet the chief impression received from his whole history is that of a warm-hearted , benevolent , devoted preacher and sufferer in behalf of what he believed essential to human salvation . His errors are from the same source with his virtues and his usefulness ; and they furnish another proof , that a sound intellectual education from early years is needed by those whose religious tendencies are the strongest . * We borrow these passages from what Hervey describes as " that sweet sermon which was a special means of bringing me to the knowledge of the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 1772.
