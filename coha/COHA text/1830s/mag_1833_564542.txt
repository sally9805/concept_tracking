txt THE most recent works on America have been written by a couple of Scotchmen , Mr. Stuart and Colonel Hamilton . Nativity , however , is the only point of resemblance between them . In every thing else they are antipodes . As these gentlemen were in the United States at about the same time , and have published their speculations at a short interval , it is a matter of curiosity to compare the two , and their books , together ; for , if unconnected by the association of similarity , they most surely are intimately linked by the association of contrast . Mr. STUART left his native laud , on account of his implication in an affair of honor , which terminated disagreeably , and induced him to seek retirement in the United States . His visit resulted in a three years ' residence , passed in industrious observations , which , on his return to Europe , he thought fit to communicate to the world . From the volumes , in which this communication was made , we gather all that we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrored as faithfully , as was that of Li amlet 's mother in the glass , which the crazy prince held up to her . We know him from crown to shoe-tie , and can imagine , with a fancy too vivid to be inaccurate , the cut of his coat and the color of his hair . Unquestionably , his quantum of the latter article was decently trimmed and smoothly adjusted , for he could get it cut for nine pence , and have it combed without what appears to have been his greatest aversion-an extra charge . His hat was well brushed , and his whole exterior was that of a gentleman , fond of decency and yet partial to economy , lie wore his clothes well , we have no doubt , and they were well made , considering that he employed an inferior artist . But of all this , though as fully convinced as of our own existence and identity , we are not quite prepared to make oath ; and we will commence another paragraph with what our traveler admires beyond all things  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Stuart , the meaning of the term a matter-of-fact man . lie lives in an element of fact . It is his meat and drink , and apparently board and lodging into the bargain . Sir Richard Phillips published a book , which he some // what ostentatiously called " A Million of Facts ; " without bragging of it , Mr. Stuart has given us double the number . No matter what it is , provided it be a fact ; however trifling , vain , or useless , as long as it is entitled to that saving epithet , it is the article for the Scotchmnan 's money . " The fact is , " he observes , " that in this country people are generally in bed before ten . " this is very like what , in courts of justice , we have sometimes heard very innocently called a " false fact . " The extensive induction , by which he arrived at this conclusion , is found in the circumstance , that his landlord , in a country village , apologized for previous non-appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been kept up till twelve o'clock by company . Still that was sufficient basis for a fact ; and we have it advanced with all the solemnity it deserves . Another fact , which troubles Mr. Stuart , is the want of an unmentionable accommodation , which he alleges is no where to be found in the states . To tell the truth , for our traveler seems to be a very amiable man , this is the most serious ground for complaint that he finds through the whole country . Our institutions of government , in his eyes , are good ; our inns are good ; our prisons are good ; but our Cloacinian conveniences are very detestable . The circumstance seems to have made a deep impression on our traveler ; and we sincerely hope , that , if he ever visits this country again , he may find the cause of his disquiet and displeasure entirely removed . His theory on the subject , we had almost forgotten to mention , is the Neptunian , and he attributes our deficiencies in this respect to the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics , though they do not always come up to the level of facts . He is eminently figurative . Nothing escapes him , that will form an item for calculation , from the value of a farm , to the price of a mutton-chop ; from the contents of the great lakes , to the amount of liquor taken by a couple of his friends in the shape of ante-meridian nippers . When he attends a campmeeting , he not only gives us the number of auditors and the number of clergymen , but the chapter and verse from which they take their text ; which , on one occasion , as if with particular reference to Mr. Stuart 's propensity , was selected from the Book of Numbers . In visiting an orchard , he entertains us with the length of the cider-mill , the cubic contents of a barrel , the price of each barrel according to the quality , with the additional and somewhat irrelevant fact of the rent of an acre of pasture-grass . Here his astonishment is excited , and he ventures a remark on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars an acre , when a horse is grazed at a dollar and a half . On his return from the orchard excursion , Mr. Stuart so far relaxed from his accustomed temperance , as to treat himself to a glass of Malaga and water .. This fact is certainly worthy of record ; but with the Scotchman it is something more  --  a nest-egg for statistics . His landlord told him that the Malaga cost him eight shillings a gallon . One item leads quite naturally to another ; and , in the next breath , we are informed that the whole charge , on the ensuing morning , " for lodging , supper , and breakfast , for my wife and myself , " was five shillings and nine pence , sterling . The dishes of the breakfast table are so many peculiar facts , worthy of individual notice : they consisted of the very unusual articles of coffee , eggs , beef-steak , toast , and butter . // There was a wonder worth crossing the Atlantic to learn , and recrossing it to promulgate ! On another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , on the rare and recondite preparations of fish , roast lamb , broiled ham and chicken , peas , sweet Indian corn boiled , ( not raw , ) potatoes , and apple-pie , with a bottle of very tolerable claret and , strange to relate , all this without any previous warning , and all for a dollar and a half for two persons ! The days of Aladdin 's lamp we verily believe to have been restored ; and Sinbad the Sailor , in the marvel of his adventures , must yield the palm to Stuart the Traveler . But , notwithstanding all Mr. Stuart 's fondness for fact , and reverence for statistics , we are constrained to admit that he is sometimes hasty in forming conclusions from very uncertain premises . One striking instance of this is to be found when he tells us that the female servants of an inn , which he visited , were uniformly obliging , " although they would not have accepted a shilling had it been offered . " We think Mr. Stuart has made this assertion rashly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the rules of experimental philosophy . A matter so important , and so easily to be tested , should never have been left to mere vague speculation . Bacon would have recommended differently ; but , on points of this kind , Mr. Stuart is a follower of Aristotle . Why did not our traveler " tip em the siller ? " He might then have substituted his favorite , palpable fact , for a doubtful , unsubstantial theory . The contest would have been between an affectation of pride , and a reality of prudence ; and ten to one on Mammon we should have considered fair odds . Mr. Stuart was too much of a Lowlander to run the risk . With the propensities thus exhibited by Mr. Stuart , one can hardly be astonished that he thinks it important to tell us , that he once ordered a chop , and was furnished with an extra canvass-back , without extra charge ; or that he attended a course of lectures on astronomy , on account of the smallness of the expense ,  --  only one shilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a planter 's in the Southern States , and had nothing to pay ; but , as an offset , in New-Orleans , he was obliged to give a dollar a dozen for his washing-without distinction of shirt or pocket-handkerchief  --  and he might have added , with his characteristic love of detail , without reference to the length of time that one had been worn , or the other used . Apropos of this love of detail , and tact of minute observation : it is a subject on which we had nearly omitted to do Mr. Stuart justice . How delicately and patiently must he have pursued his investigations , on both sides of the Atlantic , to become convinced that it is much less usual in the United States than in Scotland for the men to wear nightcaps ! From his silence on the subject we are led to the inference , that the women in the one country indulge in this luxury about as much as in the other . In our mind 's eye we can see Mr. Stuart , in slippers and shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NewOrleans , pursuing his nocturnal wanderings , in order to ascertain the truth of this assertion by the inductive process . With candle in hand , and handkerchief on head , he sallies forth at midnight , the very picture of Mr. Finn in Paul Schaick , and prosecutes his demi-phrenological studies through the bed-chambers of his hotel . lie collects statis. * // tics ; so many night-capped heads , so many un-night-capped , and discrowned . Next comes the documentary and remembered evidence of the night-caps he had noticed in Scotland ; then the comparison ; then the conclusion ; which he persuades himself to be a fact  --  the object , sole and singular , of all his wanderings and all his speculations . But Mr. Stuart did not confine his inquiries to the relative wearing of night-caps , or his fondness for st*tistics to the returns of the census , the prices of his meals , the enormity of washing expenses , or the absence of extra charges . He establishes a domestic census of his own , not under the authority of government , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at a plantation , the mistress of which had been twice married , and , what was well worthy of record , had borne twins to both of her husbands . In Rome , she would have received a bounty from the state , as a woman who had deserved well of it . On this visit , our traveler slept in the only spare chamber , which contained three beds , all of which were occupied . A circumstance so singular naturally leads him to reflection , and reflection as surely terminates in philosophical observation ; " I do not know , " he says , " what would have happened if a greater number of strangers had arrived . " Any one , even without a knowledge of the locus in quo , could suggest the only probable alternative . It is as plain as the nose on Mr. Stuart 's face , which , we have no doubt , is prominent if not protuberant , for he always goes ahead as if he were following it . We have not yet observed on Mr. Stuart 's style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross inaccuracies in grammar , harsh collocation of words , and an utter contempt of arrangement in his ideas . Juxta-position is with him no sign of similarity of subject , or even the most distant relationship . His facts are heaped together like the articles in a Yankee baggage-wagon ; nothing for show , but all for stowage . He has no regard for antecedent and consequent , and we have before hinted at his inattention to premiss and conclusion . When he states two facts in a distinct paragraph , he couples them thus " We have not been accosted by a beggar in New-York . The streets seem to be well watered . " How these fellow-passengers happened to be slung in the same hammock is more than we can easily divine . Mr. Stuart is very favorably disposed towards this country , and willing to represent all her institutions in the most favorable point of view . Notwithstanding the great rudeness to which he sometimes confesses , we believe him to have a tolerable share of civilization . But , through the whole of his two volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which warmed us with a generous feeling or an affectionate impulse towards the writer , who was so full of soft words , and found so much among us to admire . On one occasion only did we approximate to any emotion of the kind . He was describing a hospitable and joyous reception of his party , at a Virginian hotel , which was called " The Merry Oaks ; " he appeared to feel kindly and warmly , when he expressed the pleasure they enjoyed , and the regret with which they left their merry and open.hearted host . But mark the conclusion of the paragraph , and the cold-water dash it administered to our easy sensibilities - " The charge against each person was half a dollar-little more than two shillings ! " // We are suspicious of Mr. Stuart 's praise , and can not but think he had his eye on an equivalent while he was in the act of bestowing it . His volumes contain , mong masses of trash , p* tches of valuable information . In England they may b read to advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of their own country , of which they had till then been ignorant . We dislike , however , the spirit of the man , and , following him in his travels without sympathy , part from him without regret . His soul may be immaterial. , but the limit of its range is within the circumference of a six pence . Colonel HAMILTON is a very different man . Already favorably known as the author of one of the best novels of the age , his literary pretensions place him far above any other English tr veler who has made the tour of the United States . A tory by habit and education , a soldier by profession , and a gentleman by nature , his speculations are always tinctured by prejudices , though given with a freedom of expression and elegance of style , that disarm even prejudices of much that is offensive . He is not blessed with that fondness of detail which characterizes Mr. Stuart ; his views are large and comprehensive . XVe are not favored with the mysteries of his memorandum-book ; nor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor with items of the liquor drank by his friends ; nor with the ininutire of mine host 's bill . Colonel Hamilton 's mode of doing things is quite the opposite . His disbursements are made by a servant , who carries his spending money and his lending money . In general terms , we are given to understand that he frequented the best houses , saw the best society , drank the best wine , and ate the best dinners , that were to be had in the United States  --  but his vouchers have been kept for his private perusal , and the en tertainment of particular friends . The absence or presence of extra charges does not appear to trouble him in the least ; and , what is very singular , considering the importance of the subject , he has not once aspired to the circumstance of night-caps . Colonel Hamilton speculates , generalizes , philosophizes . His style is singularly felicitous , combining , in a very rare degree , strength with beauty of expression , and richness of humor with spirited wit and vig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara is a fine composition , and the reflections , with which it is interspersed , spring naturally from the grandeur he is contemplating . The account of the Shaker village , at Niskayuma , is happily drawn ; but the air of lightness about it savors a little too much of the man of the world . We never could smile at the saltatory exhibitions of a Shaker congregation . The meagre frames of the women , with the narrow shoulders and spare chests , the sallow and corpse-like complexions , please us , if possible , still less than the hypocritical visages of the men , overshadowed by the long sleek hair , and wearing an aspect of low cunning and assumed humility . Never have we been able to contemplate their performances with any higher emotions than those of disgust , or to listen to the absurd harangues of their elders without a sigh for the . weakness of humanity , nd pity for the deluded ignorance , which was thus receiving the rant of folly for the inspiration of religion . Still their absurdities are , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the eccentric and unnatural will always find a few crazy proselytes , but never a numerous body of sane disciples . // We are disposed to grant Colonel hamilton much more praise , than that which attaches to merely superior excellence and attractiveness of style . From a very thorough perusal and review of his book , and a degree of reflection upon its most important topics , we are persuaded thathe is an " honest chronicler , " and circulates nothing but the results of his conviction . That he is prejudiced sometimes , we are not disposed to deny ; and that we differ from him in many of his l ) Olitical views , as a follower of Jeffersonian republicanism , untainted by the later heresies with which it has been infused , we are ready to admit . When he admires the principles of primogeniture , and approves the odious system of fagging as current in the English schools , we can not help wishing that these lurking predilections of John Bull were corrected in so clever a fellow . When he refuses , from spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that he is himself the only loser , and we do not believe that this very respectable monument of ingenumtv experienced the least mortification . On this subject , however , he is not the only traveler who has been most unconscionably bored ; the Philadelphians should let the water-works speak for themselves . These are trifling matters , however , in an octavo of four hundred pages . How any one could expect to find fewer bross prejudices , in so large a space , we can not imagine . Colonel Hamilton complains that there is an indecent haste at our hotels in performing the functions of mastication . He is indignant that meals are furnished only at stated hours , and that if a man s not fortunately in the possession of a chronometer , and disposed to conform himself to the despotic regulations of Boniface , he runs great risk of entirely losing his breakfast arid dinner , or of getting them in a condition unmeet for a tolerably well educated palate . Servants , too , he finds generally inattentive ; and , in a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone to explore a passage to an unknown point , with nothing in the shape of a pilot , or even a compass to direct him . In all this , we think the Colonel is perfectly right ; and we have strenuously resisted every proposition to burn him in effigy , that has been based on any one of these several speculations . It is our deliberate opinion , founded not on a very extensive , t bough not a very limited observation , that at most of our public houses , people may be said to bolt , rather than to eat . They swallow their food whole , without going through a process , which foreign physicians assert to he a very useful prelude to digestion . The stomach is not treated fairly , when called upon to discharge the additional duties of the teeth . We do not wonder that it rebels against such impositions on its good nature , and are much obliged to the gallant colonel for breaking a lance in its defence . In respect to pilotage , when ignorant of the localities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often have we suffered from the want of it , and remember an anecdote which fully illustrates its necessity . Some years ago , a gentleman stopped at a hotel in Hartford , on a night when a party of Indians were destined to be his fellow-lodgers . Beds were placed for them in a long hall which extended through the house , on either side of which was a row of chambers . Our friend was disposed to retire early , and was despatched with a candle to find his apartment . Reaching one , which answered the description he had received at the bar , he entered , and , without much examination or de // lay , threw himself into the hed and drew the curtains . About an hour had elapsed , and he had fallen into a comfortably sound slumber , when he was roused by a sudden shriek . Supposing it to be an accidental yell of one of his Indian neighbors , he merely swore at them , fastened his door , and again tried to compose himself to sleep . His repose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , the man of the mansion was thundering at the door , with a whole posse cornitatus .. His guest refused all admittance , but finally consented to a parley . To his great astonishment , he discovered that he was merely a squatter in the premises , without any legal right of occupancy . The apartment belonged to a worthy lady , whose liege was absent . On retiring to her chamber , she had deliberately thrown off the incumbrances of the day , and arrayed herself in the costume which it was her wont to wear by night . After arranging all preliminaries to a quiet rest , she had drawn aside the curtains , and was about to enter her couch . Judge of her terror on finding it already tenanted by a stranger , and , if whiskers are any indication of manhood , that stranger evidently of another sex . Under these circumstances , we can hardly wonder that her cry should have borne some distant resemblance to an Indian yell . Explanations ensued , and , as the character of all the parties was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel nor a divorce . Colonel Hamilton 's speculation on New-England character may seem to be more open to objection , than his complaints of our taverns . Here we are getting upon dangerous ground , and must select our foothold as cautiously as we may . He says we are cold , money-loving , little moved by the kinder impulses of the heart , unamiable , unimaginative , vain , puritanical , and with a reputation for honesty somewhat at a discount . On the other hand , he admits that our lack of heart is compensated by a double supply of brains ; he confesses that we are energetic , independent , sober , attached to good order , well educated , and religious . The charge of dishonesty we leave altogether out of view , as , from the connection in which it appears , we presume he intends to confine it to that class of the community known by the appellation of pedlars ,  --  a body of sharpers , among whom we believe our own laws do not recognize the existence of any superfluity of fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and particularly in the Southern States , that a greater set of rogues than are acting in this capacity , can be found only in the cells of the Penitentiary , and among the graduates of our Houses of Correction . But , on examining the remainder of the charges , with as little prejudice as can be required of a New-Englander , are we prepared to say that they are without foundation in truth ? Are we not money-loving ? Is there any country where riches command greater respect , power , and influence ? Is not a man of wealth synonymous v ith a man of merit , and is not fullness of pocket a measure of capacity and talent ? Look at the grasping , monopolizing , anxious spirit , with which the accumulation of gold is sought , and the tenacity with which it is held . Look at the immense corporations , darkening the land , absorbing the general industry for individual benefit , and fostering all the aristocratic tendencies of society , to heap up a few mammoth fortunes for misers , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear eulogy out-eulo-. // gized over the remains of rich blockheads , whose mother-wit was just sufficient to enable them to steer clear of the jail , and cheat with color of law , and whose memory is a scorn and mockery to the oppressed laborer and unrelieved poor . Open our statute-books , and read the laws on imprisonment for misfortune , which would disgrace the code of Tartary-if Tartary has any code  --  but as to which , all the virtue , intelligence , and talent of old Massachusetts can do nothing in opposition to the efforts of greedy money-lenders and starving pettifoggers . Consider all these things , and then say whether or not the epithet of " money-loving " is too harsh for such a devoted worship of Mammon ? That we are a people of cold temperament , and , in general , unimnaginative , that our manners and feelings are somewhat puritanical , and that we are moderately vain , it is not our present intention to deny . If we are vain , it is not without very good reason ; as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only vain , but proud . Our puritanical notions we come by fairly , and they only prove that we are the sons of our fathers . As to the lack of imaginativeness , we have not quite made up our mind ; and our coldness finds a sufficient apology in our climate . Byron says that the " cold in clime are cold in blood ; " and , in saying it , he certainly gives us a verse of poetry that is also philosophy and truth . The better part of Colonel Hamilton 's picture may be passed over in silence : as it will find none to dispute the likeness , there is no need of adding our assent to its similitude . But it is time that we should cease bestowing our tediousness on the readers , who have kindly yawned through an article of so unreasonable a prolixity . It was not our intention to review Colonel Hamilton 's book , but merely to touch lightly upon some one or two of its most prominent topics . We think it as just a treatise as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing upon this country . There is much truth in it , which we shall do well to ponder , before rejecting . It is judicious to learn wisdom from a plain speaker , rather than folly from a deceitful one ; and if people will insist upon holding up mirrors for Jonathan to see himself in , we kiiow not why he should break that which is the truest , because it is not the most flattering.
