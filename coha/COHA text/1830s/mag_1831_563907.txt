txt A WEEK OF FRAILTY . M* window , like the post of worthy Mr. Sly , the Spectator 's vicegerent , is a very convenient and comprehensive point of observation , looking out upon the great thoroughfare of the metropolis . To be sure , it is in an attic , but it is one of my whims to affect the economical . It may well be supposed , that an inquisitive individual will take some cognizance of the fantastic stream that runs along so near him , or , if you can excuse a professional simile , that he will sometimes feel the pulse which beats so strong and close , that it is always jarring on his ear . I trust I have not been unmindful of my local advantages . I call to witness the inventory of three hundred bonnets and their wear-ers , Black , white , and grey , with all their trumpery , the long catalogue of newly-entered street gentlemen , with their paraphernalia , and the ample appendix of nondescripts , all which repose in my cabinet , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public that there are some thinking minds to keep watch over the extravagance of domestic foolery and the efflorescence of imported dandyism . I do believe , that , but for a few cold gray eyes at their loop-holes , our gentlemen would pad themselves into pin-cushions , and our ladies retrench skirt and corset until they met in the primeval strip of Eden ! I was sitting at my aerial station one morning , watching one of my unknown prot6ges , ( No. 14 , I think he was enrolled in the note book , ) who , as I saw with great sorrow , was encouraging a pair of whiskers , evidently too large for the resources of his puny constitution . I shall lose him , I said , and my fears were too true ; he has since fallen a victim to their vampyre exactions . Miserable defunct ; Sit terra tibi levis ! As I was looking at him , he curved his girded figure to its utmost point of tension , and an elastic girl tripped by him with a careless nod in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up accidentally in my direction ; it looked as if she was saying , " Poor devil . " I am not over fond of description , but the eye was a good one , duly compounded of the four elements ; just mortal earth enough to keep it from being seraphic and saintly , just air enough to make it ethereal , just water enough to make it liquid , and just fire enough to vitalize all the rest . I brushed a coat which had held its unfading green amidst the falling leaves of three autumns , smoothed a hat which had outlived the progeny of its paternal beaver , and hurried down stairs , something as a cataract might have taken its first leap from its ledge to its basin . It is but just to add , that my boisterous precipitancy occasioned me a gentle rebuke from a deaf gentleman , who lived two stories nearer Pluto than myself ; as I have reason to think , at the instigation of my landlady . This was not until evening , however ; there is no time like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into the street I found the lady had been joined by another . I walked as close behind as I dared . " You do n't like him , " said the second lady , in the subdued tone of a conversational second fiddle . " I have no objection to the imbecile , " she answered . " Do you not think him very handsome ? " " I have seen more repulsive creatures . " " What can make all the girls like his whiskered face so " It is nothing but capillary attraction , my dear . " What a pretty little soul , thought I to myself , and I do fear I said so out loud , for she turned round with a sudden start that made me feel like Lot 's wife . She was just about turning a corner , when down fell a steel-bound reticule . It clattered on the sidewalk just before me . Could she have done it on purpose ? I thought of the evergreen coat ,  --  the inveterate beaver . But after all , I reflected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I handed it to her with my best bow , she smiled so very graciously , that I could not help thinking she really did drop* it on purpose . Three days after this , a cobweb was waving over Mr. John Hunter 's treatise on the blood , and one of my pauper patients , or rather patient paupers , had gone to his long home ,  --  a barrel of proof spirits ,  --  in the // corner of a dissecting room . At noon , on each of those days , did I emerge from my receptacle ; and every day as I met her ,  --  O no , it could not be accident ,  --  the glance of recognition grew deeper and warmer . I must play the troubadour , said I to myself ; and on the fourth day , an unsealed note , couleur de rose , fell at the feet of the lady as I was walking before her . If I had turned round like a simpleton , she would have let it lie untouched . I walked on , unmoved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The verses-nobody but a New-Hollander would attack women with prose-were the following . Is thy name Mary , maiden fair ? Such should , methinks , its music be ; The sweetest name that mortals bear Were best befitting thee , And she , to whom it once was given Was half of earth and half of heaven . I hear thy voice , I see thy smile , I look upon thy folded hair ; Ah ! while we dream not they beguile , Our hearts are in the snare ; And she , who chains a wild bird 's wing , Must start not if her captive sing . So , lady , take the leaf that falls , To all but thee , unseen , unknown ; When evening shades thy silent walls , Then read it all alone ; In stillness read , in darkness seal , Forget , despise , but not reveal ! I find by turning to my books that it was two days after this when a rose-bud slipped from the lady 's boquet-it may be seen by calling at my lodgings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer sunlight of love ? Science menaced me from her crowded pages , Ambition fixed her eagle eye on me as she sat on the distant summit , and I forgot both for a passing look and a withering flower . It is very pleasant and praiseworthy to take Principle by the hand , and follow her calmly through all the changes of her path ; but when Impulse shuts her eyes and spreads her wings and lifts us like the bird of the eastern tale into her own atmosphere of freedom , there is an extasy in our very dizziness . I never thought for a moment what all this was to end in ; I was as moral as a martyr , and if the lady had advanced half as far to meet me as some of her liberal sisters will do to anybody that can adjust rhymes to nonsense , I should have been sadly embarrassed . But it is time to record my next aberration . Before I introduce the few coming stanzas , it may be as well to request all that class of readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their foreheads , to turn over to Politics and Statistics . The lines beneath were conveyed to her for whom they were intended , by a stratagem , well enough conceived but unfortunate in its execution . This accident may have had some connexion with certain subsequent proceedings . // Hast thou a look for me , love ? A glance is lightly given ; Though small the cost to thee , love , To me it may be heaven . Hast thou a smile for me , dear ? One smile may chain a rover ; A laughing lip , a flashing eye , And Love 's first page turns over . Hast thou a word for me , love ? Why not a soul is near thee ; And there is none that will betray , And only one to hear thee . Hast thou a kiss for me , dear ? O spoil it not by keeping For cheeks will fade , and hearts grow cold , While youth and joy are sleeping . What a pity it is that one can not throw the silken net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads a covey of ' more refractory beings . If her father is an alderman , I shall be committed ; if her aunt is a vestal , I shall be scandalized ; if her brother is a man in buckram , I shall be shot I respect orderly men , but they are apt to have prosaic notions ; I venerate prudent women ; alas ! the pearl of female virtue is too oftea dissolved in vinegar . Exactly one week from my first impropriety I received the following note : " SIR , Your conduct to a young lady , in whom I have the honor to be interested , is such as to require my inteference . I submit to you the choice of ap9logizing to the lady in person , of giving me the satisfaction a gentleman has a right to claim , or of receiving such public chastisement as I shall deem appropriate , and find convenient " - - On reflection I thought it best to carry the affair through boldly . I returned , then , the following answer : " SIR , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so unfortunate as to offend , ( privately of course , ) if she will meet me at any convenient place . If this proposal is not agreeable , I shall have no objection to destroying you , with any weapon which may suit your fancy , if you think it necessary to your comfort . Flagellation is entirely out of the question . In case of a meeting , I shall be gratified to render my professional services in extracting the ball . " - But my knight-errant was not to be so easily pacified or intimidated* The next day , a sunshine pedestrian-marked No. 39 , in my note book - called upon me , stiffly cravated and close buttoned . He was the ' bearer of one of those pithy little communications , which begin with " Sir , " and end with " Your servant . " I answered itin such a manner as ' must bring matters to a climax immediately . Perhaps it was foolish and wicked ; but how could I do otherwise ? I , amidst whose ancestral bearings were embroidered the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having arranged time , place , and implements , I sat down to read a chapter of Bell on Wounds . I thought of my vitals , of injuries in the abdomen and thorax , generally fatal , as my author remarked ; of my Puritanical friends with their antiphlogistic principles ; of weeping relatives and stereotyped obituaries ; but then I thought of honor and gallantry , and the blood sprang like an arrow from my heart . Sup .. pose , however , I should be so miserable as to hit my antagonist-then think of the law ; and the noose , that " mortal coil " which no man can " shuffle off ; " and the scaffold , one drop of which is a dose more sedative than all the " drowsy sirups of the east ; " and the Galvanic experiments , twitching and puckering one 's leaden features , as if they would Create a soul under the ribs of death When I thought of all these things , most devoutly did I wish I had kept my verses in the silly brain that hatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems of one of my interesting friends , or disposed of them in any way , so that they might have died unread , or evaporated unwritten . To provide against what is commonly called an accident , I made the following Will . I take the liberty , as I have done throughout , of avoiding names , dates , localities , and technicalities . " Knowing the frailty of our bodily organization , and the peculating disposition of domestics , I give and bequeath the following articles to the following persons . " My note book , containing a list of all persons who walk in public , with personal remarks , to the Female Charitable Society . " To the person marked 44 , in the note book , a green coat and a hat somewhat worn , recommending him to wear them occasionally , by way of a change . " To the person marked 19 , in the note book , a clean shirt , requesting him to keep it as a curiosity . " To the same person , a small box , containing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions for its use . To the lady marked 113 , a yard of tolerably thick cloth , to be disposed of as apparel , and applied where it is most needed . " To my great uncle , a pistol flint , with a knife to skin it . " To my stationer , an unfinished novel , The One-eyed Militia Man , ' an excellent thing , as far as it goes . " To my long suffering creditors , my blessing . " To the world , my memory , begging them to be careful of it . " And now , having set all these matters in order , I practised pistol shooting two whole days at a little cock-chicken of my landlady 's , and was awakened on the third morning by a vigorous crow from the intangible obstinate . It is now some time since this affair has sAl blown over , and I am u*iwilling to dwell upon the particulars . I will only say , that a few days after my unsuccessful attempts upon the chicken , my tailor declared the left leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but a patch , and as he assured me that no gentleman of figure wore patches , I requested him to measure me on the spot for a pair of black broadcloth pantaloons. 0 . W. H.@@183067916.txt PART II . THERE are about four hundred different Birds in the United States , three hundred and fifty of which , perhaps , may be found at some season of the year in the woods and fields in the neighborhood of Boston yet how small a number of these are at all known to the great majority of our people ! probably not fifty , out of the three hundred and fifty , would be recognized by name ; and as to identifying individuals , people in general have limited their ornithological pursuits to that very shrewd performance of telling a " hawk from a handsaw . " Our woods // are full of song , and most of the notes are familiar to our ears , yet ninety-nine out of a hundred of us take a Fly-catcher for a Robin , and know no distinction between a Goldfinch , a Summersylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day for months together . Now we hold it to be a matter of some interest to know these little visiters , and nothing more than fair to requite , with a personal intimacy and welcome , the greeting offered by their pleasant strains . No one can take a ramble for a quarter of an hour in the woods , in June , July , or August , without having his ears saluted by a sweet , rolling , melodious whistle from the lofty branches above his head ; this note is often taken for that of the Robin , though any person at all acquainted with the individual could distinguish the two species of melody , at any distance capable of transmitting the faintest of these sounds to his ear . This songster is the RED-EYED FLY-CATCHER , one of the most charming and sprightly musicians that our forests can boast of . Lie is about the size of a Sparrow , and is of an olive brown color . His lively and agreeable note is the charm of our woods from morning to night , being kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feathered choir . The tallest trees and the thickest woods are the favorite resort of this bird ; on open plains or among low thickets , he is never seen ; hut among the giant arms of the old oaks , or in the dense foliage of the walnuts , or on the top of a tall and majestic elm , he is sure to take his stand and make the dark shadows . of the forest ring with his sonorous warble . His performances , indeed , are not confined to the country , but our most populous cities are greeted by his visits . In a fine summer day as you walk through the ' mall in Boston , you may hear his mellow and enlivening whistle among the trees of that beautiful promenade , and in passing along the busiest streets , where a towering elm lifts its fresh green canopy over the brick . walls , the little rustic may be heard , straining his melodious throat amid the concert of rattling carts and creaking weelbarrows . The nest of this charming musician is quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a young walnut , oak , or hornbeam* six , eight , or ten feet from the ground , and is what is called a basket nest , hanging from a forked branch by the edges , like the pocket of a billiard-table , or a dip-net ; they are built so near the ground as to af -- ford opportunity for observing the mechanism pursued by the builder ; and the ingenuity of this little architect in knotting his looped strings in regular triangle , and weaving his chopped leaves into the warp of his habitation , till he has brought it into proper symmetry and mathematical adjustment , is enough to fill us with admiration . " Sic vos non vobis nid*ficatis ayes I " It would seem a shame that so much ingenuity and industry should not be allowed the full enjoyment of the fruits of their toil ; and yet nature-Heaven bless the mark ! - does at times play unaccountable pranks . This same nidicular handywork  --  to what base uses may it come ! The Fly-catcher 's nest , so snug and cosey , is a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , in which a changeling usurps the honor of a legitimate heir . Mayhap you never heard of the interloper aforesaid . The Cow-bunting is a bird that never builds a nest , but sneaks into that of another , and leaves its eggs to the care of strangers . If you should // chance to espy in your walks through the woods , a black , impish looking rascal , fluttering from fence to bush , like a thieving caitiff , afraid to be seen ,  --  skulking among the thickets , and prying into nooks and corners with the air of a catchpole or a pickpocket ,  --  knock him down , cape saxa manu , cape robora pastor ; stop his privateering ; nullify him ! that is the very villain , on the look-out for a nest in which to father a spurious progeny upon some unlucky wight , more industrious and Christian-like , than himself . You have heard of the Cuckoo , and his tricks of a similar stamp to this ,  --  the European Cuckoo , I should premise ,  --  for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and builds a nest of his own . The Cow-bunting is the only American bird , known to be guilty of the practice abovementioned , and , as I have just remarked , may be seen in the woods , sharking about with a stealthy movement and villanous aspect , silent and watchful , lest the " very stones should prate of his whereabout ; " and peeping and nuzzling into every odd corner for a market in which to pass off his counterfeits . Many is the decent , industrious , and pains-taking little citizen , that is plagued with the visits of this prowling customer , and there is no getting clear of him , for the villain 's craft is equal to his impudence ; a small bird will be driven from his nest by the intruder , a large one will be watched for the moment when his back is turned . The little Wittachee* can not hide his cradle in too close a seclusion for the eye of the prowler ; the red-eyed Fly-catcher 's airy basket is looked upon as constituting specially desirable quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bringing up the infant trouv6 ; the Cat-bird is not cunning enough to keep out of the scrape , though various devices are resorted to by some of these birds to rid themselves of the incumbrance ; some will abandon their nests when the Cow-bird has laid in them ; but , in general , birds will not leave eggs of their own , when a spurious one is thrust into their company . Of course , when the eggs are hatched , the brood are all equally taken care of by the dam , interloper cum ceteris ,  --  though , in most cases , the Cow-bunting is the first hatched , and as he quickly out-grows the rest of the brood , and , with his ample dimensions and narrow quarters , feels a good deal of that incommodity which troubled our venerable friend and acquaintance , the old lady who lived in a spoon , he makes short work with his brother nestlings , and elbows them overboard without ceremony . Every Cow-bunting that is reared is the destruction of three or four other birds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name from its habit at certain seasons , of frequenting the cowpens to pick up grain and seeds ; it is sometimes called Cow-bird , Cowpen-bird , and Blackbird , which reminds me of many other confusions of names in our ornithology , that occasion great error and perplexity , to one not much acquainted with natural history . Our Blue Jay , for instance , is called in Virginia , the Bluebird ; the Bluebird , is called there the Blue-sparrow . But the oddest perplexity is made by confounding together the Partridge , Quail , and Pheasant , in such inextricable confusion , that a traveler from Massachusetts to the South , would be sorely puzzled to tell which was which , without turning to a manual * Sylvia Marilandica. // of Ornithology . There is a bird in New-England , called a Partridge ; this bird is called a Pheasant , in Pennsylvania , Virginia , and the Carolinas . There is a bird called a Partridge , in the aforesaid Southern States , and this bird is called a Quail in New-England ; but the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is neither a Partridge , nor a Pheasant , but a Ruffed Grous . There are no Partridges , or Pheasants , in the United States . The WARBLING FLY-CATCHER I should have mentioned along with his brother of the red-eye ; the song of this bird is , perhaps , the sweetest and most agreeable of all the tuneful choir : with a note lQss vigorous and emphatic than the other , he far excels him in harmonious softness of tone , and the smooth , voluble flow of his musical strains . He is much less common than the Red-eye , and I do not recollect ever to have heard him within the precincts of the city but in a woody spot in the country , or on an elm or chesnut , near your farmhouse , whenever you hear from out the leaves a sweet , melting , continuous warble , in a low , gentle strain , yet clear and distinct ; tender and approaching to languid , yet *ot deficient in fulness or effect ; never harsh , sharp , abrupt or strong , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the bird I have been describing . His nest is built in the common way , in the high branches of a tree , generally an elm . He shows a considerable fondness for the society of man , by nestling near his dwellings , and his confidence and familiarity should be returned with hospitable protection ,  --  a requital no less merited by his sociable disposition , than the surpassing sweetness of his voice . Of the Fly-catcher tribe , we have various other individuals , more or less eminent for song , as the White-eye , the Red-start , and others so little known as to have no popular name . These birds , as their appellation signifies , live solely on flies , mosohetoes , bugs , &amp;c. so that the services they perform are not limited to the sphere of their musical capacities . Some of them are hardly ever seen out of the thickest woods , as these p arts abound generally in insects . The RED-START , must be looked or in thedeepest and darkest recesses of the forest . This is a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful orange on the shoulders , and white at the breast . His note is much like that of a Goldfinch or Yellow-bird , and , among the thick foliage of the pines or walnuts , you may observe him darting round and round from one limb to another in pursuit of his game , snapping up flies and moschetoes , one after another , to the tune of fifty or a hundred per meal ; the havoc , indeed , made by all of them among insects is prodigious . It is a fortunate and wise provision of nature that such a check should be provided to the multiplication of these insignificant , but troublesome creatures . All animated species have their irremediable grievances ; and to be gobbled up by birds seems to be one of the ills that fly-flesh is heir to . * Speaking of every thing , " says Caleb Quotem , " reminds me of nothing ! " Speaking of catching flies reminds me of political economy . Mr. Malthus , and his acolytes , might draw an argument upon analogy from the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark the whole scheme of animated existence-in favor of his doctrine of superfecundity , and the necessity of the preventive check . There 42 // is a very manifest superfecundity in the production of birds , and a very evident and operative preventive check in the way of this increase . Most of those familiar to us , lay four or five , and sometimes more , eggs ; the Marsh-wren lays seven or eight ; and many of these birds breed twice or thrice in a season ; yet do we find that any species is more numerous now than it was at any preceding period ? The geometrical ratio in which they ought to increase , according to calculation is enormous ; but for all this , it does not appear that any increase takes place from year to year , even in those species which are not molested by man . An attentive observation will explain this phenomenon . The system of animated nature is one great round of destruction ; hardly an inhabitant of the forest lives otherwise than by destroying some other species of animal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a series of hazards , that , after considering their number and degree , we see cause rather for surprise , that whole species are not exterminated , than for wonder at their not increasing out of measure . The Cow-bunting , as has been already remarked , destroys a vast number perhaps one third of the small birds ' nests will be found upon examination to have a Cow-bunting 's egg in them ; but this is nothing to the ravages committed among the eggs and young , by the Cuckoos , Squirrels , Pole-cats , Snakes , Owls , Rats , Foxes , &amp;c. who are continually prowling about in search of nests . When full grown , their hazards are far from being at an end ; the Hawks , Owls , and Foxes , with a host of other enemies , are ready to dart upon them at every favorable opportunity ; by this means a proper balance is kept up in their numbers , and no species is suffered to multiply beyond a certain limit . The philosopher , as is remarked by the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel , yet he admires the skilful adaptation of parts , and the efficiency with which the means are fitted to the end . The individuals , who are portions of this great scheme , may rest satisfied that their private loss is public gain , and thus to fall a personal sacrifice to the proper operation of the system , would be , as Lord Byron said of being drowned in the Lake of Geneva , " classical , but not agreeable ! " But stay-I have been digressing ; we came forth to see , and not to philosophize . Let us look around ; the dark forest environs us on every side , and the deep dell at our feet is black in the shadows of the thick pine boughs the hill sides are shaggy with a deep forest of cedars , and the fitful breeze swelling through the dense mass of foliage , sounds like the hollow roar of the ocean ; a few sunburnt rocks lift their mossy brows above the herbage , gleaming in gray and reddish masses among the fresh green thickets ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene is only broken by the shrill note of the Pinewarbler , who , now and then from the dark leaves of the evergreens , trolls forth a rattling cry , which in the lonely gloom of the woods has a melancholy sound quite in unison with the savage character of the scenery . These secluded spots and deep recesses are the favorite haunts of the WooD-THRUsH , a bird whose note is possessed of singular me*lody and compass ; he is very rarely to be met with , but his song , if it bui* once strike the ear , can not fail to arrest your attention instantaneously. // and remain impressed upon the memory ever afterwards-so very marked and peculiar are both his tone and execution . He sings seldom , generally towards evening , and is very shy . About sunset you may , by a happy chance , hear his note from the thickest part of a deep grove , and by making your way carefully through the trees , find him perched in the centre of an enormous white pine , so dark as to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsuspicious of any intruding listener , he will chant a few slow , solemn and singularly varied tones , more like those of a flute , or a church organ , than any melody of the woods . These tones are musical in a very high degree , clear , deliberate , and regulated by pauses of considerable length . I know not any songster of our groves , whose performances are more striking or effective than the singular chants of this bird ; their full , deep and impressive sounds , the solemn slowness with which they are uttered , the dark solitude of the spot , still darker from the gathering shades of evening , all combine in producing an effect similar to that of the sound of a pealing anthem , through the " long-drawn aisle and fretted vault " of a Gothic cathedral . Let us stop a moment to contemplate this monarch oak , rearing his mighty form in lonely grandeur over the dwarfish tribes of cedar and juniper around him . The veteran of the forest towers proudly over their diminutive heads , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naked body has been rent by the winter tempest , and he flings abroad his giant arms , no more , alas ! to shake their glistening foliage in the breeze , but blasted with lightning and stretching their bare and blackened forks unsheltered into the scorching sky . A flight of ill-omened Cuows , whose funeral garb and hoarse scream form a fit accompaniment to this image of ruin , are perched upon the scathed limbs , or wheeling in the air overhead , croaking forth their harsh and discordant caw . A thousand winters have beat against that lonely trunk , but its firm and deep*set roots held with immoveable grasp the stony bowels of the earth ; the vigor and brawn of youth were in those knotty branches , and the lord of the woods bore the driving of a thousand winters against his brow unmoved , and saw a thousand snows melt from the mountain tops with firm-set foot and unriven joints . The red deer bounded along the glades under his shadow , and the war-whoop of the painted savage rung in the breeze that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be remarked , that there are fewer singing birds to be found here than in other woods ; the Sylvias and Fly-catchers rarely frequent them ; and beside those already enumerat*. ed , we shall hear hardly any other note than that *f the TOWHEE . BUNTING , sometimes called Chewink , or Ground-robin . This is an innocent and rather pretty sort of bird , of tame and familiar habits , building a nest in the ground at the foot of a pine tree , and always keeping near the earth , scratching among the bushes , or , in its highest excursions , ascending the lowest branches of a cedar or stunted pi'ne . In scrambling among the thickets you may almost tread upon the female as she sits upon her nest ; on being alarmed , she will run a few yards , hop into a low branch , and begin a quick , emphatic and rather melancholy cry , " towIt*e , towk*e , " repeated at short intervals . Oftentimes in a warm day , when unmolested and in perfect quiet , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short distance from each other , and repeat and answer the same note for half an hour together * this concert , though rather monotonous and plaintive , is not unpleasing . There is another very different and sprightly note uttered by this bird , so dissimilar , indeed , to the former , that one has a difficulty in believing it to proceed from the same organs that sent forth those deep and guttural tones . From the summit of that distant tree the loud clear whistle of the ROBIN announces that the sun is hastening downward ; and as the air grows cool , and the glare of day diminishes , his note increases in emphasis and rapidity , till the whole neighborhood rings with the music . Who is a stranger to the sweet and cheerful voice of this favorite bird , or to his innocent and familiar manners ? It may be not amiss to remark that this is not the Robin Redbreast of Europe , which is a bird about half his size , but closely resembling him lit manners . This time of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another songster , who , on account of the lateness of the hour in which he is generally heard , is , I find , called by our country people , the Nightingale ,  --  an appellation which he certainly does not merit for the melody of his notes , although his vocal exhibitions are some of the most singular to our ears that the whole fbrest offers . This bird , whose proper name is the TAWNY-THRUSH , has a remarkably strong , deep , blowing voice , hardly musical , but considerably varied , and which may be likened somewhat to the hollow rolling sound made by blowing into the muzzle of a gun-barrel . When heard in the stillness of the evening , and among the thick woods , where , in fact , they almost always keep , the effect is very striking and impressive . They may sometimes be heard during the day , when besides the peculiar whistle , just described , they more commonly utter a single short and sharp cry . But they are more fond of the evening , and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the skirt of a grove , and hear them call to one another among the dark shadows of the trees , in a full and emphatic voice , sometimes harsh and husky , and at others mellowed and tuned into a warble , not unmusical . One individual calls out- " Hwy tr*oo , tre*oo , trdoo , trdoo ; " in a few seconds another replies- " Til lii lii , til lii lil , "  --  and this musical colloquy is kept up for half an hour , or more ; there are certainly few notes that sound more curiously . This Thrush is by no means a rare bird ; the woods round Boston are full of them . They are seen for a few days in the Southern States , as they pass northwardly , but they breed only in these parts . Their nests are always low , commonly close to the ground , in a stunted bush , or on a pile of sticks . Their plumage so exactly resembles the color of a dead leaf , that when in search of nests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery . The bird seems to be instinctively aware of this circumstance , and trusts to her color for concealment . When sitting on her nest , she will suffer any one to pass within a foot of her station without moving a feather . Gentle reader and companion the day is done . The sun is sinking behind the dark blue mountains in the west , and a great wall of leaden-colored shadow comes heaving up from the gray ocean , far off in the opposite heaven . Look now at the glorious pageant of a summer // sunset ! The western sky is glowing with gold and purple , and yon gorgeous company of clouds , that gather and hang around the bright track of the sinking orb , seem like blood-red banners waving over an immense curtain of green and glowing flame . A heap of dense masses are dappling the long vista of glory beyond , while their fringed edges are lighted into transparent fire by the sea of flame streaming up behind them . While we gaze , the magical scene ch*tnges . The deep crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dazzling gleam of that glancing ocean of light , pass into fainter hues ; the sparkling sky abates its fires , and the sheet of red flame wanes into a mild yellow . The purple tints have sunk into gray , and the last faint rays of the sun decline into the thin and silvery tinge of twilight.
