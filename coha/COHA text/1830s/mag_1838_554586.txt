txt THE people of the United States are like persons surrounded by mirrors . They may catch their likeness from // every quarter , and in every possible light , attitude , and movement . We have heard , - and our authority is no less than that of the elder President Adams , - of what is called a poutirtg room in France ; the apartment being of an octagonal form , and all the sides , as well as the ceiling over bead , of the most polished mirrors ; so that a person standing in the centre may see himself in every direction , multiplied into an indefinite vista of selves , as far as the eye can reach . Into such a focus of reflections , it is said , the gallant gentlemen of the most chivalrous portion of Europe cast an unfortunate lady whose temper has escaped her control , dooming her simply to the reflection of her own countenance . We , in this country , seem to dwell in a great pouting-room , wherein different nations and languages are the mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected features ; the vista seems to lengthen at every sight . In England it stretches on with multitudinous images ; and other countries return the likeness . The American character and institutions have become a great staple of English literature . Books relating to them have formed , for the last ten or fifteen years , the most prominent portion of that well-thumbed and dog-eared division of the circulating library , which seems to have such attractions for people of all periods of life ; we mean books of travels . If the United States should be suddenly blotted out of existence , or should disappear , like the ephemeral Juan Fernandez , beneath that ocean which is now poured round them , we can hardly imagine in what new direction the English travellers , who take notes for the press , would turn their footsteps . Curiosity seems satisfied , or at least silent , with regard to the extended plains of Asia , and the races of men , who , with their mighty works , have been obliterated from the earth ; and it is with difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Greece and Italy , the sacred lands of classic story , and in short all Europe , have so often fallen under the pen of the traveller , that the interest of the public in them seems exhausted . A fresher subject is found in the United States , in their unmeasured territory , with its rivers and mountains , lately or even now in the newest life of nature ; and , more than nature 's works , in the institutions formed by man in the spirit of the territory , - free , untried , and gigantic . While we have had works of this kind from the English press , of various kinds and degrees of merit , a German duke // has condescended to favor us with a dull account of his travels in the United States ; and several French writers have discussed our character and institutions with candor , impartiality , and ability . Among the latter is De Tocqueville , whose work we do not despair of seeing republished in this country ; and who , among all , of any nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facile princeps . In Prussia , we have understood that Dr. Julius , whose visit will be remernbered with pleasure by many of our readers , is now preparing for the public the results of his observation during his tour . The present work is by a German , after a residence of many years in the country . It originally appeared in England ; and has since been republished , with slight alterations , among us . We have been informed that it has been translated into the German language , and already passed through no less than three editions in that tongue . It is not a little remarkable that , while the author was preparing a translation , another appeared in a different part of Germany from a different pen ; no feeble token of the merits of the work , and of the literary activity of that great country . Pursuing , then , the allusion with which we commenced , we may call this work a mirror of transcendent magnitude , held up to the multitudes of England and Germany . In approaching the consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , force , and often eloquence of the style , in which it is written . The style would do high credit to any native , and to the manner born ; in a foreigner it seems wonderful . We could hardly believe that it was the production of one whose early days were spent in the sound of another language , if we did not know that the author was a German ; for we are mindful of the old saw , that a German has a tongue for every language . Mr. Grund seems to have obtained a mastery , almost perfect , over the English . One might read his work , and , unless his suspicions were aroused by previous knowledge of the author , or the suggestion of another , hesitate to pronounce it the production of other than a native . So remarkable is it in this respect , that we are reminded by it of the feats of Politian , whose Latinity was thought to rival that of Cicero . The idiom of our language , which is often so subtile , and eludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great , and almost unfailing accuracy . An English critic has said that he has scarcely ever // offended in this particular , except when he attempts poetical versions from Schiller or Goethe . A few signs occur in the progress of the work , which show that the author saw things sometimes through a different medium from his readers . Thus , in the London edition , the term " meat-pots " is used for the well-known phrase from the Bible , " flesh-pots " ; a form of speech which the author has altered in the American edition . The word " compare " is constantly used at the bottom of the page to indicate a reference , instead of the word " see " ; the former word being the literal translation of the German vergleichen , which is the word used for this purpose by writers in that language . Some passages in the present work are of remarkable eloquence ; and the style is uniformly precise and intelligible , abounding in energetic expressions , yet without liveliness brilliant , yet often heavy . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by a stroke of the pen ; hut all seems constructed with care and weariness . Neither is there about it any of the interest of a personal narrative , or of sketches of scenery and men . In these the author has ventured only when it was necessary to illustrate the various relations of the people , moral , social , and political , which was the distinct subject proposed by him , and which is of indefinite comprehensiveness . Every topic of manners , opinions , prejudices , government , and civilization , naturally arises in the review of these relations . Quic quid agunt homines , nostri est farrago libelli . Besides , this review is often intermingled with apt historical reflections , and particularly with comparisons with things in Germany , sometimes by way of contrast , which , as is not unfrequently the case with such efforts , are often carried too far . The author says , that he has anxiously endeavoured to give an impartial account of the present condition of the United States , and faithfully to delineate those characteristic features , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he adds , that the object of his publication will be attained , if it serve to inspire the English with more just conceptions of American worth , and increase the respect and friendship of America for England . A work written with such views does not address itself to any vulgar prejudices , and can , of course , succeed only by the judgment of intelligent readers . Abuse , caricature , and condemnation , // have become a condiment almost essential , to make a book of travels relish ; a truth which Sam Weller appears to have been well aware of , when he endeavoured to prevail upon his incarcerated master , Mr. Pickwick , to commit a breach of the prison , and to flee to this country ; " then let him come back , " says Mr. Weller , " and write a book about the Merrikins , ' as 11 pay all his expenses and more , if he blows em up enough . " That Mr. Grund has not , in the language of Mr. Weller , blown us up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is not quite so clear to us , that he was not wiser than Mr. Weller , and that he did not anticipate that excessive eulogy would be little less attractive than condemnation , while , unlike the latter , it could give no personal offence . We would not venture to carry this suggestion further , lest we should do the author grievous injustice . And charity would lead us to suppose , what is so agreeable to our naticnal vanity , that the terms of praise , constant and often exaggerated as they seem , are justified by our character and institutions . But Mr. Grund does not confine his eulogy to America . He embraces England within its powerful charm . He extends the not very dainty dish with one hand to John Bull , and with the other to his brother Jonathan , who is , for the most part , unused to such moods of gentleness . It would be difficult to find terms which could carry the English character further than the following paragraphs . " It is true , there are ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , in most respects , superior to other nations , and especially to their neighbours on the Continent . They enjoy , in the first place , a greater degree of political freedom than any other people , save the Americans , in the world . They have produced the ablest statesmen , the wisest legislators , and ( with few exceptions ) the bravest and most skilful commanders of armies and navies . Their philosophers have been the glory of the human mind , and have wrested more truths from nature than all other sages combined together . They can boast of the most manly and classical literature of the moderns , and may , perhaps , add that there is not a valuable thought which the human mind is capable of conceiving , which is not already , and most happily , expressed in the English language . They have surpassed all other nations in the mechanic arts , and have become equally superior in every thing relating to manufactures . They have increased the facilities of commerce , by the establishment of powerful colonies , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves for the humanity and justice with which they have governed them . They have carried the blessings of civilization and religion wherever they went , and established , in every clime , the glory of the British name . " - p. 59 . One of the greatest advantages enjoyed by the Americans , and which can never be sufficiently taken into consideration , consists in their being descended from the greatest and most enterprising nation in Europe . America , in her very cradle , was the child of freedom ; wrapt in chartered rights and immunites . She was the offspring of a strong , healthy , wellconditioned mother , who was determined not to spoil her by foolish caresses , but rather hardened her constitution by premature exposure . To the noble blood of her mother , she joined the superiority of education obtained in the school of adversity ; and to the attachment of her parent to liberty , the sturdy love of independence . " The English have bestowed more blessings on humanity , by the establishment of their colonies , than any other nation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and institutions , they have contributed to improve the condition of the human race . The French , the Dutch , the Spaniards , and the Portuguese have also established colonies ; but these have never risen to political importance . They were no nurseries of freedom , but administered only to the sordid cupidity of their parents . Even in achieving their independence they fall into wreck and ruin ; and the sickly progeny of diseased parents can hardly survive their sires . Compare to this the active vigor of the British Colonies ; their legislative assemblies ; their administration of justice , and the liberty of the press established in most of them ! * - pp. 154 , 155 . The spirit of the book is one of kindliness . Tbere is in it a tone of good-humor , even where the author undertakes to censure . Indeed , there is something more ; there is an air of advocacy , which is constantly manifest . This broad country , with its schoolhouses and churches , and various institutions , seems placed at the bar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hamilton he has particularly directed his defensive attack . The work of this writer on " Men and Manners , " is treated as the bill of indictruent , in which are set forth the high offences of which we stand charged . In many instances an importance , scarcely justified by the circumstances , appears to be given to the assertions of this traveller ; and Mr. Grund , in his reply to them , becomes as angry as is consistent with his nature . // If there be an American , with soul so dead as to be discontented with his native land , he may feel his patriotism revive , as he reads the earnest and argumentative eulogies of a cosmopolite , like the present author . Disposed to think well of our home and its institutions , as we are , and little inclined to despair of the republic , we are free to confess , that our love of country received a new impulse , and our confidence in its prospects gathered new strength , from these pages . The character of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) olitical , is here subjected to a minute analysis , and the elements of strength , from which it is composed , are displayed . This is not , however , accomplished by any single picture , but it appears from the whole work . Every page discloses something of fact , or illustration , or argument , which goes to make up the final result . To a foreigner , who is interested in the country , Mr. Grund 's work will be of great value , from the amount of information which it conveys . No other work , within our knowledge , presents a view so complete , of our resources in every department of life . Facts are accumulated , and statistical tables are presented , which give it very much the appearance of a topographical survey . The author not unfrequently indulges in speculations , but he never forgets to introduce the facts and tables which bear upon the subject . For this we are obliged to him , since it is placing before the public abroad , the surest means of judging us according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in a very satisfactory manner , as he had been for many years a resident in the United States . He was no tourist , who dedicated his summer rambles to this continent , or literary hack , who left his home in order to gather some fresh materials for the press . He was a citizen , who had for years observed the operation of our institutions ; who had left his father-land in early life , and devoted the affections of his manhood to his adopted country ; who had n*ingled in its society and business , and had felt the harsh alternations of its summers and winters . By birth a German , and , from circumstances , considerably conversant with the character and institutions of other nations , he has been able , at the same time that he wrote with the heart of a native , to make those observations which would hardly occur except to a foreigner . His work , moreover , is calculated to recommend liberal institutions , and to // vindicate the practical working of our system . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cause of freedom . Mr. Grund is a thorough democrat . He upholds the cause of the many against the few , and takes every opportunity to enforce the importance of religious and political freedom . The latter , he estimates as the two most prominent moral causes which promoted the trade of Holland and the United States . We know of no work , that has appeared for a long period , which will he more interesting than the present , to those of all countries engaged in the cause of human rights . And yet , while using these terms of commendation , we would not he understood as subscribing to all that he has written on this subject . As Americans , living under a constitution made and sustained by the people , in whose breath is all political power , we can not doubt the rights of the people . In any honest advocacy of these rights , we shall be ever ready to join . No cause is more sacred , or more intimately allied with the progress of man . History is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended to the tomb , all unconscious of the invigorating air of freedom , warn us , by the voiceless story of their wrongs , against surrendering ourselves to be governed by others . And the extended prosperity which has always attended the establishment of political privileges , diffusing itself , with life-giving power , over every department of human thought and action , encourages us to persevere in this cause , and to strive after a universal recognition of " Well-tempered liberty , The last and largest boon to social man . " In Mr. Grund 's zeal for the people , therefore , we find no occasion for dissent . But we do ohject to the alloy of party views and considerations , which is intermingled with it . Mr. Grund is a devoted friend to the past and present administrations . On this account , however , we have no quarrel with him . He is welcome to his political partialities or prejudices . But he has done injustice to himself , and been false to truth , by allowing them to influence his opinions . The difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the democracy of America , is at once apparent . The Frenchman has surveyed our institutions from the serene heights of an unprejudiced philosophy , and produced a work , // which , in brilliancy , condensation , and pregnant sense , will rank with the Spirit of Laws of his great countryman . The German has chosen the humbler elevations , afforded by the political party to which he was attached , and seen objects more or less invested with the mists and smoke of earth . It is on this account , that , while we concede to Mr. Grund the highest praise for knowledge of his subject , and the general ability with which he has handled it , we hesitate to give him our confidence . We feel perpetually that he has something more in view than directly meets the eye , and that secret undercurrents are at work beneath the unruffled surface of his page . The author has taken several occasions to exhibit his personal partiality for General Jackson . One of the most striking is as follows " Universal suffrage has been decried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Jackson had already been represented as the future dictator of the republic . How have these predictions been verified ? The democratic party have developed more union and strength than any previous one in power . They have reconciled the south with the north , and preserved the integrity of the Union . They have , in every instance , upheld the law , and subjected States and individuals to the proper authority of Congress . They have , at the same time , abstained from any undue and unconstitutional interference with the internal regulations of the States , and procured justice for all that were injured . They have made the government respected abroad , and obliged even the most powerful nations to preserve peace and good faith with the United States . In short , they defeated their antagonists at home and abroad , and inspired universal confidence in the safety and stability of American institutions . " And what has become of the dictator ? He is indeed yet the idol of the people , whose interests he endeavoured to protect by every act of his military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as all his predecessors , with no other personal gratification than the affections of America and the admiration of Europe . He will leave to his successor the example of his virtue , and a government established on liberty and justice . " - pp. 410 , 411 . We should do injustice to Mr. Grund , if we did not relieve him from some of the force of our last remarks , by explicitly stating , that on the subject of credit and the currency , he // has taken ground different from that occupied by the late and present administrations . The advantages of the American system of credit are treated of with great force of argument and illustration , and with a philosophical perspicacity . The character of the American merchant , so much vilified of late , meets with distinguished commendation at his hands . " An American merchant is an enthusiast , who seems to delight in enterprise in proportion as it is connected with danger . He ventures his fortune with the same heroism , with which the sailor risks his life ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of a favorite project , as the mariner is to navigate a new ship , after his own has become a wreck . An American carries the spirit of invention even to the countingroom . He is constantly discovering some new sources of trade ; and is always willing to risk his capital and credit on some terra incognita , rather than follow the beaten track of others , and content himself with such profits as are realized by his competitors . This is undoubtedly the cause of a great number of unfortunate speculations and subsequent failures ; but it constitutes also the technical superiority of the American merchant over the European . He is an inventor , not an imitator ; he creates new sources of wealth instead of merely exhausting the old ones . Hence his vigilance and application . The ordinary routine of business is not sufficient to ensure his success ; he must think , invent , speculate ; for it is more by ingenuity and foresight , than by the regular pursuit of trade , that he can hope to realize a fortune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now prosper in the United States . Fortunes there are not made by small savings , but by large and successful operations . It is not by hoarding money , but by employing and investing it , that property accumulates in America ; and the inexhaustible riches of the country open daily a thousand new roads to industry and commerce . " - pp. 240 , 241 . The author continues his remarks on the character of the American merchant , in the same strain with what we have just extracted . Lorenzo de ' Medici could hardly have received a more elaborate eulogy . The enthusiasm , with which our merchants enter updh their undertakings , and venture their fortunes , and upon which Mr. Grund has remarked , is in strong contrast with the monotonous work-day character which belonged to them in the earlier stages of civilization . The spirit of chivalry , which once possessed a single class of society , is now diffused , with considerable uniformity , through // all sorts of men ; and its manifestation , in the enterprise and generosity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the North American Indians , the melancholy relics of the powerful races , who once occupied the valleys and hilltops where we have fixed our seats , Mr. Grund has little or no sympathy . He speaks of them with a cold indifference , which might well become a speculator in their lands , but which we should not expect from an accomplished foreigner , in whose bosom the springs of justice and humanity were still to be found . His views with regard to them are fully expressed in the following extract . Let no sensitive European , therefore , complain of the barbarous cruelty of the Americans in chasing the Indians from the soil of their fathers , or in forcing them to flee from the approach of civilization , to the unhospitable woods of the western territory . The American aborigines , with but very few exceptions , never possessed the soil on which they trod , any more than the air which they breathed . They never cultivated it to any extent , nor had they , individually , any distinct title to it arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beasts of the forest , and it was useful to them only as it afforded them the means of prey . The English had as good a right to call the ocean their own , because they moved on it , as the American Indians to claim possession of their continent because they roamed in its woods . There was barbarity in the conquest of Lima and Mexico , the inhabitants of which were already in possession of many of the arts of peace ; but there can be none in the quiet progress of civilization in the United States , except what is provoked by the Indians themselves , and for which they alone must remain accountable . The American settler takes possession of a soil which has never been cultivated , and which , therefore , has had no owner . He builds his log-house in a country in which there is room enough for the support of millions , and in which there are hardly a few hundred stragglers to follow the track of the deer Is this robbery ? Is it cruel to civilize and improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and comfort to thousands of intelligent beings from all parts of the world , who would otherwise starve or be reduced to poverty , because in so doing they can not avoid intruding on the favorite hunting-grounds of some wandering tribes , and disturb their game ? This , however , they do ; and , with the deer , the American aborigines disappear from the soil . " it is in vain to talk of civilizing them . If it could be done , // which is more than doubtful , ( considering the many unsuccessful attempts which have already been made , ) they would hardly be able to compete with their teachers in any one human occupation calculated to secure a livelihood in a civilized country , and would , therefore , from necessity , become outlaws to society , and incur the punishment of the law . We can not but regret the fate of that doomed people ; but we can hardly think of rescuing them from it , without being guilty of the most flagrant injustice to the rest of mankind . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the establishment of fixed habitations in a country , is so irresistible and unsparing , that it must eventually triumph over all obstacles , and resist even the destructive consequences of wars . This is the reason why the British colonies in America prospered so rapidly , and finally finished by swallowing up Canada . The military force of th' French settlements was vastly superior to that of the English ; their lines of fortification extended from the mouth of the Mississippi to the river St. Lawrence ; but they had no possession of the intervening territory by virtue of actual settlements , and the result soon convinced them , that where the most property is accumulated , there also will be the strongest means of defence ; on that side , consequently , must eventually incline the victory . But if the policy of the Anglo-Americans was sufficient to destroy so powerful a rival as the French , what can be expected from the unconcerted , ill-advised resistance or attack of the aborigines , unskilled in military tactics , and not sufficiently strong , on any one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlers ? " Neither is it reasonable to suppose , that the quitting of their favorite hunting-grounds can give the American Indians the same pangs which an everlasting farewell to the paternal soil , the scene of all early attachments , and the habitation of all that we love , fraught with the memory and tradition of centuries , can cause to a civilized nation . The Indians quit what never was precisely their own ; they leave no object of memory or tradition behind ; and , although the loss may be felt by the tribe , no individual is actually despoiled of his own . But it is the feelings of individuals which we must here consider ; not that of the tribe or nation . A people can not be said to feel the wrongs and pains inflicted upon it by another , except in proportion as the sufferings of the whole are felt and responded to by individuals . This , however , presupposes a degree of moral developement , and a pitch of national enthusiasm , of which even history is sparing in furnishing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces are to be found in the Indian character . Let no one mistake the hatred which the colored races bear to the whites , and to each other , for a strong love of country , and an attachment to their native woods . Hatred of others is but a negative and barbarous qualification of nationality , and is by no means a necessary concomitant of its positive virtues . The hatred between the different races is something animal and instinctive , and is far removed from the noble disinterestedness of genuine patriotism . Whatever color poetry may lend to the removal of the Indians , it is , nevertheless , but the removal of a sick bed from a place where death is certain , to one from which it is more remote . Neither is it the death of youth or of manhood , but that of old age and decrepitude , which the Indian is doomed to die ; and in his mouldering ashes germinates the seed of empires , destined to change the face of the world . This is hut applying the universal law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to precede it ; no seed without destroying the blossom ; no offspring without destruction to its genitors . One nation must perish to make room for another ; and it is the peculiar good fortune of America , that she can suffer these revolutions to go on without a feverish excitement of her vitals , or hurrying the succession of events by the horror and bloodshed of war . " - pp. 225-*258 . This is a hard-hearted picture . The unsoundness of its argument upon the right of the poor Indian to the territory of his fathers , is as marked as its inhumanity . If the Indian has no right , why does our government go through the mockery of purchasing his lands , exchanging blankets for acres why did William Penn , that man of peace , enter into amicable negotiations with the occupants of the forest , and treat with them for permission to rest his head on their lands ? The possession of the Indian is not indicated by the clear and distinct appropriation which a maturer civilization has introduced as the criterion of property ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the usage of nations , sufficient to support their title . An English officer , cruising in distant seas , plants the flag of his queen on some newly discovered territory , and the folds of that flag , as it freshly kisses the breezes of a new land , proclaim the title ot ' the discoverer , though he has not left a man or a gun to guard it from indignity . If the new-found land were worth keeping , we feel confident that her majesty 's government would not abandon her title , on the ground that they never possessed the soil in question , any // more than the air which they breathed , - the ground taken by Mr. Grund with regard to theIndians . " The Engi h , " says our author , " had as good a right to call the ocean their own , because they moved on it , as the American Indians to claim possession of their continent because they roamed in its xvoods . " The difference between the two cases is very palpable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people did also . By the law of nations , the ocean was a great high-way , common to all the world . But there were certain seas , over which England claimed exclusive control not , however , because she had subdued each wave to her will , " Ipsum compedibus qui vinxerat Ennosiga*um , " and reduced to cot*nplete possession their changing waters but , because their situation around her coast exposed them particularly to the assertion of her dominion , and seemed to render her power over them necessary to her protection . It is very clear , that the Indians reduced to possession the territory over which they hunted , with as much distinctness as the English ever did the four seas . We will not urge a comparison further , to which we have been led by the illustration of the author , and in order to answer that , rather than by its intrinsic justice . Mr. Grund thinks , that it is in vain to talk of civilizing the Indians ; and , though he can not but regret the fate of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from it , without being guilty of the most flagrant injustice to the rest of mankind . Again , he does not think it reasonable to suppose , that the quitting of their favorite hunting-grounds can give them the same pangs , which an everlasting farewell to the paternal soil , fraught with the memory and tradition of centuries , can cause to a civilized nation . Here is a specious argument , to justify the arbitrary course which has been adopted with regard to the Indians . As if their attachment to the sites of their council-fires , and the earth , which covers the bones of their fathers , was not as lively and strong as that of a civilized people to the durable monuments of their country . The pathless forest has its well-known tracks for them ; the favorite haunts of the buffalo and elk are all registered in their memories ; and the course of the stream which waters their hunting-grounds , is one of their cherished recollections . To be compelled to renounce these , is to be // LJan. torn from what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their earliest attachments were directed , and about which their most valued traditions have gathered . We have little confidence , that the refined love of country , which is the offspring of an advanced state of society , is stronger in its attachment to the soil , than the untutored feelings of these artless denizens of the forest . In another part of his work , Mr. Grund says , that the Americans , as a nation , notwithstanding the occurrence of popular disturbances , have a great respect for the law ; adding , that it is the common interest of all , which requires submission to the law ; for it is the majority who are offended , when an insult is offered to the government . This is a very plausible theory , but we fear that it must fall before the stubbornness of facts . We should hesitate to believe , that , in any country to which civilization has extended , where " bells have knoll 'd to church , " within the space of the last four years , there have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of the most aggravated and fiendish outrage , as in these United States . Our ears are pained by the continied report of riot , conflagration , bloodshed , and murder . The flames , which consumed the Ursuline Convent at Charlestown , and , at midnight , scattered its tender inmates in every direction for charitable shelter , had hardly died away , and its blackened walls were still standing as a monument of a deed of atrocity almost without parallel in history , when some people at the South , assuming the solemn functions of the law , deliberately put to death five human beings , because engaged in practices at which the people of the place were rightly displeased , but which were of little importance compared with the " deep damnation of their taking off . " In another quarter , a poor negro is put to death by the cruel torture of the fagot , and the fires of Smithfield are revived at the command of the citizens of a republic . And even now , while we write , the report of a cold-blooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . An American citizen , a husband and father , has been cruelly murdered in the lawful defence of his property from the violence of an armed mob . In view of occurrences like these , it does not become an American to boast of the submission to law , as a national trait ; and he may well survey with anxiety the prospects of that form of government , under which such outrages can take // place with impunity . It was the beautiful remark of the ancient Greek philosopher , that that government was the best , under which an injury to a single citizen was resented as an injury to the state . And , when we consider that the object of society , and of the state , which is its creature , is to afford protection to the persons and property of its members , we may observe the condensed truth which is contained in this remark . Tried by this test , our government , with all the apparatus of freedom , must fail . In the deep shame for these outrages , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he venture to tax them upon any particular section of the country . There is no State which can cast the first stone . The shame of Massachusetts should find an answering look in that of Mississippi and Missouri . Well would it be for our character in history , if national penitence could wipe away the blot of these transactions . Viewing this subject so seriously as we do , we have been unable to read Mr. Grund 's account of it without the greatest pain . It is as follows " There exists but one practice in the United States , which seems to be at variance with what I have thus far advanced ; and yet , upon further consideration , I am almost inclined to consider it as a part of the common law of the country . I would refer to the Lynch law , ' of which the most brilliant accounts are furnished in the British papers . The Lynch law of America , it must he remembered , is not a child of democracy ; it is of a much more ancient and illustrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonies . It was begot in those happy times , in which religious customs took the place of the law ; and in which the ingenuity of the settlers recurred to the simplest means of obtaining the most summary justice . It is , in fact , of a patriarchal nature , having for its motto the *visdom of Solomon , - Do not spare the rod . ' The pilgrim fathers , who settled the New England States , were a highly religious people ,  --  with whom the authority of the elders of the Church was of more avail , than any positive law of Great Britain , which , from its distance , and the manner in which it had been abused into an instrument of oppression , had considerably lost its force .

" The custom being once introduced , and found expedient , was gradually increased in severity as the rigid morals of the puritans began to relax ; until , towards the American Revolution , when abuses had reached their climax , the original method of tarring and feathering ' was substituted for the more lenient punishment of the rod . The commencement being made with the excisemen in Boston , was soon imitated in the other provinces ; and being at first employed in a patriotic cause , created a universal prejudice in its favor . It became a national custom , which , as far as I remember , was only used in cases more or less directly affecting the people . Thus , whenever an individual gave a national insult , or did or practised any thing which threatened the peace and happiness of the people , they recurred to it as a domestic remedy ; but I am quite certain not with the intention of opposing the regular law .

But , as I have said before , the Lynch law is not , properly speaking , an opposition to the established laws of the country , or is , at least , not contemplated as such , by its adherents ; but rather as a supplement to them , - a species of common law , which is as old as the country , and which , whatever may be the notion of the learned in the law , ' has nevertheless been pro .. ductive of some of the happiest results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of Lynch ' ; but the above will be found to contain the essence and philosophy of all .

But we can not forbear quoting some passages from the reflections on American literature . " America was civilized in her very origin . The early settlers felt , thought , and believed as their brethren in Europe ; or , at least , did not differ from them sufficiently to create permanent distinctions . The people who obstructed their progress , and whom they conquered by arms , were not sufficiently powerful to call for an extraordinary demonstration of valor . It was not an expedition of Argonauts in quest of the golden fleece : it did not even partake of the military glory of the conquest of Mexico . The American Indians were a degraded race , without history , memory , or tradition . They seem to have been the remnants of a once powerful people , * whom a general plague or a series of internal wars had reduced to the condition of the most abject wretchedness . There was no renown attached to their subjugation ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No poetry , therefore , attaches to the conquest of the American soil , and the history of it is only remarkable from its conjunction with that of Europe . It was the oppression of Europe , which settled the American wilderness ; it was the resistance against Europe , which introduced America into the ranks of nations . Previous b that period , America had been a European province , and its history an appendage to that of England . America enjoyed the political existence of a nation , before it had an historical one by geniture . No mythological fable is blended with her origin . Her children are not descended from the gods or the sun ; they are pious Christians , who , from simple colonists , have at once risen into a powerful national independence . Had the American Indians , at the time of the European settlements , been a strong , organized nation , who , by amalgamating with the colonists , would have tinctured the manners of the settlers , and in turn received the superior arts of Their religion , rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eonclusiou* " // civilization , then a national literature , essentially different from the English , might , perhaps , have arisen from the conjunction but it would have been that of the Indians , and not of the settlers ; it would have retarded the progress of independence for centuries , and , in its stead , given birth to another system of vassallage . Another means of levelling national distinctions , consists in the propagation of learning . The man of science belongs to no country , and has no prejudices except in favor of those who are his superiors in knowledge . In the common course of nature , the arts precede the sciences in every country , as poetry comes before prose ' ; in America alone , the sciences have preceded the arts , an ( l thns raised the nation beyond the tender susceptibility of fiction . - Rousseau 's motto , Plus quon raisonne moms quon airne , ' applies not only to man , but also to Nature .

Even the most profound researches of mathematical analysis diminish the poetic grandeur of the heavens , by reducing the infinite and boundless , to the computation of the infinitely small . ' How immeasurably great , how infinitely sublime are the heavens ! But the spirit of titttcness pulled even heaven down . I " The Americans , as a nation , can not be said to be inferior in science to any people in Europe ; for not only are its most useful branches more generally diffused and applied in the United States than either in England or France , but also the most abstruse departments of knowledge are cultivated and improved by men of competent talents .

" // lation , and contribute to the developement of intellect ; but they can not create such lasting distinctions and peculiarities , as we are in the habit of claiming for the national literature of a people . " America has not passed through the different stages of civilization , each of which leaves its historical monuments and a distinct impression on the people . There was no community of religion , and hardly of feeling , previous to their common resistance against England . It was the genius of liberty which gave America a national elevation ; and it is to this genius , therefore , we must look for national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession , the religion , the life of Americans ; it is that which distinguishes them above all other nations in the world . " But the genius of liberty , though it has chosen America for its permanent dwelling , overshadows , also , a portion of Europe . England , France , and Germany , are roused by its summons ; and the poet of Europe , inspired by the same muse , kneels at the same altar , and worships the same God . Thus , the Americans , instead of being a distinct people , have become the representatives of liberty throughout the world . Their country has become the home of the banished ; the asylum of the persecuted ; the prospective heaven of the politically damned . Every people of Europe is represented in the United States ; every tongue is spoken in the vast domain of freedom ; the history of every nation terminates in that of America .

" - pp. 105 - 108 . The last part of this extract is of unusual eloquence , both of thought and language . In the anticipations in which the author indulges with regard to the literature of this country , we join with pride and cordiality . " All other nations , " he says , " have conquered by the sword , and their traces were marked by ruin and desolation ; America alone vanquishes her foes by civilization , and marks her course by moral and religious improvements . Tbere is poetry in her national developement , and the settlements of her early colonies .

Centuries elapsed before Galileo discovered , before Bacon promulgated , or rather enforced by his recommendation and example , the new philosophy , and before Shakspeare wrote . A people does not suddenly change its character , political or literary . The influence of the past is stronger than that of the present ; and we must wait till our national character has settled into the permanent shape , which properly harmonizes with the magnificent scenery in which we are placed ; till traditions have accumulated , and the history of our own continents sufficiently fills the mind , without allowing it to wander , for dearth of interest here , to the opposite shores of the ocean . Then may we expect new fountains of literature and intellectual effort to be opened .
