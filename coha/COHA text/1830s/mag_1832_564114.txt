txt Address delivered before the Massachusetts Lyceum , January 26 , 1G32 . BY JAMES SAVAGE . GENTLEMEN , AT your request I have consented to deliver an address , and have bestowed my attention upon the History of the Adoption of the Constitution of this Commonwealth . From this topic you must be prepared to expect a dry , very dry asarrative , rather than the rich philosophy , which afforded you so high entertainment in the last lecture ; * though the present may seem , if particular information could be made as attractive as general disquisition , not an unsuitable sequel to the former . The inquiry , how came the people of Massstchusetts to enjoy a frame of government , so skillfully provided for all the emergences of society in a condition of peace , order and prosperity , though it was originated and began its blessed operations in the midst of civil war , of general disquiet , of enormous debt and universal distress , that the imagination of those of us , whose memories can not extend to that time , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found interesting ; and the answer , from abler lips , ought to be as engaging as the narrative of any crisis in which the concerns of a free republic have ever been decided , and the happiness of future generations assured . If any gratification is afforded by my detail of eventst in performing this task , you may bestow your acknowledgements on a member of your body , descended from the honored father of our Constitution , whose assiduity in searching into all the evanescent memorials of that period has been amply rewarded by the affluence of his acquisitions , and whose kindness in communicating them enables me to bring out what his modesty preferred to reserve . Sic cos non sobis mellzftcats.s apes . On the violent disruption of the dependence of the Province of Massachusetts Bay upon the mother country , consummated by the hostilities of LePngton and Concord , what form of civil administration should be instantly adopted , was not a very difficult problem . You are , gentlemen , probably acquainted intimately with the circumstances , under which the actual exercise of all power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  was in the hands of a Provincial Congress . This name was assumed by the two branches of the General Court , convened as one body on the 5th October , 1774 , when Governor Gage had by proclamation , 28th September , declared his intention not to meet the General Court , and excused and discharged the members from giving their attendance at Salem , though he had , on the firstofSeptemberbefore , issued precepts to the several towns fornew elections of Representatives , who were required to assemble at that time and place . By the Boston Port Bill , the town of Salem was made the place for meeting of * On the Constitution of the United States , by Hon. Alexander H. Everett . James Ilowdoin , Esquire . // the legislature after its adjournment , directed by that arbitrary statute , on the first of June . It was , however , not a sudden thought , I presume , that led to this device of a representative assembly ; for , in the preceding month , a convention of delegates from the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued by adjournment to Milton , had passed a resolution , " that no obedience is due from this province to that , " and certain other acts of Parliament . Now as the right of the Governor to countermand the meeting of the General Court was denied , the assembling of the members against his order , was , in their situation , a natural step . We must bear in mind , that , had the Representatives assembled at Salem with the Governor 's sanction , instead of against it , they would not have been a General Court , without the Council , elected according to the charter , in May preceding , about whose rights a controversy must forthwith have arisen . These the Governor could not acknowledge , for by one of the tyrannical acts of Parliament ,  - -  that for altering the established form of government ,  --  so much of the Charter of William and Mary as related to the time and manner of electing this branch was annulled , and the King had been empowered graciously to appoint our Counsellors . His mandamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing and some unwilling subjects of the honor . It was , therefore , necessary , that these delegates of the whole people should adopt some other designation than that of a General Court , as the Royal Governor , though he might not have a right to forbid the first meeting and organizing of one branch , could have legally dissolved them immediately after , and must , in obedience to his orders , have prevented any act of Council except by those whom the House would never acknowledge , the nominees of the King 's ministers . But the first law of all communities , the preservation of existence , and the safety of their constituents , required the new Representatives to act in unison . Since it was apparent to all , that no quiet enjoyment of our rights under the Charter of 1691 , was soon to be expected , our first Provincial Congress had dissolved themselves , and called upon the people to make another election of a similar body . This second assembly was in session , when the storm of civil war , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as much foresight as energy , burst upon the Province , unprovided but undismayed . Governor Hutchinson , the most sagacious representative that Great-Britain ever employed in that station , had not heard of the passage of the Act of Parliament for altering the form of government before his return to England , and he assures us , in the close of his History recently published , that he dreaded its consequences . Well might he express in this manner his view of the character of men , with whom he had been intimately associated from his birth , and with whom he had conducted the war of the pen for a longer season than the siege of Troy . Bat however effectual might be the acquiescence of the people in any recommendations of such a Congress , it was soon perceived , that the more solemn forms of law , to which we had always been accustomed , and , indeed , the necessary division of powers , not merely legislative , but administrative and judicial , ( for it must be recollected that all courts of justice were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these several capacities , the assembly could not act without usurpation ; and if the usurpation had been submitted to , as , from the unbounded confidence reposed in the members , we may not doubt it would have been for some months , the government must have become a tyranny , the natural termination of the exercise of the three powers by a single body of men . Instead of Laws , only recommendations could be issued ; and even their Resolves had only the modest import of resolutions . So urgent was the want of a regular government , and so uneasy the condition of those distinguished men , whose mere word guided the people in this revolutionary state , that on first of April , 1775 , only eighteen days before Concord fight , our Provincial Congress had resolved , " that if Governor Gage should issue regular writs for calling together an Assembly , that the people ought to obey . " But the same body , on the 4th of May , reversed this vote , and the next day resolved , " that General Gage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , utterly disqualified himself from serving this Colony , as a Governor , or in any other capacity , and that , therefore ) no obedience is in future due to him ; but that , on the contrary , he ought to be considered and guarded against as an unnatural and inveterate enemy to the country . " The sobriety of the members happily influenced them to call upon the community to resume its rights under the charter of William and Mary , and to choose Representatives to meet in July . It was wisely determined to consider the Governor // as absent from the Province , for he resided in Boston as commander of his Majesty 's troops , with whom we were then waging deadly hostilities ; and he would not permit a General Court to sit here , nor dared he go to meet them in any other town of his Government . The process , by which self-government was re-acquired , and the state of anarchy terminated , was this : On the 12th of May , the Provincial Congress , having a week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government should be assumed forthwith , appointed its President , Dr. Joseph Warren , Dr. Church , Mr. Gerry , Col. Warren , Mr. Sullivan , Col. Danielson , and Col. Lincoln , a Committee to make application to the Continental Congress , for a recommendation to take and exercise civil government . Four days after , a letter from our Assembly was addressed , as from the journals of the General Congress , 2d June , appears , requesting the favor of " explicit advice respecting the taking up and exercising the powers of civil government , " declaring also our readiness " to submit to such a general plan as the Congress may direct for the Colonies , or make it their great study to establish such a form of government there , as shall not only promote their advantage , but the union and interest of all America . The inducement set forth was , the difficulties they labor under for want of a regular form of government , and the necessity of raising an army for defence . The letter was read , laid on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee , Rutledge , of South-Carolina , Johnson , of Maryland , Jay , of New-York , Wilson , of Pennsylvania , and Lee , of Virginia , was chosen by ballot to consider the same , and report what in their opinion is the proper advice to be given to that Convention . On the 9th of June the illustrious assembly at Philadelphia " Resolved that no obedience being due to the Act of Parliament for altering the Charter of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay , nor to a Governor or Lieutenant Governor who will not observe the directions of , but endeavor to subvert that charter , the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of that Colony are to be considered as absent , and their offices vacant ; and as there is no Council there , and the inconveniences arising from the suspension of the powers of government are intolerable , especially at a time when General Gage hath actually levied war and is carrying on hostilities against his Majesty 's peaceable and loyal subjects of that Colony , that in order to conform , as near as may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be recommended to the Provincial Convention to write letters to the inhabitants of the several places which are entitled to representation in the assembly , requesting them to choose such representatives , and that the assembly , when chosen , do elect Counsellors ; and that such assembly or Council exercise the powers of government , until a Governor of his Majesty 's appointment will consent to govern the Colony according to its Charter . " Our Provincial Congress , in conformity with this advice , on the 19th of June , addressed the people of Massachusetts , requesting them to choose Representatives to the General Court , to be held at Watertown on the 19th of July following . Such a course may at first sight appear circuitous ; but , gentlemen , your second thought , I believe , must justify its wisdom , as likely to deepen the sympathy of our sister Colonies , and to strengthen the confidence of our own citizens in their new-born government , and to insure their obedience to the necessary hardships of its legislation . Conscience would not enforce payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchy , nor could war be many weeks waged in reliance solely on voluntary contribution . For a moment I desire you , gentlemen , to reflect on the parallelism of circumstances , under which the good people of Massachusetts were thrown upon their resources for adopting a form of government in 1689 and in 1775 . At the former period we had suffered the want of a constitutional administration for a much longer season . Judgement of forfeiture in June , 1684 , had passed in the High Court of Chancery against the glorious old Charter ofthe 4th ofMarch , 1629 . The transaction was , indeed , regular in form , the quo warranto had been issued in July preceding , by order of the Privy Council , in the shameful reign of Charles II . and the notice had been brought to us in October , by Randolph , the wortbiest , because deeply interested , minister of that unprincipled tyranny . In spite of this vacating of all rights under the Charter , our people continued for nearly two years to pursue the old forms of choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xvise government at home , that had nullified all our officers , had forgotten to substitute other instruments of their gracious pleasure , to keep us in unqualified subjection At last , however , it seemed that Massachusetts was worth oppress* ing , and for above two years no Legislature was permitted to sit in the Colony . // Under James II . the tendency to despotism at home became as clear as in the Provinces . Charters were almost universally annulled , and property , the chief object of society , was nearly as insecure in England , where the adamantine barriers of law had been three hundred years building around it , as in Massachusetts , where Andros and a petty junto of associates named by the King , derided all titles to lands granted by towns or General Courts , and boldly absorbed all power , legislative , judicial , and executive . In April , 16*9 , on the slightest rumor of a revolution in the mother country , our people rose in arms , made prisoners of the King 's governor and his few adherents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last popular governor , assistants and representatives ; a convention of delegates from most of the towns having in the interval voted , that the old Charter should be reassumed . Every thing then went on in the former track ; and , though we could not nbtain a restoration of our full privileges , a new charter was granted of so great liberality , that our community acquiesced with slight difficulty in the exchange . Such an example was not the least valuable instruction conveyed to the descendants of these fearless revolutionists . Governor Gage and tke small body of enconragers of the ministry , in the times of our flithers , found , that they had to deal with a people who knew well how to vindicate principles of self-government , and to apply precedents in favor of liberty . Agreeable to the advice of the Provincial Congress , representatives from the several towns assembled on the 19th of July , 1775 , and proceeded to the election of the number of Counsellors authorized by the Charter of William and Mary . The t*ouncil , you will recollect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not well constituted for an Executive body , as it was too numerous , besides the fundamental objection from its confusion of the characters of legislation and administration . No doubt the intent of the Charter was , to give all strictly executive power to the Governor , or , in his absence to the Lieutenant Governor , yet requiring , for certain purposes , the advice and consent of council . But , for the possible case of failure of both Governor and Lieutenant Governor , the provision had been introduced , of which advantage was now taken . In a situation , assumed by necessity , claiming to act only pursuant to a Charter , designed for essentially different parposes , our fathers experienced difficulties and embarrassments . Seven members were a quorum by Charter , if the Governor , or , in the absence of the Governor , the Lieutenant Governor , were present ; but the major part was necessary to execute any such ant , matter , or thing , as the Governor , or , in his absence the Lieutenant Governor could . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this numbor was not easily to be obtained . It was the seventh day of this renovation of government , before such a quorum appeared . Another failure appears in the proceedings of the House , for the Speaker , James Warren , was not approved , as by Stat . George I. ainendatory of the Charter was required . This ceremony would undoubtedly have been adhered to ; had there been any Council in existence to act as Governor . But it would seem anomalous for the House , though by all its subsequent acts it recognized the authority of Governor as existing in this majority of the Council , having just created these Counsellors , to present to them their speaker for approbation . We must consider the transaction as the first step upward from the state of nature ; for the ilouse could not act in election of Counsellors before it had a speaker , though by the Charter it could have no speaker until he was approved . Absolute need of a reel Governor may also be inferred from many natural incidents . He alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act , had full power , without advice of Council , by himself , or any chief commander , or other officer or officers by him to be appointed , to train , instruct , exercise and govern the militia , to lead and conduct them , to encounter and repel enemies , to build and demolish forts , to adjourn , prorogue or dissolve , as he judged necessary , the General Court . By the appointment of Washington to supreme command , and its other acts , the Continental Congress had indeed assumed most of the conduct of the war then raging , and thus relieved us from the awkwardness of having a many-headed leader of our armies . Yet a lamentable want of happy provision for proroguing or dissolving the General Court is seen , when one branch of the Legislature , and that a numerous one , has the sole power over the other . Every mind must be instantly struck with the inadequacy of such a form of government to the people 's need in their novel circumstances . From any judicial decision of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As however all administration of justice was suspended , this would produce no inconvenience for the short time that such state continued . The law makisig power , also , was re // stricted under the Charter , for its acts must all have been sent to England for the royal approbation , and became absolutely null , if disallowed within three years . As full force , however , was given them in the mean time , this difficulty would have proved very trifling , had any conciliation with the mother country seemed probable . It may hardly seem necessary to add , that Independence soon became no less indispensable to propriety of forms , than to the essential rights of the community , and the claims of human nature . These embarrassments may be thought , however , of slight importance , because no conflict would arise about the manner of avoiding them . They might be shaken off , " like dew-drops from the lion 's mane . " But serious difficulties soon grew up from an uncertainty , real or unreal , about the appointing power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times rendered necessary , or from the natural disposition of a more numerous branch t&amp;interfere with the functions of the executive in particular nominations . All the Judges , Registers , Sheriffs , Coroners , Justices of the Peace for the several counties , and Judges of the Superior Court , had in about three months received appointments , in number about five hundred , from the new republican executive , in which no interposition was thought of by the House . But in the latter part of October , a disagreement arose between the two branches , about the appointment ofAttorney-General , and of all military officers , which created some delay in organizing troops , and produced much recriminative argument in messages . These questions are more likely at such times to be adjusted by sympathy than by logic ; and the greater number will perhaps too often be thought right in a revolution , even though the constitution , for violation of which arms are resorted to , should clearly decide the validity of opinions asserted by a less numerous part of the constituted authorities . Patriotism induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power was reduced in these particulars from the large reach of the Charter provisions , to the solemnity of signing commissions . The first motion towards a regular formation of government seems to have begun in the town of Pittsfield , as early as February , 1776 , yet perhaps its petition was not urgently enforced upon that Legislature , whose term of service was , with short adjournments , continued until the near approach of the new political year . Equal duration had been necessary for the Provincial Congress , whose session continued until the 19th of July , 1775 , the very day of the first General Court of the revolution . By this Petition the Court was asked to " form a fundamental Constitution for the Province , after leave is asked and obtained from the Honorable Continental Congress , and that said Constitution be sent abroad for the approbation of the majority of the people in this Colony , that in this way we may emerge from a state of nature and enjoy again the blessings of civil government . " On the 1st of July this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June , " to consider , digest and report a form of government . " At the next session , in September , this committee , whose names we can not learn by reason of the deficiency of the Journals , was enlarged by addition of five members , Col. Orne , Judge Cushing , Mr. Sargent , Mr. Partridge and Mr. Appleton , and two or three vacancies were filled . But the most influential cause that led to a new model of the form of government arose from the great mistake of the first Legislature , in their Act , August 17 , 1775 , " declaratory of the rights of towns and districts to send Representatives to the General Court . " This you may find in the appendix to the volume usually called Ancient Charters , published by our state government some years ago . From this act flowed two great evils , as the whole community soon found ; one , a representation very unequal ; the other , a house exceedingly numerous , as it seemed , being much larger than that to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the rights of the people , which had been infringed upon or restrained by the Acts of Parliament . A most powerful Memorial , agreed on by a Convention of Delegates from all the towns , except Danvers and Beverly , in the county of Essex , assembled at Jpswich , April 25th , 1776 , was presented by a Committee of the body , John Lowell , Stephen Choate , and Col. Daniel Spofford , of whom any two by vote of the following day , were directed to desire to be heard on the floor of the House in support of it . Four days after , the town of Beverly chose a delegate to sign the memorial in their behalf , and the following day the town of Danvers , after full hearing and due examination of said memorial , voted unanimously their concurrence with its sentiments , so that the whole body of the county , then far the most populous in the Commor*wealth , advanced its opinion , when Judge Lowell was admitted to address the House in // its support . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , energetic , and fit to bear comparison with any later exhibition of principles : " If ' representation is equal , it is perfect ; as far as it deviates from this equality , so far it is imperfect , and approaches to the state of slavery ;  --  and the want of a just weight in representation is an evil nearly akin to being totally destitute of it . An inequality of representation has been justly esteemed the cause which has in a great degree sapped the foundation of the once admired , but now tottering fabric of the British empire ; and we fear , that if a different mode of representation from the present is not adopted in this colony , our Constitution will not continue to the late period of time , which the glowing heart of every true American now anticipates . " " In the early period of our settlement , " the Memorial proceeds , " when thirty or forty families were first permitted to send each a representative to the General Assembly , there can be no doubt , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more doubt but that , as just an equality took place in the several corporations of the British empire , when the rule was first established there . That striking , that unjust disproportion , which fills us with disgust and detestation , has arisen in Britain chiefly from the great increase of numbers and wealth in some places of that empire , and a decrease in others , and continued from a blind attachment to the forms of authority in some , and a wicked disposition in others , who found an effectual way to turn this inequality to their own advantage , though to the destruction of the state . " " We can not realize , that your Honors , our wise political fathers , have adverted to the present inequality of representation in this Colony , to the growth of the evil , or to the fatal consequences which will probably ensue from the continuance of it . " " Each town and district in the Colony is by some late regulations , permitted to send one representative to the General Court , if such town or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elect , if of one hundred and twenty to send two . No town is permitted to send more than two , except the town of Boston , which may send four . There are some towns and districts in the Colony , in which there are between thirty and forty freeholders and other inhabitants qualified to elect only ; there are others besides Boston , in which there are pore than five hundred . The first of these may send one Representative , the latter can send only two . If these towns as to property are to each other in the same respective proportion , is it not clear to a mathematical demonstration , that the same number of inhabitants of equal property in the one town , have but an eigktlt part of the weight in representation with the other ? and with what colorable pretext we would decently inquire . " After proceeding to prove by parallel cases from various parts of the country the superior weight of a less proportion of numbers than would be found in the towns which present this Memorial , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " If a new system of government , or any material alteration in the old , is to be in the contemplation of the next general Assembly , is it not fitting that the whole community should be equally concerned in adjusting this system ? The many evil consequences that will naturally and must inevitably arise from this inequality of representation , we trust we need not attempt to mark out to a wise and free House of Americans ,  --  the delineation would be disagreeable as well as indecent . Nor would we arrogantly suggest to your Honors the mode of redress . We confide in your wisdom and justice , and if an equality of representation takes place in the Colony , we shall be satisfied , whether it has respect to numbers , to property , or to a combination of both . " The Memorial being referred to Major Hawley , Mr. Sullivan , Mr. Partridge , Mr. Phillips , Col. Brooks , Col. Freeman and Col. Orne , an Act was passed in consequence , on the 4th of May , materially changing the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new act , towns having two hundred and twenty freeholders and other inhabitants qualified , might send three representatives ; having three hundred and twenty , might send four , and so in proportion . This hasty legislation answered the purpose of curing the evil of inequality , but it increased the evil of repletion . In the new General Court , May 29th , 1776 , the number of representatives was two hundred and sixty , double the amount ever known to vote in the House for one hundred and forty years previous to 1774 . It then seemed excessive , nor could the hall of the State House accommodate such a crowd . Boston had twelve members ; and , on the third day of the session , motiop was made to discharge the members from Boston and other towns , who had sent a larger // number than they were before empowered to elect . Though this motion could not be sustained in the very face of the law passed afew days before , yet great dissatisfaction spread in many parts of the community . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling on the several towns to hold meetings , and consider of the question , whether it was the desire of the inhabitants that the General Court should make a constitution or frame of government . I have seen the returns from one hundred and sixteen towns , but presume that many others are mislaid or lost , among which are those of several of the principal in the state . More than two to one made an affirmative reply ; but the reasons against the measure seem to have been so strong , as to outweigh with the Legislature the voice of the majority . Boston , at a meeting on the lith of October , continued to the 16th , voted , unanimously , nay , giving reasons , because it is a matter of great concerumeift , and requires great deliberation and advice and information from every quarter . Some towns voted yea , if the Council and House should unite in drawing the frame of government ; others , nay , if such union were had , but yea for the House alone . Almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts inland , were decidedly against the measure , on account of the present representation being so unequal , and because , also , it was not chosen for such service . Where dissent was expressed , reasons were usually given at great length . Among those of the town of Petersham , is this ; - " the late alteration of representation must enlarge the House to so enormous a size that it must be very unwieldy . " That General Court had wisdom enough to do nothing more , than to pass on the 5th of May , 1777 , a resolve , which , after reciting , " that the happiness of mankind depends very much on the form and constitution of government they live under , and that the only object and design of government should be the good of the people , are truths well understood at this day , and taught by reason and experience very clearly at all times , " and " that having duly considered the advantages of forming , as soon as may be , a new constitution of government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should recommend the most suitable method for effecting this valuable and important purpose , " proceeds " that it be and hereby is recommended to the several towns and places in this State , empowered by the laws thereof to send members to the General Assembly , that , at their next election of a member or members to represent them , they make choice of men , in whose integrity and abilities they can place the greatest confidence ; - and , in addition to the common and ordinary powers of representation , instruct them , in one body with the Council , to form such a constitution of government as they shall judge bestealculated to promote the happiness of this state , and when completed to cause the same to be printed in all the Boston newspapers , and also . in hand-bills , one of which to be transmitted to the Selectmen of each town , or the Committee ofeach plantation , to be by them laid before their respective towns or plantations at a regular meeting of the inhabitants thereof , to be called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and plantation duly considered ; - and a return of their approbation or disapprobation to be made into the Secretary 's office of this state , at a reasonable time to be fixed on by the General Court , specifying the numbers present in each meeting , voting for , and those voting against the same ;  --  and if upon a fair examination of the said returns by the General Court , it shall appear that the said form of government is approved of by at least two thirds of those who are free and 21 years of age , belonging to this state , and present in the several meetings , then the General Court shall be empowered to establish the same as the Constitution and form of government of the state of Massachusetts Bay , according to which the inhabitants thereof shall be governed in all succeeding generations , unless the same shall be altered by their own express direction , or that of at least two thirds of them . And it is further recommended to the Selectmen of the several towns , in the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their having considered this resolve , and their doings thereon . " As it appeared by the returns , that a majority of the people had , in conformity with this project , chosen representatives with the power to prepare a draft of a Constitution , a Convention of the members of the House and of the Council , then newly chosen , was formed during the first session of the General Court , on the 17th of June , 1777 , when a Committee was appointed of one from each county , and an additional number of five chosen at large , by written vote . With the exception of Dukes and Nantucket , neither of which had then any member present , the selection of the counties was , as follows : Thomas Cushing , John Pickering , // James Prescott , John Bliss , George Partridge , Daniel Davis , Robert T. Paine , Joseph Simpson , Seth Washburn , Jeremiah Powell , John Taylor and John Bacon . The five additional membei*s , James Warren , Azor Orne , Noah Goodman , Isaac G. Stone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , by adjournments from time to time , until the eighth meeting on the 11th of December following , the Committee reported . During this long period , the Committee , which assembled on the 19th of June , having Mr. Cushing for its Chairman and Mr. Pickering for Clerk , appear to have labored assiduously every working day till the 5th of July , and also the twelve first days of September , and two or three days in December , before the report was matured . Of their Journal I have been favored with a copy . When the report was received by the Convention , it was ordered to be printed under direction of the Committee , the printer directed to suffer no copy to be taken from his office , but to deliver the whole , 300 , together with the original , to the Clerk for the use of the members , and that the printer be under oath to print no more than the number aforesaid , and that he break up and distribute the types in presence of one of the Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or suffer a copy to be taken by any person who does not belong to the Convention . We may well be excused for smiling at this anxiety of our fathers to keep so invaluable a secret , as the draft of the fundamental law , which was to control every man , woman and child of this happy community , as well as the stranger within their gates . The Convention adjourned to the 15th of January , 1778 , from which date to the 5th of March , the body was regularly employed in discussion and amendment of the report . It was very materially changed by additions and alterations , of none of which it may seem necessary for me , gentlemen , to speak ; as the result of this grand delfberation was sent out to the people , in the form which you may find i'n the appendix to 2d volume of Bradford 's History of the Commonwealth . Much more interesting to you is the treatment that this long polished draft of the supreme law received from the people . Instead of a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve under which the Convention acted , it was rejected by the proportion of five to one ; and to us , who have enjoyed the felicity of a constitution so much more perfect , it may seem remarkable , how so many as two thousand votes could have been given for its acceptance . An imperfect statement of the returns , embracing those of one hundred and twenty-six towns , from the papers of the father of the present Governor of the Commonwealth , affords me some details . Only a single county , Barnstable , shows a majority , and that very small , in its favor . Unanimous votes were given in four townsfor , and in fifty-seven towns against it . Yet the demerit of this plan would not , I believe , have been so generally perceived , had not the same sagacity , which detected and denounced the injustice of the scheme of representation in the act of August , 1775 , been again calleA into exercise . A Convention of Delegates from the towns of Salem , Danvers , Wenham , Manchester , Gloucester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Topifield , was early holden ; and , after debate , at an adjournment on the 29th of April , they adopted a series of eighteen resolutions , each containing a brief exhibition of grounds of objection . They then appointed a committee to " attempt the ascertaining of the true principles of government , " applicable to this Commonwealth , " to state the non-conformity ofthe Constitution proposed to those principles , and to delineate the general outlines of a Constitution conformable thereto . " At an adjournment on the 12th of May , the committee reported . To this report , then accepted , together with the resolutions previously adopted , is usually given the honored name ot " the Essex Result ; " and I am unable to refrain from calling it the most admirable condensation of political wisdom , that our country , or perhaps any country in so small compass , has ever produced . No man should feel himself authorized to speak definitively of our present constitution , as a whole , without maturely considering this broad foundation of it , laid nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade myself , gentlemen , that no essential amendment of our great charter will ever be urged by the leading minds of our community , without recurrence to its pages for illumination . So scarce , however , is this tract become , that perhaps not one in ten who hear me has been able to peruse it For one or two points , therefore , though not the most valuable , yet the most connected with topics of present discussion , you will , gentlemen , undoubtedly be more gratified with extracts than with my humble remarks . In the last number of the North American Review , an eloquent writer expresses a doubt of the necessity of two houses of legislation ; whether the plan , // uniform in our country in each of the twenty-four republics , rests on " any real ground of expediency or convenience . " To me , nothing , however , has ever appeared so absolutely indispensable to the foundation of a republic , except , indeed , the independence of a judiciary , and this part of the foundation would be likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic , the wisdom of the dead speaks in the Essex Result . " The legislative power must not be trusted with one assembly . A single assembly is frequently influenced by the vices , follies , passions and prejudices of an individual . It is liable to be avaricious , and to exempt itself from the burdens it lays upon its constituents . It is subject to ambition and after a series of years , will be prompted to vote itself perpetual . The long Parliament in England voted itself perpetual , and thereby , for a time , destroyed the political liberty of the subject . Holland was governed by one representative assembly annually elected . They afterwards voted them selves from annual to septennial ; then for life ; and finally , exerted the power of filling up all vacancies , without application to their constituents . The government of Holland is now a tyranny , though a Republic . " " The result of a single assembly will be hasty and indigested , and their judgements frequently absurd and inconsistent . There must be a second body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with firmness , independent upon the first , either for their creation or existence . Yet the first must retain a right to a similar revision and control over the second . " This is the sound doctrine of checks and balances , as necessary , it is usually thought , in the portion of the machine , called the legislative , as in the combination of the whole organs of the body politic . On the question of representation in the more numerous branch , which has always been the most difficult part of our mechanism to adjust , which was not less unfortunately managed by the convention of 1777 , than other portions of its plan , and to which you are compelled by circumstances to give your attention , you will be pleased with the views of this powerful state paper , however hard it may be to reconcile them with our favorite speculations , or the precepts of later experience . " The rights of representation should be so equally and impartially distributed , that the representatives should have the same views and interests with the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act like them , and , in fine , should be an exact miniature of their constituents . They should be ( if we may use the expression ) the whole body politic , with all its property , rights and privileges , reduced to a smaller scale , every part being diminished in just proportion . To pursue the metaphor ,  --  if in adjusting the representation of freemen , any ten are reduced into one , all the other tens should be alike reduced ; or if any hundred should be reduced to one , all the other hundreds should have just the same reduction . The representation ought also to be so adjusted , that it should be the interest of the representatives , at all times , to 4o justice ; therefore equal interest among the people should have equal interest among the body of representatives . The majority of the representatives should also represent a majority of the people , and the legislative body should be so constructed , that every law affecting property should have the consent of those who hold a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good of the whole by the proper judge , the majority , and the necessary consent thereto would be obtained ; and all the members of the state would enjoy political liberty , and an equal degree of it . If the scale , to which the body politic is to be reduced , is but a little smaller than the original , or , in other words , if a small number of freemen should be reduced to one , that is , send one representative , the number of representatives would be too large for the public good . The expenses of government would be enormous . The body would be too unwieldy to deliberate with candor and coolness . The variety of opinions and oppositions would irritate the passions . Parties would be formed and factions engendered . The members would list under the banners of their respective leaders ; address and intrigue would conduct the debates , and the result would tend only to promote the ambition or interest of a particular party . Such has always been in some degree the course and event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After the rejection , by so powerful a majority , of the plan of the convention , submitted in 1778 , the General Court passed on February 20 , 1779 , a resolve , directrng the citizens of the Commonwealth in their several towns , on or before the last Wednesday of May next , to consider and determine the two questions ; " first , whether they choose at this time to have a new constitution or form of govern // ment made ; " second , " whether they will empower their representatives to vote for the calling a state convention , for the sole purpose of forming a new Constitution , " provided the first question were answered affirmatively by a majority . When the returns showed a large majority in favor of these propositions , a resolve passed , June 21 , 1779 , recommending choice of delegates to meet at Camhridge on the 1st of September following . From the hlessed deliberations of that venerable body , then assembled and continued by adjournments to March 2 , 1780 , proceeded our Constitution . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions , and furnishing a key to their construction . An adjournment by the Convention to the first Wednesday of June after , was had to receive the returns of votes from the several towns on the respective parts of the solemn instrument , the body having determined , unless two thirds of their constituents were in favor , to alter the draft in such manner as to make it agreeable to that proportion of the voters . In their primary assemblies , the people expressed by the requisite majority their approbation of all parts of the instrument , and empowered the Convention to fix the time for its incepbion and organization of all its departments . You well know , that this time was the last Wednesday of October in that year . Some who hear me were fortunate enough to live at that time , and what a fund for reflection have they on the wonderful improvements which have attended our social condition in almost uninterrupted succession to this moment . Many of us remember the date of fifteen years , which was in the instrument itself fixed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment* on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution , in order to amendments , and the great degree of unanimity then expressed against any change . For the long trial of your patience , gentlemen , in listening to this minute relation , an apology might he necessary , had not you selected the subject . You planned the voyage , and directed the pilot to transport you through no verdant isles , nor along coasts , where you could be exhilarated by " Sabman odors from the spicy shore Of Araby the blest . " But the expedition will not have been unprofitable , if you return with a just sense of the difficulties of arranging a complex system of civil polity , a grateful reverence for the founders of our admirable Constitution , and a fixed resolution to do what in you lies to perpetuate its principles and extend their blessings . In the government of a state , recollection of old truth is nearly as valuable as discovery of new . Perhaps I ought not to close without modestly urging you to observe , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our affairs , from the earliest date , were those relative to representation . Either inequality in the relative weights , or irregularity in their adjustment , or the unnecessary expense of their pay , has , withjittle exception , been always observable in this part of our machinery , for above one hundred and ninety years . At the beginning , every town was allowed three deputies , but , in five years , the number which seemed too large , when it reached thirty-three , was reduced to two for each . The expense , though it included only the diet of members , was a heavy burden on the treasury , but for several years after the house was not fuller . By the great increase of Boston forty years later , it was permitted to claim one more deputy . In the charter of William and Mary , two were allowed to all towns ; but the right being then granted to the Legislature to fix it for the future , one of the earliest acts was to restrict towns having but a certain number of freeholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston alone four . The several towns paid their own members , as you will find in the statute , passed when all enjoyed equally the privilege of two ; and they frequently exercised but half their power , and sc ? metimes declined its exercise altogether for many years in succession . One of the greatest contests in the House , iii the early times under the new charter , was decided in 1694 , by twenty-six votes against twenty-four , and yet this was about representation . In the agitating period between 1762 and 1773 , you will observe the two parties amount to one hundred and ten and upwards ; but no question ever taken called for more than one hundred and nineteen , exceptonce , when Governor Hutchinson observes upon the magnitude of the interest having drawn one hundred and thirty . In May , 1774 , the last session under the charter , when the reyolution , so long preparing by both mother country and Province , was instantly impending , the complete returns in the journals show one hundred and forty . The first House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fifteenth house , and the year of its being put upon trial by the grand inquest of the people , one // hundred and sixty-five representatives were returned . About as many constituted the House , I think , only seven or eight years since . Equal laws on important subjects were not less likely to be proposed and adopted in such assemblies , than in the great congregation we have sometimes seen within these walls . Twenty years ago I hadthe honor of a right to a seat here , when the representatives were above seven hundred ; and one tdwn favored the Commonwealth with its delegate , whose constituents were so few , that , had an equal proportion through the state been allowed to show equal kindness , the number would have exceeded five thousand three hundred. * A stranger might have been astonished at the manner in which the door-keeper performed his anxious duty , and he would , perhaps , have irreverently said , that the members had been subjected to the treatment , which carcases undergo from the Inspector General of Provisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still mere discordant with the adequate theory of the Republic than this occasional assembly of an unwieldy mass . At one time the local interest , upon which great excitement was felt in Berkshire , which is equal to little more than a twentieth of the state , brings here four times its just ratio of members , if the residue be counted . Six or eight sessions after , the troops of Bristol outnumber all those from West of Middlesex , whose quota for the levy should have been five-fold greater . Partial legislation may be feared in such circumstances . While the expense was kept down by the annual tax-act calling on the sevml towns for the reimbursement of pay for attendance of their members , according to the elder law , and the construction of the Constitution by contemporaneous authority , continued with only a single exception for forty years , the charge on the community of their representation was comparatively small . Should these old instalments be now called in , your empty treasury suddenly swells with an accumluation of five or six hundred thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ; for the argument is very strong , that the member elected by a town becomes the representative of the Commonwealth , and the common treasury should disburse for this as for any other common service . It is a very general sentiment , that , in this particular , our Constitution , if it does not , ought to permit the charge without qualification of repayment . As then the Commonwealth ought to provide for payment of these servants , it has a right , undoubtedly , to regulate the number of servants it will employ . Nobody denies this right , but great diversity of opinion arises on the first proposition for its exercise . One thinks there should be a numerous representation to regard all the interests of this happy Commonwealth , and that one member should come for every fifteen hundred inhabitants ; another proposes the ratio of two thousand ; another , that of three thousand ; another four , and another five thousand . So it is assumed , that one hundred and twenty , one hundred and fifty , two hundred , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the just number of the House of Representatives on the respective bases of mathematical equality . Yet it is quite out of the question to apply this numerical precision between representatives and constituents . And if it were possible , it would be extremely unwise . For if your supreme law fixed the quota of two thousand persons as entitled to one member , hoping that three hundred and five would not be too large , it would be doubled in a very few years . The life of the constitution of the republic is not to be degraded to the standard of human breathing time , of few days and full of trouble . " Let us do honor to principles that will outlive one generation or thirty . When the desirable number of the house is fixed , you know the limits of the Commonwealth can not be extended , though its population may well be quadrupled , and , perhaps , admit of indefinite increase . Of course , you will not believe , gentlemen , that I descend to the impertinence of intruding my private opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature and by the annual communication of the Governor of the State , you are required to give your attention . On a former occasion , some years since , the right was exercised among my equals . How that opinion is confirmed , or weakened , or modified by experience or consultation with others , it would be indelicate to utter in the presence of so many , my superiors in age , in learning , in political sagacity , and every moral and intellectual endowment . One thing you will pardon me for expressing , that however great may be the ability of those before me to exceed any the most devoted services of mine to the Constitution , * In the diminution of the state , by the loss of Mai , ie , the relative weight of HULL has inerea*-ed . Instead of one five thousand three huedred and twentieth , it is now one three thousind and eightieth of the whole . nut it has had no representative siiiee , and , 1 presume , never had before . // none can go beyond me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert , that it is perfect ; but judicious affection would gladly remove the little excrescence , straighten the slight crook , and extract the thorn , which indeed diminishes not its vital strength , though it sometimes awkwardly affects its carriage . Of one thing we may be sure , that no success in binding its limbs , to ensure an unequal growth of one part , and withering of another , will be lasting . This has been attempted , and the ligaments have been burst , like the green withes of Sampson . Equality of rights the people wi , ll have , and wo be to the intriguer who thinks to blind them with a temporary advantage arising from the sacrifice of justice to expediency . The very portion of the community whose local benefit was pretended to be subserved by the offence , would unite with the injured in pouring scorn upon the offender . Artifices to rule a majority by a minority , with the sanction of forms of Jaw , will forever be unavailing here ; they will roll back , like the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake in legislation must be corrected , or ignorance will , in hiding behind it , after its character is exposed , become chargeable as intended deception . For the counterfeiting of a bank note , and the attempt to pass it , after ignorantly receiving , yet now knowing its baseness , you have slightly discriminated in the apportionment of punishment . Clean hands and pure hearts , and no other , are fit for the worship in this temple . If you would have the constitution enduring as the hundred hills of Massachusetts , you must be governed by motives , in administering it , as pure as the breezes of heaven that sweep over them.
