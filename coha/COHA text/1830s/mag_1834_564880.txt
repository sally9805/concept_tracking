txt THE times have sadly changed since the days of our boyhood , or else we are only beginning to open our eyes to the existence of things of which we never then dreamed . Ten years ago , and what young man would not have started up indignant at the mention of a division of these states , and cried , in the language of an eloquent patriot , " What factious demagogue , what ambitious usurper , shall find a place to insert a wedge to sever such a mighty Union . " But now , nullification has stared us in the face till its loathsome features have become familiar ; and we talk calmly of it as of an evil we have happily just avoided , hut which still tl*reatens . Ten years ago , and who would not have repelled , as an insult upon the people , the assertion that a majority of them were prepared to surrender the constitution of the country into the hands of any chief magistrate , who might gain their confidence and command their admiration ? But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Executive usurpation ; we admit that there is but one power in the country ; and we grant that , if the President should choose to react the eighteenth Brumaire , and expel the Senate of the United States from their hall , by a file of soldiers , - there would be hundreds of thousands of voters who would throw up their hats , and - shout , " huzza for the old hero ; down with the aristocrats . " Ten years ago , and who would have foretold so early a division among the people , and the existence of a feeling of hostility between the rich and the poor ? But is not this dreadful state at hand ? is it not beginning to show itself ? and will not the spirit of envy and malice , which the poor begin to manifest toward the rich , beget a returning spirit , which will create a real aristocracy , and which , as sure as fate , must fall by violence before the leveling principle ? // Ten years ago , and who would have foretold that atheism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a God , of revelation , of the divinity of the Savior , of the immortality of the soul , should be publicly denied , nay ! held up to ridicule and abuse ? But now , we find an extensive party , numbering perhaps fifty thousand , who openly and violently assail Christianity , and attack our system of morals ; a party , which employs as its organs five newspapers , sundry periodicals , and whose presses in New-York , Philadelphia , Wilmington , Boston , &amp;c. groan with immense editions of the works of atheistical writers . Writers , whose open and avowed object is the overthrow of the Christian religion ; who deny the immortality of the soul ; who say that " the grand rule of life is to avoid suffering , and procure enjoyment ; and that all good or evil is to be measured by this standard. *** Now , to the calm contemplative man , who thinks with anxiety about the future condition of the country for which his fathers bled , and which his children are to inhabit , these are alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral depravity of a large part of the community , and induce him to inquire into the extent of the evil , and seek for its remedies-if remedies there be . We propose , therefore , to take up but one division of this important subject in this number , and to make some remarks upon the extent and the danger of atheistical doctrine ; upon those who call themselves free-thinkers ; upon the ends which they propose to effect , as a party , and the means which they use to accomplish those ends . We take it for granted , that every reasonable man , be he a Christian or a sceptic , will assent to the axiom , that religion of some kind , is favorable to , if not indispensable for , the order and morality of every large community . To such persons , the question of how large a portion of the population of these United States are firm believers in the truths of Revelation , must be interesting ; and they will be startled , perhaps , when we say that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so large a proportion . Is this doubted ? We point to the two millions of slaves at the south ; we point to the great valley of the Mississippi , one half of whose whole population are unconnected with any religious society ; we appeal to the experience of every man , who has traveled about in stage-coaches and steam-boats , and mingled with the floating part of the population , whose representatives are to be met with there , and in the tavern bar-room . Or we come immediately home to New-England , and ask if a vast proportion even of our population have not their doubts about the truth of revelation . The very fact of the existence of so many different sects , apparently differing from each other in material points , is a powerful argument with ignorant men , and we hear them every day saying , " 0 ! among so many religions , who can tell which is right . " Now , if there are such a number of avowed infidels , and such a vast proportion of doubtful Christians , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity is spreading like wild-fire , and that in fifty years Christianity will be professed only by a miserable minority of male bigots and female fools , " a vain boast ? Before we adopt this conclusion , // let us consider a little the extent of the infidel party ; let us look among our population , and see what materials exist for its continuance and growth . It is idle in politics to talk about the danger of the dogged resolution of Andrew Jackson , or the snake-like winding of Martin Van Buren ; or in morals , to fear the unblushing depravity of Moore , or the base hypocricy and low cunning of Abner Kneeland ; such men can do nothing without the material to work upon , and , unfortunately , the material exists . Upon the extent of this material , we shall speak when we come to discuss the probability of the extension of infidelity ; at present we are to give some account of the party , which has already a " local habitation and a name. ** In the city of New-York there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better name , we shall call congregations , of professed Infidels ; some of their papers have said that they numbered twenty thousand adherents . At Wilmington , Delaware , is another regularly organized congregation ; there are several , of more or less notoriety , in the West ; one in Providence , R. I. and one in Boston . Besides these regularly organized societies , it is well known that professed infidels exist in large numbers in all the considerable towns in the West ; Dr. Cooper states that half of the male inhabitants of South-Carolina are infidels ; and the population of the valley of the Mississippi may be set down as half infidel . We have only to look carefully near home , and we shall be surprised at their existence , where we had not suspected ; Satan is no longer scared by sound of church bells , nor is industry a safeguard against the insidious approaches of the tempter ; for it is stated that more than three hundred infidels are to be found among the inhabitants of Lowell . There are very obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ; but they will inevitably succeed in shaking the faith of a majority of the operatives there , unless attention is given to the subject by the guardians of morals and religion ; for they so address themselves to the passions , and pander the appetites of the young , as to be certain of gaining their ear . In all the different towns in the country , it will be found there are several men of idle habits and loose morals , who have no chance , and no wish for success in any fixed and honest calling , and who are ever ready for the introduction of any thing by which they may gain distinction and profit . Distinction in depravity is better than none ; and as they are generally of a communicative turn , in every body 's shop , and about every body 's business in the village , they make excellent distributors of atheistical and agrarian principles . Now it will be found that such men receive the infidel papers , and from such beginning have small parties or societies of infidels been formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a spirit is breathed through the whole by means of the establishment of newspapers , and the dissemination of infidel tracts and books . The Boston Investigator strikes off two thousand impressions weekly , which are eagerly taken up , read , and handed from one to another . The Free Inquirer of New-York issues also about two thousand ; the Comet has an extensive circulation ; and the atheistical paper at Wilmington , Delaware , circulates about one thousand copies . These are the principal newspapers that are professedly atheistical ; but how many others // are there , which neglect no opportunity of giving a sideway blow at Christianity . Besides these , there are immense editions of atheistical works printed at the various infidel presses , and sold dog-cheap ; nay , they are stereotyped , and , in some instances , great pains have been taken to distribute them gratuitously over the country . In these works , no hesitation is made about sapping the very foundations of society , and sowing discord between the various clftsses of the community . The passions of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up ; nay , the people are told , and the story is rung in their ears in a thousand shapes , that " the laws which govern us are made by the rich , or by their tools , the lawyers ; and we , the people , who are compelled to obey them , have no voice in their enactment . We do not make the laws . We never understand them . They are made for our use ; we ought , therefore , to get rid of them . They are the wicked instruments of oppression , and they must be annulled , or we are a ruined people . " * The poor are taught to believe that the rich are their enemies , and hence , in part , the bitterness of spirit which is already manifested so strongly in this country between different classes ;  --  a bitterness which will turn into wormwood and gall , unless the wealthier classes do something to neutralize it , and strive , by manifesting a real interest in the moral and social welfare of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanor , to win and merit their affections . It is neither wise , nor generous , nor just , to strive , in every possible way , to draw strong lines between the rich and the poor ; but yet it is done ; and the air , the dress , the language , of the rich man , too often confirms the poor one in the idea that he is his tyrant and enemy . See the rich man bargaining with a wood-sawyer-he draws up his figure to a full height , keeps his gloved hands behind him , talks as to an inferior , beats him down to the lowest sixpence , and growls out , perhaps , when he comes for his pay , that his work is not well done , or that his muddy feet dirty his carpet . Now , think you that sawyer goes away the friend of the rich man , or his enemy ? Then consider the way in which female domestics are engaged-how prim and stiff madam sits up in her chair , with her lace cap and broad flounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks strong and able to work ; how she questions her about her life and character ; how she haggles with her about the difference between seven-and-six , and nine shillings a week ; and how she winds up with , " Well , perhaps you will do for me-you may go down in the kitchen and try ; " or , " You wo n't do for me-you are sickly-I do n't like your reference , " or something of the kind . Now , how does that girl consider the lady-as her friend , adviser , and protector ? No ; but her mistress , her superior in wealth , and nothing else ; and when she sees the sums daily wasted in luxury or parade , she thinks of the shilling a week she was obliged to deduct from her wages : she is vexed , and prepared to read with credulity such sentences in the infidel works as these : - " Factory girls and kitchen girls are white slaves ; so are milliners and mantua.makers , // and their journeywomeis and apprentices . Every kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves. * ' * The European system of social helotism never can , and never should prevail in this country . In Europe the castes have been established since the feudal age . The distinction between the classes is perfectly well defined ; the *vorking-man believes it impossible for him to attain a place in the ranks above him , and is content to live and die as did all his fathers before him . But here , the people , though not well enlightened , know something of their rights ; and unless they are granted to them fully and freely , they will take them , and a great deal more too ; and the only way to prevent anarchy and strife is to educate them well , and to raise their moral as well as their intellectual standard . They are now in a transition state , as it were , from ignorance to knowledge ; and must not be left in it , for partial knowledge is dangerous . But we are insensibly wandering from our subject , which was the gradual formation of atheists , infidels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done to a certain degree , and will be done more perfectly by organization of congregations , several of which are regularly established , and proceed with all the order and system of other societies . And what is the nature of the services in these congregations * We can answer the question from personal knowledge ; and will give an account of the public services in the congregation of Free Inquirers in this city . The old Federal-street Theatre has been prepared , and dedicated as a Temple of Reason ; the pit has been floored over , on a level , with the stage ; in the centre is a pulpit , and in the rear of this , flanking it on both sides. , and extending across the stage , are the seats for the singers . The pulpit is hnng with black ; on the front are inscribed , in Greek characters , " KNOW THYSELF ; " and on the drapery overhead is inscribed , in flaming letters , HE THAT WILL NOT REASON , IS A BIGOT ; HE THAT CAN NOT REASON , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS A SLAVE . On the Sabbath , as if iii mockery of those who assemble for Christian worship , the doors of this temple are thrown open , and the congregation begins to collect ; the boxes are occupied , and marked as private pews ; the seats in the pit fill up promiscuously with men and women , and , when the church-bells cease tolling , the services commence . First , the minister rises , and invites the attention of the congregation to the singing of a hymn , which he reads ,  --  say the 97th hymn . The music strikes up a waltz , perhaps , or some quick tune-the singers rise , and sing as follows Gather your roses while you may , Old Time is ever flying ; And that same flower which shines to-day , To-morrow may be dying . Wisely improve the present hour , Be innocently merry ; Slight not the pleasures in your power , Which will not , can not tarry. // 505 Let virtue ever be your guide , While merged in fleeting pleasure ; All other objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must fly , though flowers may fad And pleasure prove uncertain , In pleasure 's path we 11 ever tread , Till death shall draw the curtain . After this , the minister rises , and invites the attention of his flock to the readir*g of a portion of the Bible of Reason ; suppose he begin at the 55th verse of the sixth chapter , where , speaking of the creation , the Bible says " To what end should this god which he fancies light up the sphere aruund him ? If he meant to better his habitation , he must then have lived ' eternally before in darkness . If for his pleasure ,  --  what ' pleasure could that be to god ; were there such , which he could so long have wanted ' . ? Was something lacking to his felicity ? Then he was not happy , to whom any thing could be wanting to his felicity . 56th verse- " Some will say , that these operations of god were for the sake of men . Do they mean the wise ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or for the foolish , ? There was no reason he should do such a favor for those he knew would prove wicked . 57th verse- " Again , what bath the said god by the affair ? since it is admitted that all worldly conditions are most miserable . Or did he make this world and men , that he might have some to worship him ? But what doth the worship of man advantage a god , who , they say , needeth nothing ? Or , , if he respect men so much , that he mad'e the world for their sake , why did he make them frail and mortal ? Why did he subject those whom he loveth to all evils ? ' 58th verse- " It is plain that the notion of a god 's existsnve is founded alone on the impressions which itself bath made on the minds of uninformed men ' . " Or perhaps he selects the 65th verse , and reads as follows " I am ashamed of human imbecility , when it fetcheth divination even out ' of dreams ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopping from bed to bed , dId admonish snoring persons , by whispering to them visions , of what would happen to them shortly . 66th verse- " As . to prophecies and miracles , it may be evinced , every way , that all su'ch lies are the mere preached impostures of priests . 67th verse- " As for d'eath , it is nothing more than the inevitable termination of individual sensation . 68th verse- " That the effect , calledmind , ceaseth , and is entirely discontinued , is manifest ; because , it bath abeginning , and is'proved to be nothing without the body : how great a folly is it to imagine that what is mortal can be immortal ! 69th verse- " As the mind was not before birth , so neither will it be after death : and as , befcre the former , we did not experience any sensation , so , neither after the hitter shall we possess any consciousness ; for , then there will be no longer any touch , or any other sense . 70th. verse- " As . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' body , how should it be exercised after the destruction of that to which it is but an accident ,  --  a compounded faculty ? 71st verse- " All ' fears of hell are vain ; the furies , the devil , . hell , and damnation , are but fables. 72d verse- " Far from us , then , be the credulous faith in heaven and hell , and in those ' lying representations with which the superstitious fanatics think to frighten those whom they regard as not being sufficiently punished by the sense of crime itself and with which they flatter others into an opinion that their virtue is not adequately recompensed by its proper satisfactions here ' . After reading this portion of their scriptures , the minister gives out another hymn , or song ,  --  for their hymn-book contains both ,  --  and the singers strike up , perhaps , the 124th song , which runs thus // Away with melancholy , Nor doleful changes ring On life and human folly , But merrily , merrily sing , so gay , &amp;c . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the nature of which may be imagined from the nature of the source of the texts . The general tenor is to ridicule the Christian religion , to persuade the congregation that there is no God , no future state , and no soul ; in short , to preach the doctrines of the French infidels , but not with the dazzling ingenuity of a Voltaire , or the subtle logic of the Encyclopedist ; not by fair argument , and from established premises ; but by bold assertion , impudent assumption , unblushing falsehood , coarse ridicule , and profane jests. * But we leave the doctrines to future description . We will here mention , as a proof of the confidence with which the infidels look to the prevalence of their doctrines , that in one of his discourses we heard Mr. Kneeland exhorting his congregation not to resort to force in case he should be imprisoned ; " depend upon it , " says he , " it will hurt the cause ; besides , it may cause a struggle in which I may be killed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to die by violence , nor yet awhile ; I hope to live some twenty or thirty years , and die peaceably . I know , " says he , " there is a spirit abroad in the country which cries out for resistance to tyranny ; but , my brethren , keep quiet awhile ; strive to spread knowledge through the country-depend upon it , it will do us the most good , and bye and bye , if the struggle must come , and blood be shed , take ye measures for securing the victory to the right . " After the sermon comes another hymn , and then the congregation is dismissed with the announcement , that " the weekly ball will be held in this place on Wednesday evening ! " In the entry-way is spread a table , on which are paraded for sale a numerous collection of books , pamphlets and tracts , from the Bible of Reason , elegantly bound , for two dollars , down to one-cent publications , abounding with blasphemy , ribaldry , and obscenity . Among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to * We r5ceived the Bible from our fathers as the rule and guide of our life ; we would force no one to adopt it as theirs ; but we would hand it to our children the same revered book which we received ; and how can we do so , when men hold public meetings purposely to insult and discredit it , and when they vend and distribute at the corners of the streets , and distribute through the country , books , containing passages such as these : The Holy Bible " is a string of fabulous contradictions , from the fabled cosnogony in Genesis , to the fabled ( lestruction of the world in the book of Revelations . Its descriptions of a Deity are not only contemptible throughout , but often horrible . He is made to assume all shapes and characters , according to the disposition of the writer of the fabled tale ; and in no instance a higher or more dignified character than that of a tyrant . Taken as a whole , the Bible can not possibly aid the cause of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that can give stability to society , or aid in adding to the existing state of knowledge . A Jewish temple must have resembled a large slaughter-house , such as is connected with our navy victualling-offices ; while the frying and the frizzling of the carcases , and the gormandizing of the priests round the altars , must have resembled a state of cannibalism ! Jehovah is depicted as a ravenous wild beast that delighted in the savory smells of burning fats and frying limbs , and could only be appeased by this perpetual feast of priests ! Such are the laws , such is the God unfolded in this blessed book ! ' It is an outrage upon the present state of knowledge and comparative civilization , that this book should be supported by laws , and propagated by associations and subscriptions . The persecutions which now exist in defence of this book exceed those of all formoer tines in hypocrisy and villany , because science has made such a progress as to pronounce the whole a string of lies , and has render d it impossible for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present day it has no omoral support , and is kept in countenance only by force and fraud .

Boston Investigator press . 1834. // virtue ,  --  a fear of the consequences of crime . They strike at the very foundations of society . Deriding the sacredness of the marriage compact , and describing it merely as an arrangement to be taken up and laid aside at pleasure , their end and aim is to destroy all the relations of family , and all the attachments of kindred , and degrade the social condition of beings , made in the form of humanity , to the promiscuous association of brutes . They pander to the most debasing appetites of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consequences , add new incentives to the gratification of libertinism and lust . The licentious men , and misguided females , who congregate in this temple of iniquity , are furnished by this hoary-headed apostle of Satan with a full knowledge of those ingenious contrivances by which they vainly attempt to cheat nature in its common courses , and relieve iniquity from the punishments which of right wait upon it . Dares he deny this ? We are prepared to prove it , and to show that he merits epithets which we will not use now , lest , perchance , the law should have its due course , and send him to hammer granite among his betters at a neighboring institution , when it might be supposed we attacked a defenceless foe . As for the balls , which are held in the house of worship , they have the appearance of being conducted with a regard to decency ; we have reason to believe , however , that they are made use of as opportunities for intrigue and assignation to a considerable degree ; and we will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , a word for those who own the building in which these orgies are held , where our God is blasphemed , our religion insulted , and all that we hold dear , reviled and ridiculed ; did they , as is supposed , let the building with a knowledge of the purposes to which it was to be devoted ? have they still the disposal of it ? can they , at their will , remove this moral nuisance , this social gangrene , and will they not ? If so , then , be they who they may , rank they never so high for riches , titles , or power , they shall be known ; and the public shall see that we have respect for no person , and fear of no consequences , when attempting to do our duty as watchmen and sentinels of society . We have endeavored , thus far , not to write as religionists of any sect , but have regarded the evil of infidelity as a social one ; we pity , and we hope God may pity , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief ; we complain not of the insults to our religion , but we should be faithless to society if we did not endeavor to point out the danger . The whole tendency of these doctrines is to destroy every thing like morality , to remove all restraints from the passions of the ignorant , and break up the foundations of society by destroying confidence between man and man . This can be proved to demonstration from the most orthodox infidel authors . We will not make any selection of the most atrocious of these writings ; but as a fair sample of them , and as a specimen of the ruinous and antisocial tendency of these doings , quote the following stuff* which would merit no other notice than a smile of pity for the ignorance , and of contempt for the depravity of the writer , were it not put forth in the official organ of an increasing party . // Atheism in New-England . " The clergyman makes a god of his interest , because he finds he can get a good living out of the ignorant poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor man the real truth , that god was matter , and that it was impossible for hire to act in any other manner than he did , how many poor men would go then to hear his nonsense from the bible about father , son , and the holy ghost , or holy spirit ? Not one would go ; they would then rely upon their reason and common sense . The clergyman then would he obliged to obtain his living by honest means , and so would the judges and lawyers , for no man would be so foolish as to go to law , when he saw through the trick of religion , that it was only a finesse of the rich to blind the poor. ; therefore a court of justice would only be a nsisnomer ; it should be called a court of injustice ; for where is the poor man that ever obtained justice from the courts ? If the poor man has little property , is not his case prolonged from term to term , until he is completely fleeced , and divides nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the physician , we see it is his interest not only to cheat the poor out of his reason and senses , as well as the clergyman and lawyers , but out of his health too . Therefore , the moment a poor man catches a little cold , in consequence of his ignorance of the laws of nature , ( being blinded by religion ) he applies to the physician for cure . The physician knows his interest too well not to make the poor man sick indeed . He christens the cold by some hard technical term , and then looks very grave , and , by his nostrums , bleeding , blistering , and mineralizing , keeps him under his hands until he has run up a round doctor 's bill1 and has also broken down his constitution ; then he lets him go for the present , knowing full well he must come to him again for farther fleecing , or to some other sprig of physic . If the poor man had been wise , and studied philosophy , instead of ha ring religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a little attention to his diet . But such is the imposing effect of these three learned professions of law , physic , and divinity , which are all bottomed on falsehood that the poor man finds himself bereft ' of reason , his health , and his property , before he gets half way through life , or knows what true enjoyment is . So much for this foul fiend , religion , which the rich make an engine of for destroying the reason and common sense of the poor . " This effusion , from a low-minded , suspicio*is wretch , who metes to others by his own measure , whose judgernent seems corrupted by the foul vapors which come steaming up from the corroded and noxious cauldron ef his heart , is signed by his name  --  a name that we will not hold up , as he perhaps wishes it should be , to give him a notoriety , ( though it would be like the notoriety of the felon hung in chains , forcing attention by its offensive odor ; ) but we will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our language strong ? so are our feelings ; so ought to be the feelings of every man who has the good , not of his church , not of his religion , but of society and of the human race at heart .

We would not persecute ; we would use neither the fetter nor the sword ; but , let these men go out from among us , or let us go out from among them .

It is the greater , when we consider the currency frequently obtained by such things , and the corresponding good or evil they must be continually effecting . Few persons are probably aware , for example , of the extent to which Pike 's Arithmetic has been used , and even still is ; or some half a dozen others which might be named , including Adams 's , one of the most modern , of which , according to a statement in the author 's Preface , some forty thousands had been printed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authenticated , we suppose , that some of our school-books have been sold in numbers ranging from one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand , within the first ten years of their existence ! The appearance of a new candidate for currency like this , with any thing like specious pretensions , may be deemed , we repeat it , a matter of national interest . It is very evident to us , that Mr. Leonard has not lost sight // of these considerations ; nor yet of another circumstance , equally interesting to the cause of education ,  --  that , in the crowd of these candidates for the lucrative public favor of which we have spoken , there must be something rather remarkable in the character of a new one , to give it much prospect of a profitable rivalry with its fellows . A fresh Arithmetic is not the imposing phenomenon it once was . It must not only advance claims to improvements of some sort over its predecessors , but it must sustain them too , sooner or later . It must endure examination . Slovenly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is not Mr. Leonard 's . It is evident on every page , that great labor has been spent upon it , and that of no blind or dull description , but by a mind impressed with clear views of the subject , and accustomed to make its industry tell to some good account . Not that this Arithmetic contains a large proportion of new matter , or proposes many original ideas . We should at once have doubts of its value suggested to us , if it affected any such thing . The improvements it seems to us to present , are those of greater convenience than show . Mostly , they must needs be matters of arrangement , rather than of substantive innovation . MeAdam was not the first man who used broken stones in road-making . He used them in a slightly different manner from others ; but he altered the whole face of countries by the change . Mr. Leonard has done something , we think , to . Macadarnize arithmetic . The chief merits of his book may be soon stated . Many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we mean to express its character in respect not merely to details , but also to system and order , prevailing coherently throughout the work . Intended , we presume , for the use of common schools , it assumes that the learner is able to read ; and beginning at this point , it goes on from one subject to another in a manner which appears to us eminently rational and natural . Every principle is explained , either by simple questions preceding the statement of it , so that the pupil reasons it out for himseW or by the discussion of an operation performed at length in figures . To do this , or attempt it , more or less , is a common practice ; but the extent to which these explanations and illustrations accomplish their object , must of course depend upon each author 's skill . In this work we consider them to be unusually practical , simple , and clear . These , as all teachers well know , are important points . Brevity is another , and this too has been studied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great embarrassment of youthful minds . Others have attained the merit of // brevity too often at the expense of clearness , - sometimes omitting matter in fact indispensable to the complete comprehension of the subject , and perhaps for the sake of introducing what is , to say the least , of doubtful value . Mr. Leonard 's book is remarkably free from these faults . Where it is really necessary , he uses as many words as other authors , but very seldom where it is not . Let us take one specimen . A rule has been adopted in many of our most respectable courts of justice for computing interest when partial payments have been made . In the New York Chancery Reports , this rule is thus stated by Chancellor Kent ; - " The rule for casting interest , when partial payments have been made , is to apply the payment , in the first place , to the discharge of the interest then due . If the payment exceeds the interest , the surplus goes towards discharging the principal , and the subsequent interest is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the payment be less than the interest , the surplus of interest must not he taken to augment the principal ; but interest continues on the former pril ) principal until the period when the payments , taken together , exceed the interest due , and then the surplus is to be applied towards discharging the principal ; and interest is to be computed on the balance , as aforesaid . " Thus we find this rule in the recent Arithmetics . Mr. Leonard seems to us to have gained much and lost nothing by expressing it as follows " Cast the interest to the time when the money paid shall at least be equal to the interest , then discharge the interest from the money paid , subtract the excess , if any , from the l ) rincipal , and cast the interest on the new principal as before , and so on . " His management of interest may be referred to as a specimen of his style . Generally the scholar carries off from common treatises no single simple rule that will really serve the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commits to memory , - a number of half-formed ones , none of which proves available in the end , and he finally gets to performing the operations in question by a process which he owes to his own unaided common sense . The Numeration in this work , the statements of all the simple rules , and the method of proving certain operations ( as multiplication ) , may generally be compared with corresponding portions of common treatises , much , we think , to the advantage of the former . This is a recommendation which applies to details . A more comprehensive one is deserved by the arrangement at large . The author 's study has evidently been , to make this such throughout that one subject would naturally call up another , introducing us from each to each by an obvious and pleasing // gradation ; so that any article , as Fractions , Decimal Fractions , Federal Money , &amp;c. when once discussed and explained , instead of being laid aside altogether , is made to recur practically , - not , as it were , intruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This merit would seem to be indispensable ; but , as we have before hinted , authors have attained to it mostly but in imperfect as well as widely-various degrees . For example , Mr. Leonard 's first rule in Decimal Fractions is for changing a common fraction to a decimal . All the treatises have such a rule . It is as easily explained in one place as another . Now the position of it is important , and herein is the difference between the arrangement before us , and others which occur to our recollection . In them it is placed at the end of Decimals . Here , coining first , its principles can be employed in addition , subtraction , &amp;c. , of Decimals , which follow it . Thus the pupil has the advantage of reimpressing an important process upon his mind , at the same time that he performs an operation similar to those which occur in the actual practice of business , and so reminding him of the real utility of the rule . So , in most of the treatises , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many rules must be given , and a long article appears . In the work before us , the subject comes after Decimals , and every operation in it is performed by reference merely to them . So , in Compound JVumbers , where Fractions are to be applied to them . Mr. Leonard here has inverted the common order . In ordinary text-books , possessed too of much merit , the arrangement makes it necessary to crowd part of Compound JVumbers into Fractions ; and hence follows omission as well as repetition , with a needless enlargement of the volume , and confusion of the pupil 's mind . Our meaning will be understood by a reference to Reduction of Fractions , or of Decimals , in the common treatises and in Mr. Leonard 's . Percentage is another case in point , and there are many more . We specify these merely as illustrations . The form and name of that ancient stumbling-block to novices , the Rule of Three , are retained as usual . So are the old distinctions generally , which on the whole we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were it nothing more , need occasion no inconvenience . It is perfectly easy to do so , and yet thoroughly work the old processes over anew . The learner , in this book , is led on through the subject in question with a good deal of tact . Much reliance is placed on examples , to be performed by the pupil , and these are of all conceivable varieties which may be of use to him . // At the same time nothing is solved by algebraic proportion ; and in this point the author agrees , so far as we recollect , with Colburn alone . The reason is clear enough . It costs the pupil more to simply state the examples in such a form , than it does to perform them without any statement at all . Nor do many persons , in actual business , make any statements in proportion , in similar cases . They work , in fact , just as it will be seen Mr. Leonard has led his learner by his right explanations to do . It is obvious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rule of Three , which hardly admit of being stated in proportion at all . This is an instance of judicious omission ; and there are many more such , though the treatise embraces , we believe , all the modern improvements in Arithmetic , which deserve to be so called . Position , Permutations , and Combinations , are among these omissions . The two last are algebraic subjects , of limited utility , and not to be explained in arithmetic . The first is wholly useless . One of our popular authors acknowledges this in his preface , though he still inserts the article in his book , apparently from mere deference to hab it . Mr. Leonard would perhaps have made a good exchange , in rejecting all these Rules , had he only gained by it the insertion of Specific Gravity which is of utility , and the writing out of Mensuration , and the Mechanical Powers , without the customary mutilation . These articles contain much matter of real value , especially to young mechanics ; and , though an arithmetic is not a treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , observed in many other cases as well as this , of furnishing in his book all the matter which is really wanted by the class he writes for in actual ordinary life , and which is not to be had from other sources . Every mathematical subject of prime necessity , in fact , belongs to an arithmetic , and so does every important branch of business which contains mathematical calculation . After all , we have but the simple elements of mensuration given here . They occupy little space , though obviously applicable to surfaces and bodies so extensively , that the intelligent student can hardly fail , after making himself master of these principles , to measure correctly any thing which is likely to come in his way . So among the Mechanical Powers , we have a description of the second kind of lever as well as the first . For this a good reason exists . The second is in common use , perhaps as much so as the first . And yet we do not now remember any other // instance of its finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is usual to give a rule for finding the capacity of a cask in ale and wine gallons only . In this treatise it may be measured in bushels , or in imperial gallons ; the latter of which , at least , is of some moment , inasmuch as this measure is exclusively used in Great Britain , and , to some extent , ( like the bushel measure , ) in our own country also . Such , generally , is the practical character of the work ; and we consider it no small merit . Other illustrations of it occur to us in the excellent little department devoted to Book-Keeping , adapted to popular use , to business-forms , to the divisions of the dollar , as adopted by auctioneers , and to the account of the moneys in which the value of small articles is usually named in the various parts of the United States . These may look at first like trifles ; but it is trifles like these which make up , in the aggregate , the real availability and true worth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statements last named ,  --  not to say every reader of newspapers . Probably the least indispensable part of the work is the article on Foreign Measures , Weights , and Moneys , being chiefly intended for one class , the merchants ; but it is obvious , that a remark like that just made respecting domestic information equally applies , as regards these other matters , to every person who would consult foreign histories , or travels , or even a common journal . The leading recommendations of Mr. Leonard 's book , then , are its simplicity , clearness , and practical character . More can scarcely be said in favor of such a work . We ought , however , to mentioi* , that not a few cases occur of the correction of long-established errors , especially in the form of rules , some of which , popular as they have been and still are , must frequently be productive of most incorrect and inconvenient results . A striking instance of this kind will be found in Mensuration . At the same time , the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few errors in the answers here and there , and there are some cases , where the author has relaxed a little from his rigorous principle of making things perfectly plain to the most indifferent understanding . For example ; " Per cent . is a contraction of the Latin per centurn , which signifies per hundred . " But these are trivial things , easily corrected in another edition.
