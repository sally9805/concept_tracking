As performed at the Chesnut street Theatre  --  Philadelphia . PREFACE . A large portion of the Deformed was written as early as the year 1825 , when an unsuccessful attempt was made to introduce it upon the stage . About a year ago , at the request of a favorite performer , I was induced to revise my almost forgotten manuscript ; it was brought forward , and its reception was such , as leaves no cause to regret that I followed his advice .  --  The play is in imitation of the old English drama , and the outline of some of the characters may be found in a coarse comedy , by Deckar . Mr. Dunlap , of New York , built his Italian Father upon the same comedy , which will account for the occasional similarity between this production and that excellent drama . The first scene , in the fourth act , is modelled upon a scene in the Italian Father , and the incident of Beraldo seeking the Duke at the palace , to chastise him , is imitated from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen short of my original , may safely proclaim it without fear of contradiction . In submitting the following scenes to the press , I must beg the reader to bear in mind that they were written rather for the stage than the closet , and that many passages which are vapid in perusal , prove effective in performance . The Deformed is intended as an acting play , and as such its merits and defects are to be tested . R. P. S. Philadelphia , May 1 , 1830 . DRAMATIS PERSON . Duke of Florence Mr. Wemyss .

Outside of a Palace  --  Time  --  Sunrise . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a morning , Claudio , to tempt Jove from his Ganymede , but , bright as it is , a plague of this early rising , say I. My head pays for it . By my knighthood , if I were but Phoebus ' charioteer , the duke would not have had such a morning as this for his merry making . I get up with clouds on my brow . Clau . Claudio His grace is early abroad to celebrate the anniversary of his wedding . Lodo . Lodovico Men rise by times who have been four years married , signor , and this day completes that term of his probation . I have reason to remember the time , for on that day the wings were clipped of two as brave spirits as any here in Florence . They could never soar above the earth since . I mean his grace and poor Beraldo . Clau . Claudio What , Beraldo , whom the late duke married , on compulsion , to count Trebatzo 's daughter ? He was a wild blade , was he not ? Lodo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And though he was then high in favor at court , he has been travelling crab fashion ever since . O , it ' s a straight and easy course from the top of the hill to the bottom ! Poor Beraldo , once fortune 's favorite  --  now lies in prison condemned to death for a mortal wound inflicted on one of the roaring boys in a duel . Clau . Claudio What was the cause of their quarrel ? Lodo . Lodovico Faith , I know not , but ' t is said they found it at the bottom of a flaggon of wine . Many a fight lies perdu there , signor , and Beraldo was one who would drink to the dregs , but he would come at it . The young duke once was of the same stamp also . Many a roaring set-to have we had together ; there was music in the trio , but they have changed their merry note since their marriage . Clau . Claudio Here comes the duchess and her party .  --  She is indeed a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the world , while he alone knew where the sandal pinched him . Clau . Claudio I have hear 'd that she 's of a jealous temper . Lodo . Lodovico So much so that his grace can not stir a foot from her girdle without being catechised . He has no more freedom than her hawk when he flies hoodwinked with a string to his leg . So much for matrimony . Enter Oriana , Viola , Eugenia , Adorni and others . R. H. Ori . Oriana Good morning , gentlemen . The sun is fairly up . Where tarries his grace , the duke ? We should have been in the field an hour since . Claudio and Lodovico court Viola . Viola . Viola You are fond of falconry , my lady ? Ori . Oriana And thou too girl , and hast , I perceive , but little mercy on thy quarry .  --  Signor Adorni , sets the wind right ? Shall we have sport to day ? Ador . Adorni I know not , my lady . Those sports that depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to promise . Ori . Oriana What , splenetic , while all around are smiling ! Eugenia , look to thy husband . Thou'rt to blame , girl , for suffering him to go to large in such a humour . Lodovico , seek the duke and hasten his departure . Exit Lodovico.  --  R. H. Ador . Adorni Apart . Her scoff ! You see how it is , Eugenia ! Eug . Eugenia Mistake her not . She did not mean to wound you . Be more cheerful . Enter the Duke , followed by Lodovico.  --  R. H. Duke . Duke of Florence I fear I have made you wait , love . Ori . Oriana Your grace was not wont to be the last . Duke . Duke of Florence Now then to horse , and let us spur on until we overtake time . Ori . Oriana That requires swift steeds , my lord . Going . Enter Astrabel with a paper , meeting them .  --  L. H. Astra . Astrabel I pray your grace 's pardon , and beseech you read o'er this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in haste ; prithee , good woman , take some other time . Astra . Astrabel Did'st ever know a time unsuited to a gracious deed ? Read it for mercy 's sake . Duke . Duke of Florence I am in haste . Astra . Astrabel So are the hours that bear Beraldo to the scaffold . Duke . Duke of Florence Beraldo !  --  Go on before . Lodovico attend the duchess ; I will but read and follow . Lod . Lodovico Put on yellow , my lady  --  that letter 's from a mistress . Ori . Oriana Oh ! sir , you can not make me jealous . Lod . Lodovico True , I can not , but perhaps the duke may . Exeunt all but the Duke and Astrabel.  --  L. H. Duke . Duke of Florence Are you Beraldo 's wife ? Astra . Astrabel That most unfortunate woman . Duke . Duke of Florence I am sorry these storms have fallen upon him . The remembrance of former friendship still dwells strongly with me , and if it appear that in fair fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his life . To-morrow I will seek your house , and bring , I hope , joyful tidings . Direct me to it . Astra . Astrabel I will enquire here , at your palace gate . Duke . Duke of Florence Not so . Astra . Astrabel In truth , our dwelling-place would shame your highness . Duke . Duke of Florence So poor , too . What now ? Enters Lodovico.  --  L. H. Lod . Lodovico My lady asks if your grace is coming . Duke . Duke of Florence Ride softly on before ; I 'll overtake her . Lod . Lodovico She vows by hawk , and hound , and horse , she will not on a foot without you . Exit Lodovico.  --  L. H. Duke . Duke of Florence I come , I come . To-morrow I will see you . Commend me to Beraldo . She is going . One word more . You are count Trebatzo 's daughter ? Astra . Astrabel I once did call him father , but now , such rude spots of shame stick on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daughter . Duke . Duke of Florence Thou wert his favorite child  --  and does he nothing for you ? Astra . Astrabel All he should . When children start from duty , parents may swerve from love . He nothing does , for nothing I deserve . Duke . Duke of Florence Shall I endeavor to restore you to his favor ? Astra . Astrabel Oh ! my lord ! you may restore my husband from the jaws of death  --  but to restore me to a father 's love ; O ! impossible ! impossible ! Bursts into tears . Exit .  --  R. H. Duke . Duke of Florence It shall be put to trial , notwithstanding . She is fair and seeming virtuous . How is this ! the count Enter Trebatzo.  --  L. H. Trebatzo in the vicinity of the ducal palace ! then miracles have not yet ceased . Treb . Trebatzo ' T is now sometime since I stood in the sunshine of the court , and I did not suppose that your grace would remember so slovenly an attendant as old Trebatzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends should be unto us as our jewels are : valued as dearly , being locked up and unseen , as when we wear them . Treb . Trebatzo Nobly said . It does my old heart good to see your grace , at least once in a twelve-month , and that is my business abroad so early . Duke . Duke of Florence And trust me , I rejoice to see that the winter of life has not yet chilled your blood . The sickle of time hath gone over you , but you are still the same . Treb . Trebatzo Fields are mown down and stripped bare , and yet they wear green coats again . Duke . Duke of Florence Scarce can I read the stories on your brow which age has written there . Treb . Trebatzo My brow is somewhat furrowed , my lord , but my heart shall never have a wrinkle in it , so long as I can cry " hem " with a clear voice , and look in the face of my fellow creature with a clear conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ! Treb . Trebatzo Happy ! O ! yes . I am not covetous ; I am not in debt ; have fought by the old duke 's side , but I never cringed at his feet . No man I fear ; no man I fee . I would not die like a rich man , to carry nothing away , save a winding sheet ; but as a just man , who leaves an unspotted name behind him , and like the swan goes singing cheerfully to his nest . Duke . Duke of Florence I repeat it , you are happy , and doubtless make those around you so . Your wife and children . Treb . Trebatzo My lord !  --  I have no wife  --  no  --  children . Duke . Duke of Florence Is your wife dead , sir ? Treb . Trebatzo Yes ! but she is still with me . Here ; she 's here . Pointing to his heart . When a knave and a fool are married , they walk together like bailiff and debtor ; and when death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never parted . Duke . Duke of Florence You had a daughter too , sir , had you not ? Treb . Trebatzo O , yes , and have her still . Adorni 's wife .  --  Thou knowest her . The pride of your court ; the solace of my age . Duke . Duke of Florence I meant not her . A younger daughter , if my memory fails not . Treb . Trebatzo With emotion . O ! my lord ! this old tree had another branch , and but one more growing out of it . It was young , it was fair , it was straight . I pruned it daily , dressed it carefully , kept it from the wind , helped it to the sun ; yet for all my skill in planting , it grew crooked . The fruit it bore was bitter . I hewed it down ! What 's become of it I neither know nor care . Duke . Duke of Florence Then can I tell you what 's become of it .  --  That branch is withered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duke of Florence Her name , I think , was Astrabel . Her husband 's  --  Treb . Trebatzo Curse on him  --  name him not . Duke . Duke of Florence She is dead . Treb . Trebatzo Ha ! dead ! Duke . Duke of Florence Yes ! what of her was left , not worth the keeping , e'en in my sight was thrown into the grave . She 's turned to earth . Treb . Trebatzo Would she were turned to heaven ! Peace be with her ; blessings be on her grave . Dead ! Is she dead ! well , well , I am glad o n't ! No drunken reveller will now at midnight beat at her doors . The grave will protect her from pollution  --  ' t is well . She will sleep now  --  and in her grave , sleep all my shame and her own , and all my sorrows and all her sins . Duke . Duke of Florence I am glad to see you are not marble . Treb . Trebatzo O , sir ! this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is hot , scalding hot , and the heaps of ice about my heart , by which a father 's love was frozen up , are now dissolved to tears . My poor misguided child , I feel too late that I am still thy father . But she is dead . Duke . Duke of Florence Your unnatural rage is dead , and the better feelings of your heart have resumed their dominion . an is not man until his passion dies . Your daughter 's frailties are dead , but still she lives , graced with every virtue , while poverty and despair are the sole companions of her fire-side . Treb . Trebatzo She lives then ? I am sorry I wasted tears upon a wanton ! but my handkerchief shall drink them up , and water wash out all again . Is she poor ? Duke . Duke of Florence Trust me , she is . Treb . Trebatzo ' T is well . It should be so . ' T is ever thus with creatures of her trade . Duke . Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trebatzo Seven winters have wasted away since my doors and my heart have been closed against her . Duke . Duke of Florence Your doors , but not your heart . Treb . Trebatzo Yes , my heart , the heart she trampled on .  --  Nay , plead not for her . You know not what it is to be deserted by a favorite child . Duke . Duke of Florence To crown her woes her husband lies in jail condemned to death . Treb . Trebatzo Let him hang ! One half of her infamy will then be out of the world . Curse on him ! ' T was he who first taught her to taste poison . Duke . Duke of Florence But your daughter . Treb . Trebatzo She is no longer mine . Duke . Duke of Florence You are now beyond all reason . Treb . Trebatzo Then I am a beast . Sir , sir  --  I had rather be a beast and not dishonor my creation , than be a doating , fond , indulgent father , and hug vice to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is one who may forgive her  --  I trust he will  --  but for me  --  I can not , I can not . Duke . Duke of Florence Fare you well ! I will no farther touch you . Exit .  --  L. H. Treb . Trebatzo Alas , my girl ! art thou poor ? Poverty dwells next door to despair ;  --  there is but a thin and broken wall between them . Poor Astrabel ! I have kept thee from my heart too long ; but thou hast now rushed in and filled it to the overflowing . Yes  --  I will go to her . Shall a silly bird peck her own breast to nourish her young , and a father see his child starve ?  --  That were hard . The pelican does it and shall not I !  --  But how shall it be done ?  --  I have it  --  She shall drink of my wealth as beggars do of the running stream by the highway , nor think of the source whence it flows . Exit . SCENE II . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  L. H. Adorni . Adorni So wealthy and so beautiful , you say ? Clau . Claudio The fairest maid in Florence . Trust me , sir , She needs no gloss that fortune can bestow To make a king turn suitor .  --  Such a one , That were another planet to be formed , Might be transplanted to the firmament , And outshine Venus . Adorni . Adorni Of what age , good Claudio ? Clau . Claudio Neither a bud , nor yet a flower full blown . Adorni . Adorni All things are beautiful ! Clau . Claudio How now , Adorni ! May not a man commend his mistress ' charms Without offence ? A reigning belle , ' t is true , Might have some cause to frown at what I 've said  --  But thou hast none . Shake off this peevish humour . Thou art not jealous that my Viola Should share my heart with thee ? What ails thee , man ? Adorni . Adorni I look abroad , and all that strikes mine eye Is beautiful . E'en things inanimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ;  --  the flower we tread upon Betrays the labor of the skilful hand That fashioned it . The sky is glorious Passing all wonders . The birds that cleave the air , Are beautiful in plumage and in form . The living sea , when warring with the sky , Making its weapons of the works of man , That float upon its bosom , is sublime . The countless things that grow beneath its surface , Though made for man 's use , seldom meet his eye , Are moulded in a form to yield delight When brought to view . The principle prevails , In heaven , earth , air , and to the caves of ocean  --  All things are beautiful !  --  Nature has lavish 'd , with unsparing hand , The choicest gifts upon her meanest works ;  --  But , in her boundless prodigality , Not one has fallen here . I  --  I alone , Move through this world of vast variety , A species in myself  --  disown 'd by all !  --  As ' t were a foil to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scoff of man . Clau . Claudio Thou wrongst thyself to entertain such thoughts ;  --  Nature has been to thee most prodigal . Thy birth is noble , and thy fortune great ; Thy mind accomplish 'd and thy taste refin 'd . Adorni . Adorni True  --  fortune placed me on a giddy height , That all might gaze and wonder , and become . However base , contented with their state . The starving beggar as he craves an alms . Receives it from my hands  --  and thanks his God . That he was not thus stricken and deform 'd : Returning pity for my charity . My taste , you say 's , refined . Is that a thing To be rejoic 'd at , since it teaches me The grossness of my own deformity ; To hate myself and execrate my race ? Clau . Claudio Out on you ;  --  this is madness . Adorni . Adorni My mind 's accomplish 'd !  --  True , with patient toil , I 've studied night and day to make my own Th ' accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive My wasted carcass . Yes ; my mind has been  --  A fire that feeds on all within its reach , And then consumes itself for lack of fuel . But what of that ! who estimates the mind In this base world where earth alone can prosper ? Fools with fair forms . though sterile of all good , As the parch 'd desert , mount upon our necks And are proclaim 'd the master works of heav'n ; While those who 're gifted with th ' ethereal spark That lights them to explore the universe , Are pass 'd unnoticed as the senseless clod If cursed with such deformity as mine . Clau . Claudio All do not judge thus blindly . Thy fair wife Gave proof of this in making choice of thee . Ador . Adorni Yes , she gave proof of more than this when she Made choice of me . Clau . Claudio For shame ! I blush for you . Ador . Adorni Twelve months have scarcely passed since she was priz 'd The treasure of the court  --  the cheering sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . Ay , from my lady 's page E'en to the duke , there was not one but felt Most honor 'd when he had the grace to touch Her shoe-tie . The young Duke himself ne'er met her Without smiling and kissing his hand to her . All eyes were turn 'd upon her as she mov 'd Like some bright comet that no cloud obscures While all the firmament is hung with mourning . And yet , though worshipp 'd thus , she fixed on me . As if I 'd been Apollo in his prime . And why was this ! say , was it natural ? Clau . Claudio Thou art resolved to prove it otherwise By showing what thou art . Ador . Adorni Oh ! woman , woman ! Whom gownsmen sagely call the greatest good Bestow 'd on man , though ancient records tell How thy first fatal act ' mid Eden 's bloom Entail 'd damnation on the heirs of heaven ;  --  By what name shall I call thee ! . Clau . Claudio Why this bitterness ? Ador . Adorni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to a wife As pure and spotless as the virgin snow That falls at midnight , when the frozen moon Has crystalliz 'd the world . Ador . Adorni Ah ! say you so : then thou shalt try her virtue . Clau . Claudio Fie , fie ! . Ador . Adorni Thou shalt . Clau . Claudio Pray fool yourself no farther . Twice you 've sway 'd me To this disgraceful office : Twice you 've sway 'd me To this disgraceful office : Twice I 've wooed her , And by the bright unspotted cheek of truth She is  --  Ador . Adorni A woman . Clau . Claudio Chaste as Dian 's self . A perfect crystal that betrays to view The slightest flaw within it . Ev'ry act Is open as the mid-day sun , to all , And challenges the closest scrutiny . Ador . Adorni When the dark Alisander leaf looks greenest The sap is then most bitter . Clau . Claudio Still suspicious ! Ador . Adorni Look on me , Claudio !  --  Can it be possible She loved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ador . Adorni Try her again  --  but once more I beseech you . Clau . Claudio On this condition , that you stand ear witness Unto our conference . Ador . Adorni Peace , peace , she comes . Lovely enough to rouse your eloquence . Retires  --  R. H. Enter Eugenia.  --  L. H. Eug . Eugenia My husband is not here ! Your pardon , sir .  --  Going . Clau . Claudio Nay , do not shun my presence , fair Eugenia . Oh ! turn again , though from your arched brow You pierce me with the arrows of disdain . Eug . Eugenia Have I not twice repell 'd th ' impetuous storm Of thy incessant rudeness ? Why again Insult my feelings and degrade thyself , By giving birth to thy unholy wishes ? Adorni is thy friend , and is it thus That thou repayest him the love he bears thee ? Shame on thee , Claudio . Clau . Claudio His cold neglect Must plead forgiveness for my tenderness . Eug . Eugenia His cold neglect ! ' T is false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adore him . And if he should , were that sufficient cause That she neglect herself ? Clau . Claudio Look on him , Madam , Nature has been so niggard in her gifts That he deserves not , surely , to engross Thy matchless beauty . Eug . Eugenia Thou popinjay ! That such a daw should peck at illeg . And chatter of the bird that cleaves the heavens Is monstrous . " Look on him ! "  --  Look on thyself ! But I forbear.  --  My eyes were open , sir , When I made choice of him , and I preferr 'd The strong wing 'd bird of Jove , to that of Juno . Thou'lt say ' t was strange , and wonder at my taste , But such it is , and I shall never mend it . Clau . Claudio He can not love thee , Madam , as I love .  --  See , on my knees  --  Eug . Eugenia False man , begone . To parley longer with a wretch so base Would lead thee to suspect I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say ! Exit .  --  L. H. Ador . Adorni ( Coming forward . ) She 's mine , she 's mine , heart and soul , Claudio ! A shrewd tongue , faith . Clau . Claudio Well , sir , what think you now ? Ador . Adorni The world may boast a woman strictly honest Without the course of nature being changed ; And my fair wife , I 'm fully satisfied Would freeze e'en glowing Phooebus with a frown . Clau . Claudio Heav'n send you keep in this mind , at least Till the moon changes . Ador . Adorni Ay , good Claudio ; Till the sun burns out and the stars are blotted From the face of heaven . O , she 's mine , she 's mine ! Clau . Claudio A husband of the right stamp . Well , now to see the lovely Viola , And then , to woo and wed her . Ador . Adorni Viola !  --  O , I remember now . Was she not of the Duke 's party this morning ? Clau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to Ludovico and look closely ; Or rather break your chains .  --  A painted puppet , As fickle as the wanton winds , that kiss Alike the carcass and the blooming rose ! Clau . Claudio Your language is too harsh .  --  Though vain , imprudent  --  She is most strictly virtuous . Ador . Adorni As Casar 's wife !  --  Pshaw ! Claudio ;  --  But say no more , thy folly plainly shows The greatest curse that man can labor under Is the strong witchcraft of a woman 's eyes . Exeunt ..  --  R. H. END OF ACT I. ACT II . SCENE I. A chamber meanly furnished . Enter Beraldo.  --  L. H. Ber . Beraldo At length I am in my own castle again , as free as nature made me . How light I feel . No shackles on my limbs now . The heels of Mercury are not more supple than my own .  --  Why Astrabel , ho ! wife , where art thou ? Enter Astrabel.  --  R. H. Astra . Astrabel Who calls ?  --  O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms .

Cheer up , I have had enough of watery eyes in the prison . Smile , smile , wife , I have friends at court , I am free , I shall soar , I shall fly high again , fly high ! Astra . Astrabel Beraldo ! Ber . Beraldo Is it possible that these limbs ever danced in fetters ! That this buoyant spirit was ever dampened by the atmosphere of a prison ! That instead of nature 's beauteous works I was doomed to behold misery and despair , and the only sounds that greeted my ears the groans of the wretched , the clank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars ! But , that is past . I breathe pure air again , and it is to my soul as refreshing as wine , and I leap forth into the world a new born man . O , ' t was a glorious world till laws were made to curse it , and hood-winked Justice took her daily rounds to trample on the feeble . Astra . Astrabel Beraldo . Ber . Beraldo What sayest thou , sweet one ? Astra . Astrabel Couldst thou not make a mirror of thy prison and therein view the unsightly scars thy name and fortunes bear . Ber . Beraldo Faith , Bell , I need no glass to see them . Astra . Astrabel Then in viewing mend them . Ber . Beraldo A plague !  --  Have I turned my back upon a jail for this !  --  Postpone thy lecture to some fitter time . Dampen not my wings now . I shall soar again .

Astrabel Thou knowest too well Beraldo , and too dearly hast thou paid for thy knowledge , with the loss of wealth , and time , and fair fame . O , my husband , could'st thou be content with our humble home , thou wouldst here find a friend more faithful than those who pledge themselves in drunken oaths , and praise thee for thy failings . Ber . Beraldo I do believe thee ; and I protest to thee I will turn over a new leaf , but let me fly once more that I may feel that I am free . Knocking . Who 's there ? Astra .

When with full sail he floated along the sunny stream , he loved me , and now that the tempest has risen and his fortunes are wrecked , I 'll cling unto the ruin and act the pilot until the barque goes down , and gladly will I perish with it . Enter Beraldo and Trebatzo , the latter disguised .  --  L. H. Ber . Beraldo Come in I pray you . Would you speak with me , good fellow ? Treb . Trebatzo Is your name signor Beraldo ? Ber .

The mother 's own face !  --  May the destinies spin a long and even thread of both your lives  --  I have not forgot that face , though the beauty of her cheek hath , like the moon , suffered strange eclipses since I last beheld it .  --  Crosses to Astrabel . Gentlewoman , the last man I served was your father . Astra . Astrabel My father ! any tongue that sounds his name speaks music to my heart . Welcome old man , thou good old man ! How does my father ? Has he health ? does he think of me ? does he speak of me ? but alas ! I have so much shamed him , so deeply wounded him , that I scarce dare speak the tender name of father .

Let them weep themselves away an they will , for at thy time of life , thou canst see but little in this world worth looking after . Treb . Trebatzo True , true , and that little makes them weep the more .  --  Signor . I have a suit to you . Ber . Beraldo Well , what is it , grey beard ? Treb . Trebatzo I have a mind to serve your worship . Ber . Beraldo To serve me ! Good fellow , I do not think that will serve your purpose .

But ' t is not so with me . My white head is no inn for such a gossip . I do not want money , sir , thanks to my old master ; though we did fall out at last , I would do him justice . Astra . Astrabel Didst love thy master ! Duke . Duke of Florence As myself , lady , and for the love I bear him I wish to serve you until such time as he shall be reconciled . Ber . Beraldo Damnation ! The love you bear Trebatzo is no passport to cross my door . Begone ! Astra . Astrabel Beraldo , look at his grey hairs .  --  Remember he is poor and friendless . Ber .

Load not the back already broken ; take not the crutch from the decrepid . Ber . Beraldo Never fear , Bell . Thou knowest me better . Treb .

Kind heaven preserve his life and mine , until I again deserve , and receive his blessing . Trebatzo turns away and wipes his eyes . Ber .

Viola . Viola I also Have been deceiv 'd ; thou'rt not the man I thought thee . Clau . Claudio In what , pray , am I changed ? Viola . Viola I did suppose the gallant Claudio Would have defied the devil and all his works , But lo ! he 's frighten 'd at a petticoat , And dreads the witchcraft in it . Is this manly ? Clau .

Claudio Faith I should be If that same maid were dress 'd in hose and doublet . Viola . Viola Yet , as she is , thou hast as much to dread From her as from Lodovico.  --  For shame ! Art yet to learn , that there are human things That were intended for no earthly use But to cut capers at a lady 's elbow , Dangle her fan , sometimes draw off her glove , And run her various errands that are deem 'd Too trifling for a lackey to attend to ?  --  And whose ambition never soars above Holding her farthingale on holidays , To keep it from the dust !  --  Out on thee , sir !

Viola So , thy note is changing !  --  But saidst thou not , thou wert resolved to be My fool no longer ? Clau . Claudio Said I so ? Impossible !  --  As long as I may be a fool with thee I envy not philosophers their wisdom . Viola . Viola I thought you would recant . Come in a moment , I 've much to say . You hesitate !

Adorni That ' t was base  --  Base in the depth of baseness , for this friend . So honor 'd , and this frail one , so belov 'd . To work my ruin . Eug . Eugenia O , my husband ! O ! Ador .

But yesterday , for some imagin 'd wrong , He challeng 'd me to mortal fight , yet came not We staid beyond the hour , and still he came not . Believing some mistake , of time or place . The cause of this strange bearing in a man Noted for true courage , we sought him at The Count Adorni 's house .

Oriana To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her possession ? Reads . " To my soul 's idol . " Why . this is the duke 's own writing ! Lodo . Lodovico And therefore designed for you , lady ; for , as she remarked , a faithful husband can have no other idol than a loving wife .  --  An apt conclusion , made from close observation of nature . Ori . Oriana ' T is well . I thank you for your service . You can go . Lodo . Lodovico So the duke is fairly trapped . This matrimony , I find , resembles somewhat the religion of the old Romans  --  every man must confine his devotions to his household lar , or his home will soon become too hot to hold him . Exit .  --  R. H. Ori . Oriana Opens the letter . Why , what a strain of cloquence is here ! Cupid himself was sure his secretary , and the very ink was dropped from Venus ' eyes . To me he never wrote thus ! Oaths , promises , and jewels . enough to tempt a vestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that the world trampled on as if beneath its notice . What excellence must dwell in that bosom ? Ha ! here comes the duke ! I will no longer conceal from him the knowledge I possess , but tax him home with his perfidy . Enter Duke .  --  L. H. Duke . Duke of Florence Aside . So , still some symptoms of a storm remaining ! My gentle Oriana , I am charmed to see that the clouds that hung around thy brow this morning have dispersed , and that the light of thy sweet face breaks forth again . Ori . Oriana Your grace is courteous . I find you are as gallant after a lapse of four years as upon our wedding day . Duke . Duke of Florence More so ; and trust me , the wife 's to blame if the husband 's gallantry does not improve with time . Ori . Oriana But often it increases to such a degree that it can not be confined to a single object . In that case , who is to blame ? Duke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her business to keep her husband to herself ; and if she neglect it , the fault lies with her . The point is clear as noonday . Ori . Oriana That is man 's sophistry ; woman would reason differently . Duke . Duke of Florence Would she not rather permit her passions to decide , than go to the trouble of reasoning at all upon the subject ? Even the gentlest are at times thus borne away . Confess now , Oriana , you did me wrong in your suspicions of poor Beraldo 's wife . Ori . Oriana I confess that I did Astrabel injustice , and am sorry for it . Duke . Duke of Florence She was a petitioner for her husband 's life , and you would not have me close my ears to mercy . Ori . Oriana Certainly not , even though a beauteous woman were the advocate ; and she is a peerless one . Duke . Duke of Florence I begin to think so , and am anxious to see her restored to her former station . Poor thing ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ori . Oriana You have found that out , sir ? But let us dismiss her , and turn to a subject more grateful . Your present has been received . Duke . Duke of Florence My present ! Ori . Oriana And I commend your taste . I knew not till now that you possessed such rare judgment in jewels . True , you chose a strange way of presenting them , but still they are valued as a testimony of your gallantry and love . Duke . Duke of Florence I am in the dark ! What mean you , Oriana ? Ori . Oriana This casket will explain . Produces the casket . Duke . Duke of Florence Confusion ! Ori . Oriana You have seen it before , my lord ? Duke . Duke of Florence I think I have . Ori . Oriana Rich as the jewels are , they are much more lightly prized than the impassioned letter that accompanied them . Duke . Duke of Florence The letter ! Ori . Oriana Produces the letter . Read for yourself . There is honeyed poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord , my lord ! Duke . Duke of Florence Can it be possible ! Whence had you this ? Ori . Oriana From a source you little think of  --  " Your soul 's idol ; " far worthier of your love than you imagined , for though surrounded by poverty , and having neither fame nor friends to lose , she has with scorn rejected your shameful overtures . Duke . Duke of Florence I beseech you let not passion carry you beyond reason . Ori . Oriana My lord , my lord , attempt not to palliate ; think of the baseness of the act . Beraldo was your friend  --  trampled on by a scoffing world . One word from you would have changed their scoffs to praises , and yet , so far from feeling compassion , you attempt to rob him of the only good he has remaining , and make him poorer than the poorest . Shame ! O , shame ! Better , my lord , were it to be without power , than thus to use it to oppress the fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence Hear me but speak .  --  She 's gone . So , the storm is fairly raised , and heaven only knows when it will pass over . A noise without . What means this disturbance in the palace ? Enter Beraldo.  --  L. H. Ber . Beraldo Off , ye , sycophants and slaves . ' T is not the first time my foot has trod upon this pavement ; though ye have forgotten that , this time shall be remembered . Duke . Duke of Florence Beraldo here . Ber . Beraldo I could not longer rest patiently under the weight of the obligation that your grace would confer upon me , and have come to express my gratitude . Duke . Duke of Florence Name it not . Ber . Beraldo Pardon me , I must , and in such terms , too , that no mistake may follow . Are you acquainted with yourself , sir ? Duke . Duke of Florence Thoroughly . Ber . Beraldo I am sorry for it , for I must say it is a disgrace to the Duke of Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Florence Scoundrel ! Half unsheaths his sword ,  --  pauses , and sheaths it again . Ber . Beraldo That was the word , but since it is not sufficient to rouse your courage , hear more .  --  There was a time when I stood by your side your equal in the world 's eye , in the proudest faculties that nature bestows on man . Our names were linked together on the public tongue , and the one could not pass but the other followed . Our hearts it seemed were also joined , until your father thought fit to lay the axe at the very root of my growing fortunes , discard me from court . and disgrace the man whom he once delighted to honor . And why was this ?  --  Because I was not wholly devoid of the frailties of my nature . From that hour the faces of all were turned against me , save those who were too low to be sunk lower ; and Florence became as a strange land . Years passed away , and my nature was changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you also knew that a single word from your lips would have raised me to life and hope again , and yet you had not the humanity to breathe that word . Duke . Duke of Florence Beraldo . Ber . Beraldo I have not done yet . Your neglect stung for a moment and was forgotten . I placed you to the account of things created to be despised , and cared not again to look at the offensive page . Your grace was forgotten until this day you condescended to visit my humble roof , when your well seigned friendship awakened feelings that for years have slumbered in my bosom . For a moment I felt towards you as I did in happier days , but soon I discovered that the seeming angel who came to solace the feeble and the wretched , was an arch devil , who , under an assumed shape , would have basely stolen the only remaining good the malice of the world had left me . Duke . Duke of Florence Will you not hear me ? Ber . Beraldo I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , sir , to my advocate , touching his sword , well satisfied that his sharp argument will place the beggar and the prince upon a footing . Draw and defend thyself , if a life like thine be worth defending . Draws . Duke . Duke of Florence Beraldo , are you mad ? Ber . Beraldo I can not but remember there was a time when you would as soon have leaped into a den of hungry tigers , as to have offered me this day 's insult . True , you presumed upon my outward change , but to thy cost thou'lt find me still the same within . Defend thyself , I say , while I teach thee how a knave in purple and gold may be put down by honesty in rusty velvet . Presses on the Duke . Duke . Duke of Florence Ho ! there , without ! Enter Lodovico and others , who seize and disarm Beraldo . Ber . Beraldo Are these your princely tricks ? The ducal crown has made a noble fellow of you . Duke . Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A duke , a duke , but no man , no man , by heaven ! Exeunt .  --  Beraldo led off .  --  L. H. END OF ACT IV . ACT V. SCENE I. The Prison .  --  Adorni and Eugenia discovered .  --  Beraldo lying at a distance on the floor . Ador . Adorni And can you then forgive me ?  --  My glad heart Leaps at the sound of thy sweet voice again , Unmindful of its weight of guilty sorrow , And I could gaze upon thee thus forever , Till my wrapp 'd soul had joyfully assum 'd Thy form and purity , most fit for heaven . Speak , speak , belov 'd , O ! let me hear thy voice ! Say you again forgive me . Eug . Eugenia Joyfully ! Thus will I ever hang about thy neck , In prison or in palace . Ador . Adorni Hear her , ye saints , And gain another virtue from her truth , Beyond what poets , in their fondest dreams , E'er sung of woman ! Ber . Beraldo Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nought in life like bitter suffering for sweetening our natures . Grief mends the heart , good sister . Eug . Eugenia If so , thine would have been perfect long ere this . Ber . Beraldo Nay , mine was broken past mending . Ador . Adorni Beraldo.  --  Ber . Beraldo What says the little mirror of honor ? Ador . Adorni We have never known each other . Ber . Beraldo Well , ' t was no fault of mine . I was familiar enough , heaven knows , to encourage you . Rises . Ador . Adorni And had I not been blind with pride , I might have perceived , that beneath the rough outside you assumed , there was a noble , generous , and feeling heart . Ber . Beraldo Feeling !  --  The shafts of the world have been shot at it until it is one entire wound . Feeling ! Ador . Adorni And can you forgive me the shaft that I have thrown . Ber . Beraldo It hit the mark , signor , but I forgive you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud heart has deigned to ask it . Ador . Adorni Your hand .  --  Ber . Beraldo In tears , boy ! No words could speak as eloquently as those silent tears ! Still you were right , Adorni . I know the worth of a fair name , and I was once as proud of mine as any he in Florence , until it was stolen from me , and banded about by the foul breath of cut-throat rascals ; and then , in self defence , I scoffed at those who suffered their actions to be biased by a name . But no matter ; my scoffing is over , and my name , such as it is , is quite good enough for a gibbet . Eug . Eugenia Despair not yet , Beraldo . Ber . Beraldo O , I shall fly high to the last . But poor Astrabel , who will feel for thee when I am gone ? Condemned in the sight of the world ; fallen in thine own esteem ; cast off by those who should love thee ; who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Duke . Duke of Florence What madness , count Adorni , urged you on To bear the weight of Claudio 's punishment ? Ador . Adorni Compassion for the friend my madness injured . Duke . Duke of Florence And injured innocent what brings you here ? To Eugenia . Eug . Eugenia He 's still my husband , though your grace did part us . Duke . Duke of Florence It then would grieve you that the insulted law Should separate you ? Ador . Adorni O , sir , but for that , We have no earthly grief , no earthly fear . Eug . Eugenia Rather than leave him now , I 'd undergo The sharpest woes that e'er awaited mortal . Duke . Duke of Florence You shall redeem him at an easier rate . Walks to the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mystery ? Ber . Beraldo Court tricks , I 'll warrant you . Court tricks I know him . Ador . Adorni He ever loved her . Ber . Beraldo I have heard as much . But for that matter , Jove himself you 'll find A very Joseph , when compared to him . Ador . Adorni She starts ! Ber . Beraldo And well she may ; the knave 's a startler . Duke . Duke of Florence Consider it . The holy link that bound Your fates together has been rashly severed . He therefore has no reason to complain , His life being purchased by a trifling toy He reckless cast away and did not value . Eug . Eugenia Do not insult me , on my knees I pray you . Ador . Adorni Wretch , stay not longer here , or I may do An act of bloody justice , that shall teach Reptiles in office , the bruis 'd worm they tread on May turn and sting . Ber .

Virtue is folly now , Since no one gives you credit for your virtue . Ador . Adorni Patience , kind heaven , I 'll do a murder yet . Duke . Duke of Florence Yield to my wishes , and my love shall place you Where e'en the proudest matron in all Florence Might crown the boldest flight of her ambition . Ador .

Tarry one instant longer , and we prove Which is the better metal . Ber . Beraldo Bravely said , Your grace will take the hint  --  my wrongs are fresh , And though unarm 'd , trust not too far to that : I 've still the weapons mother nature gave , And feel disposed to use them . Duke . Duke of Florence Lady , farewell . Reflect on what I 've spoken ; bear in mind Adorni 's life depends on your decision . Exit .  --  R. H. Ador .

Lodovico The lady Astrabel at court ! most welcome . Astra . Astrabel Ah ! signor , you were my husband 's friend in happier days , forget it not in his adversity . Can you bring a wretch , so fallen as I am , into the presence of the duchess ? Lodo . Lodovico I can , and gladly will attend you . Astra . Astrabel And yet I tremble to appear before her .

Astrabel Did you deliver the casket to her , and that silly message ? Lodo . Lodovico I did as you desired . Astra . Astrabel I can not but reproach myself for having planted a pang in her gentle bosom ; but indignation at the duke 's conduct , and the hope that she might turn him from his evil course , and still retain his friendship for my husband , impelled me to take a hasty step which my cooler judgment condemns . Lodo . Lodovico Doubt not the event . Permit me to attend you to the duchess . Astra . Astrabel Thank you ; my tears thank you . I have nothing left but tears . Heaven will reward you . Exeunt .  --  R. H. SCENE III .

Signor Adorni , Since thou hast rashly ta'en upon thyself , In stern contempt of justice and ourselves , The punishment imposed on Claudio ; Although our kinsman , and a valued friend , Do not presume upon our blood or friendship To ask for mercy . The insulted laws Must be appeased , although they rend in twain The bleeding heartstrings of the upright judge . Ador . Adorni I bend not here for mercy . I should spurn Life , if thy gift . So thou mayest freely take That , thou wouldst make a heavy curse by sparing . Duke . Duke of Florence Still obdurate . Ador . Adorni I still retain the pride that nature gave me . Eug . Eugenia Do not provoke his rage , for my sake do not . Ador . Adorni Let the pale coward shrink who fears to die , And tremble if a sceptred knave but frown ; But he that 's weary of this pageant life Can laugh to scorn the impotence of man . Duke . Duke of Florence There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tongue that names it . Ber . Beraldo Fly high ! A man of my own heart . Fly high ! By heaven I love thee , pride and all , Adorni . Duke . Duke of Florence What says the lady ? Eug . Eugenia Hear me , in mercy hear . Duke . Duke of Florence Am I contemned then ?  --  To the scaffold with him . Eug . Eugenia Alas ! Adorni , do I bring thee death ! Ador . Adorni Grieve not for me ; for I had rather meet Death clothed in all variety of terror , Than live to see a spot upon thy virtue . Eug . Eugenia Then we will die together . Clau . Claudio Hold ! Throws off disguise . Omnes . Omnes Count Claudio ! Clau . Claudio Here , take my forfeit life , and spare my friend . Ador . Adorni How , Claudio ! This sacrifice for me ! Clau . Claudio I owe it to myself and to the world .

Duke . Duke of Florence For thy sake , and thy father 's , chaste Eugenia , We 've tented to the core thy matchless worth , Which , like pure-gold , unharm 'd , has undergone The fiery trial . In proof of our opinion , We now restore thee to thy former rank , And all the favor that was lately thine . And since thou'rt parted from that wayward man , And hast the power to make a happier choice , Whoe'r you honor with your hand , we promise Shall meet from us the marks of special favor . Ador .

And feel with all a woman 's gratitude The boundless debt I owe for what thou'st done , To vindicate my fame so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , If I prefer my husband 's lowly fate To all thy princely power can lavish on me . Ador . Adorni I never knew her till this trying moment . Duke . Duke of Florence Signor Adorni , dare you question still This wrong 'd one 's virtue and Count Claudio 's truth ? Ador . Adorni I dare not raise my head : shame weighs me down . My heart is smitten , and my pride is gone . To think that my unworthiness had gain 'd The love of two such beings , and to think That I dared question the decrees of heaven , And murmur at my fate while I possess 'd Its choicest gifts , strikes to the very soul . But my distemper 'd mind at length is purged , And all things now appear in their true colours . Duke . Duke of Florence And thou in thine . As the harsh sentence passed On Claudio was teeming with injustice , We here revoke it ; and again restore To him th ' enjoyment of his former rights . Clau . Claudio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Trebatzo And swear truly And yet it is thy father 's face , Beraldo . Ber . Beraldo Where will this end ! It was my daily prayer My poverty and shame might be conceal 'd From Lord Trebatzo 's eyes , until the grave Had made me reckless of what foot trod on me Yet he has witness 'd all my abjectness . The strong convulsions of my tortured soul , When it ran riot in its agony , And deem 'd no eye look 'd on in cold derision . I would that had been spared me ! Treb .

To lead th ' apparent rover from his course .

Rushes into Trebatzo 's arms . Duke . Duke of Florence No more of jealousy , my lovely Oriana . Ori .
