Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : CHRIST HEALING THE SICK . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1834 ) Giver of health and life , Where , but to thee , can pain and sorrow go , Amidst the weary strife , The fitful fever , and the maddening throe , Which wring the bosom in this world of woe ? Oh thou , of all , the meekest and the best , Where , but with thee , can the sad heart find rest ? Calmly thou standest there : The temple 's arches vast are swelling round : Thy presence fills the air With holy radiance and with peace profound , And bids an influence , as of hope , abound ; On thee the languid eye in trust is turned , Where late the baleful fires of frenzy burned . On thee the mother bends Her tearful glance , and checks the rising sigh Which on her hope attends , As to the Lord she draweth fondly nigh , And meets the light of his benignant eye ; She clasps her breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus  --  and is blest . And they who linger near , With friends in sickness yet more fondly loved  --  Betwixt a smile and tear Gaze on the Saviour , and with faith are moved To see the wonders of his kindness proved ; Around his robes they cling  --  the faint revive  --  The stings of pain are quenched  --  the dying live . The face , that wore but now The settled paleness of the suffering hour , Reclaims its healthful glow ; The red lip , faltering , speaks of heavenly power , While crystal tears descend  --  a grateful shower ; Watering the damask cheek , that changed so soon , Like some fair lily to a rose of June . ' T is done ,  --  and from the crowd Sweet voices , filled with joy and thanks , arise  --  The healed ones sing aloud ; And like rich incense , soaring to the skies , Ascend the anthems of their glad surprise : The lame , the blind are healed , the sick restored , And with rejoicing hearts they praise the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1808-1841 : DEPARTURE OF THE ISRAELITES FROM EGYPT . from Poems , in The religious souvenir ( 1834 ) The dawn was grey in Egypt . Broken clouds , In long and wavering companies , o'erhung The realms of Pharoah and the land of Nile , Tinct with the crimson of the coming morn . Faint hues of struggling light enwrapt the piles , The pillar 'd halls , and domes , and columns huge , That with ambitious effort seemed to pierce The chambers of the sky , and rest in air . Red rays were on the pyramids . Their tops , Companions of the clouds , did seem to wear The orient lustre from their borders flung , As in rich troops they caught some radiant smile , Won from the golden fountains of the sun . A murmur rises from a gathered throng Of bright rejoicing youth and reverend age , A band , with groups and trains diversified , And of dim length immeasurable :  --  afar , Beyond the bases of high pillars old , The throng is wandering on , heavy and slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , as with measured strength the living tide Rolls its long masses on , the man of God , Moses ,  --  the servant of the mightiest King , Whose rule is through immensity from heaven ,  --  In solemn grace , and mein majestic , stands And views , with tranquil glance , the impressive scene . Onward , still on , they move ;  --  the weary eye No end to the long column can discern  --  But something like a cloudy fire is seen , Hovering afar , ' twixt Migdol and the sea . The morning seems to pause  --  and wavering rays That play on wreaths of mist , high in the East , Appear to tremble ' gainst the envious bars That check the lingering glory of the dawn . A voice , as of command , through the deep air , Above the countless throng is heard to move , And the whole plain is motion . As they tread In grateful temper on , a song , out-poured From lips and hearts unnumbered , seems to rise As the broad concourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the heaving main , From the bitter curse and the bondsman 's chain ; From the taunts of the vile and the proud we go , To the land where rich honey and milk will flow ; Where the smile of God on our homes will lie , Like the calm , pure light of a summer sky ; We go , where peace in our hearts may dwell , We bid to the region of plagues farewell . II . " We haste from these borders , where now the wail Of desolate mothers is on the gale ; The cries of the first-born in death we hear , Fainter they wax on the pitying ear ; The yearning bosom , whose sighs are pour 'd O'er the dreamless sleep of the unrestor 'd  --  These are the sounds in this gloomy land , So late by the wings of the tempest fann 'd . III . " We go , though the journey be long and sad , To a clime where the mourner will soon be glad ; Where the waters are sweet , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green ; We may faint in our languor , as on we tread , On the cold earth pillow the weary head ; But our God hath spoken  --  we trust his word , We have heard the voice of the living Lord ! IV . " He will guide us onward , whose mighty hand Scattered cloud and blight over Egypt 's land ; Whose glance unobstructed surveyed it round , When fire and hail smote the desert ground ; When the locusts swept through the upper sky , And drave the light from their course on high ; When they sank , like poison , to blast the spring , To destroy each tender and vernal thing . V. " He will bear us on ! We shall rest at last , And , in peace , look back on our journey passed ; Upon perils averted , on blessings shed , Like dews of eve on the mountain 's head ; The Lord will temper the midnight gale , He will guard our feet from the scorpion 's trail ; From fiery serpents , from drought and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI . " We will praise his name , in that goodly land , Where tend the steps of this lengthened band ; Where the pomegranate ripens , and strays the vine . Where the olive-leaves bloom in the bright sunshine ; Where the voices of waters and waving trees Are rich on the fragrant and blessed breeze : That promised land as a type is given Of the regions of glory and life in heaven " W.
