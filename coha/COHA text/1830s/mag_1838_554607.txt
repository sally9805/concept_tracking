txt Or late years , we have seen much attention directed towards the obscurer portions of English literature , for the purpose of bringing whatever was valuable into notice again ; and in addition to this , the lives of many celebrated writers have been diligently investigated to recover the smallest relic , or to find grounds for some new argument or construction , that might render our idea of the men more precise and just . This zeal is for the most part to he taken as a sign of literary activity and love of truth ; though at times it may betray an unreasonable distrust of old reports and opinions , and an officious readiness to disturb long-received impressions . The effect has certainly been , that writers , whose fixture in the world 's memory seemed immovable , have been brought before us for judgment as if they were but of yesterday , and have occupied a place in journals and in conversation , which seems most proper for those of our own time , and whose pretensions are not yet determined . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the characters of distinguished men , we shall probably find that the pnfavorable judgments of them , which we had inherited from their contemporaries , have gradually been mitigated ; while those who have been remembered chiefly for their good or great qualities stand just where they did in common opinion , notwithstanding the discovery of serious flaws in their characters , and the novel and powerful arguments that have been employed to give fresh pungency to their known faults , and thus unsettle their dominion . The moral aspects of this result are important ; but we must pass them by . One effect of such investigations , though it be not always contemplated , may be noticed as soniewhat to our purpose . It is , that our interest is increased in many an established writer , whose claims , as we have never dreamed of disputing or defending them , may have less place in our thoughts than they should . This interest is likely to be effective and practical , by drawing general attention to the past and present condition of literature and authors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instance but in one particular , if in the lapse of years false habits of thought or composition have crept in , and productions marked most of all by // monstrous originality have possessed the public mind , we may hope that a fresh acquaintance with our ancient favorites will check the prevalent irregularity and extravagance , and restore the moderation of truth without repressing a healthy spirit of enterprise . In offering some observations upon the Periodical Essays which constituted the most brilliant and popular form of prose composition in the early part of the last century , we need not say that it makes no part of our object to give them , were it in our power , a notoriety they have lost ; for we do not know precisely what their present state is , or whether they have much declined from the high favor they once enjoyed . As we grow older , we certainly do not become more competent judges of the present standing of books that were the delight of our youth . We may not hear the Spectator and Guardian , Addison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coverley as frequently and heartily named as when we were forming our taste in English literature , and laying up in memory some precious allegories , scenes and characters , which we were not to lose , or suffer to fade , through the longest and most varied experience of life . But the old must remember that they themselves speak but little of these cherished writings . The time has long passed , when they met to cite their favorite passages and interchange their recent opinions and feelings , and when the world of letters was as new to them as that of life and nature . Let us presume , then , that though not one of even our old school-books be now in use , and although the number of new miscellaneous works for daily consumption is far greater than that of Queen Anne 's time , yet that the periodical essays of her reign are still a part of our domestic reading , and not merely an indispensable ornament of the library . Though they can not be quite so exhilarating now as when the just printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , was laid upon the Londoner 's breakfast table , and fourteen thousand copies every morning scarcely served the demands of the kingdom , we will however suppose that they still have the charm of an old family classic , and that all are willing to have some recollections of them revived . We shall enter hut imperfectly into the spirit and importance of these papers , unless we form some idea of the state of society at the time . For we are not to suppose that they were written by a set of literary men to make a sensation by // showing their genius and taste , and upon subjects suggested by their course of study or particular turn of fancy . They were specially intended from the beginning , and the purpose was never forgotten , to hear directly upon the society and the men of the day , upon existing evils and wants , to meet a present emergency and to work a social reform . The state of manners is for the most part made sufficiently clear by the essays themselves , and need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , and literary , of the halfcentury from the Restoration , has set it apart for special reprobation in English history . We speak of it as blighted . It seems a monstrous exception , and not of use even as a warning . The corruption and its continuance are with difficulty traced to an adequate cause , and followed out to those usual good effects which , in the order of providence , are permitted to spring from evil . An English writer but a few months since included that age in a period which he considered as the most vicious that the world had seen , since the corruption of the Roman emperors was chastised and crushed by the invasion of the northern barbarians ; and , contrasting it with our own age , he speaks of " the delicacy of moral feeling now that would render it impossible for the most vulgar-minded of living English public men to accept from a foreign power such bribes as a Russell , a Sidney , a Marlborough received without any apparent consciousness of disgrace . " And he next designates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manners , that forbids the remotest allusion in female society to topics familiarly discussed by and with the wives and sisters of those great men . " * If this be stated truly , we must prepare ourselves to surrender more than one of the few names , which we had been accustomed to honor as exceptions to the age , and as redeeming it from the reproach of utter shamelessness . A few particulars may be mentioned to show what sorts of public and private evils the periodical essays were intended to mitigate or remove . It was , first , an age of bitter political strife , religious intolerance , and fierce foreign wars that were closely allied with the domestic dissensions . These contests at home were not of the kind we ordinarily expect and rarely dread in free communities . Those divisions among men , which usually pass under the name of parties , seem to us at this dis * Foreign Quarterly Review , No . XXXVII . Art V. // tance like the rising up of whole orders against each other . The passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called public . The points in controversy were no less than a change of dynasty , a change or restoration of the constitution , the overthrow of the established church , the silencing of dissent . It seems as if the whole community were made up of cavaliers , puritans , republicans , lovers of th church , lovers of papacy , all in battle array for some public object , all filled with a sense of burning wrongs or a dread of sudden fall from eminent station , and intermingled with the idle and desperate who find their opportunities in the general trouble and confusion . And this idea is the more forced upon us , as we see few if any of those softening influences in operation , - those , for example , of a refined , popular , and easily accessible literature , - which invite all to seek some interval of retirement and repose , when they may think for themselves , and get loose from the thraldom of public questions and agitations . From such a state of things , and this mutual distrust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , and something of a tragical cast even in the dissoluteness of the times . But it was remarkably an age of luxury , frivolity , and licentious wit , and of skepticism or relaxed devotion , save in the humbler classes , who were sure to be derided for the singularity of their virtue . In the next place , the general estimation and influence of females , we mean those of the fashionable class , may he ascertained pretty nearly from the tone of Pope 's and Swift 's satire , and from the plays of that day . And the manner in which they are addressed or spoken of in the essays themselves , at the moment when the writers are lamenting female degradation , and seeking to begin the reform of the state by a purification of home , often betrays , in the midst of their courtesy and kindness , a degree of contempt which must have been forced from men whose benevolence was as remarkable as their genius . How painful is it to see them appealing to the honor or selfishness of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confiding so faintly in the self-respect of the mothers and daughters of England . It is admitted that exaggeration will find a place in our estimates of society at any period . We seize upon obvious ill or good , and praise or blame in the mass , forgetting how much // secret virtue tbere*is and must be in every class , if society still holds together ; and how much refined iniquity is concealed or tolerated in what appear to us the best *of times . We forget , too , in the contemplation of different periods , that the forms , the exterior of life vary , and that as*deadly profligacy , the more deadly for being subtle , may subsist amidst artificial decencies as in shameless effrontery . We forget that the topics and phrases which offend one age were familiar in another , and we may say almost harmless ; for they grew from a low state of refinement , and indicate but did not produce it ; and a merely conventional abandonment of them would have very little operation towards purifying society , and furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to moderate our judgments of others , we may adopt Steele 's generous observation ; " As bad as the world is , " he says , " I find by very strict observation upon virtue and vice , that if men appeared no worse than they really are , I should have less work than at present I am obliged to undertake for their reformation . They have generally taken up a kind of inverted ambition , and affect even faults and imperfections of which they are innocent . " But after all this acknowledged exposur to exaggeration , we do not hesitate to pronounce the period we have spoken of , rather than described , as marked out for reprobation in the history of English if not of European society . We might discriminate so far as to say that there was bolder profligacy , and certainly more reckless persecution , in the earlier than in the latter part of this half century ; in the reign of Charles the Second than of Anpe ; and it would be easy to show that corruption did not cease with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of the writings we are to speak of . But it is enough for the present purpose to have taken this general view of the times . It was then the object of the Periodical Essays to resist a vicious age ; to purify the sources of pleasure ; to divert and soften party hostilities by recommending topics which had a common interest and led naturally to reflection ; to elevate and refine familiar conversation by a colloquial elegance of their own , and to regulate it by fixed laws ; to bring literature near to a people apparently little versed in books ; to establish and make clear that beautiful and delicate boundary , which marks off our home and makes it a little world within itself , without diminishing general benevolence . But it is scarcely // possible to enumerate all the particular purposes they were intended or fitted to accomplish ; so minutely did they take cognizance of all classes of men , and all human interests , and so various were the subjects to which they drew attention . It would be better , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical teacher of duty . It might be thought , from the view we have Just taken of the times , that the reformer of such a people must necessarily be a stern censor ; but it is well known that the usual tone of the essays is cheerful and kind-hearted ; and that they have much more of the air of a family journal than of didactic wisdom ' solemnly addressed to a whole people . The objects , which we have thus described , were to be effected by a series of little papers , published in a separate form , thrice a week , and at one period every day ; and these little papers , thus rapidly thrown off for a present purpose , were destined to become , if not absolutely the most important part of the literature of the last century , yet certainly its most remarkable characteristic . Our attention is first due to the Father , as he has been called , of the Periodical Essay ; and his connexion with it will be the chief subject of our-*remarks . We owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Richard Steele ; and we say this with a full knowledge of the assistance he received from the wits , moralists , and geniuses of the age , and whose greater popularity has almost cast his merits into the shade . Steele was the originator , conductor , and working-man ; and he appears to have been the responsible man , both as to the business concerns of the papers , and the demands of those who might be offended by personalities . His course of life had been perhaps more favorable for a literary undertaking that required sudden and brief composition , than for deliberate and extended discussion ; and the sanguine temper , buoyant spirits , and impulsive action , which were the principal causes of his many errors and disappointments , were also the very qualities to cheer and sustain him in the daily calls upon his invention and resources . We will give a few particulars of his life , and notices of his character , derived from different sources , which are thought to bear especially upon his fitness for his great and various enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foi*ty years of age . He had distinguished himself at Oxford , and while there discovered a taste for dramatic composition , which he culti // vated afterwards with some success , but not to the securing of permanent celebrity . For a season his attention was diverted from literature by the attractions of a military life . And so wayward was he , so resolved to follow out a present humor and have his own way , that upon failing to obtain a commission , he entered himself as a private in the horse-guards little heeding the forfeiture of a succession to a good property , which a relative had intended for him , but which he left to another upon hearing of his kinsman 's voluntary degradation . Steele recommended himself so well to the whole regiment , that the officers sought to have so agreeable a companion in their own number , and succeeded in their application to that effect . It was a dangerous connexion for one of his temper and years , with every temptation to indulgence , and no excitement , it should seem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable , idle , he plunged into the grossest excesses , and recovered from them to suffer the keenest remorse ; for his conscience never failed to assert her claims , and his sense of the beauty of virtue was undimmed . Such was his life for several years ; and the weakness and redeeming points , which we observe in him then , were , in their degree , to be ohserved to the end of his days . One characteristic incident is worth mentioning . In his seasons of contrition , he wrote a little work for his own use which he thought might strengthen the reflections suggested by a review of his evil and wasted life . Finding the experiment fruitless , and suffering the keener anguish for it , he at last thought , that by publishing his private treatise , and thus exposing himself to the world 's contempt should he again fail , he should have the strongest motive to self-restraint . But , like all moral remedies that do not begin in sound principle and motives , his scheme was wholly ineffectual . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinning ; and his reckless associates had another cause for mirth and ridicule . He next appears as a dramatic author ; but upon his disgust at the failure of one of his comedies , he abandoned playwriting for many years . He then commenced his celebrated series of periodical essays . Those now the best known , The Tatler , Spectator , and Guardian , employed him , with little interruption , for nearly five years from the early part of 1709 . In this hasty summary it is unnecessary to name other of his // periodical writings , some upon a similar plan with those just enumerated , and some of an exclusively political cast . His life , as we have seen , was miscellaneous . He had followed no profession , unless his early connexion with the army be called one . His necessities saved him from fastidiousness as to his employment , if it was creditable and yielded a support , and , better still , if it ministered to his love of pleasure and display . He was for a time associated with the managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the connexion . He entered into political life with a zeal and devotion that seem scarcely compatible with his literary ardor and occupations , and with a fierceness that we should little expect in one who has left so many and beautiful testimonies to his sweetness of spirit . He was a violent partisan writer ; and whatever may have been his determination to keep clear of party matters in the three periodical works we have named , the temptation was sometimes too strong , and the poison penetrated even there . We may add , that while in parliament , bis offensive pamphlets drew down the vengeance of the Tories , and he was expelled from that body for what they called his scandalous and seditious libels . We refer to these things to show that Steele was far from being a retired scholar or speculatist ; and though we care little now for his political course , yet we shall probably understand him better as a literary man , if we bear in mind , what sort of life he led that he held offices ; that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , and disposed to push his fortunes by bold enterprises ; and , above all , that he was alive to any measures that affected the prosperity of his country in whatever direction , and especially those that concerned toleration in religion and freedom generally . There can be no doubt that his varied experience , his acquaintance with common topics and all classes , his interest in all that was going on , as welt as his natural turn for observation , prepared him to address his countrymen with authority and with the chance of being heard , upon their personal and domestic affairs , and upon most matters of general concern . But if , as we have represented him , he was a man of pleasure and fashion , and violent in his political warfare , and , we may add , improvident , and at the mercy of his creditors , it may be reasonably thought that he was not the most proper person to set about the work of public moral reformation . // And yet his imperfections seem , in some points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this office . Steele was never thoroughly in love with vice , or hardened by acquaintance with it . His lively though fluctuating sense of the obligations , the elevating influences and happiness of religion , by reminding him of his weakness and low attainments , teaches him humility , and carries him directly to the wants and sins of others without the least air of pretension or oppressive injunction . Remorse for his own failings is not strong enough to make him a good example , and he never set up for one nor was it of sufficient force to give him , what he most wanted , steadiness and consistency of character ; but it brings him into close and effective connexion with those , whom , under his disguise , he would touch to the quick . Neither does his contrition create a morbid and repelling tone of remonstrance ; but he talks with men as a companion and friend , who has as much at least to correct in himself as in them , and who would have it the joint interest of all to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own and others ' imperfections , that his mind has become narrowed and impoverished by the very importance of his purpose , - that every thought and word is made solemn and weighty , and his aim for ever prominent . He has no single or prevailing class of sentiments or topics , and no system to unfold or maintain . Any thing of present human interest is good enough subject and occasion for him . It brings him to some point in the minds of others , where he is sure to find or make them alive . And though he does not profess to analyze truths or settle general principles , yet he has admirable skill in applying familiar truths and principles . And perhaps nothing is more observable in him , than the profound reflections and close perception of character and feeling , which attend upon his most familiar writings . Something perpetually comes up , which the occasion does not seem to demand ; and generally it will be found that the choicest matter is in those papers , let the main subject be what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost irresponsibly , whatever occurs to his mind . We feel then that he is hearty in his business , and that he is well prepared for it . From considerations like these , it should seem that his very faults qualified him in some degree to be a teacher , by showing him how to probe the faults of others and adapt his instructions to their moral wants . Nothing is clearer than that // he never relied a moment upon his character to give weight to his lessons . He wrote under the different disguises of Isaac l3ickerstaff and Nestor Ironside , and in the Spectator as one of a club ; and for part of the time at least , he was not known as the writer . On giving up the Tatler , he says the purpose of the work was wholly lost by its being so long understood that he was the author . " I never designed , " he continues ; " to give any man a secret wound by my concealment , but spoke in the character of an old man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to allure my reader with the variety of my subjects , and insinuate , if I could , the weight of reason with the agreeableness of wit . The general purpose of the whole has been to recommend truth , innocence , honor , and virtue , as the chief ornaments of life ; but I considered that severity of manners was absolutely necessary to him who would censure others ; and for that reason , and that only , chose to talk in a mask . I shall not carry my humility so far as to call myself a vicious man , but at the same time must confess my life is at best but pardonable . And with no greater character than this , a man would make but an indifferent progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable vices , which Mr. Bickerstaff has done with a freedom of spirit , that would have lost both its beauty and efficacy , had it been pretended to by Mr. Steele . " - Tatler , No. 271 . It may still be supposed , that he assumed his serious mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is every reason to think him sincere . We will not allow that the lightness of his character is against this . We judge rather by the fact , that , though in the great variety of his topics he says many things frivolous and exceptionable , yet the inculcation of religious truth , motives , and obligations is , in his later essays at least , steadily , perseveringly pursued . It is postponed for nothing else . It is introduced at any moment , and in any connexion where it can be with prudence and decency ; and for the most part in a strictly practical manner . While Addison and Berkeley , among his coadjutors , are frequently prone to speculation and argument in their religious papers , Steele aims chiefly at instruction that shall bear directly upon conduct . While Johnson , at a later day , made use of the same form of writing to convey the speculations of a profound religious philosopher upon man and duty , and the results of his observation of human life , Steele , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exercising over them a minute supervision , and inserting truths perhaps as profound into the particular cases before him . He writes as if he were aware that here lay his power to do good , and not in merely generalizing his observations . We know how easy it is to utter separate moral sayings , good enough , too , to become proverbial , and with no other motive than to set off a discourse and purchase favorable opinions . But it was no part of Steele 's object or habits to make brilliant sentences on any subject . He was deliberately occupied with making men better . His series of moral and religious papers , published during Lent in the Guardian , is introduced in this strain of satirical apology . " If it were possible to bear up against the force of ridicule , which fashion has brought upon people for acknowledging a veneration for the most sacred things , a man might say that the time we are now in Lent is set apart for humiliation , and all our actions should at present more particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eminent divine , who was also most exactly well bred , told his congregation at Whitehall , that if they did not vouchsafe to give their lives a new turn , they must certainly go to a place which he did not think fit to name in that courtly audience . It is with me as with that gentleman . I would , if possible , represent the errors of life , especially those arising from what we call gallantry , in such a manner as the people of pleasure may read me . In this case I must not be rough to gentlemen and ladies , but speak of sin as a gentleman . " - Guardian , No. 17 . And in a later page of the same work , he seems heartbroken that he can do so little against a fashionable vice . " Does the poor girl imagine that a scrip of paper , a collection of sentences , and an old man 's talk of pleasure which he is past , will have an effect upon him who could go on in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her false hope from the repetition of them by some friend that heard them ; who could pass as much time in pursuit of her as would have attained some useful art or science ; and that only to attain a short revel of his senses , under a stupor of faith , honor , and conscience ? " - Guardian , No. 45 . To show his sincerity and zeal in his moral enterprise , we may add , that he not unfrequently exposed himself to personal // outrage by his bold assaults upon fashionable vices. * This was particularly the case in his unrelenting warfare with the professed gamblers . He says in his " Apology , " that if the " sharpers , gamesters , knaves , and pickpockets are no longer the men of fashion , or mingle with so good an air among people of quality as formerly , it is more owing to Mr. Steele than to any other that ever made use of pen and ink . " And at the close of the Tatler , he publicly thanks three military gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any danger that might befall him in the endeavour to banish fraud and cozenage from the presence and conversation of gentlemen . In the same spirit , and with scarcely less exposure to personal insult or injury , he set himself against the practice of duelling . He had long been opposed to it in principle and feeling . Once in his life he had reluctantly fought with a young brother-officer , who had been dissuaded by him from sending a challenge to some one who had given him offence . The young man was led by his companions to believe , that Steele 's good offices had been induced merely by his partiality for the real or supposed offender , and thus had in effect raised the character of the wrong-doer at the expense of the other 's honor . Steele , who was then recovering from a fever , received a challenge for his well-meant advice ; and , after endeavouring in vain to get rid of it by argument and raillery , he finally accepted it , in the full confidence that by his superior skill he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . In the attempt to disable him , however , his antagonist was run through the body , and lingered some time in a desperate state from tho wound , but in the end recovered . Steele 's distress during this interval of suspense turned his thoughts more seriously than ever to the practice itself , and it is supposed that he then prepared the materials of the several papers on duelling in the first volume of the Tatler . He thus expresses himself on the undertaking . " It is worth our consideration to examine into this chimerical , groundless humor , and to lay every other thought aside , until we have stripped it of all its false pretences to credit and reputation among men . But I must confess , when I consider what I am going about , and run over in my imagination all the endless crowd of men of honor who will be offended at such a discourse ; I am undertaking , methinks , a work worthy an invulnerable hero // in romance , rather than a private gentleman with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great opportunities with the nature of man , and know of a truth , that all men fight against their will , the danger vanishes , and resolution rises upon this subject . For this reason , I shall talk very freely on a custom which all men wish to see exploded , though no man has courage to resist it . " - Tatler , No. 25 . And in the review of his labors , he says , " I shall be so arrogant as to say of myself , that , in spite of all the force of fashion and prejudice , I alone bewailed the condition of an English gentleman , whose fortune and life are at this day precarious , while his estate is liable to the demands of gamesters through a false sense of justice , and his life to the demands of duellists through a false sense of honor . " - Preface to Tatler . In further considering his moral qualities , as they appear in his writings , we observe next that he was a man of sentiment . His convivial life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from friendly to the temper , had no more power to blunt the delicacy of his affections than the tenderness of his conscience . With frivolity or vice in all forms for his frequent theme , and often entering into gross details , and sparing nothing of personality , satire , and ridicule in laying open an evil to its very root , it seems as if his heart must be hardened by the contemplation of folly and sin , though with no other object in view than their cure ; and that familiarity with them must he nearly as hurtful to the reformer as to the offender . How is it that he has enough constitutional sensibility left , to speak with fervor and kindness of pure emotions , generous actions , and domestic delights ? The utmost sweetness and love breathe through his moral speculations . How tender his remembrance of affecting scenes and incidents in his childhood . How lively his sense of the beauty of a sound , honest heart ; of the dignity and benign power of woman , in her several relations and proper sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship ; of the deference we owe to others in the smallest things . We are drawn near to him , and breathe the air of benevolence and courtesy , and love him the more that he is not perfect , if only for sympathy . We love the unreserve which looks so much like having nothing to conceal , however much he may have to regret , and which assures us that he feels no oppressive anxiety about sustaining a character , though he prizes moral worth to its // height . He commits himself to us , as if it were his way of gaining our trust and an opening to our hearts for what may do them good . He commits himself to us , as if it did himself good . The beauty of his sentiment consists not in a philosophical or imaginative meditation of human life and the human heart hut in that warmth and almost childlike facility of feeling , which a real , affecting narrative , or some event of the present hour is just fitted to move . And yet we would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transient character , and shows him to be changeful and self-contradictory ; for it has paternal tenderness and steadiness , and diffuses itself over his thoughts , and reminds us ever of the same old friend we have so long known . We should do him wrong , if we did not acknowledge , that in his most affectionate and kindly views of the tempers and trials of others , of their dangers , follies , and errors , though he is chiefly a practical teacher and aims at immediate effect , he yet shows a power of deep philosophical scrutiny into principles of conduct , and the tendencies of habit , example , and all external influences . There is so little formality , for the most part , in treating subjects of this kind , and indeed any subjects , that his profoundest remarks have little prominence , and sometimes appear wholly casual ; and hence they will not be fully estimated but by those who have read him much , and become accustomed to the action of his mind , till their knowledge of his spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most writers of real worth , who are not fully valued , owe it to some difficulty in their manner ; but Steele , to his being , if possible , too easy ; that is , to the general air of obviousness , which prevents the suspicion that there is more if we would look for it , or rather , if we would think about it a little . It will be found easier to define the properties of Steele 's writings , than to fix precisely upon the qualities of his mind . We can say truly that his papers abound in wit , humor , common sense , and pathos ; in narrative , description , and characters ; in the inculcation of sublime truths , and correction of the humblest faults ; but we are at a loss to determine in which he is best , or for what power he is most distinguished , or by what title we shall most truly express his intellectu*al character . rrhe case is not at all uncommon . The difficulty is owing in part to the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of humility in the composition , which flows , we should think , from the ease and serenity with which he wrote . The faults seem slight , the beauties depressed . We feel that all is harmonious and as it should be ; but when we come to analysis , we find that there is no place for hold distinctions , or sparkling and pointed criticism . Take , for example , the power of imagination ; and without inquiring whether Steele has the poetical temperament , let us ask ourselves whether he has , in any considerable degree , the power of poetical conception . And probably we shall find , that we have read him without thinking of the matter . His imagination is employed , as he says , upon obvious and common subjects , and he appears to present them to our minds more as they would strike and please the generality of readers , and as they would be directly useful by their bearing upon men 's daily conduct , than as they are modified and new-combined by one of a decidedly original and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say precisely where the imagination does and does not operate . Its influence is often most subtile where it is most pervasive , and least recognised where it is most felt . It may be the secret of a man 's boundless wit , and of his skill in painting family scenes and the most ordinary life . What we call his accurate discernment and knowledge , or his ingenuity , or his rapi ( l and playful association of fancies , may be in fact the exercise , and no humble one , of that very faculty which creates the highest works of poetry . By what other power is it that Steele assembles his little groups at the coffee-houses , or in private families , or in his own apartment , and sets people before us in such a manner that we at once become acquainted with them as if they had fallen in our way , and makes them talk , not as in hooks , hut as if every word had been taken down from real conversation ? Here is illusion produced by realities , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by animating descriptions and actions , and where our warmed imaginations are made to do half of the work for the author . This familiar , every-day acquaintance with characters of every variety and without number , is not and could not be obtained from mere delineation . They are not sketches . They are genuine living men and women . We know them and their manner of life . We are prepared for all they have to say . We can account for their motives , anticipate their doubts , answer their objections , advise them what to do , and predict their destiny . It is impos // sible to have more perfect common life than this . Our own experience could hardly make us wiser . So of the letters which constitute so important a part of these papers . Every case is a real one . The correspondent is evidently making an application , or communicating facts which relate to his condition and come within his knowledge . It takes little from Steele 's merit in this particular , that many of the letters are genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scurlock who became his second wife ) , and that much of the gossip and satire is founded in fact , and concerns parties who are well known ; for the same character of verity belongs to the whole . If we now pass to other properties of his writings , we are reminded at every turn of his good sense ; his clear , strong , practical distinction of what is true , useful , and becoming in the matter before him ; his decided rejection of fallacies , impertinencies , and all frivolous , collateral points that so commonly arrest or distract men of weak judgment or over rapid association . His stories and collected anecdotes and sayings , his historical passages and illustrative fables and comparisons , all bear directly upon his purpose and partake of its character , and almost seem to have caught some hue from his mind while he was in the act of transcribing them . Nothing is thrust in for brilliancy , that worst of all devices , which is sure to produce interruption and inequality , and let the reader escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which agree well with the general turn of the thoughts and the nature of such compositions . There seems to be an almost unnatural absence of the artificial . We have an abundance of unelaborate beauty , but little of that polished grace and elegance which we might expect from his natural refinement , aided as it was by early influences of education and of society . There is , however , something better than grace and polish to denote his common manner ; we mean his familiar , colloquial ease and directness , which show that he is earnest about his work , and feels quite equal to it . He has a method of stating things , which the reader would pronounce the same in which they would occur to himself , and which at once makes him a party in the matter , and puts the writer quite out of consideration for the time . This is a very sure way to gain our confidence . Steele made no pretension to literary elegance . Speaking of his friend Addison , he says , " The elegance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much my purpose , as , in any intelligible manner I could , to rally all those singularities of human life , through the different professions and characters in it , which obstruct any thing that was truly great and good . After this acknowledgment , you will see that I rejoiced in being excelled . " But as we would not have Addison 's style any thing but what it is , however much pains its beauty may have cost him , so neither do we see any thing in the carelessness and inaccuracies of Steele to make us wish that he had studied his expressions and constructions more diligently . Not that we dislike scrupulosity , but that we never think of these defects . How should we , when we feel the power of his thoroughly truth-telling manner , and when it is so easy to supply his deficiencies ? We never dream that he is not a writer of the first order , and capable , if he pleases , of the highest graces . In short papers like these , sent forth in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of personal responsi. - bleness in the writer , the temptation to exaggerate is very strong . It seems to be one mode of overcoming the disadvantages he labors under . And this temptation is increased , should he find that he is every day getting more and more of a reputation for wit and brilliancy ; since the conviction is forced upon him , that the public will not be satisfied , unless he continues to exhibit the quality which they have praised him for , and which he is known to possess . Hence the danger of substituting a forced and ambitious style for the easy and natural one , which first gained the good-will of his readers , and then made their demands exorbitant . But , happily , Steele never writes as if he had a literary character to support , or indeed any character but that of the good old gentleman who has taken our morals into keeping . And though he knows very well how to exaggerate in a quiet , grave style , which looks like truth , and throws the whole force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet we can name no writer who is less driven to literary artifices to relieve himself from the trouble of thinking . And it is for properties like those we have named , both in style and matter , that he never wears out , never seems old and exhausted . It is true that Charles Lamb said of him ; // up in his mind . But in another view of the case , he would have been unwilling to part for a moment with that old feeling of comfort and gratitude , which made him wish to begin the acquaintance again , but which could not need a new stimulant . If we have read Steele much , and turn to him yet again , every new reading seems more like an act of meditation or memory than receiving another 's thoughts . We have no surprises , no admiration . We do not need them . We do not feel that we are engaged with a memorable work of literature , which we are to compare with others . We do not say a word to ourselves about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a succession of familiar , agreeable images which we begin to value as part of ourselves ; an easy , natural humor which never quite runs over and never loses its charm , and an early companion , who is so visible and intelligible in every word , that he is at our side and ialking with us . Steele 's writings are neither so old nor so recent as to make a selection of his beauties necessary for the purpose of explaining or justifying the views we have expressed of his usual manner . A few passages , however , may be cited ; and the first we take will show how heartily he could enter into the romantic humors of a timid , devoted , despairing lover , for such is Lord llinchinbroke , the Cynthio of the Tatler . Steele heard him discoursing one evening at the Chocolate-house in the following strain , a part of which reminds us of Crabbe 's " Lover 's Journey . " It seems that his heart was overflowing with some false idea of his success . Well , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is nothing but ogling with skill carries a woman ; but , indeed , it is not every fool that is capable of this art . You will find twenty can speak eloquently , fifty that can fight manfully , and a thousand that can dress genteelly at a mistress , where there is one that can gaze , skilfully . This requires an exquisite judgment , to take the language of her eyes to yours exactly , and not let yours talk too fast for hers ; as at a play between the acts , when Beau Frisk stands upon a bench full in Lindamira 's face , and her dear eyes are searching round to avoid that flaring , open fool , she meets the watchful glance of her true lover , and sees his heart attentive on her charms , and waiting for a second twinkle of her eyes for its next motion . ' Here the good company sneered ; but he goes on . Nor is this attendance a slavery , when a man meets with encouragement , and her eye comes often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the repetition of four or five significant // looks at him , the happy man goes home to his lodging full of ten thousand pleasing images ; his brain is dilated , and gives him all the ideas and prospects which it ever lets into its seat of pleasure . Thus a kind look from Lindamira revives in his imagination all the beauteous lawns , green fields , woods , forests , rivers , and solitudes , which he had ever before seen in picture , description , or real life ; and all , with this addition , that he now sees them with the eyes of a happy lover , as before only with those of a common man . You laugh , gentlemen , but compare yourselves in good-humor with yourselves out of humor , and you will then acknowledge that all external objects affect you according to the disposition yon are in to receive their impressions , and not as those objects are in their own nature . How much more shall all that passes within his view and observation touch with delight a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemblage of soft affection , gay desires , and hopeful resolutions . ' " - Tatter , No. 22 . We wish we could subjoin to this rhapsody Mr. Bickerstaff 's sedate conversation with his sister Jenny , upon her marriage . It is in the eighty-fifth Tatler , and a beautiful specimen of Steele 's wisdom and kind feeling . A short passage , however , from the Guardian , will serve for a contrast in manner . " The ancient and religious lady , the dowager of my friend Sir Ambrose Lizard , has for some time estranged herself from conversation , and admits only the visits of her own family . The observation , that old people remember best those things which entered into their thoughts when their memories were in their full strength and vigor , is very remarkably exemplified in this good lady and myself when we are in conversation . I choose , indeed , to go thither , to divert any anxiety or weariness , which at any time I find grow upon me from any present business or care . It is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirits upon those occasions ; but there is a kind of sorrow , from which I draw a consolation that strengthens my faculties and enlarges my mind beyond any thing that can flow from merriment . When we meet , we soon get over any occurrence which passed the day before , and are in a moment hurried back to these days which only we call good ones ; the passages of the times when we were in fashion , with the countenances , behaviour , and jollity , so much , forsooth , above what any appear in now , are present to our imaginations , and almost to our very eyes . This conversation revives to us the memory of a friend that was more than a brother to me ; of a husband that wa* // dearer than life to her ; discourses about that dear and worthy man generally send her to her closet , and me to the despatch of some necessary business which regards the remains , I would say the numerous descendants , of my generous friend . I am got , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say of this lady ; which was , that she is far gone towards a better world ; and I mention her ( only with respect to this ) , as she is the object of veneration to those who are derived from her , whose behaviour towards her may be an example to others , and make the generality of young people apprehend , that when the ancient are paut all offices of life , it is then the young are to exert themselves in I their most laudable duties towards them . " - Guardian , iNo. 5 . Let us read next his account of " false hypocrites , " or the men of a fantastical humor of affectation . Their follies will remind us that , in some points , the artificial in manners undergoes as little change as the natural principles within us , and that the satirist of Queen Anne 's day might give lessons to the fashionable men of our own . " About five years ago , I remember , it was the fashion to be short-sighted . A man would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass . At a lady 's entrance into the play-house , you might see tubes immediately levelled at her from every quarter of the pit and side-boxes . However , that mode of infirmity is out , and the age has recovered its sight ; but the blind seem to be succeeded by the lame , and a janty limp is the present beauty . I think I have formerly observed , a cane is part of the dress of a prig , and always worn upon a button , for fear he should be thought to have an occasion for it , or be esteemed really , and not genteelly a cripple . I have considered , but could never find out the bottom of this vanity . I , indeed , have heard of a Gascon general , who , by the lucky grazing of a bullet on the roll of his stocking , took occasion to halt all his life after . But as for our peaceable cripples , I know no foundation for their behaviour , without it may be supposed that , in this warlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden leg . This sort of affectation I have known run from one limb or member to another . Before the limpers came in , I remember a race of lispers , fine persons , who took an aversion to particular letters in our language . Others have had their fashionable defect in their ears , and would make you repeat all you said twice over . I know an ancient friend of mine , whose table is every day surrounded with fiatterers , that makes use of this , sometimes as a piece of grandeur , and at others as an art , to make them repeat their commendations. " - Tatler , No. 77. // In a still earlier paper , Steele has pursued men into another method of perplexing the unwary . We extract but a part of his statement . " Among the many employments I am necessarily put upon by my friends , that of giving advice is the most unwelcome to me ; and , indeed , I am forced to use a little art in the manner ; for some people will ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell you is still under deliberation . I had almost lost a very good friend the other day , who came to know how I liked his design to marry such a lady . I answered , By no means ; and I must be positive against it , for very solid reasons , which are not proper to be communicateQ ' Not proper to be communicated ! ' said he , with a grave air , I will know the bottom of this . ' I saw him moved , and knew from thence he was already determined ; therefore evaded it by saying , To tell you the truth , dear Frank , of all women living , I would have her myself . ' Isaac , ' said he , thou art too late , for we have been both one these two months . ' " I learned this caution by a gentleman 's consulting me formerly about his son . He railed at his extravagance , and told me , in a very little time he would beggar him by the exorbitant bills which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridle , ' said I ; pay none of his hills ; it will but encourage him to fu*rther trespasses . ' He looked plaguy sour at me . His son soon after sent up a paper of verses forsooth , in print , on the last public occasion ; upon which , he is convinced the boy has parts , and a lad of spirit is not to be too much cramped in his maintenance , lest he take ill courses . Neither father nor son can ever since endure the sight of me . " These sort of people ask opinions only out of the fulness of their hearts on the subject of their perplexity , and not from a desire of information . There is nothing so easy as to find out which opinion the man in doubt has a mind to ; therefore the sure way is , to tell him that is certainly to be chosen . Then you are to be very clear and positive ; leave no handle for scruple . Bless me , sir , there is no room for a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at once applaud his wisdom and gratify his inclination . " - Tatler , No. 25 . The following passage contains much good sense , and shows an elevated and liberal spirit ; and though the topics are familiar to everybody now , yet it is pleasing to know that our ancestors had the advantage of such good instruction . // education to raise ourselves above the vulgar ; but what is intended by the vulgar is not , methinks , enough understood . In me , indeed , that word raises a quite different idea from what it usually does in others ; but , perhaps , that proceeds from my being old , and beginning to want the relish of such satisfactions as are the ordinary entertainment of men . However , such as my opinion is in this case , I will speak it ; because it is possible that turn of thought may be received by others , who may reap as much satisfaction from it as I do myself . " It is to me a very great meanness , and something much below a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to rank a man among the vulgar for the condition of life he is in , and not according to his behaviour , his thoughts , and sentiments , in that condition . For if a man be loaded with riches and honors , and in that state of life has thoughts and inclinations below the meanest artificer , is not such an artificer , who within his power is good to his friends , moderate in his demands for his labor , and cheerful in his occupation , very much superior to him who lives for no other end but to serve himself , and assumes a preference in all his words and actions to those who act their part with much more grace than himself ? E*pjqtet*s has made use of the similitude of a stageplay to with much spirit . It is not , ' says he , to be considered , among the actors , who is prince , or who is beggar ; but who acts prince or beggar best . ' The circumstance of life should not be that which gives us place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our solid distinction . Thus , a wise man should think no man above him or below him , and further than it regards the outward order or discipline of the world ; for , if we conceive too great an idea of the eminence of our superiors , or subordination of our inferiors , it will have an ill effect upon our behaviour to both . He who thinks no man above him but for his virtue , none below him but for his vice , can never be obsequious or assuming in a wrong place ; but will frequently emulate men in rank below him , and pity those above him . " This sense of mankind is so far from a levelling principle , that it only sets us upon a true basis of distinction , and doubles the merit of such as become their condition . A man in power , who can , without the ordinary prepossessions which stop the way to the true knowledge and service of mankind , overlook the little distinctions of fortune , raise obscure merit , and discountenance successful indesert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of an angel rather than a man ; and is above the rest of men in the highest character he can be , even that of their benefactor . " - Tatler , No. 69. // known as the Spectator ; and we have limited ours to the Tatler and Guardian for another reason , that we think Steele , admirable as his papers in the Spectator are , will not he seen on all sides , and felt in all the variety of his genius and beauty , and nice observation of human life , until we have followed him through the two journals which were most particularly under his control . Perhaps we have offered a temptation to make the trial . Of Addison , to whom more than any one these Essays owe their celebrity beyond their own age , it is not to our present purpose to say any thing , except in relation to the friendship that subsisted between him and Steele . It is true , that the Tatler was begun without the least intimation of the project to Addison ; and so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first information of the authorship was quite accidental , - from nothing more , than Steele 's having made use of a curious criticism on Virgil which he had heard from Addison . But their union soon after as periodical writers was destined to make an era in our literature , and the great event in their own lives . And their friendship is scarcely less memorable ; for it shows us two eminent men , of equal years , joined in one object , without rivalry or distrust of each other ; the one improvident and rash , yet bearing reproof from his companion , and grateful for it ; the other shy *nd reserved , and , under his friend 's responsibility , entertaining the town with many a jest , or personality , or coarse sketch , which it is supposed he would not willingly have been answerable for himself . And Steele receives his aid with almost romantic gratitude . Speaking of Addison 's kind office towards him , he says ; " He performed it with such force of genius , humor , wit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who calls in a powerful neighhour to his aid ; I was undone by my auxiliary . When I had once called him in , I could not subsist without dependence on him . " He says , moreover , it would have been barbarous in Addison to deny this frequent assistance to one with whom he had lived in intimacy from childhood , and considering the ease with which he is able to despatch the most entertaining pieces . The whole tone of his references to his friend is most respectful , affectionate , and grateful . And his veneration is no small testimony to the purity of his own mind . It could not have grown from a consciousness on Steele 's part of inferior natural vigor and originality . It flowed from a deep feeling and love // of the beautifbl fancy , the perfect grace , the mild philosophy , the well-applied learning , the warm religious sentiment , the heart-felt moral touches , and the careful self-discipline , which pervaded the writings , and no doubt the conversation of his long-tried friend . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint labors for the good of the English people . rrhe petty political difference which separated them towards the close of Addison 's life , must have its place in their biography , and is not without its lesson . But even if they had not been reconciled , yet this hostility between men in political life , who had loved each other in their best days and noblest pursuits , would scarcely throw a cloud over the cheerful remernbrar*ce we have of their united names and efforts . It was early in their friendship that Steele said to Addison ; " There is nothing I so ardently wish , as that we may some time or other publish a work written by us both , which shall bear the name of The . lllonument , in memory of our friendship . " They have left the monument in their joint works , and the world best remembers them by the inscription . But Addison was not Steele 's sole coadjutor . He received assistance from many quarters . Sometimes important hints came from other friends , or from unknown persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Besides , we know , that he received entire articles from several of the best writers of the time , and among them are no less names than Swift , Parnell , Berkeley , Young , Pope , and Gay . We do not mean by this to intimate , that Steele himself , as editor , was not a hard-workiug man . This would not do to say of a man , who had the sole charge of the Tatler and Guardian , and furnished two fifths of the papers in the first seven Volnines of the Spectator , - the only volumes , we believe , in which his articles can be traced . Indolent as he has been called , and fond of fashionable life and political questions , he was yet able to bring himself to work day by day to get his journal ready . In allusion to the constant pressure upon him , he says ; " When a man has engaged to keep a stagecoach , be is obliged , whether he has passengers or not , to set out ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , he pro* ceeds as usual to something that has just fallen under his notice , or else is apparently burdened with the applications of correspondents for immediate advice , so that he is compelled // to defer his answers . And such is the variety and crowd of materials in his Tatler , that one might take it for the universal mntelli encer of the kingdom instead of a moral or fashionable journal . Still , if we should suppose that Steele alone furnished all the matter for any one of these journals , we must give him credit for diligence and vivacity as remarkable as his genius . We do not say this chiefly in reference to the amount of the composition , but to the daily calls upon him ; to the duty of furnishing so many pages as a matter of course at the regular application of his publisher . The wonder is , that he did not fall into habitual dulness and a repetition of himself , from his mechanical constancy of work . One more particular , and we will take our leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices he paid to his contributors ; for it must he acknowledged that the service of the periodical writers was mercenary , even then . If he paid all as liberally as he did Berkeley , we should scarcely be justified in calling the present the most favored time for journalists for Steele gave him a guinea and a dinner for every paper he sent to the Guardian , and in general the numbers in that work are much shorter than those of the Tatler . So productive was the sale of the papers , that Steele himself mi bht have been rich ; but it was not in the power of public favor , or private friendship , or his wife 's fortune , or his own most brilliant success to make him so . He knew well how to moralize over improvidence for the good of others , and that was all . There are many points of view , in which these Essays have an interest at the present day . They are no doubt of great consideration for their literary excellence and influence , for the variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxims of prudence , and for the perpetual resource they offer to those who love repose or gentle exhilaration . But they are in nothing more curious and pleasing than as a monument of their age , as a part of English antiquities . They are not so properly a history , as a set of pictures of the times . They do not serve the purposes of guide-hooks , which direct us to high roads and prominent objects , but they raise the veil of a hundred years , and , by a kind of magic , show us the whole of daily English city life at that period ; the men and their costume , the professions , the theatres , the trades , the interior of private houses , the prevailing notions respecting education and criticism . We have every condition of life , every pursuit , // and almost every kind of opinion , conversation , tastes , fashions , follies , vices . Till we think a little of the subject , we shall have no conception of the minuteness and extent of information which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left untold ; not because we have looked for every thing and found it , but because nothing is felt to be wanting . Lon*. don is all about us . We do not take it in at once , or , like strangers and travellers , go over the whole , as a business ; but we become acquainted with it as we do with our own town and neighbours , in the course of our business and amusements . Such is the charm and power of these sketcbes of real life , drawn incidentally in the course of moral instruction , and not prepared for the purpose of giving lively and complete representations.
