txt AMONG other curious particulars on the subject of bells contained in that oddest of books , the " Doctor , " it is stated that it was not uncommon for bells to be cast within the precincts of monasteries , and that , as soon as the casting was finished , the hell was baptized , and immediately raised to its place in the belfry , in order that no profane hands might touch it after its consecration . It is probably a scene of this kind , which Schiller intended to represent in his " Song of the Bell . " Whether Schiller originally designed it for music , we do not know , though there are some circumstances which lead us to suppose that such was not his intention . However this may have been , it has been made the subject of a musical composition by Andreas Romberg ; and it is of the whole , considered as a musical work , that we design to give an account . The German of Schiller has been translated into English for the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve exactly the mechanical structure of the verse , line for line , syllable for syllable , accent for accent , preserving the rhymes precisely in the same position in which they were placed in the original , was a task which might well have been deemed an impossibility . But in order to give full effect to the music , this was necessary , and , notwithstanding its great difficulty , the translator has succeeded in performing it . Nor only this . We do not hesitate to say , that under all this accumulation of adventitious difficulties , incident to the use which // the translation was to serve , it is a work marked with the ease and force of an original composition . The " Song of the Bell " is in its form dramatic , the interlocutors being the master and the chorus of workmen , who are engaged in casting the bell . From time to time the master gives directions with regard to the different processes , while the workmen describe the uses of the bell , moralizing upon the various events of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of the composition which reminds us of the chorus in the ancient drama , and one almost expects to find that the master is Vulcan , and that his workmen are the Cyclops , laboring at their furnaces in the bowels of Etna . But these workmen are no Cyclops forging the thunderbolts of Jupiter , or the armour of classic heroes , and discoursing of the immovable laws of Fate and Destiny . Neither are they the warlike artisans of the middle ages , like Harry Smith of the Wynd , ready alike to forge or to wear in battle their strong armour . These bell-founders are good German artisans , full of enthusiasm and love of all things in the world or in life , prone to speculations somewhat mystic , and withal possessing a certain quiet and unobtrusive humor . The various subjects which are suggested by the different uses of the bell , naturally divide the song into several distinct portions . But the directions of the master are so introduced as to fix the attention upon the work which is going on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect has also been beautifully produced by the composer , who by introducing the same melody with slight variations whenever the master speaks , has given the same unity of character to the musical composition . Notwithstanding that the general unity is so well preserved , still the poetry and the music being naturally divided as we have remarked , into several distinct portions , it will be more easy to convey an idea of the whole by describing each portion separately . To the direction of the master to commence their work , the workmen answer in chorus , " To the work we now prepare , A serious thought is surely due , And cheerfully the toil we 11 share If cheerful words be mingled too , " &amp;c . The music of this chorus is simple , unpretending , and graceful . The master then directs them to feed the fire and add to the " melting copper " the " boiling tin . " " That the thick metallic mass Rightly to the mould may pass . " // CHORUS. - " What with fire 's dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shall on some lofty sacred tower Tell of our skill and form our pride , " &amp;c . The music of this chorus is a spirited and majestic movement , full of dignity , and well expressing the idea of the poetry . The first use of the bell is at the baptism of the infant . The days of infancy , childhood , and the first delicious hours of youthful love , make the subject of some beautiful music . A sweet and expressive air describes with much beauty the earliest hours of infancy , which " are passed in sleep 's dominion mild . " The impetuous days of early manhood , when the youth " rushes to the world without , " his return home , his first emotions of love and the progress of the passion , make the subject of a solo and a duet . These three airs make , as it were , one scene in the piece , and in them the composer has shown great power of appreciating and expressing the sentiments of the poet . The mixture of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stronger and the gentler sex . The marriage festivities ar*e described in a lively and pleasing melody . Next comes one of the most remarkable portions of the whole work . The bustle and hurry of active life , the labor and enterprise of the husband to amass wealth , and the busy household virtues of his wife , are described by the poet with exquisite but delicate and subdued humor . The composer has seized exactly the idea of the poet , and given a song containing just as much quiet , comic expression as the poetry requires . The hurry and bustle of a money-getting life are , we should think , as little adapted as any thing could be to the purposes of art . It is not a little remarkable that the composer should , in this instance , so exactly sympathize with , and realize the idea of the poet . The toils arid labors of life are not without their reward . " The father cheerful from the door , His wide-extended homestead eyes , Tells all his smiling fortunes o'er ; The future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees . * * * * * He boasts with swelling pride , Firm as the mountain side , Against the shock of fate Is now my happy state . " These words make the subject of a quartette . The cairn and soothing effect of a beautiful landscape , composed of richly cultivated grounds , is well expressed by soft music gradually increasing in force with the swelling feelings of the fortunate // owner . At this moment three other voices are added with the words , " Who can discern futurity ? Who can insure prosperity ? Quick , misfortune4s arrow flies , ** the music contrasting beautifully with the loud voices in which the preceding boast was expressed . The master now directs the casting to begin . * * * Strike the copper clear , God preserve us here ; Sparkling to the rounded mould It rushes hot , like liquid gold . " Here the chorus describes the destructive effects of fire ; " When bursting from her bonds , she s seen To quit the safe and quiet hearth , And xvander lawless over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composer deserves particular notice and commendation , inasmuch as musical authors are apt to mistake the true objects and capacities of their art , and to describe such scenes by attempting directly to imitate the noises , rather than by giving a musical expression of the emotions excited by them . The full examination of this chorus , which is somewhat long , would occupy too much space , but there is one point which we think deserves to be mentioned particularly . When the conflagration has spread desolation over the whole city , and there is no longer hope of checking its progress , " Hope now dies ! Man must yield to Heaven 's decrees , Submissive , yet appalled , he sees His fairest works in ashes sleep . " The two first lines here quoted are given by the composer as a loud burst of despair , which is gradually softened down to an expression of humble resignation . The casting is now completed , - " To the dark lap of mother earth We now confide what we have made . " The chorus composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest chorus in the whole piece . It brings out with great delicacy , the idea of the poet , conveyed by the words , " And yet more precious seed we sow , With sorrow in the world 's wide field , And hope , though in the grave laid low , A flower of heavenly hue t will yield , " // The music expresses with much beauty the blending of the emotions of sorrow and hope . This is followed by a short dirge , succeeded by a beautiful recitative and air to the words , " Alas ! the wife , - it is the dear one - Ah ! it is the faithful mother , Whom the shadowy king of fear Tears from all that life holds dear , " &amp;c . The whole of this scene , if so it may be called , is full of pathos and tenderness . The metal is then suffered to cool , the mould is broken up , the hell is christened , and immediately swung aloft , to be " a neighbour to the stars . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music which abounds in this last part . The concluding chant , " All together ! heave ! Its birthplace see it leave . Joy to all within its bound Peace its first , its latest sound ! " is full of grace and beauty . In the construction of the music of this piece , it seems to us that the composer has had one very great difficulty to contend with . We think that there is too muck poetry , to admit of an adequate musical expression in a single composition . This is merely an opinion , and as such we offer it with due deference to better judges . A song , in order to admit of proper musical expression , should , as it seems to us , be confined to the bringing out of one single leading idea , and so of a chorus , or any other portion of a musical work . In order to give unity to a musical composition , there must be one leading musical idea , pervading the whole , and carefully brought out and set before us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass rapidly from one thought to another , he will almost of necessity abandon the musical unity of his composition . Handel 's famous song , " I know that my Redeemer liveth , " which we have always considered to be the finest vocal composition extant , is a good exemplification of what we have been saying ,  --  it being wholly confined to the musical expression of a single thought . It appears to us that the music of the " Song of the Bell " also illustrates the correctness of our opinion , though the composer has certainly succeeded remarkably well in overcoming the difficulty . We wish to call attention to another point . It is remarkable that the composer has in no single instance , that we can recollect , attempted a direct imitation by means of music , of any object which he wished to describe , but in every case has made his music descriptive , by endeavouring to express and to excite in others the same emotions and feelings as are expressed by the // poetry . It may safely be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical sound , and that just in the same degree as we succeed in imitating natural sounds , we depart from music . We think any person may be convinced of this by examining either the Creation or Seasons ' ' of Haydn . In both those immortal works there are some , though not a great many instances , of direct imitation of natural sounds , and we think it may be confidently asserted , that even the genius of Haydn has not succeeded in making those passages nmsical . The author of the music of the Bell has shown that in this matter he thoroughly understands the powers and objects of his art . We can not conclude without recommending this composition to the serious study of the lovers of music . It is published for the use of the Academy , in a form very convenient for study , and with the orchestral accompaniments compressed into a very practicable arrangement for the piano forte . It deserves to hold a place in every collection of piano forte music.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
