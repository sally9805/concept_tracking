txt AT the end of my last number , I left the valiant Captain Smashem of the Rantipole Sharpshooters , in manifest danger of an indictment for a riot , and a court martial for disobedience of orders ,  --  and my valiant self with uniform torn , and face bruised , so as to vie in colors with the rainbow ; my body , it is true , in a situation not very enviable , but my soul borne aloft on the wings of glory . My experience has taught me that most things , in this world of chance and changes , happen differently from our anticipations ; this remark is especially true of promotions in the militia . Captain Smashem , for instance , according to any rational calculation , was , as they say , completely dished ; there was an end , one would have imagined , to his military career ; for who would - have thought of trusting a man with command. , who - had showed himself so unwilling to obey ? and what reason could-possibly be urged for promoting an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient in that indispensable accomplishment-the art of running away ? Yet in the face and eyes of these good and sufficient reasons to the contrary , Captain Smashem found favor with his compatriots and fellow-soldiers . The idea of a court martial was soon given over ; the events on Booby Hill being generally considered of a character not sufficiently serious to merit the consideration of so grave a tribunal ; - the thought of an indictment was very generally scouted , lest it should lead to undesirable collisions between the civil and military authority ; Captain Smashem 's misbehavior at the great sham-fight passed gradually into oblivion ; and , within less than three years from that event , he was chosen major-general of the division to which we both belonged . If that magnanimity of spirit , which I have ever especially studied , and which has enabled me to support a dignified composure , alike on the muster-field , and in the Applesbury Almshouse , did not now come to aid , my readers can scarcely imagine the terms of strong disdain , in which I should speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmith ; skillful in nothing but hammering iron , and beating his neighbors ; a man of no merit or military science whatever , should thus be placed at the head of a division ; while I , college-learned , devoted heart and soul to the military profession , who had given my nights and days to Steuben , and who had sacrificed my time , my fortune , and the dearest affections of my heart , for the honor of promotion in the militia , still remained a mere captain of Light Infantry ! I was tempted , ( and who would not have been ? ) to throw up my commission at once , and to renounce forever , the service of an ungrateful country . And perhaps my country would have lost my invaluable services , and I myself , retiring from the bustle and confusion of military life , should have ended my days in sweet , domestic , inglorious obscurity , had not the hand of fate , which intended me for no such humble , though happy station , visited me at this time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military profession , for solace and support . My readers must be very well aware of die passion I entertained for Marianne Fairservice . Indced , it was her vivid exclamation , at the // sight of the Applesbury Light Infantry , while it was yet commanded by Captain Doggett , which , as I have already related , first kindled in my bosom the flame of military ambition . Miss Fairservice was not generally reputed handsome , hut she was certainly a very remarkable girl . I know not what it was , but there was a fascination about her , which no one could withstand ; many people , at their first introduction , called her affected , and pretended to think her disagreeable , but no one ever tarried long within the sphere of her influence , who did not love her . She had a s*veetness and gentleness of temper , combined with great spirit and intelligence , and every word she uttered was in such a soft , enchanting voice , that I firmly believed , though she could not have captured , she might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for my part , I positively declare , that although the exigences of my military career have carried me from the most northerly corner of Essex , even to the island of Nantucket , and from the utter extremity of Cape Cod , far west among the mountains of Berkshire ; and though , as became a soldier , I have always had an eye upon the ladies ; yet I have never seen the woman , who could stand a moment 's competition with Marianne Fairservice . I loved her  --  and my readers , who must by this time have some idea of the serious , enthusiastic turn of my temperament , may easily imagine how much is expressed in that single word . The very day on which I was chosen captain of the Applesbury Light Infantry , I had put up my sign , as an attorney in the village , and , on the evening of that same eventful day , I found courage to tell Miss Fairservice how much I loved her . She acknowledged a mutual passion , and we were engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the present , for Marianne 's father had taken some unaccountable dislike to me ; and , though I tried my very best , to get into the good graces of the old gentleman , I had not the slightest success . My inclination to serve my country as a militia officer , which , had the old fellow possessed one single spark of patriotism or public spirit , would have gained me his approbation and applause , was with him , a theme of constant jests and derision ; and many is the time , I have had the greatest difficulty in the world , to prevent myself from returning most impertinent answers to his impertinent observations . He carried his hostility to me so far , that , finally , having some suspicion how matters stood between Marianne and myself he resolved to leave the town ; that absense and change of scene might prevail , where paternal authority was found inefficacious . He chose a residence some forty miles distant from Applesbury ; and , some time after his removal , Marianne was sent to Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circles of fashion , and she was surrounded by beaux and dandies of the first order , against whose elegant impertinences , and graceful bandinage , a poor rural militia officer , and country attorney stood a very slight chance of successfully contending . It is not necessary to mention the tears and promises with which Marianne and myself separated , nor particulaly to describe the scheme of secret correspondence which was arranged between us . The lady , I believe , loved me sincerely ; but I am inclined to think , ( though in this I may very probably be mistaken , and I hope I am , ) that the sweet // gentleness of temper , which made every thing she did and said so peculiarly feminine and fascinating , incapacitated her for any very deep and serious attachment . Our correspondence , which was extremely constant at first , as obstacles increased , grew less frequent . It was impossible for me to see Marianne at her father 's house ; and , for a considerable time after she was sent to Boston , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my first serjeant , which threatened to involve my company in irretrievable confusion , and which cost me eight months hard labor to bring to a happy termination . Having finished this weighty business , and finding a moment 's leisure to attend to my own affairs ,  --  somewhat alarmed at Marianne 's long silence , I resolved to pay her a visit . It was nearly a year and a half since I had seen her ; and now , that we were to meet , it was , of necessity , in that cold , distant , and unrestrained way , which is worse , if any thing , than not meeting at all . For the lady , at whose house she was visiting , had been particularly requested by Marianne 's father , to keep an eye upon his daughter ; and , also , on all such gentlemen from the country , as might honor her with a call . We met , however ; and I found Marianne more charming than ever . She assured me that her affections remained unchanged ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having made myself very agreeable . There was an embarrassment that almost completely overpowered me ; that stiffened my limbs and tied my tongue ; and my emotion was so excessive , that I was obliged to keep silent for fear of betraying it . On the whole , this unlucky visit did me much more harm than good , since Marianne would no doubt have remained constant to me much longer than she did , had I not foolishly exposed myself to so disadvantageous a contrast with the several admirers who were already making her advances . The ladies of New-England , however they may be surpassed by the ladies of other countries in beauty , in wit , in temper , in accomplishments , in ardor , in constancy , far excel all the rest of the female world in-*prudence ; a virtue , no doubt , very great , but which I and some others who have soared above the common level , can not help regarding with a certain degree of contempt . Now Marianne possessed her full share of this virtue ; and as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that love should triumph no longer over reason . She saw me somewhat awkward and ungainly , ( for I had not yet acquired that military air and assured carriage , for which , in maturer life , I was famous ; ) my career of promotion in the militia seemed to be cut short ; and , what was much worse , my property was gradually wasting , and I had no business in my profession . She resolved to make a handsome retreat , and , accordingly , wrote me word , that she had long considered herself as a clog and impediment to the eagle-flights of my ambition ; that nothing , she was assured , could long delay my promotion , were it not that all my time and thoughts were absorbed in my affection for her ; that she had resolved to sacrifice her own private feelings to my advantage and the good of the country ; and she , therefore , had the pleasure to inform me that she was shortly to be married to Mr. Workington , an elderly gentleman , as I afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world had set down , the ten years last past , for // an old bachelor . So ended my engagement with Marianne Fairservice ; yet not my affection for her ; for I love her to this hour as well as ever . Let those inveigh against the lady 's inconstancy who are confident of their own virtue . For my part , I do not find it very difficult to excuse her . When an engagement is once publicly announced , there are a hundred motives to keep the parties constant to it ; but a long perseverance in a secret engagement-absence and temptation interveningrequires a steadiness of temper , which it is in vain to expect in a woman ,  --  at least , in any woman with blue eyes and a light complexion* The marriage of Miss Fairservice made a complete revolution in my affairs . Had she proved constant to me , my military spirit would , perhaps , have soon evaporated , and I should have shortly become a thriving country attorney . My life would have been less glorious , and probably more happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great military commander ; andy perhaps , I should not have died in an almshouse . But to imagine what might have been is useless and idle . The iron hand of Fate engrasps us ; our fortunes are determined by an invisible agency ; our destiny is allotted to us , and must be accomplished ,  --  and Fate , Fortune , and Destiny , conspired to make me the most famous of militia officers . Not three days after I received Marianne 's farewell letter , there was a grand review of the brigade to which I belonged . The troops were to be reviewed by General Smashem , who was to rendezvous with his suite at Black Sam 's tavern , about a mile from the parade ground , and there await the arrival of an escort . Though my heart was torn by a thousand contending emotions , I was on the ground with my company at a very early hour and was detached by Brigadier General Spitfire to do the escort duty to Major-General Smasheni . The orders I received were in the following words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it necessary to be particular : " You will proceed , with all convenient despatch , to Black Sam 's tavern , and there wait till nine o'clock , A. M. at which hour , precisely , you will take up your line of march for the parade ground , acting as an escort to the major-general and his suite . " It may well be imagined , that this particular duty was not much to my mind ; but , suppressing all personal feelings , in the true spirit of military obedience , I resolved that the orders I had received should be executed to the letter . I arrived at Black Sam 's tavern about half past eight , and found the general and his staff , with their coats off , in the midst of a high carousal . My officers and myself were invited to join them , which invitation I thought proper to decline . After waiting some time , the wooden clock in the bar-room began to strike nine , but neither the general nor his attendants began to show any intention of moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own watch , which had lately been set by the sun , when I ordered my music to strike up , and marched off my company at double quick time . The sound of my drums brought half a dozen coatless officers to the windows ; they called to me to stop ; they protested that General Smashem had torn a hole in his regimental breeches , and could not possibly move till the chamber-maid had mended it ; the general 's aids came running after me , hatless and out of breath , with express orders from the general to march back and wait his convenience ; but I turned a deaf ear to them all , and pushed off with great speed for the parade ground . // In about half an hour after I had taken my place in the line , General Smashem and his staff came riding up in great disorder , and after a brief interview between Brigadier Spitfire and the Major-General , I suddenly found my sword taken from me , and myself put under arrest . General Smashem 's friends were very loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my trial . I would enter at length into this trial , and state the evidence and arguments adduced on both sides , were it not that the said evidence , being carefully taken &amp;swn in writing by the acting Judge Advocate , and contained in five large folio volumes , is preserved in the office of the Adjutant-General of this Commonwealth , where , also , may be found the summing up of the Judge Advocate , and my defence also , together with the opinion of the court , delivered at length , each contained in ten quires of large foolscap  --  to which interesting collection of documents I hereby refer my readers . The fact , whether the General had or had not torn his breeches , or whether the delay was or was not occasioned by this cause , was made a very serious question . The evidence touching that point is contained in the third and fourth of the abovenamed volumes , which will be found the most interesting of the collection . But without entering into details , suffice it here to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court adjourned , , after having unanimously determined honorably to acquit me . The ground taken by the court was , that I had obeyed the orders I had received from the Brigadier-General ; that , till the Major-General had assumed the command of the brigade , he might justly be regarded as a mere stranger , of whom I was not obliged to take any notice further than my orders extended ; and that , as the Major-General did not choose to be ready to be escorted , at the hour which had been previously arranged between . himself and the Brigadier , on which arrangement my orders had been predicated , I did very well to obey my orders and march away without him . Nor did my triumph end here . For this court-martial having called me into notice , the memory of my deeds of valor on Booby Hill , which time had a little obscured , began to be resuscitated ; my name was again in every body 's mouth ; my laurels bloomed afresh , and , the colonel of our regiment dying just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BELLEROPHON BURDOCK.
