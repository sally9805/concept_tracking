txt The question , which involves the fate of the Bank of the United States , is now before the country ; and no man can say , that the means of forming a just opinion of its merits are withheld from those by whom it is to be decided . The closest scrutiny into the affairs of that institution , which suspicion ought to dictate or prejudice demand , has been already made ; none of the instruments , by which public sentiment could be excited against it , have been overlooked , or employed in the spirit of lenity ; the counsel on both sides have been fully heard ; and the people of the United States , the good men and true , are about to declare their verdict . We hold it to be a great error to maintain , that it is of little consequence at what determina // tion they may arrive . Be that determination what it may , it will seriously affect the interests of the country . for good or evil , for many years to come . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public question , in comparison with which the interests of this party , or that individual , sink into insignificance ; and which must he considered , by those who would view it aright , solely in reference to the general welfare . In this light , we have on some former occasions attempted to examine it ; and in resuming our observations , we propose to take up the history of the Bank where we left it , and to give as large an account as our limits will allow , of whatever proceedings have been since instituted in relation to it , together with some remarks on the message of the President , in which he refuses his assent to the bill passed by both Houses of Congress , modifying and renewing its charter . It is well known that the Executive has deemed it expedient , in his communications to Congress at the opening of their several sessions since his induction into office , regularly to express his objections to the Bank , and his hostility to its continued existence , as it is at present constituted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarking that he had previously , on more than one occasion , felt it his duty to declare his sentiments upon the subject , he added that he thought proper , without a more particular reference to the views of the subject then expressed , to leave it for the present to the investigation of an enlightened people , and their representatives . ' A remarkable difference of opinion , however , appeared at this time to exist between the President , and one of his official advisers . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury , on the state of the finances , bears date on the day following that of the message . There was no intimation in the latter , that the sentiments of the President had undergone a change ; on the contrary , the reference to his former communications indicated , that they remained the same as before ; while those of the Secretary of the Treasury were expressed with frankness and decision in favor of the existing Bank . He regarded its constitutionality as clearly and definitively settled ; and the experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearness , the indispensable necessity of such an institution to the fiscal operations of the country , the security of commercial transactions , and the safety and utility of the local banks . Without asserting // that the organization of the existing Bank was wholly free from objection , he insisted , that the judicious manner in which its affairs had been conducted , the accommodation which the Government and people had derived from it , and the knowledge it had acquired of the business and wants of the various sections of the country , a knowledge , which could be gained only by time and experience , together with the danger of withdrawing the facilities afforded by it , even for the purpose of transferring them to another institution , gave it strong claims upon the consideration of Congress , in any future legislation on the subject . These considerations induced him to recommend the expediency of re-chartering the Bank at the present time , and with such modifications as , without impairing its usefulness to the Government and the community , may be calculated to recommend it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitally important ,  --  to the confidence of the people . ' So early as December , 1829 , the President had recommended this matter to the consideration of Congress , as being , at that time , a proper subject for legislation ; and though he has since declared that he considers present action premature , ' it is not surprising that this circumstance , combined with the energetic exhortation of the Secretary of the Treasury , independently of the fact , that their application had been delayed as long as it could be when there was any hazard of an unfavorable decision , should have induced the officers of the Bank to present a petition for the continuance of their charter . The memorial of the President , Directors and Company of the Bank was accordingly presented early in January last , to the Senate by Mr. Dallas , and to the House of Representatives by Mr. McDuffie . In the Senate , it was referred to a select Committee . Various modes of reference were proposed in the House , but , after some debate , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 10th of February , reported a bill , the particular provisions of which it is unnecessary to notice here . Before this bill had been considered by the House , a resolution was offered by Mr. Clayton , of Georgia , providing for the appointment of a select committee to examine into the affairs of the Bank , and report thereon , and investing them with power to send for persons and papers . In the speech with which that gentleman introduced this proposition , he presented to the House certain // allegations of misconduct on the part of the officers of the institution , seven of which he considered as involving violations of its charter ; while the residue , fifteen in number , were designated by him as abuses worthy of inquiring into , not amounting to forfeiture , but going , if true , clearly to show the inexpediency of renewing it . ' Whatever might be the merits of these singular specifications , precision was not among the number . They were designated by Mr. Clayton as an indictment ; and among the counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks and brokers , to job in stocks , contrary to the charter ; ' a charge , on which none but a flinty attorney-general would put either fellow-being or corporation upon trial . These accusations were represented by Mr. Clayton as demanding an instant and rigorous investigation , which the proposed committee were to institute . On this resolution , a debate arose , which was continued about a fortnight , in the course of which various amendments were offered and successively rejected . It was at length proposed by Mr. Adams to amend the resolution , by striking out all that portion which followed the words providing for the appointment of a committee , and inserting the words to inspect the books , and to examine into the proceedings of the Bank of the United States , to report thereon , and to report whether the provisions of its charter have been violated or not . ' The amendment also empowered the committee to meet in the city of Philadelphia , invested them with authority to send for persons and papers , and instructed them to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following . As was intended by the mover , it wholly changed the character of the resolution . The mode of investigation contemplated by that resolution was one , which was regarded by Mr. Adams as neither authorized by the charter of the Bank , nor within the legitimate powers of the House . It would have affected not only the officers of that institution , but the rights , interests and characters of persons not responsible for their proceedings , and over whom the House had no control ; and was , therefore , in violation of the security to individual rights , given alike by the charter and the law . His views upon this poiAt are presented in his separate Report with great clearness and strength . It would seem that his reasoning was acquiesced in by the House ; a motion , which was made to amend his amendinent , so as to authorize the committee to inquire whether the // provisions of the charter had been abused as well as violated , was withdrawn , and the amendment of Mr. Adams was adopted without alteration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inquiries of the committee to those objects , the right of investigating which was reserved to Congress , in the charter of the Bank . It was then proposed by Mr. Everett , that the committee should consist of nine members , to be appointed by ballot ; but , at the request of others his motion was withdrawn , and the result which he obviously anticipated , took place . A majority of the committee were appointed by the speaker , from the number of those members who had voted in opposition to the amendment of Mr. Adams , and in favor of the resolution , in the form in which it originally stood , and in which it had been rejected by the House . Under these circumstances , the committee proceeded to Philadelphia , to accomplish the object of their mission . Scarcely had they begun their operations , when a. majority of their number thought proper to give a different construction to the resolution , from that which was intended by the House ; and determined to inquire , not merely whether the charter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any circumstances of mismanagement in its affairs , from the time of its foundation to that'very hou.r ; according to the schedule of abuses and suspicions , which their chairman , Mr. Clayton , had incorporated into the indictment of which we have already spoken . No objection was made to this proceeding on the part of the Bank ; its President only reminded the committee of the confidential character of its accounts with its customers ; a circumstance , which appeared to be of small moment in the estimation of the majority of their number . Such was the spirit in which the investigation was begun . As if to leave no doubt in regard to its character , the chairman entered a statement on the minutes of the committee , in which he declares that he had sought privately from one of the witnesses under examination , and from every one else likely to furnish it , information respecting the misconduct of the Bank . Far from indicating a bias in favor of the institution on the part of the committee , this proceeding served rather to betray a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The character of such a committee is or ought to be of a judicial , quite as much as an inquisitorial nature ; and this determination to find abuses by private research shows very little of the // temper of the judge . At all events , it led the committee into a field of investigation , quite too broad for the limit of any human commission ; but as if it were still too contracted , it was resolved , on motion of one of the members , Mr. Cambreleng , to proceed to examine the President and Directors of the Bank of the United States , on the question of loans , exchanges , funded debt , banking , specie and paper circulations , and on the general effect of the operations of the Bank and its branches upon the trade , industry , currency , foreign and domestic exchanges and revenue of the United States . ' This investigation appears to have been confided to Mr. Cambreleng himself , who executed it in an interminable series of questions , which it cost the President of the Bank as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits will not permit us to follow the committee in their flight through all the circles of earthly knowledge ; a task , which belongs rather to the schoolmen of less illuminated ages , than to our humble capacities . All that we can do is very briefly to examine some of the fruits with which the committee were laden , on their descent from these sublime excursions ; and we do this principally for the purpose of showing the material , out of which those violations of the charter were fabricated , of which the chairman had in the outset declared the officers of the institution guilty . It was naturally to have been expected , that in preparing his report , that gentleman would have availed himself of the opportunity of declaring their innocence , if the charges should be unsupported by the expected testimony , or if otherwise , of publishing their guilt . He did neither the one thing nor the other ; he simply stated , on the part of the majority of the committee , that they would submit to the House , without expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imputation against the Bank ; or in other words , the alleged violations of its charter . They thus conveyed the Impression , that they were persuaded of the validity of these allegations ; a fact , which is hardly to be credited . If it were so , it indicates a facility in believing , which they will find very few to share . The first on the list of supposed violations of the charter was a charge of usury , founded on a transaction which occurred ten years ago , since which time more than one generation of presidents and directors have passed away . The branch at Lexington discounted a promissory note , subscribed by William Owens and others , for four thousand dollars , // payable in three years in specie ; and this amount was received by him in notes of the Bank of Kentucky , then at a discount of fifty-four per cent. , at their nominal value . They were paid to him at his urgent solicitation . He declared , that they would answer his purpose as well as specie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the payment of debts at their nominal value . At their nominal value , had the branch at Lexington received them ; they recovered that value six months after this transaction ; so that , had the branch retained them , it would have received the full amount of them with interest . Under the agreement with Owens , the Bank received nothing more than the nominal value , and he received nothing less . When a suit was instituted on the note , the defendants offered a special plea , in which they averred , that at the time of the loan , the notes of the Bank of Kentucky were generally depreciated , so that one hundred dollars of the nominal value thereof were of the current value of only fiftyfour dollars . To this plea , the attorney for the Bank demurred , relying rather on the presumed legal invalidity of the plea , than upon the real merits of the case . The plea was , however , sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States , and the Bank was thus made to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think , that the committee need hardly have referred it to Congress to decide , whether there was any violation of the charter here . The committee next submit the question , whether the issuing of branch drafts can be justified under the provisions of the charter . The notes of the Bank , according to that instrument , are to be signed by the president and cashier ; but the labor of preparing the required number , was greater than the physical strength of any two persons could endure . Application was therefore made to Congress in 1823 , for authority to issue notes signed by other persons than these officers ; and a committee , of whom Mr. Cambreleng was one , reported that the request was reasonable and ought to be granted . This report was made in February , 1823 , within a week of the close of the session , and was not acted on . In 1827 , a new petition was presented , and referred to the Committee of Ways and Means , who made no report upon it . The opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the branches to issue drafts , or bills of exchange , drawn by those branches on the parent Bank ; and it was unani // mous in favor of that power . They were acceordingly issued , in a uniform style , resembling that of the notes of the Bank , and signed by the presidents and cashiers of the respective branches . Though payable only at the parent Bank , the credit of the institution gave them universal circulation . They were in fact an accommodation to the public , who thus effected many of their exchanges without expense , rather than to the Bank , to which , under certain circumstances , they might prove very inconvenient . The only wonder is , that the power of issuing such drafts , in the manner proposed , should ever have been questioned . Except in the fact of their uniformity , they differed in no respect from the drafts which the bank had been , and must have been , in the habit of employing . If they involved a violation of the charter , it might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the public , rather than the institution , was the gainer . It might at least have been remembered , that an opinion had been pronounced in favor of their legality , by one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States . The two next charges against the Bank are , that it has sold coin , particularly American coin , and that it has sold stock obtained from Government under special acts of Congress . Of these transactions , the first is supposed to be unauthorized by any provision of the charter , and the second expressly prohibited by the injunction against any dealing of the Bank in stocks . Foreign coins , in the opinion of a majority of the committee , are not bullion ; in that of the world at large , they unquestionably are ; but the committee argue , that if foreign coins should be considered as bullion , American coins should not , so that in one way or another , the Bank has gone beyond its powers . The right of dealing in bullion , or foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any doubt that might exist respecting the power of the Bank in this particular ; while that of dealing in current coin is incident to the very nature of such an institution . These coins are bought by the Bank at their intrinsic value , and sold by it in the same manner ; nor could it well he otherwise ; for if the Bank were forbidden to allow an advance in purchasing , or to receive any advance in the sale of them , it would be a simple prohibition against paying out , or importing , or purchasing specie , in any case whatever . With respect to the sale of stock , the argument of the majority of the commit*ee appears to be founded on a misconception of the provisions // 1832 . Bank of the United States . of the charter . The Bank is prohibited from buying any portion of the public debt , but it is not forbidden to sell any evidences of that debt which it may lawfully possess , and it is expressly authorized to subscribe for government stock ; over which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appertain to every other owner of all other property . The majority of the committee would not have anticipated much danger from the exercise of the right of selling , if they had adverted to the fact , that the purposes of speculation in stock are poorly answered by the mere privilege of selling , without that of buying also . At all events , it requires more than common sagacity to detect in either of the above operations , any violation of the charter of the Bank . Indeed , the right of selling public stock has been employed by it in seasons of peril , very much for the security of commercial credit , and the general welfare of the country . The two last supposed violations of the charter , as suggested by the majority of the committee , are the making of donations for roads , canals , and other purposes , and the building of houses to rent or sell , and the erection of other structures in aid of that object . In their statement of these , as in other instances , their Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from the guilt of this offending corporation . Express authority is given it by its charter , to purchase real estate , which it may hold in mortgage as security for the payment of debts previously contracted , as well as such as may be sold under executions in its own favor . By the failure of many of its debtors in the Western States , it was some years ago compelled to become the owner of a large amount of real property . The donations here alluded to were small subscriptions made for the imirovement of such estate in the vicinity cf its own , with the view of enhancing the value of the latter , and small sums contributed to fire insurance companies for its security ; and the building in question was executed , in order to put the property of the Bank in a more eligible condition for sale . No persons except the majority of the committee can believe , that the Bank would voluntarily become the purchaser of real estate at all ; and it is difficult to conceive , why those gentlemen should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mighty speculations , to lay out a road or build a warehouse for the public detriment . The right of placing property in a // situation to be profitably held , or advantageously sold , is incident to the right of ownership ; for it would be strange indeed , if the Bank were only authorized to hold this property on such terms , as may render it entirely worthless . Such is a cursory survey of the charges , which a majority of a select committee of the House of Representatives have presented to that body , as violations of the charter of the Bank of the United States ; in regard to which they do no more than intimate their own opinion , but leave it to the House to appreciate their enormity . It seems almost like ridicule , to bring them forward with the solemnity of criminal accusations . Indeed , if the character of those legislators were not at war with such a supposition , one might imagine them to be indulging themselves in a jest , designed to be at the expense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dwelt upon them thus lightly , because they are examined in the Report of the niinority of the committee briefly , but with much ability , and in that of Mr. Adams , with his characteristic force and directness . No stronger evidence could be desired of the correct and judicious manner in which the affairs of the Bank have been conducted , than is afforded by the fact , that these are the foremost ofihuces in the dark catalogue of its crimes . Other accusations there certainly were , but they were not urged as violations of the charter ; they came under the head of abuses worth inquiring into , and into which the committee did accordingly inquire with abundant alacrity and zeal . The officers of the bank were charged , among other things , with having loaned large sums to the editors of public journals , with the view of securing the press in aid of their nefarious purposes ; and the private affairs of these individuals were accordingly investigated and made public , in order to excite against them some odious suspicions of corruption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been indiscriminately made , as well to those editors whose sentiments were hostile , as to those whose opinions were favorable to the Bank ; it was to no purpose , that a case of suspicion . at the worst , was all that could possibly be proved ; it was to no purpose , that the minority of the committee remonstrated against this exposure of the private affairs of individuals ;  --  the majority of the committee went triumphantly on in their brilliant career , and at last left it to the better judgment of the House to decide , on the facts which they . had collected and spread on the face of their Report , whether such // cases of corruption had any actual existence or not . We do not propose to enter upon the examination of these details ; we could add nothing to the considerations which are set forth by Mr. Adams , in his stern and indignant commentary on the examination , and its results . We will only observe , that there is no censor so rigid , as a political partisan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; every action is uniformly attributed to the worst imaginable motive , and the possibility of the existence of a good motive , or of the absence of an evil one , is never for a moment admitted . If the Bank loan money to an editor who is opposed to it , it is bribery ; if it advance money on competent security to a friendly one , it is the wages of iniquity . Let its officers adopt whatever course they may , they are sure to furnish conclusive evidence of their own guilt . Now there is obviously no reason , why those who happen to pursue the calling of editors of public journals , should be deprived of the facilities for the conduct of their business which they require , and which all other persons possess . It is just as reasonable to suppose that every editor , who opposes the Bank of the United States , is the slave of the State Banks , as to assume that all who support it are bought by its accommodations . Indeed , the mere loaning of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , as of necessity to call for the sacrifice of principle and independence in requital . In the particular instance which is dwelt upon with much emphasis by the majority of the committee , we understand that the loan was made on good security , though for a longer term than usual ; but when the officers of the Bank , men of unquestioned honor and integrity , whose assertions are not lightly esteemed in the community of which they are members , promptly and indignantly disclaim the motive thus imputed to them , of'insinuating themselves ' in this way into the management of the press , there seems to he no propriety in charging them with falsehood and hypocrisy . We may , perhaps , doubt their prudence ; but it is going a little too far , to magnify imprudence into fraud and corruption . There is one fact , relating to this and the other investigations of the committee , which is worthy of remark . So far as we are informed , no argument was founded on their Report , either b*y friend or foe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank , in the body of which they were members . After these Reports had been severally presented to the // House , the Senate resumed the consideration of a bill to modify and continue the charter of the Bank , which had been previously reported by the select committee , to whom the memorial of the President and Directors was referred . It was adopted by that body , after a deliberate and ample discussion . The following is a cursory account of its provisions . It proposed to continue the charter for the term of fifteen years following the third day of March , 1336 . Authority was given to the Directors to appoint two or more officers to sign notes for a smaller sum than one hundred dollars , which were to be of the same validity as if signed in the usual manner . No notes , checks or drafts , which were not declared upon their face to be payable at the Bank where they should be issued , were to be put in circulation . The Bank and its branches were required to receive all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payable on their face , in payment of balances due to them from the State Banks . No real estate , except the Bank buildings and lands mortgaged , was to be held by the Bank for a longer term than five years . Two offices only were to be established or continued in any one State . The sum of $200,000 was to be paid annually to the Government , during the period of fifteen years , as a consideration for the benefits resulting from the charter . Congress was to retain the power of preventing the Bank from issuing or keeping in circulation notes of a smaller denomination than twenty dollars . A list of the names of all stockholders , together with a statement of the number of shares held by then ) respectively , was to he furnished annually to the Secretary of the Treasury , and to the Treasurer of any State , who should apply for it . This bill was also passed by the House of Representatives , with an amendment , allowing the continuance of more than two branches , where they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the amendment ; and in this form the bill was sent to the President for his signature . It was shortly afterwards returned by him to the Senate , accompanied with a Message , in which he assigns at length the reasons which induce him to refuse it his assent . Before we proceed to offer any remarks upon this document , it may be proper to look for a moment at the early history of the institution , the merits of which the President has never yet been able to perceive . Neither in this Message , nor in any allusion which he has heretofore made , is there a single // ray of light , to relieve the dark shadows of the picture he has drawn . It was in 1811 , that the charter of the first Bank of the United States expired . The paper of the State Banks was poured out in a defuge , to fill the vacancy occasioned by the loss of its circulation . In two or three years after , every bank , to the South and West of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No man needs to be informed of the effects of the depreciation of the currency which followed . In addition to the destruction of business , the interruption of confidence , the loss of credit , and the reckless and fatal spirit of speculation , there was a deep and real distress in some portions of the country , which seemed hardly to admit of any relief . In the midst of the complicated mischiefs growing out of this state of things , and for the purpose , as far as might be , of remedying them , the existing Bank of the United States was established . The renewal of the charter of the former one would probably have prevented their occurrence ; but it was not so clear , that the creation of the new one would remove the evil , by restoring the currency from its state of alarming and unprecedented depreciation . Other experiments had been tried , and tried in vain . Peace had returned , but no return of specie payments came with it . Public opinion called loudly for their resumption , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entreated , prayed , but all in vain . Some of the State Banks were willing to adopt the measure ; others could not be persuaded to relinquish the golden harvest , which they alone were gathering ; nor is there any reason to believe that the object could have been accomplished , without the intervention of the Bank of the United States . The course of that institution was prompt and resolute . Instead of retiring , as it might have done with profit to itself , from a difficult and ungrateful task , it manfully and readily met the exigency ; it proposed a compact , by which on the one hand the State Banks pledged themselves to resume specie payments , xvhile the Bank of the United States , on the other , pledged its resources to sustain them in the operation . It did sustain them ; it did effect its purpose . We have the testimony of Mr. Dallas , no undistinguished name , and of Mr. Lowndes , a man not apt to be mistaken , and not likely to deceive , in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fulfilled . It has ever since preserved the currency of the country in as sound a condition as one which consists in a large proportion of paper can ever be maintained . // Yet the President of the United States was so little impressed by these facts , that he declared the Bank to have failed in the great end of establishing a sound and uniform currency ; and in the Message which is now before us , has taken other very unfavorable views of its tendency and operation , which might induce the uninformed to suppose , that it is nothing better than the source of accumulated evils . Of this paper , we would speak with the respect due to the official station of the President of the United States ; but we deem it neither unbecoming nor unjust to say , that his name must have been attached to it under the influence of feelings of stern and unchangeable aversion to the Bank . There is hardly a paragraph , in which these feelings are not betrayed ; there is not one , in which its merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its privileges , as if they could he designated by no other word , than an unpopular and odious one . But what is this monopoly ? Not the privilege of loaning money ; that is possessed by every individual in the land . Not a monopoly of the right of issuing notes for circulation ; that it enjoys in common with dome three or four hundred other institutions , existing under the authority of the several States . The power of issuing notes is one , which is every where , by the policy of our laws , taken from individuals , and conferred on corporations , subject to the supervision and control of the public authorities ; and , moreover , paying largely for the privileges thus accorded to them . The Government of the United States , in consideration of a large amount directly paid , and of services rendered of great moment to the public welfare , confers this privilege on a single institution . It employs no more , because no more are needed for the purpose . Beyond this , there is no justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges of the Bank , which are exclusive only , because it could not otherwise exist . TI'e Bank enjoys no monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchanges . Every individual has the same right of dealing in these , that he possessed before it was established ; and if he can not profitably pursue the business , it only proves , that the premium has been reduced by the Bank to the lowest rate , and that the funds of individuals are transferred at the least possible expense . Before it was instituted , the premium of exchange , paid in general at the West for bills on the large commercial cities , as we are assured on competent authority , was 2* per // cent. , and in many instances , much larger : now , at the highest , it is one half of one per cent. ; and in a great number of cases , where drafts or notes are used , no premium on the transfer of funds is paid at all . So with respect to foreign exchanges , the operations of the Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuation in the demand , and , as a seller of them , in the supply ; and it purchases and sells upon the most favorable terms , because if it did not , the business would pass into other hands . There is obviously no monopoly here ; nothing but an extensive , but not exclusive dealing on the part of the Bank , of great advant*ge to the community . In various other portions of this document , expressions are used which , if they proceeded from any other source , would seem to have been intended merely to excite unmeritbd prejudice against the institution . Its stockholders are mentioned as a privileged class , enjoying favors and gratuities , from which the mechanic and the laborer are excluded ; as if the same reproach were not just as applicable to those of every local hank . The erection of such an institution is denounced , as an alarming encroachment on the rights of the States ; when , if there be any encroachment in the case , the regulation of the currency , which has so long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed an encroachment on the rights of the Union ; and the constitutional prohibition of the power of directly taxing the Bank by the States is lamented , without any apparent admission of the fact , that such a power to tax is nothing less than a power to annihilate . But we have no room to dwell upon these subjects , and can only express our regret that topics of this sort are introduced into a state-paper , where one would not naturally look for aught resembling an appeal to prejudice . The first and immediate effect of renewing the charter of the bank , in the manner contemplated by the bill , would , in the judgment of the Executive , be to raise the value of the stock to nearly fifty per cent . above its par value . This advance , equal to seventeen millions , would be , he says , a mere donation to the stockholders ; whereas , on the contrary , it should be paid into the treasury of the United States ; because , if these monopolies are tobe sold atall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is doubtless true , that the Government , in granting any charter , must act for the benefit of the people , and not of those on whom it is bestowed ; and it is universally*idmitted , that // a reasonable compensation should be paid by the latter , for the privileges thus conferred upon them . When their charter was originally granted , they paid to the Government a million and a half of dollars , and became bound to transfer the national funds , and to transact the business previously performed by the various loan offices , without pecuniary compensation . It is now proposed , that they shall pay the sum of two hundred thousand dollars annually , during the term of their charter . This is the amount , which both Houses of Congress , after much deliberation , have fixed upon as just and reasonable . It should not be forgotten , that the profits which the Bank can derive from the government deposits , since the reduction of the revenue , will be far less than they have been heretofore , xvhile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater ; and it must be remembered also , that if the Government is to receive all the profits of the charter , individuals can have no motive for accepting it . Now , if the suggestions of the President were adopted , it is very obvious that the stockholders , far from receiving any benefit , would experience a positive loss . Nothing but the wildest spirit of speculation could raise the price of the stock , in the manner which he supposes ; and if such should be the fact , that price would be but momentary , as it would he far beyond its real value . Admitting , however , that this should be the result , and that the Bank should pay for its privileges one half the amount of its capital stock : it would then require an advance of one hundred per cent . on the remaining amount , to raise the stock even to its nominal value . Under these circumstances , the stockholders could not accept the charter without the certainty of loss . The same remark may be applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter , which have been liberally made . If the stock of a new bank , which should be bound to pay ten millions into the treasury , could be subscrihed , which we conceive to be absolutely impossible , there could result nothing but loss to those unfortunate enough to be its holders . The fallacy of the argument arises from laying out of view the fact , that the advanced value of the stock has arisen in part from the judicious management of the niffairs of the institution , and the hold which it has obtained upon the public confidence ; advantages , slowly gained , and not to be readily acquired by a new one . If any persons are to he benefited by the granting of the // charter , the benefit would seem to belong to those who have made the institution what it is , rather than to any other given number of individuals . The suggestion of the President is , that the whole American people should be allowed to become competitors for the purchase ; but it is evident that , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons ; and there is no reason , why they should not be possessed by the present stockholders , as well as by any other equal number . The only interest which the public at large can have is , that they should be exercised in the manner most likely to promote the general good . This security , as it appears to us , would be found in the renewed existence of the present institution , quite as certainly as in any other way . Another objection , which stands in the van of the President 's long array of objections to the bill , is the danger of allowing foreigners to become proprietors of the stock . Eight millions of it in amount are already in their hands , and , owing to the mode of taxation to which its American holders are subject , he apprehends that nearly the whole will sooner or later be concentrated in the hands of foreigners , and employed by them to effect the ruin of our institutions . In this way , an event , which would not under any circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank is constituted , never can occur , is represented as an inipending and unavoidable evil . Every one knows , that foreigners are prevented , by the charter of the institution itself , from exercising any influence in the management of its affairs ; and if they had power to do this , a sufficient motive for undertaking it would still be wanting . Why should they purchase the stock , in order to exercise a control which the purchase of the stock will not give them , and which , in a season of exigency , supposed in the very statement of the objection , would , if they obtained it , be much more likely to expose their property to peril , than the institutions of this country ? The foreign holders of American bank stock are not very likely to become conspirators and incendiaries : they would not be ambitious of breaking down the pillars of any temple of Dagon , under whose ruins they would be the first to perish . It would be no sport to these engineers to hoist with their own petard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be the remotest , which represents a company of merchants and bankers as anxious to spring a mine for the destruction of nations , at their own personal expense . We // have , however , some instructive experience upon this point . Of the twenty-five thousand shares , into which the stock of the first Bank of the United States was divided , eighteen thousand were held by foreigners in the year 1809 . Then was the time , if ever , for these enemies of freedom and good order*to accomplish their wicked purposes . The cry of foreign influence was ringing from one extremity of the Union to the other ; the signs of the times were dark and ominous , and the charter was about to expire ; but we have never heard among the rumors of that eventful period , either that this stock was purchased by the secret service money of Great Britain , or that its real owners exhibited any ambition to sacrifice the Government , which gave their property protection . If any danger of the sort existed , it would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock of local banks , canal or rail-road stock , or that of any State in the hands of foreigners , as from their possessing that of the Bank of the United States ; but we have never heard of objections on the part of any State , that they should become the owners of this species of property . There appears in fact to be some mistake in the premises , which are to lead to so disastrous a conclusion . It is the taxation of stockholders here , while foreigners are believed to be exempted from the burden , . which the President thinks likely to accumulate the stock in the hands of the latter . He supposes that the bill concedes to the States the right of taxing the interest of resident stockholders , while that of foreigners , being free from any such exaction , will be the more valuable of the two . But the bill in truth concedes nothing of this kind . If the States did not possess this right of taxation before , no act of Congress can give it to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . They always have possessed , and do still possess it , and we know no reason to doi*ibt that it has been exercised . All that the bill proposed to do , was to render it more easy than it is now , to ascertain the precise amount of the interest of resident stockholders ; by requiring that a list of their names , with the number of shares held by them respectively , should be furnished on application to the treasurer of any State . But without any such provision , the tax would be no more likely to be evaded , than a tax on money at interest , or various other kinds of property . In the same manner may the foreign stockholder be made liable to similar taxation at home ; and // his tax would in all probability not be lighter , than that of the native owner of the stock . The only effect of subjecting the foreign stockholder to taxation here , would be , to render the stock less valuable abroad than it is at home ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting the proposition of the President to prohibit its sale to aliens , under penalty of absolute forfeiture . ' The truth is , that much of this stock is sent abroad in the way of remittance , thus answering the purposes , and saving the exportation of specie , and not simply because it is desired as a means of permanent investment ; but if it were sold only to those who wish to retain it , it must be obvious , that they would be interested in the preservation , rather than the destruction of our Government , precisely in proportion to the extent of their interest in the stock . The error of the Message arises from a supposition , at variance , as we believe , with the observation and experience of practical men , that there is in our country at this moment a superabundance of capital . The increase of capital , however great it may be , is not equal to that of the demands of industry and enterprise . In the absence of our own , that of foreigners comes in to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were not wanted and could notbe advantageously employed . A nation that neither wants nor requires it , would no more think of procuring it abroad , than he who has money which he wishes to loan , would think of borrowing of his neighbor . Within a few months , a loan to the amount of several millions has been negociated abroad . The capital , thus introduced , animates and quickens industry in all its branches ; sets the cars of our rail-roads in motion ; impels the boats that crowd our navigable canals ; and pours itself through a thousand channels , to swell the broad tide of our national prosperity . We can not but regret that the President should have thought proper to utter a denunciation , which must , so far as it has any effect at all , diminish the value of American stock in every market in the world . By one of the provisions of the bill , the notes of the Bank and of its branches , though declared on their faces to be payable at one place only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balances due from the State Banks . This provision , in the opinion of the President , though sufficiently just as far as respects those Banks , is yet most odious , // because it confers on these institutions a privilege which is denied to individuals ; and hecause it tends to unite the local Banks and that of the United States in the consummation of any measures , which may conduce to the common benefit of all . From this language it would naturally be inferred , that the people were about to be deprived of some right which the Bank might well be required to allow , and which they may properly claim . But what is this supposed right ? Simply , that all the notes issued by the Bank and all its offices , shall be made payable at every office ; or , in other words , that each office shall be constantly provided with funds to redeem , not only its own notes , but the notes of all the rest . This would be merely to ordain , that no branches shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to require , that each State Bank should redeem the notes of every other . So far as this can be done with safety , it is already done by the Bank of the United States , from a regard to its own interest , and to extend the circulation of its notes ; and its extensive dealings in exchange afford it greater facilities for so doing , than any other ins*tution could possess . Its five dollar notes are already paid in this manner ; and the instances are rare , in which similar payment has been refused in regard to notes of any denomination . But if it were under*an imperative and indispensable obligation to redeem its notes , not merely at the offices whence they are issued , but at every other , the expense and burden of such a requisition , if the thing were practicable , xvould he too great for any institution to bear . On the occurrence of a pressure in the money-market of any commercial city where a branch may chance to he established , the hills of every branch which could possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch for redemption , in addition to its own . These notes are now as valuable as specie ; that is , wherever they may be issued , they are any where convertible into it , at a premium which is no greater than the expense of transporting specie ; and to require any thing farther , would he to compel the Bank gratuitously to perform the exchanges of every individual in every section of the country . We know not that there is any complaint against its present course in this respect ; reasonable complaint , we think , there can be none . Even as respects State Banks , the provision would be wholly nugatory . It is designed to guard against the exercise of a power , which the Bank has never used ; that of effecting // a combination among several branches , to send the notes of a particular bank to a branch in its vicinity for collection , while the bank , thus called upon , can offer only in exchange the notes of the branch which demands the payment . The dealings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been such , as to call for the application of any remedy like this . It has been urged , says the President , as an argument in favor of re-chartering the Bank , that the calling in of its loans will produce general embarrassment and distress ; and he replies to this argument by maintaining , that this can not be the case , unless its management has been bad ; in which event the fault will be its own . The argument , if well founded , will in his opinion never be less powerful than it is now ; so that , if it have any force , the Bank must be permitted to endure forever . If , however , the facilities which it gives are required by the industry and commerce of the country ; if , as we shall presently attempt to show , they are of indispensable necessity to some particular sections , it by no means follows , that any distress , which might result from the sudden withdrawal of those facilities , would be ascribed with justice to mismanagement on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reasonable to prohibit agriculture , and hold the farmer responsible for the injuries of the famine . Some parts of the country are rich in industry and enterprise , but poor in capital ; in obedience to one of the purposes of its institution , the Bank pours out its capital there ; it can not be suffered to depart , because there is nothing to supply its place . Undoubtedly , if there be any imperious necessity for destroying it , the evil must be encountered . But shall we destroy it , simply because it must at some time perish , like all things earthly , and because we may chance to think that it can be no more easily destroyed at any future day ? A proposition of this kind can only be supported on the ground , that the institution is dangerous as well as useless . The doctrine of the Message in fact is , that it is full of evil in all its tendency and operations . The amount of stock held in the nine Western States , ' observes the President , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and in the Easterii and Middle states about 13,522,000 dollars . The profits of the Bank in 1831 , as shown in a statement to Congress , were about 3,455,598 dollars ; of this there accrued in the nine Western States about 1,640,048 , in // the four Southern States about 352,507 dollars , and in the Middle and Eastern States about 1,463,041 dollars . As little stock is held in the West , it is obvious that the debt of the people in those States is principally a debt to the Eastern and foreign stockholders ; that the interest they pay upon it is carried into the Eastern States and into Europe ; and that it is a burden upon their industry , and a drain of their currency , which no country can bear without inconvenience and occasional distress . ' If we were called upon to point out the most obvious and striking example of the beneficial operations of the Bank , we hardly know to wha*t quarter we should more readily turn , than to the section thus exhausted and oppressed ; or from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , than from those which are here arrayed in testimony of its evils . XVhat was the condition of the Western States a few years ago , and what is it now ? Before the operations of the Bank were conducted on their *present scale , the people of these States had all the natural advantages , of which they are in possession at present ;  --  the same magk*al fertility of soil , which hardly asks the aid of patient industry , to yield its golden harvest ; the same bold spirit of enterprise , which laughs at danger and privation ; the same magnificent rivers , to bear the produce of their labor to the sea . But all these availed them comparatively little , so long as the capital procured by their industry was absorbed in new improvements , and enough could not be aflbrded , to circulate the productions of their labor . In order to supply this deficiency , banks were established , without any of those salutary restrictions , which experience has shoivn to be essential to guard the public against the multiplied calamities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were established for the very reason that capital was wanting . For a time , the expedient appeared to answer its intended purpose ; but the interest of their proprietors combined with the demands of the public to induce unlimited issues of paper , and the ' inevitable consequences were soon revealed . It was impossible for the banks to redeem their notes , and their value sunk at once in the hands of the holders . Creditors , however , were compelled to receive them or not be paid at all ; for the fatal remedy of stop and relief laws , which always ag*ravate the evil they are meant to cure , was instantly applied to prevent the utter ruin of the debtor . These measures produced no other effect , than that of taking the // property of one man and giving it to another , of enriching the speculator , and destroying all that confidence , without which the elements of society are feebly held together . Those who would gladly have removed from this scene of ruin found it impossible , because the paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely worthless in another . Nothing could be imagined more fatal to industry , than such a state of things as this ; and we are confident , that we do not attribute too much to the operation of the Bank of the United States , when we say that it did more than any other cause , to rescue the Western States from these accumulated evils ; not indeed in the outset of its operations , but since it has been conducted on its present extensive and judicious plan . But the depreciation of the local currency , though by far the greatest , was not the only evil . The merchant , who carried this depreciated paper beyond the limits of his own State to purchase supplies , was of course compelled to exchange it for such funds as might serve his purpose ; and the rate of discount was graduated according to the risk and difficulty of obtaining payment of the notes he carried with him . It is needless to explain the consequences resulting from a necessity of estimating the solvency of banks in establishing that rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of an unsound currency . Under the present system , the mischiefs arising from a depreciated and fluctuating currency are not likely to return . The paper of the Bank of the United States is every where received in payments to the Government , and every where equivalent to specie , and the depreciated currency of other banks can not be kept for any length of time in circulation . Their issues are thus limited by their ability to redeem them . At present , the beneficial influence of that institution is more distinctly visible in the operations of exchange ; and from these , individuals in all sections of the country derive real , if not equal benefit . For all commercial purposes , they are brought into the immediate vicinity of each other . The merchant in New York , who sells goods to the dealer in Cincinnati , draws on the latter for the amount ; the Bank purchases his bill on the most favorable terms , and provides him with funds for further operations without hazard or delay . The facilities given to the Western merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . His trade is in the first instance carried on with the Western and Southwestern // States , and with the drafts received in return for his produce , he may purchase his supplies in the Atlantic cities . If he send it to New Orleans , his bills , drawn on the proceeds , are bought by the branch in his neighborhood , and remitted to that city . When , ' says the President of the Bank , the notes issued by the several branches find their way in the course of trade to the Atlantic branches , the Western branches pay the Atlantic branches by drafts on their funds accumulated at the branch in New Orleans , which there pay the Atlantic branches by bills growing out of the purchases made in New Orleans on account of the Northern merchants or manufacturers ; thus conipleting the circle of the operations . ' The Western dealer is thus enabled immediately to pay to the cultivator the price of his crop , while he himself receives the amount for which he sells it at New Orleans . The influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry of the West . The merchant of the seaboard might obtain less complete accommodation elsewhere ; but the people of the West must obtain it from the Bank , or obtain it as they did several years ago , for a price , at the very lowest , five times greater than it is at present . Yet even this , important as it is , is not the only benefit which the Western States derive from the Bank . Their demand for capital , to keep the ponderous wheels of their ever-active industry in motion , is supplied by loans to the amount of many millions of dollars , apart from the acceptances of bills drawn on other parts of the country . The capital , thus furnished by the Bank , can not be drawn to the same extent from other sources . On the very statement of the President of the United States , the West would obviously not be able to supply its place . It is provided for them by the Bank , at the interest of six per cent. , a rate far lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would readily give ; and the lowest portion of the profits upon it is remitted to those by whom it is provided , while its substantial benefits remain , and animate and brighteii the prosperity of that singularly favored portion of our land . Such is the picture , in which the Pr*sident can see nothing but darkness and gloomy shades ; - such is the drain upon the currency , and the burden upon the industry of the West ! But what consequences are to follow , when these facilities shall be withdrawn , as withdrawn they must be , so far as we have any understanding of the views of the President of the // United States ,  --  so far , certainly , as the decision of the question rests with him ? Even if another similar institution were to be created , they must still be withdrawn , because years must elapse , before the same could be afforded by the new . The term of its charter , now remaining , will hardly be sufficient to enable the present Bank to call in its debts and withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to form no part of the President 's design . That design has been already communicated in a former message , in which he proposed to establish a Bank without power to issue notes , without power to make loans , and with authority merely to buy and sell exchange with the deposits of the Government ; which , as we have seen , must in future be more limited than they have been heretofore , and derived from revenue , a small portion of which only is collected in the West . For aught , then , that appears , an incalculable amount of money is in the course of less than four years to be remitted in discharge of debts , from the Western States to the Atlantic cities and to foreign countries . The circulation of the Bank , which constitutes the only currency of several of those States and a large proportion of that of all , must disappear . In what manner this debt is to be paid , is beyond the power of the imagination to conceive ; but it may safely be predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in comparison with which , all the calamities which have heretofore beset that portion of our land , would be prosperity and happiness . Nor is the place of that circulation to be supplied by the erection of State Banks , in such a crisis . The capital , on which alone those institutions could be safely founded , would be withdrawn ; and they could but ill supply the want of capital , when its deficiency is the very cause of their creation . Such fabrics , built in the eclipse , ' could show no canvass on a heavy sea . Their notes would rush at once to the branches of the Bank , in payment of the overwhelming debt . Experience is full of lessons on this subject , to which it would be madness not to listen ; but eloquent as it is , it can not adequately tell the danger . It were almost as well , that the magnificent Father of waters , rolling onward to the sea with the golden fruits of a continent upon his bosom , ploughed by a thousand keels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine he reflects , in his majestic course , were suddenly exhausted of his mighty flood . // We had ventured to entertain the opinion , that the constitutional power of Congress to incorporate a Bank was as fairly settled , as any power ever can be ; but we are informed by the President , that the fact is otherwise ; that it is neither settled by precedent , nor by the decision of the Supreme Court ; not by precedent , because if the Congresses of P791 and 1816 decided in favorof a bank , ' those of 1811 , and 1815 , decided against it ; nor by the decision of the Supreme Court , because , besides that this tribunal has no authority to control Congress or the Executive , when acting in their legislative capacities , it has never decided that all the features ' of the present Bank are constitutional . It is obvious that the acts of Congress , by which banks have been erected , carry with them an authority , which the rejection by that body of certain bills presented to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power , they declare plainly enough that they believe themselves to possess it ; but when they decline to use it , their unwillingness may arise from an objection to the particular mode of exercising it which is offered for their consideration , as well as from a conviction that they want the power . Thus in 1815 , President Madison , in the same Message in which he refused his assent to a bill for the incorporation of a bank , declared that he waived the constitutional question , as being precluded , in his judgment , by repeated recognitions , under varied circumstances , of the validity of such an institution , in acts of the legislative , executive , and judicial branches of the Government , accompanied by indications , in different modes , of a concurrence of the general will of the nation . ' His rejection of a particular bill , under these circumstances , could not well be quoted as a proof , that he denied to the Legislature the possession of the constitutional power . The Congress of 1815 doubted it as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the President rejected . In the other instance mentioned in the Message , that of the Congress of 1811 , the power was , if not affirmed , at least , not denied . A bill was actually passed by the House of Representatives in that year for the incorporation of a Bank , which was rejected in the Senate by the casting vote of the Vice President ; but one of the Senators who voted in opposition to it has declared , that he never at any time entertained a doubt respecting the constitutional power , and that his objection was founded on some particular provisions of the bill . The hostile // precedents therefore vanish , while the power of Congress to incorporate a bank has been affirmed in every conceivable mode , by the almost unanimous opinion of distinguished statesmen , the uniform action of the Government , and the ready acquiescence of the people . With as little justice can it be maintained , that the question is not yet settled by the authority of the judicial tribunals of the United States . The Message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of the particular bill of the last session of Congress are constitutional . They have however affirmed the constitutionality of the existing charter , which this bill was intended to renew . We regret to perceive , that the President appears himself to entertain doubts of the constitutional power of Congress to incorporate any other institution , than such an one as he has himself recommended in a former Message ; one which would certainly not come within any constitutional prohibition , if any such existed , to incorporate a Bank . We will here allude to some other portions of the Message , which convince us , that the assent of the President to any bill for the incorpcration of a bank , bearing the least resemblance to the existing one , is not to be expected . In attempting to show , that the provisions of the bill are not such as are necessary and proper to enable Congress to carry into execution any of their powers , he points to the section in which it is declared that no other bank shall be established during the continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one Congress on the just authority of several successive future ones . The doctrine is simply this ; that Congress can make no contract , which shall be binding on their successors . If this doctrine be well founded , nothing is more certain than the fact , that all certificates of public stock , all pledges of property of the Government for the payment of the public debt , all subscriptions to the stock of incorporated companies for the purposes of internal improvement , all contracts , in short , of every description whatsoever , perish with the Congresses by which they are made . We do not consider it necessary to do more than state this proposition ; it is enough for our present purpose to say , that no individual , in the full possession of his senses , could ever become a subscriber to the stock of an institution , which the same power that made , could the next moment destroy . As if the doctrine were not stated with sufficient clearness , the President shortly after de // 512 Oct. dares , that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sales of exclusive privileges for a limited time , or a time without limit , to restrict or extinguish its own discretion in the choice of means to execute its delegated powers , is equivalent to a legislative amendment of the constitution , and palpably unconstitutional . ' Again : By its silence , in connexion with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of McCulloch against the State of Maryland , ' says the Message , this act takes from the States the power to tax a portion of the banking business carried on within their limits , in subversion of one of the strongest barriers which secured them against Federal encroachments ; ' and this supposed power is declared to be one , to which the States ought pertinaciously to cling , ' and of which it is unconstitutional to deprive them . It is worthy of remark , that the right of taxing the parent Bank , which is here considered as a clear State right , has not before been claimed ; all that has been contended for , is that of taxing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill concedes no right of taxation whatever to the States ; if they do not possess it , it is denied them by the constitution of the United States ; if they do , no act of Congress could take the right away . The right for which the Message contends is that of taxing the circulation of the Bank . The power of taxation is unlimited ; it involves that of complete annihilation . There must be some singular confusion of powers , if Congress may do that , which the States may forcibly prevent ; if Concress has power to erect an institution , which the States have equal power to overthrow . The argument proceeds upon the assumption , that the power over all banking business , including that of regulating the currency , belongs exclusively to the States ; and if the assumption have any foundation , it shows Ciat Congress have no jurisdiction over the subject at all . With such views , how can the assent of the President be given to any bank of circulation , at any future day ? How could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equivalent to a deliberate and dangerous assumption on the part of Congress of a right plainly reserved to the several States ? Or , if he should consent to do this , how could individuals be induced to invest their property , where , at any moment of dissatisfaction , it could be swept at once into the treasury of any State ? We hold , therefore , that on the principles of the Message , not only the days of this Bank are numbered , but // that , so far as depends on the Executive , it would be delusion to look for the creation of any other ; excepting such an one , without power to make loans , without power to issue notes , without property and without credit , as he has himself already recommended . It was not without surprise , that we saw the following doctrine promulgated on the authority of the President of the United States . It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives , of the Senate , and of the President , to decide upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them for passage or approval , as it is of the Supreme Judges , when it may be brought before them for judicial decision . The opinion of the Judges has no more authority over Congress , than the opinion of Congress has over the Judges ; and on that point , the President is independent of both . The authority of the Supreme Court must not , therefore , be permitted to control Congress or the Executive , when acting in their legislative capacities , but to have only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve . ' If by this it be intended to assert , that the Supreme Court have no authority to interpose to prevent the passage of an unconstitutional law , the proposition is doubtless true ; hut it goes farther . It declares that , after the Supreme Court have declared a law to be unconstitutional , Congress may properly re-enact it , whenever they see fit . If such be its real meaning , a doctrine more fatal to the operation of our Government is not easily to be conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court had at any time decided against the power of the Legislature to create a hank , they might the very next moment establish one , without any violation of the spirit of the constitution ? The constitution is nothing more than the recorded will of the people of the Union ; in all controversies respecting its intent and meaning , it is ordained by that supreme will , that the Court , and not the Legislature shall decide . By such a doctrine , a legislative body , acting under certain powers , are at liberty to do , not only what the tribunal which is commissioned hy the people to decide in doubtful cases respecting the extent of those powers , declare that they do not authorize , but that they explicitly forbid . The judicial power is thus made to rest upon the arm of other authority , and may at any hour be crushed beneath it . All the restrictions by which the wisdom of our fathers would have checked the VOL . XXxV. - NO. 77. // unlimited exercise of legislative discretion , are swept away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier to shield our civil rights , are prostrate in the dust . The whole action of the system of our Government is converted into a mere battle between its several departments , for power and victory . Indeed , the tone of the Message throughout , as respects the Supreme Court of the United States , is not what we had hoped to see ; here , as well as elsewhere , it seems to haVe fallen on evil days , if not on exil tongues . It is now more than forty years , since that great and dignified tribunal was first erected . During that whole period , some of the wisest and best men of our country have filled its seats ; its moral influence , like the invisible attraction which holds the universe together , has preserved , each in its place and order , the various and mighty elements of our social system . The world affords no finer spectacle , than the tranquil but majestic operation of a power like this ; relying , not on that force which unintelligent things obey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom ; no nobler example of proud and dignified self-denial , than the act , by which millions consented to do homage at the venerable shrine of reason and of law . Like all things else in the constitution of our Government , it had its birth in the united public will . It may be overthrown by violence , or it may be undermined by the slow efforts of illiberal hostility . But if it he the will of Providence , that its pillars should be shaken , the whole fabric of that Government will perish in a common ruin ; the days of our country 's glory will be numbered and finished ; - her historian may shut the book ; - her star will go down in blood . It is contended in the Message , that the Supreme Court have done no more than to decide , that Congress may incorporate a bank ; but that they have never yet decided , that the features ' of the existing charter are constitutional . The Court , it maintains , in the case of MeCulloch against the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature to decide upon the degree of the necessity of such an institution , and thus admitted , that the details , the particular features of the act , are points with which the Judges conceive themselves to have nothing to do ; and it then proceeds to argue , that several of the provisions of the existing act are not necessary to enable the Bank to perform the duties assigned to it as a public agent , and are of course unwarranted by the constitu-. // tion . Here is apparently a cold and reluctant assent to the authority of the decision , but it is only given to what we con* sider a very erroneous representation of it . In the case in question , the language of the Court was , that the act incor*-porating the Bank is constitutional . ' This act is the charter of the existing Bank ; and it would be a strange inference from these expressions. , that the act itself may be constitutional , while its provisions are altogether at war with the constitution . The import of the terms is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut that the act of incorporation , in its present form , is within the just limits of their authority ; and not that the question , whether Congress have exercised their power in conformity with the constitution , is one with which they have nothing to do , or that the Legislature may have used a constitutional power in an unconstitutional way . Undoubtedly , the Court disclaimed all right of judging of the degree of the necessity for the exercise of this power ; that is , whether Congress should or should not use their constitutional discretion . This would have been a plain assumption of legi*-lative authority ; but it is difficult to imagine , how this can be mistaken for a declaration , that , as Congress may use such means as are suitable and proper for the due execution of their rightful powers , the Court can not interfere when they employ improper ones . Still less did the Court determine , that an act , in execution of any of the powers of Congress , in order to Le necessary and proper ' within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indispensable necessity . Were this the fact , our Government would soon be at an end . Not a single provision of the penal code of the Union is indispensably and absolutely necessary . There are , in fact , no means by which the powers of Congress are ever exercised , for which others might not be substituted . The Message admits , that such is not the opinion of the Court . The Court , ' it observes , have satisfied themselves that the word " necessary , " in the constitution , means " needful , " " requisite , ' ? " essential , " " conducive to ; " ' and then proceeds to maintain , that certain provisions of the existing charter , not being indispensably necessary , are unconstitutional . In its terms , therefore , the Message very unwillingly admits the authority of the Court ; but the argument forgets the admission . The Court declare , that the Bank is exempt from liahility to State taxation ; that it may lawfully be invested with exclusive privi .. // leges ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all this the Message pronounces plainly uncon* ' stitutional , and in doing it , expresses of course the same opinion of the existing charter , as a whole . It seems hardly necessary to enter into an argument to defend that , which the authorized expounder of constitutional law , the Supreme Court of the United States , has already vindicated with all the force of authority and reasoning . We shall not attempt to do this ; but simply express our conviction , already intimated more than once , that they must greatly deceive themselves , who entertain the hope that the President can ever give his assent to any bill bearing the slightest relation , in any of its essential provisions , to the existing charter . He says , indeed , that had the Executive been called upon to furnish the project of an institution , not liable to any constitutional objections ; the duty would have been cheerfully performed . That task has already been performed , and the result is not such , as to inspire Congress with any passion for soliciting the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; such applications are not in the usual nor appropriate course of the proceedings of Congress . had they , however , thought fit to adopt the intimation , and to call upon the Secretary of the Treasury , the organ of the Executive on financial subjects , for such a project , what could he have done more than to refer them to his Report at the beginning of the late session , in which he has urgently recommended the renewal of the existing charter ? We have thus adverted to those portions of the Message of the President , which appeared to us most open to objection . There are other portions , - as well as other considera .. tions which have been frequently urged elsewhere , to which our limits will not permit us even to allude . The subject is not easily comprehended within the compass of a few pages ; and , in the remarks we have already made , we have found ourselves compelled to treat it more in the way of suggestion , than of ample and extended investigation . Even if the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some other with similar powers , there are considerations of importance which plead strongly in favor of the former . The profits of the stockholders , including the advanced value of the stock , have not been Large ; their affairs have been conducted with judgment , // prudence and liberality of spirit ; besides the price originally paid for their charter , they have performed services for the nation , in supplying it with loans , in the transfer of its funds , and in the restoration of a sound and uniform currency , and performed them faithfully and well . But , more than this , the danger of a transfer of their privileges and duties to another institution , a danger which the Secretary of the Treasury has so clearly and strongly pointed out , ought not causelessly to be incurred . The hazards consequent upon a change of this sort would be great and numerous ; what benefit the country could derive from it , it is beyond our comprehension to perceive . If , however , it should be determined that no bank shall exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved from that wretched state of distrust , confusion and disaster , from which the efforts of years were heretofore required to redeem it . What reason is there to believe , that the long train of ills , which followed the dissolution of the last Bank , will not attend the extinction of the present one ,  --  wild and reckless speculation , ruined confidence , worthless currency , and prostrate and broken crediX ? Let the people attend to the - warnings of experience . If there be truth in her voice , or wisdom in her instruction , there will be nothing auspiciou.S in*he hour , which shall witness the downfal of the Bank.
