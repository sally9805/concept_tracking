Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in front of the Capitol of Lusitania . Enter Aufidius and Perpenna from opposite sides of the stage . AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS Whither in so much haste , valiant Perpenna ? Have Pompey and Metellus sack 'd the town , That thus with eager step , and anxious eye , You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VENTO Not so , Aufidius  --  ' T is to meet our friends , The Senate , who assemble at this hour With the Ambassador from Mithridates , To act upon the proffered league with Pontus . Go you not thither ?  --  we shall lack your counsel . AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS The Senate 's but one man  --  Sertorius Lords it alone o'er all the powers of Spain ; Why should we then , in empty pageantry , Swell his proud triumph ?  --  What he wills , is law : Jove reigns not more supremely .  --  Thinkst thou he will consent to march ' gainst Rome ? PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO If he refuse , his ruin is secure , And fate forestalls our purpose . Haughty Spain , Brac 'd by old feuds for deep and deadly war And vain of late success , looks for new conquests  --  Rome , her old enemy , her promised prey ; And should Sertorius mar these golden prospects , ' Twill only be in peril of his own . We 'll see his coasted faith severely tested . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between himself and country  --  accept or not The proffered league , in either he 's undone . AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS Not so , Perpenna  --  so ascendent is he , O'er all the hopes and happiness of Spain , United with her strongest sympathies , An union in misfortune and success , And almost deified by superstition , They dare not  --  and they would not if they dare , Impugn his high decree . PERPENNA PERPENNA VENTO Time shall determine  --  I have sown the seed , Ay  --  sown it  --  in the people 's very heart , That soon shall ripen in a glorious harvest , And thou , and I , and all , shall reap the fruit . Upon this very subject shalt thou see , By bribes and strong allurements have I wrought The senate to my purpose .  --  Thou know'st Aufidius , With what unceasing zeal  --  enduring patience , I 've toiled and plotted ' gainst this hated rival ;  --  Rival in love , and in the lists of war . To-day the heavens shall hear and crown my pray'rs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  But question me no more  --  no more delay ; The senate have assembled  --  and our absence May chill their glowing purpose . AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS Have with thee then  --  but thou shalt see , Perpenna , Affianced as they may be to our cause , How every heart shall shrink in his rebuke And bow before him .  --  By the mailed Mars , E'en Pompey 's star sheds but a sickly ray , Beside his spotless and meridian splendour . Nay , even grant the senate should stand firm , Where are the people  --  the Sertorian band Who cling around him with unwavering love , Like the fond ivy twining round the oak Or life 's warm eddies circling through the heart  --  In conquest and defeat !  --  Thy own brave cohorts , Marshalled , and trained by thee , desert their leader , And with one voice cry  --  " Lead us to Sertorius ! The victor , who subdues himself and others . " From such devotion what room is left for hope ? PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO Say there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of those throng 'd legions Seduced by his base arts from my command ? But for my vast supplies of men and means , This favour 'd agent of superior powers , This lofty idol of an impious worship , Despite of his bravadoes and their love , Had long since yielded to Metellus ' force , And graced a Roman triumph .  --  But Aufidius , Let us not pause and ponder on our griefs , While the kind fates supply the means of vengeance : This day decides his doom . AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS Then let us in  --  But mark me now , Perpenna , Our votes are vain  --  Sertorius has decided , And that which he decides , fate 's awful fiat Stamps as irrevocable  --  It is done ! Exeunt . SCENE II . Enter Mucius , Flavius , Caiphus , and Citizens . CITIZENS . CITIZENS Huzza ! huzza ! Mithridates and Sertorius  --  Pontus and Spain ! FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Sertorius and Mithridates  --  Spain and Pontus , say I ! Since the alliance was sought from , and not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute ? MUCIUS . MUCIUS A glorious day  --  a day of joy to Spain ! The wars are over  --  that is , they will be over ; for when Spain joins with Pontus , Rome must yield . Great Mithridates is a match for Rome , and we 're a match for him  --  Hence you perceive , when of three foes ,  --  and all of equal strength ,  --  two shall combine , the other is o'erthrown . CAIPHUS . CAIPHUS ' T is plain  --  by last , leather , and lapstone , wondrous plain . Why learning is the very sole of this nether world . Here now is Mucius , who has done more in five words to show how old Rome is to be mastered , than all your kings and generals in fifty years .  --  Well said , book-worm ! FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Ay , ay , Mucius is a rare one , and not the less so for being commended by thee , who art also a rare one  --  seeing you are the opposite of each other , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUCIUS Mystery me no mysteries  --  come , demonstrate . FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Nay , nay , be not impatient good Mucius , on this day of liberty and triumph ; as thou hast most laudably , learnedly , and logically shewn it is , or at least is to be . MUCIUS . MUCIUS What meanest thou by mysteries ?  --  FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Why , thy mystery is to supply furniture for the head , being a schoolmaster , or pedagogue ; and his is to furnish the feet , being a shoemaker , or cobbler . MUCIUS . MUCIUS And thine to accommodate the neck , being a carpenter or gallows-maker  --  therefore it is that thou art ever between us twain , as alike an enemy to head and foot . FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Fie on ' t , fie ! you are only chafed because my trade is the more prescriptive and honourable of the three . CAIPHUS . CAIPHUS Why more prescriptive ? FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Because the gallows was in use before schools were taught , or shoes mended ; and not before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for elevation . MUCIUS . MUCIUS But why more honourable ? FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Because it is the end of guilt and dishonour .  --  Whereas your arts are too frequently the credentials and lures of both . Calf-skin from top to toe , thrives best as the times run ;  --  it is a most vendible commodity . MUCIUS . MUCIUS Hang thyself to prove thy first position , and I care not to admit the last for the sake of the service . But no longer parley ; let us to the Capitol to greet the glorious league . FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS Here is a score of wiseacres for you  --  walking a mile to greet a league .  --  Beshrew me , but this smacks of policy  --  playing into the shoemaker 's hand ! sole leather shall pay for this . ( aside . ) CITIZEN . CITIZEN Ay , to the Capitol  --  to the Capitol !  --  ' t is meet the people should assert their rights , and ratify this treaty . We all approve it !  --  CITIZENS . CITIZENS All !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny your rights ? MUCIUS . MUCIUS And if he should !  --  a drachma for his denial . Perpenna is my man ; he bends , and bows , and cries  --  " Good Citizens , " on all occasions ; while Sertorius heeds us not  --  sees us not  --  but with his head among the stars , seems to disdain the earth he treads upon , and to spurn us as so many impediments to his advancement . CAIPHUS . CAIPHUS Right Mucius . He is parlous proud ; but it were better in him never to provoke our anger ;  --  this is no time for antics ; we who made , can unmake . We are not to be put off as old leather that has done its best service  --  we must be satisfied . CITIZENS . CITIZENS We will be satisfied ! we will have justice . Exeunt . FLAVIUS . FLAVIUS And if I mistake not , you are in a fair way to require my service , if you are deemed worthy the charge ; and should not be strung up summarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , and expedition . Exit . SCENE III . Senate Chamber . Sertorius , Perpenna , Aufidius , Ambassador , Senators , Lictors , and diles . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Pharos Demetrius , we decline your offer .  --  ' T is true that Rome has proved a wayward mother , Proud , cruel , and relentless . Does it follow That we , her banish 'd sons , to mend our fortunes , Should clasp a stranger to our dear embrace ; To jointly prey upon a parent 's bosom , And like the pelican , in ruthless famine , Devour our source of life ? PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS What binds , or what should bind Sertorius To such a parent ? Have you not fought her battles , Shed your blood in her defence , devoted all your life To the aggrandizement and power of Rome  --  And , save those scars engraven on your front To show how much you dared , and what you suffer 'd , Where 's your reward ? SERTORIUS , QUINTIS SERTORIUS ( laying his hand on his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal casket  --  where all life 's treasure dwells ! Think'st thou unjust requital mars our love , Or that devotion to our country 's cause Regards past offering whilst ' t has aught to offer ? If I am outlaw 'd , is not Rome abused  --  Troubled , and tortured by intestine treason ? The weapons of her hope , sheathed in her heart By parricidal hands !  --  why should she then , Bleeding at every vein from inward faction , Receive from me the final , fatal blow , That terminates her glory and her grief ? PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS In striking her , dost thou not punish them  --  Them , who have mounted on thy hopes to empire  --  Them , who have exil 'd thee from friends and home , And all that makes life dear , or death deplored ? Has then revenge , that balm of injured minds , No cure , no charms for thee ?  --  then let ambition , Pointing the way to fortune and renown , Allure thee to those proud , supernal heights , Which only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUINTIS SERTORIUS By heaven , Demetrius ! I avow it proudly , Here in the very centre of the realm  --  My friends , bear with me  --  nature will have way ;  --  Borne as I am upon the people 's love To power and station , and what else beside The noblest minds desire  --  Still I confess , Far rather would I be the meanest subject Of mighty Rome , than the wide world 's proud master . PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS A subject !  --  thou may'st be her Emperor , The monarch of the mighty of the earth . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Not so , Demetrius !  --  Rome expires with freedom ; Were I her monarch , Rome would cease to be , And leave my sceptre worthless . PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS Grant it were so :  --  even thy humble prayer To be a private citizen of Rome  --  it is denied thee ! The intercession of thy mother Rhea  --  The recollection of thy great exploits  --  Thy hardships  --  filial love , and loyalty , All plead for thee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable objects Excites no wonder ,  --  but that a man like thee , Who scorns to halt when glory bids thee on , Shouldst hesitate , between conflicting views , One placing thee upon the neck of Rome , The other at her foot  --  the foot that spurns thee !  --  Ye Gods , ' t is past belief  --  thou dost but mock me ! Think of great Marcius , and his Volacian bands , Trampling triumphantly o'er prostrate Rome  --  Let that inspire thee .  --  He sought for aid , While aid solicits thee , and monarchs are thy suitors . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Does the time honour 'd page of Roman story Supply no prouder models for Sertorius , Than discontented and rebellious traitors ? Men who alike opposed , or served the state To gratify ambition , or revenge !  --  What say'st thou to those stainless men of Rome , Who rose superior to their private wrongs  --  Who sacrificed revenge to public good , And magnified their nature and the world ? Can I lose sight of their illustrious virtues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branded with the name of traitors , Yet ever yielding to the hand that smote them ! Where is the Roman that forgets such Romans , Or scorns their bright example ? Know then , Demetrius , that the patriot heart Throbs first and last for country . What , shall a pillar , Howe'er magnificent and richly wrought , Degrade the temple that its strength sustains ? Or shall they , as in sacred Grecian domes , Unite in mutual grandeur ?  --  and when time With his unsparing , fell , and ravening maw , Disrobes them of the ornament of youth , Dissolving and prostrating all their glory , Sink in one common ruin and become More fam 'd and cherish 'd than in pristine pride . PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS The temple of thy faith  --  proud Rome must fall ! No pillar can sustain it ;  --  the crimson 'd swords Of factious Scylla and his lawless bands , How down the massy fabric of her fame , The boast and dread of full five hundred years , Into its elements ,  --  why then shouldst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin ? SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Now by the Gods , you turn my blood to flame , And mar the traitor you would make of me ! If there be aught more arduous to accomplish Than to dissever all my thoughts from Rome , And change my doating duty into hatred , ' T were to unite with such a curse as Seylla , The pampered minion of Nicopolis . Bloated , not sated with Patrician blood  --  The felon , that purloins his country 's glory , To prostitute it to his country 's shame . Thou sayst Rome 's fall will crush me ; I submit !  --  The brave man never should outlive his country : As clings the infant to its mother 's arms Blessing and blest  --  so cleaves the patriot 's heart To the embraces of his native soil , At once deriving , and imparting life . PERPENNA PERPENNA VENTO ( to Aufidius , aside . ) Not now to speak , were to be dumb for ever ;  --  The crisis has arrived , and on the instant , Hangs life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  forty ships of war  --  Great Mithridates tenders now to Spain ; When were such offers made , or when rejected ? AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS What do we hazard for this vast reward ? SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Talk not of hazard , I dare hazard all But that , without which , all is penury ; The cherish 'd , priceless , peerless jewel  --  Honour . When on the borders of the rapid Rhone , Arm 'd cap-a-pie in massy mail , I stood , While the huge hillows thundered for their prey , I paused not to appreciate the peril , But plung 'd , at once , like Curtius , in the gulf , Haply to live or die . ' T was for my country !  --  But when you ask , that to destroy that country I should shake hands with her inveterate foe , And sell myself to shame , immortal shame , I tremble  --  and profess myself a coward . I can not do it !  --  shuddering nature dare not . PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS Yet , noble Quintus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my resolution 's deaf , And can not hear you . Come , your voices , friends . PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO The Senate do concur with Mithridates . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Thou dost concur , Perpenna , not the Senate . SENATORS . SENATORS We ratify the league , and join ' gainst Rome . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Impossible !  --  A Roman Senate turn her arms ' gainst Rome ! We who are bound to magnify her fame  --  To stretch her empire to earth 's utmost verge , That glory like the ever radiant sun , May rise , and set upon her vast horison . Is this the voice of all  --  do none dissent ? SENATORS . SENATORS We all unite with him . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Then all unite , to disunite this arm From Lusitania 's cause . Whate'er betides , No change , shall change my steadfastness of soul , Or make a traitor of me . PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO Remember Quintus , what we owe to Spain ; Adopted  --  nurtur 'd  --  cherish 'd  --  honour 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; but where 's the pledge You give to Spain ! adopted as you are By her affection ; grafted on her state ; How shall she trust you , while ye recreants prove To your first love  --  and found the very alter of your faith , On having been foresworn.  --  Let me beseech you , Weigh this matter nearly ; oppose your honour To the proffer 'd treasure , and all the gold of Pontus Turns to dross . What , are ye a hireling tribe , To be bought out , by him that bids the highest ? If the design be noble , grasp it nobly ; And do not , like a band of sordid slaves , Embrace your bondage , for the golden fetters . AUFIDIUS , AUFIDIUS ( to Perpenna ) . See how they quake and quail beneath his eye ! A moment longer , and the cause is lost . SENATORS . SENATORS Rome 's lost to us  --  then we are lost to Rome . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Then are you lost to me.  --  These dignities The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the name of traitor , And thus I cast them off for such as you are . throws off his scarf and crown . PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO Quintus Sertorius , we are constituted By public suffrage , and the laws of Spain , The guardians of the realm ; the conservators , Not of the rights of Rome , but Lusitania . How shall we answer to ourselves and others , For the perversion of this sacred trust ? SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Peace , peace , Perpenna ! I will answer it . Who shares the glory , only shares the peril !  --  I stand alone in both . If Mithridates Demand Bythynia and Cappadocia , Accustomed as they are to kingly rule , And held by conquest only , by the Romans , It meets with our accordance : but to encroach Where every foot of ground supports a freeman , None but a slave could urge it . SENATORS . SENATORS We do not urge it  --  we submit to this , Restrain old Rome within her just domain , Her ancient limits  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Patience , ye Gods !  --  and thou , great olus , That with thy sovereign wand , curb'st and direct'st The ever changing and rebellious winds , And gather'st them within thy stormy bosom ,  --  Teach men fidelity . PHAROS . PHAROS DEMETRIUS My mission is discharg 'd  --  the terms promulg 'd  --  Which , and which only , Pontus can accord ; And thus I take my leave . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS I here dissolve the Council . Farewell Demetrius !  --  to your King repair ; If he approve the terms we now propose  --  The only league that we can ratify , He may command our service . But from myself , And from Spain too , while she relies on me , All other hopes are vain . And so farewell . Exeunt at opposite sides of stage . PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO Most noble Senators ! Pillars of the State !  --  Why did ye flee from Rome in search of freedom , To forge new fetters here , and hug your chains ? What evil demon , hot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus converts you into pliant tools Of the renown 'd Sertorius ?  --  a Roman outcast ! His guards  --  his supple pandars  --  fawning slaves ?  --  In birth , in fortune , and in dauntless daring , Who yields the palm to him ,  --  and yet in power , His eagle winged ambition soars so high , That we are only left to gaze and wonder At the proud pinnacle on which he revels , While grovelling in our lowly sphere beneath him . Who shares his glory ? who divides his council ? Who dares to disobey his stern decree ? Let this day answer ! this eventful day  --  That dedicates you to perpetual bondage . How will you e'er presume to face the people , Whose rights you have abus 'd ?  --  whose trust betray 'd ?  --  Arm 'd in their wrongs , and wrought to desperation ! In anxious expectation , thousands wait , Thronging your public walks  --  your Senate doors , To greet the adoption of this glorious league : And who shall dare proclaim the base result ? None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you have shared  --  for none resisted . You were o'erborne , forsooth , by great Sertorius !  --  A mighty Senate  --  govern 'd by a frown !  --  SENATOR . SENATOR Chide us not , brave Perpenna : did not Quintus Absolve us from all answer to the people ? The people , who have sanctioned what is done By the unbounded faith reposed in him , Thus rendering opposition to his will Like vain resistance of the cataract , Making it rage the more . PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO He did absolve you  --  but will they absolve you ? Your virtues , they appropriate to him ; Your vices are your own :  --  nay , even more  --  His vices , also , are ascribed to you ! Redeem the past  --  atone for your disgrace  --  Fly through the streets , and publicly proclaim This outrage on your rights , and those of Spain ! Nought else can save you from deserved reproach . SENATOR . SENATOR All earth shall witness that we were coerc 'd . Exeunt Senators . AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foretold this triumph of Sertorius ? Despite of all the rooted hate I bear him , I almost grow enamoured of his virtues , When I behold him , like the baited lion , With all his hopes reposing on himself , Surrounded by his hunters and their toils , Still firm and fearless , ever facing dangers  --  PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO Reserve thy praises for his monument  --  They will improve in marble , and endure ; While he yet lives , they 're fulsome flattery : To give them currency , and weight , and value , They need the stamp of death . To live in glory , is the meed of thousands ; But honour never shall become eternal , Till hallowed and attested by the grave . How many mighty and majestic minds , In after life demolish the proud structure , Elaborated and adorned , by youth , With gems of science  --  trophies of the war , Garlands of love , and spoils of great ambition ! Death is the crown , or crucifix of Fame .  --  AUFIDIUS . AUFIDIUS When to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure oblations , We kill but curse not  --  nay , the song of joy , Chaplets of flowers , and temples filled with incense , Surround and soothe the bleeding victim 's anguish .  --  A patriot is the sacrifice you offer , Shall we do less for him !  --  PERPENNA . PERPENNA VENTO No more Aufidius.  --  If my own heart 's blood , Gush 'd from the wounds inflicted on your hero , Mine is the hand should deal the deadly blow , And mine the eye should look unwavering on  --  But hopes destroy 'd , endear those which remain . The time reproves us  --  haste thee then , my friend ; Blow to contagious winds the sickly rumor Of treachery , of treason , and dishonour , That every breast may swell with the infection , And re-infect the pestilential air .  --  Exeunt . ACT II . SCENE I. A Hall in the House of Marcellus . Marcellus , Marcia , and Timandra . MARCIA . MARCIA Alas , how ruthless is the rage of war ; Defeat , or victory , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When shall the conflict end , which thus derives Fresh vigor from misfortune or success  --  Like great Antus , whose gigantic frame , From each successive fall , derived new strength ? MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS It only ends in the extinction of our hapless realm . Already full two hundred thousand foes , Beleaguer our possessions . Rome 's best gen'rals , Loaded with laurels , won in other wars , Unite to overthrow this fated city ; Each moment freighted with some dire event , Rolls onward to the huge catastrophe Of hideous and inevitable ruin . MARCIA . MARCIA Oh , my father , Look not with this despairing , hopeless eye , Upon Spain 's prospects  --  clouded as they are , And fraught with grief !  --  is there not yet still one Undaunted , and devoted to her cause ? Signally favour 'd by the pitying Gods ? MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS Thou mean'st Perpenna  --  dost thou not , my child ? MARCIA . MARCIA Was it Perpenna that Besieg 'd Lauron in face of the great Pompey ? Quell 'd the Characitani ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Led by renown 'd Metellus ? surely father , I err in my remembrance if it was ! MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS Not so , my daughter  --  You have all by heart ; Come hither , fair one , and recount to me , The conquests of your soldier . What more precious Than deeds heroic from the lips we love ! Methinks Sertorius was the hero 's name ? MARCIA . MARCIA Recount to you , my father !  --  you , who taught me The fam 'd exploits of every martial leader ? MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS A hopeful pupil , who so well remembering The conquests gain 'd , forgets by whom achiev 'd ! But canst thou teach me nothing in return , Which thou alone canst teach , and I should learn ? Are those the only triumphs of Sertorius  --  Is there no bloodless victory , dearer far Than the acquirement of the world beside ? MARCIA . MARCIA What means my father ? MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS I mean , the conquest of this tender heart  --  This citadel , that yielded to a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Ha ! little traitor , art thou self condemn 'd ? " Was it Perpenna that besieg 'd Lauron , In face of the great Pompey ? " runs the text so ? Nay , nay ! thou art a traitor  --  come , confess ; And still so guileless , artless , and so fair , We almost love the treason  --  for the traitor . MARCIA . MARCIA Forgive this constant and devoted heart The only fraud it ever practis 'd on you ; A fraud long practis 'd on its thoughtless self : I will chastise it , father , if you bid me  --  But it is past reclaim  --  for ever gone . MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS And thou would'st follow ? thus the sequel reads . Now , by unspotted Dian , thy young love , All radiant in bright hope 's delusive plumage , Wings the bold eaglet 's unresisted flight Forthright and upward to the cloudless sun . Beware my Marcia , pause  --  and learn from me How evanescent and how vain is glory ; A sparkling bubble on life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  destroys ; A lamp sepulchral in a charnel house , Gilding , with flickering ray , the shades of death .  --  This idol , who engross 'd the hearts of all , Who reigns in thine with sway so absolute , And almost shares devotion with the Gods  --  Has done a deed to-day , should shake his fame , Though rooted in earth 's centre !  --  MARCIA . MARCIA What deed , my father ? ' t is impossible , That the preserver and support of Spain , The faithful , fearless , and resistless soldier , Could ever act beneath that lofty virtue , Which wafts it precious incense to the skies , An offering fit for heaven . MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS Judge then , when I relate the dire event : Thou know'st the King of Pontus , Mithridates , Whose power is equall 'd only by the Romans , Proposed an union with the Spanish power , For the invasion of tyrannic Rome ; On terms most bounteous , and by all approv 'd  --  By all , save one  --  Sertorius !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should not the Senate share it ? MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS The Senate , stimulated by Perpenna , In one acclaim consented to the league ; But stern Sertorius awed them to his purpose , And clinging to the Romans , spurn 'd the compact . Incens 'd and outrag 'd by his haughty bearing , The Senators denounce him to the people , And all his garner 'd glories , by this act , Are scatter 'd to the winds . The common herd , Urg 'd on by master spirits  --  who , unseen , Guide and promote the mischief they condemn ,  --  Besiege him with revilings and complaints , Proclaim him traitor  --  and with ruffian hands Would rob him of his life ! MARCIA . MARCIA Thy arm , Timandra  --  His life !  --  said'st thou his life , my father ? The life of one , who is the life of all !  --  MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS Be calm , my child ; repose upon this breast , Thy native pillow  --  Silence all thy fears .  --  Thou art of Roman lineage : chide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should hide .  --  Here , at the sun 's decline , Sertorius meets me ; And ever faithful to his pledge , he comes . Welcome , Sertorius  --  ever , ever welcome . Enter Sertorius . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Health and high honour to the brave Marcellus . Ever gentle Marcia ! the rude , unsparing blasts Of savage war , have blanch 'd thy maiden cheek ; Cheer up , my fair one  --  for the spring of peace Shall pluck the lily from that faded brow , And plant its roses there ; why should'st thou droop ! No cankerous cares corrode thy youthful heart , Or trace their channels through these vestal veins . MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS If flowers fade upon her virgin cheek , ' T is not for want of dew !  --  Leave us , my child , Anon thou shalt return . Comfort and solace her , My good Timandra , and make her griefs thy own . Exeunt Marcia and Timandra . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Oh , what a treasure hast thou there , Marcellus ! Unlike the miser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding hour , And lights you on to joy . MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS And yet this jewel , So rare and lustrous to thy partial eye , Beams not alone on me  --  another shares it . Shares , did I say ?  --  monopolizes it ; While all unconscious of this world of beauty , Like fair Narcissus , he enamour 'd grows Of his own charms , and covets what he has . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Betroth 'd to brave Perpenna ! ' T is the last blow  --  bear this , my stubborn soul , And ever after be invulnerable ;  --  ( Aside ) No other shaft can pierce thee . Happy pair ! Crown them with joys perennial , ye blest powers , And guard their hearts ' gainst agonies like mine ; Too grave to bear , too poignant to conceal . MARCELLUS . MARCELLUS Why , how now , Quintus  --  dost thou scorn my child , That thou would'st thus transfer her to a rival ? Must I be plain ? I tell thee she is thine , By her free choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title which I ca n't withhold , And would not if I could . The self-will 'd dame Avoids the gallant , gay , adoring throng That haunt her walks , and hang upon her accents , As zephyrs curl around the fragrant rose ; And yields herself to thee  --  a veteran soldier . SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Mine ! Say'st thou ? Mine !  --  the peerless Marcia mine !

And a word in thy ear , Mucius ; if Sertorius should grow wrathful , thou shalt see this porcupine shooting his quills as he now does , fry 'd and basted in his own fat ! He will be offered up as an atonement for all those , who in opposition to the Gods , laugh and grow gross , in spite of worldly learning and lamentation . CITIZENS . CITIZENS Hark ye ! hark  --  he speaks . MUCIUS . MUCIUS Soldiers and citizens :  --  The times cry out revenge , and they must have it . Revenge cries out for blood , and it will have it .

SERTORIUS . QUINTIS SERTORIUS Peace , magpie ! Say rather , that ye are the soil of freemen  --  The rank , foul compost whence sedition springs .

QUINTIS SERTORIUS And is this all ?  --  Can none of you remember Another outrage practis 'd upon Spain ? I found you slaves , in bodies and in mind ; I burst the chains of both and set you free , And this is my requital : you would fain return To your old bondage ; freedom has grown irksome . Or would you , disobedient as you are , Presume to rule the state ? First learn to serve ; So shall ye best acquire the power to govern .

It will be observed , that in the prceeding work some liberties have been taken , under poetical privileges and particularly in respect to Lusitania and Spain being considered as the same . This , however , it is presumed , will be excused ; as Spain , or Hesperia , originally embraced Lusitania or Portugal ,  --  and both of them , for a time , as would appear by Plutarch , were subject to the government of Sertorius . Sertorius , one of the most distinguished names of antiquity , was the son of Quintus and Rhea . In his youth he served under Marius , in Gaul ; where the Romans being routed , his horse was killed , and although wounded , he swam across the Rhone in complete armour , and thus escaped . In the wars between Sylla and Marius , he took part with the latter , and ever bore the most determined hate towards the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed in the contest for the tribuneship . Upon the overthrow of Marius , the influence of Sylla procured the banishment of Sertorius , and that of many other valiant Romans , who sought refuge in Spain ; where , in a short time , Sertorius acquired an almost sovereign control . He formed his Senate , and established public schools , wherein the Spaniards were instructed . He was not permitted , however , to remain undisturbed : Sylla sent large armies to assail and to subdue him , but without success . The Roman armies were routed , although headed by such commanders as Pompey and Metellus . The vigilance and skill of Sertorius were deemed irresistible ; so much so , that Mithridates , king of Pontus , surnamed the Great , sent an ambassador to him , proposing to pay to Spain three thousand talents , and supply forty ships of war , if she would consent to unite against Rome . Sertorius caused the ambassador to appear before the Senate , where , notwithstanding the Senators were unanimous in favour of the treaty , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this refusal , Perpenna Vento , elated with the vanity of birth , aspired to the command , and sowed dissension among the Senators and people . The conspiracy daily gathered strength , and among the rest Perpenna drew in Antonius , who had a considerable command in the army . They prepared letters for Sertorius , which imported that a victory was gained by his officers , and a number of the enemy slain . Sertorius offered sacrifices for the tidings , and Perpenna invited him and the conspirators to supper , which he was prevailed upon to accept . The entertainments at which Sertorius was present , had been always attended with great order and decorum , as he had ever accustomed his guests to divert themselves in an innocent and irreproachable manner . But in the midst of the entertainment , the conspirators sought occasion to quarrel , giving in to the most dissolute discourse , and pretending drunkenness as the cause of their ribaldry .
