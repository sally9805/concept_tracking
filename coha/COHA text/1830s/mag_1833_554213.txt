txt During the last year , very many of the great in intellect have gone down to those mansions where the mighty rest ; - but who of that illustrious number was more fortunate in the variety of his honors , or the meekness with which he bore them ,  --  more eminent for the silver purity of his delightful fame , than Sir Walter Scott ? It is in this light that he most deserves the homage , which the world has liberally paid ; well may it kindle a vivid satisfaction in the heart of every friend of his race , to see God 's highest gifts combined with virtue ; to see the starry crown of earthly honor burning on his brow , who is clothed in the beautiful garments of a kind and gentle spirit . Such examples deserve to be remembered , and held up to the admiration of mankind ; they redeem and vindicate our nature . Whatever the cause may be , it is too late to deny the fact , that men have hastened to bow down to the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We have followed with insane admiration the march of conquerors , even when their path of blood and fire has gone over our own dwellings ; we have hung with rapture on the lips of the poetical philosophers , who laugh at virtue as a dream , and // blot out the realities of a better life ; all that makes up the value of our being here , and the infinitely higher hope of a hereafter , have been flung , as a worthy offering , upon their unholy altars . It is true , the fault is ours ; we have no right to complain of the inflictions which we invite and welcome ; but in these cases , as in many others , something is needed to save us from ourselves ; and there is no greater benefactor than he , who corrects and ennobles human sentiment , by casting a healing bough into the poisoned waters . Such was Sir Walter Scott . He did not retreat behind a frozen misanthropy , to cast a midnight shade of mystery around his name ; he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his God ; he did not withdraw himself from the public view , that familiarity might not destroy the impression of ' his presence ; his conversation in the world was that of one alive to every human sympathy , of a heart full of kindness and good will to men . There is no fit emblem of such a spirit in the unhealthy light , which rises from the gloomy marshes , only to guide the traveller into the fens from which it sprung ; his course was rather the ascension of a star , shining out from its still watchtowers , and regarded by the voyager with religious veneration , as it directs him in his pathway through the sea . He has taught us , that the way of fame is not less bright to human eyes , because it is illuminated with a holy light ; we may now see , that the powers which Providence has given are not elevated , when they are applied to the purposes of injury and ruin ; that he ill accomplishes the end of being , who leaves no trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fiery track : and we may not unreasonably hope , that men will hereafter be more true to themselves , more faithful to the destinies and glory of their race , than to look with cold esteem on the noble coalition of intellect and virtue . It is for this , that we reverence the memory of Scott ; it is this which brings him to our recollections , like a welcome and familiar friend . We remember him as we call to mind the venerable features of the honored guardians of our early years , who have gone down to death , and left no bitter thought behind them but the single one , that we shall see their face no more . All this is characteristic of a noble iiature ; but there are other elements of his character as a literary man , which bind him even closer to ' our sympathies . These are the lesser virtues , commonly so little thought of , that there is no credit in // observing , and no great reproach in disregarding them ; requiring more resolution than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them which flatters vanity or pride ; we allude to the kindness of feeling and liberality of judgment , which men of letters ought to be the first , and are commonly the last to show . It would be a curious subject of inquiry , why the pursuits , which seem most friendly to a spirit of amity and peace , should animates those who follow them to eternal battle ; for so indeed it is . We have sometimes thought , that so far as tranquillity is concerned , the name republic of letters was but a questionable compliment to the political form , from which the title is derived . Books have been written upon the quarrels of authors , and the materials for such works are as copious as the laziest compiler could desire ; they occupy about the same space in literary biography , that war does in the history of nations ; but they would in vain be sought for in the life of Scott ; though he was at times not without provocation , under which most of his brethren would have forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he very early formed the resolution to guard himself against those infirmities of temper , which so easily beset and waylay authors by profession . Such a determination was nothing more than an expression of his natural feeling ; it would never have been formed by one , in whom virtue would not have found her way without its aid . Every one remembers how Lord Byron undertook to visit the iniquities of an illiberal reviewer upon all his literary brethren ; as if writers were under a moral obligation to labor only for the benefit of printers , he rebuked Scott in a very lofty tone as sordid and mercenary , because he had received a large compensation for one of his poems . It so happened , that the amount received for the very work which Lord Byron had in view , had been applied by Scott to the relief of a friend 's necessities : nor was it long , before the noble poet found cause to copy the very example he condemned . Here was an instance of gross interference with the private affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials for it were so close at hand ; few would have hesitated in such a case to use them : but the feeling of Scott was of a higher strain ; he passed the accusation by in silence , and when some years afterwards he had occasion to allude to it , only vindicated his own course , without a single word of sarcasm or reproach . More than this // no man hailed the rising star of Byron with more generous welcome than he , though conscious that before it his own was destined to grow pale ; no man cherished his fame more kindly , looked with more tenderness and sorrow upon his faults while living , or sung a nobler requiem over his untimely grave . The severest reproach which one of his friends ever heard him utter against another , was his remark in regard to a living writer , that , great as his ability had been , he had never shown himself the friend of rising genius . He had a right to say so ; for more kind encomium on others might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contemporaries put together ; nor is it easy to recall a single word of harsh or illiberal censure , in the whole compass of his almost numberless productions . His praise was early given , and was therefore doubly kind ; it cheered the young adventurer at the outset , instead of waiting until others had begun to raise the cry of victory ; and we doubt not , that his single word of encouragement has breathed more animation into the heart of genius , as it pursued its slow and melancholy way , than the world 's chorus of applause when its triumph had become complete . There is a moral disease , which very frequently besets superior genius ; it is compounded of excited passions , of jealousy and fear ; perhaps it may sometimes animate it to unusual effort ; if so , it is still a burning fever , which sends a warm glow to the cheek and radiance to the eye , while it silently consumes the heart . We are startled by the manner in which it is revealed ; if the mind occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it presently sinks again to the lowest level of the earth . Pope thought he could bless the executioner who would relieve him of his Homer ; Collins perished by slow torture ; the history of literature is full of these examples , which are courteously called the eccentricities of genius ; while they are only those maladies , which self-indulgence leaves the mind as little power to control , as the physical ones , by which the delicate and fair are early struck with death . Genius may inhabit a world of its own ; it may have its being in solitary communion with the heart ; high inspirations and glorious visions may . be there ; but dark and fatal passions may dwell there too : the affections are kindling into madness ; the overwrought soul becomes its own destroyer ; and when the realities of life force themselves in , they are like the breath of pestilence to the heart . Such is the law of // nature : excessive sensibility was no more designed for the soul , than fiery cordials to sustain the frame ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellectual power ; and those who have seen the ocean in the terrors of the storm , find no magnificence or beauty in it , as its waves dash peacefully upon the summer shore . it is folly to suppose , that the mind can dwell forever in the clouds , or always soar towards the sun ; it was made for something better than this vain and selfish contemplation of itself ; it was designed by Providence to act on others . Of such defects , Sir Walter Scott had absolutely none ; from this madness of the intellect , no man was ever more eminently free ; some have for this reason been led to doubt his power ; they n2light as well doubt , whether the power of directing the agitated elements is superior to that which lashes them into fury . His mind was of a bold and open cast ; he had on the one hand none of the effeminacy of talent , nor any of its ecstasies on the other ; his character was too manly for either ; and he holds the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic , that the man of unpretending virtue occupies between the scrupulously cold , and the zealous unto blood . The same unaffected superiority pervaded both the heart and intellect of this extraordinary man . In poetry and romance , he was a great reformer ; but he went not forth to battle , animated by the spirit , or clad in the steel of many who have borne the name ; he was mighty to pulling down the strong holds of false taste and vitiated feeling , only by the eloquent persuasion of a high example . This was so kind and gentle , so like the meadow gale of spring to the sick and weary frame , that men hardly knew its power . Yet never was intellect more clear and penetrating ; every object in nature , every element in character , was presented to his mind in its true colors and just proportions ; nothing was magnified through a mist , or half hid in the uncertain morning twilight ; when he describes the works of God , or the beings which inhabit them , the folds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunbeams dart from their tabernacle of purple and golden clouds ; every thing stands forth in the broad light of truth . Men saw , that he had led them back to nature ; others had shown them the outward man , or man as he is under the influence of wild passion , while he revealed him under every aspect of existence , and in every variety of action ; his charao // ters are no Master Peter 's puppet show , which ask the aid of an interpreter ; his scenes are no mummeries , showing bravely only by candlelight ; wherever he leads us , whether to the cottage or the palace , whether to the Glasgow Tolbooth or the Highlands , we are sure to meet with man and nature . It is impossible to doubt , that the private qualities of such a man were fitted to spread an atmosphere of happiness around him ; a poet 's character is so legibly impressed upon his works , that other testimony respecting it need scarcely ever be asked for . Take for example Burns ; a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind sensibility often broke through the midnight gloom of his ordinary feeling ; but the repose of such a mind is the weariness of exhausted effort ; we see at once that quietness and just thought are not the prevailing habit of his soul . The quick sensibility of genius , instead of being the vital heat which nourishes , is the flame which consumes it . Scott had little of this ; had he possessed it , it would have been no less fatal to his power of estimating character , than to his domestic peace . Nor had he , on the other hand , that cold , ironical propensity , which mocks enthusiasm . He was a keen observer of his fellow men ; but he saw their weakness without scorn or anger ; he did not labor to find selfishness at the bottom of the current of their generous feeling ; he saw them as they were ; and the judgment of the truest observer is most likely to be kind . Perhaps these feelings are not preserved with difficulty by those who are happy in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Scott , they were sternly tried by adversity ; but in the severest hour of trial , he was still true to himself ; the sunshine of his heart grew brighter , as the shadows fell on all around him . There is a sorrow , which accompanies the downfall of the great ; but far deeper and more enduring is that , which follows the departure of the good ; and when he died , he was lamented less for his exalted genius , than the many excellencies of his heart . We have alluded to these traits of his intellectual and moral character here , because the world stands much in need of such instruction ; we think it will be henceforth somewhat less inclined to measure the power of genius by the extent of its aberrations ; his example has shown , that good sense is not the natural enemy of talent , and that infidelity and misanthropy are not the only paths to glory . Who can doubt , // that he must have been happy in those early influences , which so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us little of his youthful history , and it is too late for other chroniclers to supply the loss ; we know , however , that his mother was a lady of amiable disposition , and not without poetical pretensions ; he has alluded in his poems to his father , as one undistinguished by rank or fame , though sprung from the gentle blood of Scotland ; a man of humble merit and modest worth . He describes himsell , in another , as a self-willed imp in childhood ; a sad annoyance to the grave ones of his neighborhood . We do not learn that he gave much indication of his future eminence ; nothing at all remarkable is recorded of the promise of his boyhood . Dr. Adam , one of his instructers , sagaciously believed him dull ; it is said that Dr. Blair , on visiting his school one day , when assured by his master , that his skull was the thickest'in the school , declared that he saw the light of genius shining through it . Mr. Cunningham intimates that the Doctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others will believe , that the cranium of the master was not the least solid of the three . The prediction of Dr. Blair was however confirmed by the keen discernment of Burns ; this lad , ' he is said to have remarked , will be heard of yet . ' By far too much importance has been usually attached to these early omens : the mind does not rush at once into maturity ; the first blossoms are not most likely to sipen into golden fruit ; and if it were so , it would not follow , that all this must be seen by the casual observer . One indication , however , he gave , which was not afterwards fulfilled ; that of a strong propensity for sport and mischief ; he describes himself as having been a champion in the desperate wars , which were carried on some half a century ngo between the boys of Edinburgh . But his pleasures at this period appear to have been chiefly of a contemplative kind . An interesting view is given of them in the introduction to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the freedom with which they alluded to himself , but are read for that very reason with a melancholy satisfaction now ; he was used to wander with one or two companions among the hills , where they amused themselves with relating tales of romance and chivalry to each other , the dawning , probably , of the glory which was yet to come ; and few will be disposed to doubt him when he says , that he acquired among his asso // dates the reputation of a tolerable story-teller . What would have been their feelings could they have foreseen ) that the boy , whose mind was even then clinging to the rich associations which cover the scenery and history of his native land , was in a few years to write his name upon the broadest page of human glory ; that his praise should traverse seas and mountains , and the farthest boundaries of nations , as the fiery cross swept over the headlands of his country ! One of those accidents at this time occurred to him , by which good is brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future drawn from what threatens to envelope it with gloom . He was attacked by a dangerous illness , which confined him for a long period to his bed , in a state of entire inaction ; in order to relieve the weariness of this , dispensation , he read all the novels which the solitary circulating library of Edinburgh could supply ; and , if that repository bore the least resemblance to our own , it is easy to imagine into what a chaos he must have plunged . After exhausting all its treasures of romance , he went on through travels , voyages , and history , very much after the manner of Waverley , who spared nothing but the theological treatises of his tutor . Such a course of reading would have been fatal to the powers of an inferior mind ; nor could it have benefited any , that did not possess the power of changing all it touched into gold . His practical sense , the most remarkable element in his character , preserved him from the many evils , to which such spontaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direction to his mind , which the world has little reason to regret ; the first suggestion of his best efforts in romance and poetry , and the very materials of many of them , were derived from this unpromising source . Upon his recovery from this illness , he devoted himself with assiduity to his legal studies ; this was an occupation , which has little charity for errors of imagination , though there is none , which more directly leads to just reflection and wisdom in the practical concerns of life . He attended for some years to the practice of his profession , with what success it is not easy now to ascertain ; Dr. Pichot of Geneva assures us , on his authority , that he at least so far trod the threshold , as to plead in criminal trials , under favor of the venerable custom , which gives the cause of indigent culprits to the youthful advocate , in the same way as the bodies of convicted ones are handed over to the young // anatomist . We are told by some , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wholly destitute of selfpossession : by others , that he was cool and penetrating , putting witnesses to the rack of cross-examination with infinite grace and satisfaction : but we have the authority of Mr. Lockhart for believing* that he gave few evidences of remarkable talent in his professional career . Nor is this at all surprising : this species of success requires some peculiarities of temperament , which are not always found in connexion with the highest reach of mind ; but it is evident enough , that though scarcely any branch of study could be named in which he might not have been eminent , the practice of the law was not congenial to a mind like his : we suspect that some of the profession might even now be found , who would rather search the mysteries of the feudal system in Ivanhoe than Blackstone . We are , however , assured by the same high authority , that he appeared before the General Assembly of Scotland on one occasion , with such brilliant eloquence , that Dr. Blair was tempted to renew his former prophecies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmity requires to prompt us to unwelcome labor ; his paternal inheritance , though inadequate to the purposes of literary leisure , placed him above the necessity of constant effort ; but , being unwilling to rely too much upon the profits of his pen , he took the resolution to find some permanent resource in office ; and he soon found this in the Sheriffalty of Selkirk , to which he some years afterwards added the place of one of the principal Clerks of Session . It is singular enough , that the boldest notes of Scottish inspiration should have been uttered b a sheriff of Selkirk , and an exciseman of Dumfries . y No doubt , the field of effort which he made so peculiarly his own , was at this time distinctly open to his view . He saw the capacities which were set before the poet 's eye by a land like his ; he must have felt his power of throwing a glory over its streams and mountains , which should endure till the last should perish and the others cease to flow . Bums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the lowland tongue : he had done that for the language and manners of his country , which could have beei*i accomplished only by a master 's hand ; he had elevated a coarse provincial dialect into the chosen one of tenderness and fancy ; he had led the muses from the high into the lowly walks of life , and // taught them to find as welcome an abode in the cottage as the kingly hail . The way was thus-prepared , for one might .. ier than himself to tread . Genius could ask no nobler field , than that which lay before him ; there are not many lands , with richer subjects for its power . Her traditions rushed upon his soul , with high and kindling influence ; his spirit was on fire with the recollection of her chivalry , and all her ancient glories ; rude as she might be to the stranger 's eye , she had charms for him , such as no other spot of earth could wear . These were the associations , of which his heart was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged at the cottage fireside ; that retreat , where they continue to linger , after the historian has passed them by , and where Providence has ordained for the salvation of the nations , that patriotism shall burn with purer light , than in the bosoms of the proud and high ; they twined round all the enjoyments of his childhood , and all his hopes of fame ; he had made them all his own ; and they were spread over the magnificent scenery of Scotland , like the veil of autumn haze upon the lake and river . He looked around him , and there were the Eildon hills , cloven in three by the rod of the enchanter ; there were the rude towers , dark with many a wild and fearful tale ; the venerable abbey , crumbling , but stjll magnificent , and grander in its ruins than the noblest work of modern art ; the battle-field , red with the blood of the loyal and the true , and consecrated by the glory of Wallace and of Bruce ; the mountain , , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than all , the cottage , where every variety of character was revealed ; here were scenes , where he was to fix the foun-* dations of no transitory fame . Just beyond him , were the highlands , an unknown region , except when the wild hordes swept from their declivities like a torrent in its wrath ; a stern and savage race , ennobled by the iron virtue of a loyalty , stronger than death ; fit dwellers of the mountain and the rock , claiming as little sympathy with the race beneath them , as the kingly eagle with the bird that soars on trembling wing below . If he asked for the heroes of the romantic legend , a long and bright array started into life before him ; there was the stern and haughty Douglas ; the queen , made immortal by her loveliness and sorrow ; the Knight of Snowdon , fit hero of an Oriental tale ; Claverhouse , with the fierceness of an avenging spirit beneath a brow of lofty beauty ; there was // the hardy borderer , rejoicing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeled to human sympathies , and elevated by enthusiasm to act and suffer , like a soldier of the cross . Such were some of the scenes and characters , which stood forth in light *t his command , like the rocks and headlands of Scotland in mysterious flame , as Bruce approached its shore . We are told by Scott himself , that he made his first poetical essay in some schoolboy lines upon a thunderstorm ; they were well received , until an apothecary 's wife administered to him a potion worse than any of her husband 's , by admitting the fact of their merit , hut proclaiming at the same time , that they were not his own . He says he never thought of her again without indignation , though she was not greatly in the wrong ; for he admits that the words and thoughts were borrowed , and there is nothing else which would afford much room for plunder . He did not attempt poetry again , until after the completion of his legal studies . Just about this time , German poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was introduced there by the recommendation *of Mackenzie , already very high ; and men were in as much rapture at the discovery , as the voyager with some unvisited and glorious island in the South Sea . Literary men set themselves instantly at work to become masters of the language : among others , Scott became a member of a class formed for that purpose , being attracted by its resemblance to the Lowland Scotch , and willing to follow the prevailing fashion , rather than from any enthusiastic feeling . His teacher soon grew weary of his pupils , and they on their side found more satisfaction in witnessing the unutterable contortions of a Frenchman , who was laboring to master the German and English at once , than in the new-found treasures of this peculiar literature . The impulse which Mackenzie gave was afterwards revived by a much weaker instrument . Matthew G. Lewis , observing the direction which the public taste had taken , spread his little sailtriumphantly , and undertook , in his novel of the Monk , to introduce the German taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work , though it is now hardly to be found even in those catacombs of perished romances , the circulating libraries , was so popular in its day , that Fox is recorded to have crossed the House of Commons , to compliment the author ; it was thought to J*ave created a new epoch in the literature of his country . In // this noon-tide of his fame , he chanced to visit Scotland , where an intimacy grew up between himself and Scott , which gave a new color to the young advocate 's future life . Animated by observing Lewis 's success , and conscious , as he could hardly fail to be , of the superiority of his own powers , he turned his attention anew to German literature , and published translations of Burger 's Lenora , and the Wild Huntsman . His little adventure did not keep the sea ; he found nobody but the trunkmaker greatly benefited by his labors . One finds it difficult to credit this of him , whose works a few years afterwards were borne as fast and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farthest regions of the earth . It is interesting to dwell upon this portion of his life : those who are , early discouraged by neglect may derive instruction from witnessing the severe discipline which he had to undergo . Two years after this , he published a translation of Goethe 's Goetz of Berlichingen . His first original production was the ballad of Glenfinlas , written in imitation of the fragments of Gaelic poetry , of which he entertained a higher opinion than the critical remarks of Mr. Oldbuck would have led us to believe . This was followed by another ballad , called the Eve of St. John , composed for the pious purpose of preserving Smallholm tower from dilapidation ; its proprietor having promised to protect it , upon condition of being paid in poetry . These pieces were communicated to his friends , not precisely in the same manner as the homilies of the Archbishop of Granada to Gil BIas , but accompanied with an earnest request that they should criticise them with the utmost freedom , and mark the portions , which might be improved : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that not a verse was left untouched , and hardly a single line ; until , in a sort of desperation , he restored the work to its original state , and bade defiance to the critics . His friend Lewis was at this time engaged upon his Tales of Wonder , in which , at his solicitation , Scott 's two ballads were inserted : though not until Lewis had taken him to task , in a very lofty way , for the inaccuracy of his rhymes . Nothing can be more ludicrous than the grave and complacent style in which Lewis rebukes him , as Sir Geoffrey Hudson gives advice to his giant namesake of the Peak . The world , however , exhibited no great admiration of the Tales of Wonder ; Lewis made a total wreck of all the reputation he had previously gained , and went at once to the // bottom ; and Scott was glad to reach the shore , without any loss of his ; his portion of the work was in truth the only one , which was treated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably encouraging : nor , according to his own account , did the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border , a work composed partly of ancient ballads , and partly of imitations of them , bring him much nearer to the fulfilment of his hope deferred ' of fame , though Mr. Cunningham assures us , that this was the foundation of his glory . Hogg 's mother , a venerable lady , who was quite at home in the literature of the border , told him , that these ballads were made for singing , and no for reading ; * and the public inclined to the same opinion : many of them are , however , remarkable for simplicity and beauty . It was not until the publication of the Lay of the Last Minstrel , that he stood forth like Eneas from the cloud , with the bearing of a son of light , and set the seal of immortality upon his name . Fortunate as Scott certainly was in the powers and attainments , which fitted him for his new career , no less than in the discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so in the character of the poetry of his day . It resembled the listless stillness of a summer noon . The repose of the poetical regions had been not at all disturbed by the mighty convulsions , which , at the close of the last century , were subverting thrones and altars , and investing the minds of men with the fearful energies of a destroying angel : and the poets slept as quietly as Aswad , when awakened by the mother of Thalaba in the Paradise of Irem . We can hardly comprehend now , that Hayley should ever have been mistaken for a poet , much less a great one ; and the Pleasures of Memory must have delighted , rather by the smoothness of the verse and the associations twining round the subject , than by any exhibition which it gave of real power . There were indeed two great names , which must be taken as exceptions , and by no means as examples of the inspiration of the time* two , as strangely contrasted in their moral qualities , as in the whole frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Burns , of whom we have found occasion more than once to speak . The poetry of Burns was the reflection of a fierce and indignant spirit , on fire with a sense of its imagined wrongs , and alternately breathing forth its notes of reckless sarcasm , withering reproach , and wild sensibility , // with the blasting power of a fallen angel , or the burning accents of a seraph 's tongue ; that of Cowper , in his better hours , was the inspiration of the meek and lowly , walking abroad , at the eventide , under the influences of a blessed faith , to meditate among the works of God . Men were astonished to see a peasant rising from the cottage fireside , with a proud consciousness of his superiority , to take his place in the front rank of genius ; but it was the contrast between his condition and his pretensions which amazed them ; the full measure of his intellectual energy was hardly understood then , nor is it adequately now ; and so it was with Cowper : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , but they would have loved it better , had it been covered by some other than religious light . Apart from them , the poetry of England was like the spirit of the frozen sea ; no expression played upon the marble stillness of its face , and no glow of life re* lieved its deep repose . There is no period in the history of England for centuries , when its inspiration was bound by so paralysing a spell . This was the very time for a great master to appear , whose voice should ring like a trumpet-call over field and flood ; but it required no common power so to wind it , as to stir the heart . A certain measure of the admiration of the hour is at the command of all , who choose to play off an extravagant mimicry of models , which the public are content to praise . Scott 's own experience was evidence enough of this , when he afterwards found himself attended , like Falstaff , by a train of imitators , who were prouder to follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march to Coventry at their head ; but none but the highest talent can turn back the current of false taste , or induce the depraved appetite to drink at the unpolluted fountain . False taste is but another name for false opinion ; nothing but the hand of a mighty reformer can dash its idols to the earth . This was the first part of Scott 's undertaking ; and he was next to throw the attractions of romance and poetry over the rugged features of border chivalry , a dispensation which the world had never admired before , and over a state of society , eminently destitute of those qualities , that sometimes give a grace and ornament to the wildest forms of savage life . His experiment was certainly a bold one , and he so regarded it ; two of his friends , to whom he exhibited some portions of his un // finished work , shook their heads and went their way ; but the critical imyrimatur of Jeffrey was set upon it ; and we need not attempt to describe the wonder and delight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet recent ; it burst upon the world , like the icy covering of the boughs , beneath the glories of a winter 's sun . It has been fashionable enough to say , that the poetry of Scott is not destined to be read hereafter ; some infer this from its unusual popularity , as if nothing could be seen aright , except at the distance of a century . Even Sir James Mackintosh , no common judge , believed that it could not last , because none but the most elaborate poetry had yet defied the test of time . This is , after all , only saying , that it does not square with our notions of what poetry ought to be . Some believe , that the poet trespasses upon the province of another , when he deserts nature to find a subject in the world of art ; others imagine , that the heart is his only true dominion ; and there are very few , who do not set up a poetical definition of their own , like the image in the plain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal with which they do it homage . But this is partial judgment ; it takes one quality for all , unlike the Oriental tale , which represents the foot that kicked a vessel of water to a thirsty animal , as conveyed to Paradise to enjoy its reward , while the remainder of the man found no such recompense . It is possible , after all , that the waters of Israel may be found of no less healing virtue than the rivers of Damascus ; - that the very qualities which in our opinion lead to death , may be the very ones which shall make the works of genius live . The poetry of Scott falls within none of these definitions . His versification , perfect as much of it may be , betrays in many instances very little of the care of preparation ; there is nothing so aristocratic in his love of nature , as to make him look with indifference on art ; nothing so fervent in his contemplation of the heart , as to make him insensible to human action . Action is indeed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of his reader beats high as it is borne along with the rush and sweep of its movement ; and it is vain to say , that there is nothing of poetry in what so excites us ; we might as well deny , that there was music in the h*irpstring of the ancient bard . The truth is , that it was a development of the same qualities , which were afterwards manifested in his romances with such // commanding power , in a form , less fitted to reveal them in their full perfection . Fortunate indeed it was , if that can be attributed to fortune , which is an accident befalling genius only , that he afterwards assamed another form , better calcula* ted for the exhibition of character in all its shifting alternations of light and shade , its infinite varieties of stern feeling , of high resolve , of playful humor , of every thing , in short , from the loftiest to the lowest . The ancients understood this , when they placed the region of song upon the mountain 's brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight and the storm , and lifted above the crowd , that hurry onward in the paths of life around its base . Shakspeare understood it no less , and uniformly throws aside the restraint of verse , when he has to deal with the familiar and the common . The romance , as Scott afterwards presented it , was the discovery of his maturity ; it was poetry still ; but he had laid aside conventional restraint , and gone forth with the active bound of the mountaineer , when his foot is on his native hills . Any one will feel the force of this remark , who considers how perfectly impossible it would have been to present such a personage as Captain Dalgetty in verse ; while Ellen Douglas is as delightful a vision as his pencil ever drew . It was thus that the form of verse became a limitation of his power . Still , though we do not incline to place the metrical romances among the highest efforts of talent , not even of his own , we believe that there are redeeming virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . What can be richer or more glowing than his descriptions ? They are not like the images reflected dimly in the dark chamber , when the sun is shut in by clouds ; they stand out in full distinctness and reality , like the outline of the mountains on the evening skies of autumn . What was ever more beautiful or truer , than his picture *f the scenery of Loch Katrine in the Lady of the Lake , a poem by which the pilgrim traces out his path , as if directed by a golden bough ? This is the first of his poems , in which his descriptive power is revealed in a perfection , which not even he could afterwards excel * though probably no traveller will visit Melrose or Flodden , made so celebrated by his earlier ones , hereafter , without recollecting their departed minstrel , or gaze upon a lake or mountain of Scotland , without bidding his gentle spirit rest , It is a great prerogative of genius , thus to write its name upon every hill and valley 9f its // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it there . Then his sentiments are always just , and flow naturally , without enthusiasm , as if they merely shadowed forth the prevailing temper of his soul . But the real , inwrought , undying charm is that of which we have already spoken ;  --  the life and spirit of the action , rolling onward in a deep and flashing tide ; and this , in spite of all definitions , will hardly fail to be regar4-ed as an evidence of the existence and power of the art divine . Certain it is , that no conqueror ever gained a victory more decisive and complete , than that which was accomplished by the author of the Lay of the Last Minstrel ; and yet it is far from being the best of the class to which it belonga . Its characters are dim and shadowy , and betray very little of that perfect mastery of the heart , which was afterwards so strikingly displayed . His heroes of border chivalry are no more distinguished by any peculiar qualities , than Gyas and Cloanthus ; the Lady of Buccleugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attempt to feel much interest in the others . There are many defects in the construction of the story , which seems to have been formed without any regular plan , the writer having evidently drifted with the tide ; and the superstitions , however characteristic and true , are sometimes startling and repulsive . All this is probably owing to the manner in which the tale was written . Scott was requested to write a ballad upon the legend of Gilpin Homer , which was expanded in its progress into this poem ; and it was thus prepared under all the disadvantages of an involuntary , if not of a reluctant task . But all this and more would be atoned for by the bursts of genuine poetry , which are perpetually breaking forth ; yet we remember it rather as a succession of beautiful fragments , than a well compacted and perfect whole . In Marmion , which appeared three years after , there were the same defects and beauties , each in less degree , but other excellencies were added , which the Lay had not revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Marmion was full of life ; the construction of the story was not perfect , and the versification , though in many places rich and beautiful , was in many others rude and careless ; but it led right onward to the glorious battle scene , one of the finest passages of narrative poetry in the language ; of which it is hard to believe that , in its present form , it required the labor only of a single afternoon . Thus the various excellencies of &amp;ott // were gradually exhibiting themselves , like stars above the horizon : in the first instance , we find true sentiment , and passages of uncommon beauty ; then comes the animated and varied action ; and the fullness of his descriptive power is reserved for the Lady of the Lake , the most popular of all his metrical romances , and the best deserving of its reputation . Its characters are beautifully drawn , and the story proceeds with undiminished interest to its close ; nothing in poetry surpasses the magic beauty of its scenery ; it shows , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , than any of his former works . But it is needless to enter into an inquiry respecting the merit of poems , which have been read with admiration wherever the English language is known . Rokeby and the Lord of the Isles were the only remarkable ones which followed ; these were distinguished by other traits than any which preceded them ; they exhibited far more variety and precision in their views of character , and greater hurry in the preparation . Scott had evidently become in a degree weary of his task , nor was this at all wonderful : he says that he had taught others to use his weapon as skilfully as himself ; a world of imitators had assumed his dress , and mimicked his voice and air , until he was completely ashamed of his . company , and the world was tired of the motley train . Another circumstance bad for some time prompted him to leave the field ; this was the appearance of Lord Byron in the lists ; whose original genius , together with the mystery that hung around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung , secured a complete monopoly of the public favor , and left no space for others ; but be retreated with a grace , that deserved to win the honors of the highest victory ; and , far from murmuring at the change , pursued the path on which he had already entered and was now to tread without a rival . The Lord of the Isles and Rokeby were published aftei* Waverley appeared ; so that , before this resolution took complete effect , he had begun his new and memorable task . From . the time when he commenced the publication of his poems , his wealth had kept increasing with his reputation ; * this was a period of his life , which we have passed over somewhat hastily ; but his condition in respect to fortune , a blessing to which poetry is. not uniformly found to lead , was afl that poet could desire . In his . beautiful retreat at Abbotsford , in the midst of a region frill of song and legendary tale , he // 307 was at leisure to pursue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already beyond the reach of accident ; but some secret misgivings led him to adopt that mystery in regard to his romances at first , which , partial as it always was , kept the world forever on the watch to pierce it . He evidently looked upon Waverley as a hazardous e*rperiment ; and so it was : for unless he could reform the public taste , already vitiated , there was no hope for him ; the sentimental novels of the day must fly before it , or itself must perish ; and well he knew , that the literature of his country had nothing to which it could be likened . There were romances in abundance , but something more was wanting . Nobody could deny to Richardson the praise of just and noble sentiment , and a famil .. knowledge of some affections of the heart ; nor was this light praise ; he was l ) opular in his day , because he was infinitely superior to all who went before him ; but his day was long since past ; his characters were looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume of a century ago ; and men had no patience with one who managed a love affair with as many notes and protocols , as a conference on the affairs of Belgium . Fielding and Smollett were great in their own sphere , but that sphere assuredly was not high ; nothing could surpass the fidelity of their portraiture of certain modes of social life with which they were familiar ; but neither of them had the least conception of poetical romance . With these exceptions , and one or two others , the field was entirely barren ; for the sentimental trash of twenty years ago has no claim to be remembered ; having performed its task of injuring the public taste , it was ready to pass quietly into oblivion , when the hand of a true magician should dissolve the spell . It will not be expected , that we should enter on a critical examination of Waverley , andthe brilliant train which followed it , when we have hardly room to enumerate them all ; it would be the offering of a plea , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with greaterimpartial .. ity , than before the hand which created them was cold and still . The historical romance was indeed - of his creation , and he stands responsible for it in character and fame ; if it be true , as some have said , that he has thrown a false coloring over the severe truth of history , with a view to lead other minds astray , we might still admire , but we could no longer venture to defend // him . We know that some have gone so far , as to charge him , for his representation of the Covenanters , with deliberate and wicked falsehood ; but it would be well for those who thus accuse him to consider whether , if he is partial on the one side , they are not as much so on the other ; in fact , when we can not read of the wars of Greece and Troy without taking sides , it is vain to talk of perfect impartiality in matters nearer to our own day . One might as well believe all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one will deny , that they have shown little mercy to their political or religious foes* He probably gave a true transcript of his own impressions and prejudices in regard to the religious sects , with which he had to deal , and may have done them undesigned injustice , though he has certainly invested them with many noble qualities . Mr. Cunningham has told us , that the Cameronians acknowledged the fidelity of the portrait ; but if it were erroneous , we should no more think of charging him with falsehood , than we should charge his accusers with the same failing in regard to him . There was no motive for it : Scott was not one , who found it necessary to Tesort to extravagance or caricature ; his taste , if not his moral *en*e , would have prevented this . When again we are told , that by mingling fancy with fact , and changing the order of events , he has perverted history , and led us into errOr , we at once perceive , that the objection rests on an unfounded theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to make it criminal to disregard their order or connexion ; history itself has no value , except so far as its lessons have a moral influence ; a man may study chronological tables forever , and be no wiser than when he first began . If , according to the former charge , he perverts history by false views of the influence of events or character , it is a grave oflbnceundoubtedly ; but throwing the rich veil of fancy over the rigid features of historical fact is not doing this ; it is only investing it with a graceful drapery , instead of a deceitful mask . We have no doubt that thousands have bec*n induced to read history , by the influence of these romances , who would otherwise as soon have sat down to nmuse themselves with Coke or Euler ; nor do we think that they have in general complained that the author has deceived them . It would be strange if he should misrepresent so well , as to send his readers to the very spot , where they may find the *ui*ns-*of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his // pictures of James I. , of Mary , of Elizabeth , and of Cromwell , are taken from the life ? They go beyond the usual power of history , which gives their likenesses too often with the inexpressive features of the marble image on their tombs ; while he makes them walk forth from the canvas , like the queen in the Winter 's Tale , with ail the freshness of reality . The scene of the earliest of his romances is laid in Scotland ; and for this very reason , they are probably the best ; though when one is called upon to select the finest of the whole , the chances are , that he will enumerate a third part of the number . He could hardly fail to share the feeling , which he attributes to the generous Highland outlaw ; though his heart did not shrink , nor his arm wither like fern in the frost , when he lost sight of his native hills ; the world had no prospect that could console him for the loss of the rocks and cairns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The characters of those , of which the scene is laid in other countries and other times , are powerfully drawn , and the action is not less quick and exciting ; but the moral associations connected with the scenery are wanting , and we are sometimes tempted to look back with the feeling of the dying chief , to the blue hills of his country . There he was conversing with what he saw and knew ; his Antiquary was so true a picture , that it led a friend to the discovery of the secret of the authorship ; his characters were welcomed by his countrymen as old acquaintances , as in fact they generally were ; Jeanie Deans , a most affecting portrait of unpretending nobleness of soul , was real ; and when Mr. Jarvie assured his brethren of the council , who set up their nashgabs at him , ' that Rob Roy , saving the misfortune of some folks losing life by him , and one or two other trifling qualifications , was an honester man than stude on any of their shanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his worthy father the deacon , were perfectly remembered by the aged men of Glasgow ? At a later period , he evidently feared that his readers had grown weary of the subject ; and he therefore left the land of his departed ancestors and living friends , the happy family mansion , to go abroad in others ; wherever he went , he found and represented man ; but this was a spot , which he could not leave without a sigh . Wherever his scenes are laid , whether in Switzerland or in the Holy Land , man is at work and in action , as he is in the broad highway of life ; he appears , not to sustain , a character , or to play a part , but to talk // and feel and act like man . The beings whom God had made were good enough for him ; you do not find them heralded with pomp and acclamations , nor are you warned beforehand whom and what you are to meet ; but you look on and observe them as they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you encountered them in the daily walks of life , and carry away as distinct an impression of their dress and every other peculiarity , as if you had just parted from them in the field or in the street . So it is with his descriptions : instead of being sensible that he reads them , one feels as if he were abroad in the open sky , where every object is distinct and true , and in perfect harmony with others ; the power of association is at work ; he suggests the outline , and fancy finishes the picture ; and that picture is reality and nature , and not a poor resemblance of artificial life . There is no illusion or extravagance ; and to say that such representations are not happy in their moral influence is only to declare , that nothing valuable can be learned by the study of mankind . When Waverley appeared , men beheld it with as much perplexity , as the out-break of a revolution ; the more prudent held their peace , and waited to see what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having nothing wherewithal to measure it ; some were as stubborn in refusing to admire it as was Dr. Johnson in refusing to laugh at the waggery of Foote , and with pretty much the same result ; but the public , without asking their opinion , gave decisive judgment in its favor . Guy Mannering came next , and swelled the tide of favor to a torrent : here was a tale of our own times , and every body knew the characters as well , as the old shipmaster at Wapping remembered Captain Gulliver . There was not an old lawyer of Edinburgh , who had not played at high jinks with Sheriff Pleydell ; of Meg Merrilies they were not so certain , though they thought they must have seen her ; but great would have been their satisfaction , had they known the author half so well , as Andrew Dinmont and the whole race of Pepper and Mustard . The Antiquary was of a different cast : with less of fire and action , it had greater elegance of style , and more originality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drawn with singular skill ; none but a master could have kept alive the attention of the reader , after the fearful scene of Halket head . Though at first somewhat less popular than the others , it went in a short time beyond // them in the public favor . The author 's reputation was now established beyond the fear of change ; be went on traversing almost the whole imaginable field of romance , and throwing off his tales from the press with the rapidity of enchantment ; while in the mean time , to put the public more at fault as to their source , he wrote and published poems , and edited various works , which would have filled the time of any other man . While he was thus delighting the world with his creations , that misfortune fell upon him , which was probably the remote cause *hat brought him to the grave . All the fruits of his laborious industry were swept away by the bankruptcy of his publishers , and he was suddenly crushed beneath a load of debt , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have witnessed with dismay . One hardly knows whether to regret or not , that he felt the weight of this calamity ; for it revealed some noble traits of character , which prosperity has no chance to show ; but it is affecting to think of him as he was afterwards , exhausting all the powers of his mind with more zeal in order to be just , and for the benefit of others , than he had done for his own ; not in the expectation of wholly throwing off the burden , or of securing that provision for his age , to which the least selfish look with hope . To this we are indebted for the revelation of the secret which might otherwise have gone with him to the tomb , the authorship of Waverley ; it could be kept no longer : and when he at length avowed it , prepared as men were for the discovery , it came upon theIn like the words of the Black Knight on the ear of Locksley , I am Richard of England ! ' And what a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these romances , he was not only the author , but the sole and unaided author ; that with the exception of quotations , there was not a single word in them which was not derived from himself , or suggested in the course of his reading ! The wand of the enchanter was now , as he said , broken , and the rod was buried . From this time forth he applied all his energies to the task which no one but himself could have dreamed of executing ; the biography of Bonaparte , a hasty but most imposing picture , the Tales of a Grandfather , and the History of Scotland , the one a delightful series of familiar tales , the other a dignified and authentic narrative , and his tales of demonology , together with a fresh and brilliant series of romances , flowed in quick succession from his pen ; and if any of these betray the marks of // haste or imperfect preparation , who but must wonder , that with his purposes thus broken off , and the shadows of age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix that admiration , which he had claimed without a rival in his better days ? The boxy might be partially unstrung , but no hand but that of Ulysses even now could bend it . But the close of his labors was appointed , and was fast approaching . In 1831 , four years after the occurrence of that misfortune , to which allusion has just been made , a severe illness , the effect of his incessant application , gave emphatic warning , that his end was drawing nigh . With the vain hope of restoration , he was induced to go abroad , and dwell for a time beneath the sunny skies of Italy ; in the language of Wordsworth , the whole world 's good wishes went with him ; but he was apparently sensible that it was too late for hope , and longed to return to his home , to be nearer a more permanent habitation . When he arrived in London , his fine intellect was overspread by a dim and disastrous eclipse ; on his return to Abbotsford he seemed partially revived ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind and body sunk together , and on the 21st of September 1832 , he died . With what feelings the intelligence of this event was heard , is well known to all ; it was universally regarded as a personal misfortune . If Scotland wept over bill and valley for her darling bard , there was no co*intry , where his name had gone forth , which did not share her sorrow . It is hard to estimate the power of a mind , which stands alone and unapproached in its peculiar sphere ; certain it is , that there is none , in the history of recent literature , with which it is to be compared ; in the whole literature of England , there is but one , and that one is Shakspeare . Who but Scott could stand the test of such comparison ? We do not pretend , that Scott was Shakspeare 's equal ; the genius of the Child of Fancy , far from being bounded by the real , ranged through the vast extent of all imaginable being ; summoning at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , as his Prospero calls down the sunshine or directs the storm . He saw the soul , when it lay beneath the wrath of fearful passions , like a wreck upon the sea ; the heart-wrung agony of Lear ,  --  the unearthly vengeance of Iago ,  --  the spirit of Hamlet , crushed beneath the burden of an awful mystery , which it can not cast away : - all the forms of life , so unlike our ordinary // being , and yet so fearfully true ,  --  these were his chosen field , and it was open to none but him . Who but he could have created Ariel , the most delightful spirit that ever crossed the poet 's dream ? The power of the supernatural has so completely perished , that Scott never fails more signally than when he labors to revive it ; and yet , there are many things in which he resembles , while in all he stands only next to Shakspeare . Both broke the chains of artificial life , and explored the deep treasures of the heart ; instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no permanent existence , they described it under the influence of passions and emotions , forever and every where the same . The task of Scott was in some respects the lightest : his position in life made him familiar with the train of feelings incident to most of those whom he describes ; while Shakspeare , though he did it with a sagacity which could not err , was compelled to attribute those of the beings whom he knew to those with whom he was not conversant . We are affected by both , as Mr. Partridge was with Garrick 's acting ; there seems to he no acting in the case ; every body moves and does as other men would do , in the same situation . In these respects , the power of both is very nearly the same ; in each , it is alike exhaustless . Both knew that great secret of human character and action , its relentings and compunctious visitings ; the wild flowers and green places are not all covered by the black and scorching lava ; even when the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes , a gleam of tenderness comes over it , like that pause amid the storm which Gray pronounced so like the voice of a spirit . Do you see that saugh-tree ? ' said Meg Merrilies ; it s but a blackened stump now : I ye sat under it many a bonny summer afternoon , when it hung its gay garlands ower the poppling water . I ye sat there , and I ye held you on my knee , Henry Bertram , and sung ye songs of the old barons and their bloody wars . It will never be green again , and Meg Merrilies will never sing blithe songs mair . ' So it is with the touch of heart-break whi**h unmans Rob Roy , when Helen made a lament , as well as Macrimmon himself could have made it , on his exile from his own land ; and there is nothing more touching or more true than the exclamation of Ellen Douglas , Oh what have I to do with pride ? - and that of the high-souled Jewish maiden , I will never wear // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feeling which makes both the teachers of a living and excellent philosophy ; : and not only such are they , hut they are at the same time so thoroughly familiar with the practical concerns of life , that the most just rules of conduct may be gathered from their writings . Whatever may he the merit *f Sir Walter 's other worksr it is on his poetical ones , of course including his historical romances , that his fame will chiefly rest . The former might create a high and lasting reputation for any other man ; but they are lost in the surpassing splendor of his works of fancy . His biography of Napoleon is a rich and animated sketch ; hut when it is remembered , that men are still too much dazzled by that portentous meteor to gaze upon its track with steady eye , we need not wonder that Scott failed to view it in the light of mild philosophy . He designed it for a popular narrative ; and , as such , it will long remain without a rival . It wants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of his age ; and the time to write it in a spirit of impartiality is not yet come . The lives of Swift and Dryden are better examples of philosophical investigation ; those of the Novelists are wrought with less care , though full of interesting facts and judicious criticism . In all his works , his style is as free and unaffected as his mind ; energetic , solemn , bold and eloquent , as his immediate purpose may reqmre ; we know not whether its not unfrequent carelessness is felt by the reader as a blemish ; it certainly is far more easily forgiven*. than the appearance of stateliness or art . We have already spoken of the graces of his private character ; on this point there is no discordant testimony , and it is one on which we may profitably dwell . It is rarely given us to see a man so eminent , and yet so humble ; so exalted in the world 's esteem , and so lowly in his own ; so ready to allow to others the praise , which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong temptations of honor and success , greater than our imperfect nature often has to show ; if it is not virtue , it as truly indicates its presence , as the emerald verdure does the richness of the soil beneath . Kindness to others was the ruling passion of his life ; his humour , bright and penetrating as it was , was always playful and forbearing , and while it flashed , reffised to wound ; not a shade of selfishness was in his heart ; his greatest happiness appeared to // spring from seeing others happy . I was told , ' says Mr. Cunningham , that he was never moved to anger but once , and that was against a clergyman , who unthinkingly began to remove one of the large gray stones which mark the tragic event recorded in that mournful ballad ,  --  the Dowie Dens of Yarrow . ' A beautiful picture of his domestic life has been given by one of our countrymen , who visited him at Abboisford , a year before its noble tenant took leave of it forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard to say a harsh word of another ; and when misfortune gathered heavily around him , it did not , as it is too apt to do , harden the heart it has no power to conquer ; his temper and affections were still unchanged and kind . There is no higher eulogium to be paid to man , than to say , that he remains faithful to his character through every change of prosperity and sorrow ; it can he only paid to him , who finds his pleasures in the way of duty . In his writings as well as in his daily conversation , he was always found on virtue s side ; they are throughout a vindication of the humble and domestic virtues ; they reflect his own high principles and sentiments as truly , as the lake reflects the sky . In one of his fine tales of border chivalry , he has represented Nature as lamenting when the Poet dies , and uniting with man to celebrate the obsequies of her departed worshipper . A beautiful fiction indeed it is , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed , shall partake of human sympathy when it is withdrawn , and when he , whom they once knew. , shall be known to them no more . And for whom should Nature mourn , if not fot him , who has made her dear to many hearts ,  --  who has thrown a charm over all the scenery of his native land , which shall live when ages shall have passed away ? On every one of her mountains he has set a crown of glory , like that which is flung upon them by the morning sunbeam ; he has converted her valleys into a holy land , towards which the footsteps of the literary pilgrim tend ; at his call , her bards and heroes have awoke , and brought back all that delights us in the legendary tale , or thrills us in romance or chivalry . If it be forbidden to inanimate nature to mourn for such a worshipper , his memory will not fail in any Scottish heart ; but not to Scotland only will his name and praise be limit -- ed : - they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotest islands of the sea ; and they will endure , wheft those of the proudest conquerors shall have passed into ohlivk*.
