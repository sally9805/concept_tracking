This is not the place to enter upon the discussion of the question of the actual merits of the titles claimed by the respective parties upon principles of natural law . That would involve the consideration of many nice and delicate topics , as to the nature and origin of property in the soil , and the extent to which civilized man may demand it from the savage for uses or cultivation different from , and perhaps more beneficial to , society than the uses to which the latter may choose to appropriate it . Such topics belong more properly to a treatise on natural law than to lectures professing to treat upon the law of a single nation . 5 . The European nations found little difficulty in reconciling themselves to the adoption of any principle which gave ample scope to their ambition , and employed little reasoning to support it . They were content to take counsel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt no necessity of vindicating their conduct before cabinets , which were already eager to recognize its justice and its policy . The Indians were a savage race , sunk in the depths of ignorance and heathenism . If they might not be extirpated for their want of religion and just morals , they might be reclaimed from their errors . They were bound to yield to the superior genius of Europe , and in exchanging their wild and debasing habits for civilization and Christianity they were deemed to gain more than an equivalent for every sacrifice and suffering. * The Papal authority , too , was brought in aid of these great designs ; and for the purpose of overthrowing heathenism , and propagating the Catholic religion , 2 Alexander the Sixth , by a Bull issued in 1493 , granted to the Crown of Castile the whole of the immense territory then discovered , or to be discovered , between the poles , so far as it was not then possessed by any Christian prince . 3 1 8 Wheat .

Coll . 3. /z/ 6 . The principle , then , that discovery gave title to the government , by whose subjects or by whose authority it was made , against all other European governments , being once established , it followed almost as a matter of course , that every government within the limits of its discoveries excluded all other persons from any right to acquire the soil by any grant whatsoever from the natives . No Cation would suffer either its own subjects or those of any other nation to set up or vindicate any such title . 1 It was deemed a right exclusively belonging to the government in its sovereign capacity to extinguish the Indian title , and to perfect its own dominion over the soil , and dispose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be asked , what was the effect of this principle of discovery in respect to the rights of the natives themselves . In the view of the Europeans it created a peculiar relation between themselves and the aboriginal inhabitants . The latter were admitted to possess a present right of occupancy , or use in the soil , which was subordinate to the ultimate dominion of the discoverer . They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil , with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it , and to use it according to their own discretion . In a certain sense they were permitted to exercise rights of sovereignty over it . They might sell or transfer it to the sovereign , who discovered it ; but they were denied the authority to dispose of it to any other persons ; and until such a sale or transfer , they were generally permitted to occupy it as sovereigns de facto . But notwithstanding this occupancy , the European discoverers claimed and exercised the right to grant the soil , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right of occupancy ; and the title so granted was universally admitted to convey a sufficient title in the soil to the grantees in perfect dominion , or , as it is sometimes expressed in treatises of public law , it was a transfer of plenum et utile dominium. 8 . This subject was discussed at great length in the celebrated case of Johnson v. M'Intosh ; and one can not do better than transcribe from the pages of that report a summary of the historical confirmations adduced in support of these principles , which is more clear and exact than has ever been before in print . 9 . " The history of America , ( says Mr. Chief Justice Marshall , 1 Chalmers , Annals , 676 , 677 ; 1 Doug . Summ , 213L /q/ in delivering the opinion of the Court , ) l from its discovery to the present day , proves , we think , the universal recognition of these principles . " Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope . Her discussions respecting boundary , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery . Portugal sustained her claim to the Brazils by the same title . 10 . " France , also , founded her title to the vast territories she claimed in America on discovery . However conciliatory her conduct to the natives may have been , she still asserted her right of dominion over a great extent of country not actually settled by Frenchmen , and her exclusive right to acquire and dispose of the soil , which remained in the occupation of Indians . Her monarch claimed all Canada and Acadie , as colonies of France , at a time when the French population was very inconsiderable , and the Indians occupied almost the whole country . He also claimed Louisiana , comprehending the immense territories watered by the Mississippi , and the rivers which empty into it , by the title of discovery . The letters-patent granted to the Sieur Demonts , in 1603 , constitute him Lieuten ant-General , and the representative of the king in Acadie , which is described as stretching from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to extend the power of the French over that country and its inhabitants , to give laws to the people , to treat with the natives , and enforce the observance of treaties , and to parcel out and give title to lands , according to his own judgment . 11 . " The states of Holland also made acquisitions in America , and sustained their right on the common principle adopted by all Europe . They allege , as we are told by Smith , in his History of New York , that Henry Hudson , who sailed , as they say , under the orders of their East India Company , discovered the country from the Delaware to the Hudson , up . which he sailed to the 43d degree of north latitude ; and this country they claimed under the title acquired by this voyage . Their first object was commercial , as 1 8 Wheat . 543 . See also Worcester v.

The claim of the Dutch was always contested by the English ; not because they questioned the title given by discovery , but because they insisted on being themselves the rightful claimants under that title . Their pretensions were finally decided by the sword . 12 . " No one of the powers of Europe gave its full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents upon this subject are ample and complete . So early as the year 1496 , her monarch granted a commission to the Cabots , to discover countries then unknown to Christian people , and . to take possession of them in the name of the King of England . Two years afterwards , Cabot proceeded on this voyage , and discovered the continent of North America , along which he sailed as far south as Virginia . To this discovery the English trace their title . In this first effort made by the English government to acquire territory on this continent , we perceive a complete recognition of the principle which has been mentioned . The right of discovery given by this commission is confined to countries ' then unknown to Christian people ' ; and of these countries Cabot was empowered to take possession in the name of the King of England . Thus asserting a right to take possession , notwithstanding the occupancy of the natives , who were heathens , and , at the same time , admitting the prior title of any Christian people , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same principle continued to be recognized . The charter granted to Sir Humphrey Gilbert , in 1578 , authorizes him to discover and take possession of such remote , heathen , and barbarous lands , as were not actually possessed by any Christian prince or people . This charter was afterwards renewed to Sir Walter Raleigh , in nearly the same terms . 14 . " By the charter of 1606 , under which the first permanent English settlement on this continent was made , James the First granted to Sir Thomas Gates and others , those territories in America lying on the sea-coast between the 34th and 45th degrees of north latitude , and which either belonged to that monarch , or were not then possessed by any other Christian prince or people . The grantees were divided into two companies at their own request . /q/ The first , or southern colony was directed to settle between the 34th and 41st degrees of north latitude ; and the second , or northern colony , between the 38th and 45th degrees . 15 . " In 1609 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made , a new and more enlarged charter was given by the crown to the first colony , in which the king granted to the ' Treasurer and Company of Adventurers of the city of London for the first colony in Virginia , ' in absolute property , the lands extending along the sea-coast four hundred miles , and into the land throughout from sea to sea . This charter , which is a part of the special verdict in this cause , was annulled so far as respected the rights of the company , by the judgment of the Court of King 's Bench on a writ of quo warranto ; but the whole effect allowed to this judgment was , to revest in the crown the powers of government , and the title to the lands within its limits . 16 . " At the association of those who held under the grant to the second or northern colony , a new and more enlarged charter was granted to the Duke of Lenox and others , in 1620 , who were denominated the Plymouth Company , conveying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 48th degrees of north latitude . Under this patent , New England has been in a great measure settled . The company conveyed to Henry Rosewell and others , in 1627 , that territory which is now Massachusetts ; and in 1628 , a charter of incorporation , comprehending the powers of government , was granted to the purchasers . A great part of New England was granted by this company , which , at length , divided their remaining lands among themselves ; and , in 1635 , surrendered their charter to the crown . A patent was granted to Gorges for Maine , which was allotted to him in the division of property . All the grants made by the Plymouth Company , so far as we can learn , have been respected . 17 . " In pursuance of the same principle , the king , in 1664 , granted to the Duke of York the country of New England as far south as the Delaware Bay . His royal highness transferred New Jersey to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. 18 . " In 1663 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country lying between the 36th degree of north latitude and the river St. Mathes ; and in 1666 , the proprietors obtained from the crown a new charter , granting to them that prov- /z/ ince in the king 's dominions in North America , which lies from 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to the 29th degree , and from the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea . 19 . " Thus has our whole country been granted by the crown while in the occupation of the Indians . These grants purport to convey the soil , as well as the right of dominion , to the grantees . In those governments which were denominated royal , where the right to the soil was not vested in individuals , but remained in the crown , or was vested in the colonial government , the king claimed and exercised the right of granting lands , and of dismembering the government at his will . The grants made out of the two original colonies , after the resumption of their charters by the crown , are examples of this . The governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania , Maryland , and a part of Carolina were thus created . In all of them the soil , at the time the grants were made , was occupied by the Indians . Yet almost every title within those governments is dependent on these grants . In some instances , the soil was conveyed by the crown unaccompanied by the powers of government , as in the case of the northern neck of Virginia . It has never been objected to this , or to any other similar grant , that the title as well as possession was in the Indians when it was made , and that it passed nothing on that account . 20 . " These various patents can not be considered as nullities ; nor can they be limited to a mere grant of the powers of government . A charter intended to convey political power only would never contain words expressly granting the land , the soil , and the waters . Some of them purport to convey the soil alone ; and in those cases in which the powers of government as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always acknowledged itself to be bound by the grant . Though the power to dismember regal governments was asserted and exercised , the power to dismember proprietary governments was not claimed . And , in some instances , even after the powers of government were revested in the crown , the title of the proprietors to the soil was respected . 21 . " Charles the Second was extremely anxious to acquire the property of Maine , but the grantees sold it to Massachusetts , and he did not venture to contest the right of the colony to the soil . The Carolinas were originally proprietary governments . /q/ In 1721 , a revolution was effected by the people , who shook off their obedience to the proprietors , and declared their dependence immediately on the crown . The king , however , purchased the title of those who were disposed to sell . One of them , Lord Carteret , surrendered his interest in the government , but retained his title to the soil . That title was respected till the Revolution , when it was forfeited by the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which this principle has been recognized will be found in the history of the wars , negotiations , and treaties which the different nations claiming territory in America have carried on , and held with each other . The contests between the cabinets of Versailles and Madrid respecting the territory on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico were fierce and bloody ; and continued until the establishment of a Bourbon on the throne of Spain produced such amicable dispositions in the two crowns as to suspend or terminate them . Betweeen France and Great Britain , whose discoveries , as well as settlements , were nearly contemporaneous , contests for the country actually covered by the Indians began as soon as their settlements approached each other , and were continued until finally settled , in the year 1763 , by the treaty of Paris . 23 . " Each nation had granted and partially settled the country denominated by the French Acadie and by the English Nova Scotia . By the 12th article of the treaty of Utrecht , made in 1703 , his most Christian Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotia , or Acadie , with its ancient boundaries . ' A great part of the ceded territory was in possession of the Indians , and the extent of the cession could not be adjusted by the commissioners to whom it was to be referred . The treaty of Aix la Chapelle , which was made on the principle of the status ante bellum , did not remove this subject of controversy . Commissioners for its adjustment were appointed , whose very able and elaborate , though unsuccessful arguments in favor of the title of their respective sovereigns show how entirely each relied on the title given by discovery to lands remaining in the possession of Indians . 24 . " After the termination of this fruitless discussion , the subject was transferred to Europe , and taken up by the cabinets of Versailles and London . This controversy embraced not only the boundaries of New England , Nova Scotia , and that part of /z/ Canada which adjoined those colonies , but embraced our whole Western country also . France contended , not only that the St. Lawrence was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ohio was within that colony . She founded this claim on discovery , and on having used that river for the transportation of troops in a war with some Southern Indians . This river was comprehended in the chartered limits of Virginia ; but , though the right of England to a reasonable extent of country , in virtue of her discovery of the sea-coast , and of the settlements she made on it , was not to be questioned , her claim of all the lands to the Pacific Ocean , because she had discovered the country washed by the Atlantic , might , without derogating from the principle recognized by all , be deemed extravagant . It interfered , too , with the claims of France founded on the same principle . She therefore sought to strengthen her original title to the lands in controversy , by insisting that it had been acknowledged by France in the 15th article of the treaty of Utrecht . The dispute respecting the construction of that article has no tendency to impair the principle , that discovery gave a title to lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title prevailed , it was still a title to lands occupied by the Indians , whose right of occupancy neither controverted , and neither had then extinguished . 25 . " These conflicting claims produced a long and bloody war , which was terminated by the conquest of the whole country east of the Mississippi . In the treaty of 1763 , France ceded and guaranteed to Great Britain all Nova Scotia , or Acadie , and Canada , with their dependencies ; and it was agreed , that the boundaries between the territories of the two nations in America should be irrevocably fixed by a line drawn from the source of the Mississippi , through the middle of that river and the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain , to the sea . This treaty expressly cedes , and has always been understood to cede , the whole country on the English side of the dividing line between the two nations , although a great and valuable part of it was occupied by the Indians . Great Britain , on her part , surrendered to France all her pretensions to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she surrendered nothing , although she was not in actual possession of a foot of land . She surrendered all right to acquire the country ; and any after attempt to purchase /q/ it from the Indians would have been considered and treated as an invasion of the territories of France . 26 . " By the 20th article of the same treaty , Spain ceded Florida , with its dependencies , and all the country she claimed east or southeast of the Mississippi , to Great Britain . Great part of this territory also was in possession of the Indians . 27 . " By a secret treaty , which was executed about the same time , France ceded Louisiana to Spain ; and Spain has since retroceded the same country to France . At the time both of its cession and retrocession , it was occupied chiefly by the Indians . 28 . " Thus , all the nations of Europe who have acquired territory on this continent have asserted in themselves , and have recognized in others , the exclusive right of the discovery to appropriate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected or adopted this principle ? 29 . " By the treaty which concluded the war of our Revolution , Great Britain relinquished all claim , not only to the government , but to the * propriety and territorial rights of the United States , ' whose boundaries were fixed in the second article . By this treaty , the powers of government , and the right to soil , which had previously been in Great Britain , passed definitively to these States . We had before taken possession of them , by declaring independence ; but neither the declaration of independence , nor the treaty confirming it , could give us more than that which we before possessed , or to which Great Britain was before entitled . It has never been doubted , that either the United States or the several States had a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty , subject only to the Indian right of occupancy , and that the exclusive power to extinguish that right was vested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it . 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land in controversy lay , passed an act , in the year 1779 , declaring her * exclusive right of pre-emption from the Indians of all the lands within the limits of her own chartered territory , and that no persons whatsoever have , or ever had , a right to purchase any lands within the same from any Indian nation , except only persons duly authorized to make such purchase , formerly for the use and benefit of the colony , and lately for the Commonwealth . ' The act then proceeds to annul all deeds made by Indians to individuals for the private use of the purchasers . /z/ 31 . " Without ascribing to this act the power of annulling vested rights , or admitting it to countervail the testimony furnished by the marginal note opposite to the title of the law forbidding purchases from the Indians , in the revisals of the Virginia statutes , stating that law to be repealed , it may safely be considered as an unequivocal affirmance , on the part of Virginia , of the broad principle , which had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians resided in the government . 32 . " In pursuance of the same idea , Virginia proceeded , at the same session , to open her land-office for the sale of that country which now constitutes Kentucky , a country every acre of which was then claimed and possessed by Indians , who maintained their title with as much persevering courage as was ever manifested by any people . 33 . " The States having within their chartered limits different portions of territory covered by Indians , ceded that territory , generally , to the United States , on conditions expressed in their deeds of cession , which demonstrate the opinion , that they ceded the soil as well as jurisdiction , and that in doing so , they granted a productive fund to the government of the Union . The lands in controversy lay within the chartered limits of Virginia , and were ceded with the whole country northwest of the river Ohio . This grant contained reservations and stipulations , which could only be made by the owners of the soil ; and concluded with a stipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not reserved , should be considered as a common fund , for the use and benefit of such of the United States as have become , or shall become , members of the confederation , ' &c.,; ' according to their usual respective proportions in the general charge and expenditure , and shall be faithfully and bond fide disposed of for that purpose , and for no other use or purpose whatsoever . ' The ceded territory was occupied by numerous and warlike tribes of Indians ; but the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish their title , and to grant the soil , has never , we believe , been doubted . 34 . " After these States became independent , a controversy subsisted between them and Spain respecting boundary . By the treaty of 1795 , this controversy was adjusted , and Spain ceded to the United States the territory in question . This territory , though claimed by both nations , was chiefly in the actual occupation of Indians . /q/ 35 . " The magnificent purchase of Louisiana was the purchase from France of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are in fact independent . Yet , any attempt of others to intrude into that country would be considered as an aggression which would justify war . 86 . " Our late acquisitions from Spain are of the same character ; and the negotiations which preceded those acquisitions recognize and elucidate the principle which has been received as the foundation of all European title in America . 37 . " The United States , then , have unequivocally acceded to that great and broad rule by which its civilized inhabitants now hold this country . They hold , and assert in themselves , the title by which it was acquired . They maintain , as all others have maintained , that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy , either by purchase or by conquest ; and gave also a right to such a degree of sovereignty as the circumstances of the people would allow them to exercise . 38 . " The power now possessed by the government of the United States to grant lands resided , while we were colonies , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles given by either has never been questioned in our courts . It has been exercised uniformly over territory in possession of the Indians . The existence of this power must negative the existence of any right which may conflict with and control it . An absolute title to lands can not exist , at the same time , in different persons , or in different governments . An absolute must be an exclusive title , or at least a title which excludes all others not compatible with it . All our institutions recognize the absolute title of the crown , subject only to the Indian right of occupancy , and recognize the absolute title of the crown to extinguish that right . This is incompatible with an absolute and complete title in the Indians . " /z/ // of America asserted by the European nations , we may now enter upon a consideration of the manner in which the settlements were made , and of the political constitutions by which the various colonies were organized and governed . 40 . For a long time after the discoveries of Cabot were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indifference or inactivity in respect to the territory thus subjected to her sway . 1 Nearly a century elapsed before any effectual plan for planting any colony was put into operation ; and indeed the ill success , not to say entire failure , of the first expedition was well calculated to abate any undue confidence in the value of such enterprises . In 1578 , Sir Humphrey Gilbert , having obtained letters-patent from Queen Elizabeth , 2 granting him and his heirs any lands discovered by him , attempted a settlement on the cold and barren shores of Cape Breton and the adjacent regions , and exhausted his fortune and lost his life in the fruitless labor . 8 The brilliant genius of Sir Walter Raleigh was captivated by the allurements of any scheme which gave play to his romantic temper ; and unmindful of the disastrous fate of his half-brother , or gathering fresh courage from the consciousness of difficulties , eagerly followed up the original plan under a new patent from the crown . 4 To him we are indebted for the first plantations in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil and climate and productions of that region given by the first adventurers , that Elizabeth was proud to bestow upon it the name of Virginia , and thus to connect it with the reign of a virgin Queen . 6 But notwithstanding the bright prospects thus held out , three successive ' 1 Robertson 's America , B. 9 ; Doug .

' /q/ attempts under the auspices of Raleigh ended in a ruinous disaster , and seemed but a presage of the hard fate and darkened fortunes of that gallant , but unfortunate gentleman . 1 41 . The first permanent settlement made in America under the auspices of England was under a charter granted to Sir Thomas Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth year after his accession to the throne of England 2 ( in 1606 ) . That charter granted to them the territories in America , then commonly called Virginia , lying on the sea-coast between the 34th and the 45th degrees of north latitude and the islands adjacent within 100 miles , which were not belonging to or possessed by any Christian prince or people . The associates were divided into two companies , one of which was required to settle between the 34th and 41st degrees of north latitude , and the other between the 38th and 45th degrees of north latitude , but not within 100 miles of the prior colony . By degrees the name of Virginia was confined to the first or south colony . 3 The second assumed the name of the Plymouth Company , from the residence of the original grantees ; and New England was founded under their auspices . 4 Each colony had exclusive propriety in all the territory within fifty miles from the first seat of their plantation. 5 42 . Some of the provisions of this charter deserve a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil condition of the persons who should become inhabitants of the colonies . The companies were authorized to engage as colonists any of the subjects of England who should be disposed to emigrate . All persons being English subjects and inhabiting in the colonies , and every one of their children born therein , were declared to have and possess all liberties , franchises , and immunities , within any other of the dominions of the crown , to all intents and purposes , as if they had been abiding and born within the realm of England , or any other dominions of the crown . The patentees were to hold the lands , fec. , in the colony , of the king , his heirs and successors , as of the manor of East Greenwich in the county of Kent , in free and common socag'e only , and not in capite ; and were authorized to grant the same to /z/ the inhabitants of the colonies in such manner and form and for such estates , as the council of the colony should direct . 1 43 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed by a local council , appointed and removable at the pleasure of the crown , according to the royal instructions and ordinances from time to time promulgated . These councils were to be under the superior management and direction of another council sitting in England . A power was given to expel all intruders , and to lay a limited duty upon all persons trafficking with the colony ; and a prohibition was imposed upon all the colonists against trafficking with foreign countries under the pretence of trade from the mother country to the colonies . 2 44 . The royal authority soon found a gratifying employment in drawing up and establishing a code of fundamental regulations for these colonies , in pursuance of the power reserved in the charter . A superintending council was created in England . The legislative and executive powers were vested in the president and councils of the colonies ; but their ordinances were not to touch life nor limb , and were in substance to conform to the laws of England , and were to continue in force only until made void by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high offences were to be sent - to England for punishment ; and subordinate offences were to be punished at the discretion of the president and council . Allegiance to the crown was strictly insisted on ; and the Church of England established . 3 The royal authority was in all respects made paramount ; and the value of political liberty was totally overlooked , or deliberately disregarded . 45 . The charter of the first or Virginia colony was successively altered in 1609 and 1612 , 4 without any important change in its substantial provisions , as to the civil or political rights of the colonists . It is surprising , indeed , that charters securing such vast powers to the crown , and such entire dependence on the part of the emigrants , should have found any favor in the eyes either of the proprietors or of the people . By placing the whole legislative and executive powers in a council nominated by the 1 1 Haz . Coll . 50 ; Marsh . Colon . 25 , 26 ; Robertson 's Amer . B. 9. 2 1 Haz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsh .

But without hesitation or reluctance , the proprietors of both colonies prepared to execute their respective plans ; and under the authority of a charter , which would now be rejected with disdain as a violent invasion of the sacred and inalienable rights of liberty , the first permanent settlements of the , English in America were established . From this period the progress of the two provinces of Virginia and New England forms a regular and connected story . The former in the South , and the latter in the North , may be considered as the original and parent colonies , in imitation of which , and under whose shelter , all the others have been successively planted and reared . 1 46 . The settlements in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing under a policy , which subdivided the property among the settlers , instead of retaining it in common , and thus gave vigor to private enterprise . As the colony increased , the spirit of its members assumed more and more the tone of independence ; and they grew restless and impatient for the privileges enjoyed under the government of their native country . To quiet this uneasiness , Sir George Yeardley , then the governor of the colony , in 1619 , called a general assembly , composed of representatives from the various plantations in the colony , and permitted them to assume and exercise the high functions of legislation . 2 Thus was formed and established the first representative legislature that ever sat in America . And this example of a domestic parliament to regula.te all the internal concerns of the country was never lost sight of , but was ever afterwards cherished throughout America , as the dearest birthright of freemen . So acceptable was it to the people , and so indispensable to the real prosperity of the colony , that the council in England were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gave it a complete and permanent sanction . 3 In imitation of the constitution of the British Parliament , the legislative power was lodged partly in the governor , who held the place of the sovereign ; partly in a council of state named by the company ; and 1 I quote the very words of Dr. Robertson throughout this passage for its spirit and general truth . Robert . Hist , of America , B. 9. /z/ partly in an assembly composed of representatives freely chosen by the people . Each branch of the legislature might decide by a majority of voices , and a negative was reserved to the governor . But no law was to be in force , though approved by all three of the branches of the legislature , until it was ratified by a general court of the company , and returned under its seal to the colony . 1 The ordinance further required the general assembly , as also the council of state , u to imitate and follow the policy of the form of government , laws , customs , and manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of England , as near as may be . " The conduct of the colonists , as well as the company , soon afterwards gave offence to King James ; and the disasters , which accomplished an almost total destruction of the colony by the successful inroads of the Indians , created much discontent and disappointment among the proprietors at home . The king found it no difficult matter to satisfy the nation that an inquiry into their conduct was necessary . It was accordingly ordered ; and the result of that inquiry , by commissioners appointed by himself , was a demand on the part of the crown of a surrender of the charters . 2 The demand was resisted by the company ; a quo warranto was instituted against them , and it terminated , as in that age it might well be supposed it would , in a judgment , pronounced in 1624 by judges holding their offices during his pleasure , that the franchises were forfeited and the corporation should be dissolved . 3 . 47 . It does not appear that these proceedings , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted any indignation or sympathy for the sufferers on this occasion . The royal prerogative was then viewed without jealousy , if not with favor ; and the rights of Englishmen were ill defined and ill protected under a reign remarkable for no great or noble objects . Dr. Robertson has observed , that the company , like all unprosperous societies , fell unpitied ; 4 and the nation were content to forget the prostration of private rights , under the false encouragements held out of aid to the colony from the benignant efforts and future counsels of the crown . 1 Robertson 's America , B. 9 ; Marsh .

With the fall of the charter the colony came under the immediate government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special commission appointing a governor and twelve counsellors , to whom the entire direction of its affairs was committed . 1 In this commission no representative assembly was mentioned ; and there is little reason to suppose that James the First , who , besides his arbitrary notions of government , imputed the recent disasters to the existence of such an assembly , ever intended to revive it . While he was yet meditating upon a plan or code of government , his death put an end to his projects , which were better calculated to nourish his own pride and conceit , than to subserve the permanent interests of the province . 2 Henceforth , however , Virginia continued to be a royal province until the period of the American Revolution . 3 49 . Charles the First adopted the notions and followed out in its full extent the colonial system of his father . 4 He declared the colony to be a part of the empire annexed to the crown , and immediately subordinate to its jurisdiction . During the greater part of his reign , Virginia knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his delegated agents ; and statutes were passed and taxes imposed without the slightest effort to convene a colonial assembly . It was not until the murmurs and complaints which such a course of conduct was calculated to produce had betrayed the inhabitants into acts of open resistance to the governor , and into a firm demand of redress from the crown against his oppressions , that the king was brought to more considerate measures . He did not at once yield to their discontents ; but pressed , as he was , by severe embarrassments at home , he was content to adopt a. policy which would conciliate the colony and remove some of its just complaints . He accordingly soon afterwards appointed Sir William Berkeley governor , with powers and instructions which breathed a far more benign spirit . He was authorized to proclaim , that in all its concerns , civil as well as ecclesiastical , the colony should be governed according to the laws of England . He was directed to issue writs for electing representatives of the people , 1 1 Haz . Coll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 , 64 ; 1 Haz . Coll . 189. 8 1 Haz .

The rights of Englishmen were thus in a great measure secured to the colonists ; and under the government of this excellent magistrate , with some short intervals of interruption , the colony flourished with a vigorous growth for almost forty years . 1 The revolution of 1688 found it , if not in the practical possession of liberty , at least with forms of government well calculated silently to cherish its spirit . 50 . The laws of Virginia , during its colonial state , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of its institutions and civil polity , from those of the parent country , as those in the Northern colonies . The common law was recognized as the general basis of its jurisprudence ; and the legislature , with some appearance of boast , stated , soon after the restoration of Charles the Second , that they had " endeavored , in all things , as near as the capacity and constitution of this country would admit , to adhere to those excellent and often refined laws of England , to which we profess and acknowledge all due obedience and reverence . " 2 The prevalence of the common law was also expressly provided for in all the charters successively granted , as well as by the royal declaration , when the colony was annexed as a dependency to the crown . Indeed , there is no reason to suppose , that the common law was not in its leading features very acceptable to the colonists ; and in its general policy the colony closely followed in the steps of the mother country . Among the earliest acts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only true church ; 3 and its doctrines and discipline were strictly enforced . All non-conformists were at first compelled to leave the colony , and a spirit of persecution was exemplified not far behind the rigor of the most zealous of the Puritans . The clergy of the Established Church were amply provided for by glebes and tithes , 1 Robertson 's America , B 9 ; Marsh . Amer . Col. ch. 2 , pp. 65 , 66 , note .

Non-residence was prohibited , and a due performance of parochial duties peremptorily required . The laws , indeed , respecting the church , made a very prominent figure during the first fifty years of the colonial legislation . The first law allowing toleration to Protestant dissenters was in the year 1699 , and merely adopts that of the statute of the 1st William and Mary . Subject to this , the Church of England seems to have maintained an exclusive supremacy down to the period of the American Revolution . Marriages , except in special cases , were required to be celebrated in the parish church , and according to the rubric in the commonprayer book . The law of inheritance of the parent country was silently maintained down to the period of the American Revolution ; and the distribution of intestate estates was closely fashioned upon the same general model . Devises also were regulated by the law of England ; l and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1748 , when one was enacted which contains a few deviations from it , probably arising from local circumstances . 2 One of the most remarkable facts in the juridical history of the colony is its steady attachment to entails . By an act passed in 1705 , it was provided , that estates-tail should no longer be docked by fines or recoveries , but only by an act of the legislature in each particular case . And though this was afterwards modified , so as to allow entails to be destroyed in another manner , where the estate did not exceed 200 sterling in value , 8 yet the general policy continued down to the American Revolution . In this respect , the zeal of the colony to secure entails and perpetuate inheritances in the same family outstripped that of the parent country . 51 . At a very early period the acknowledgment and registry of deeds and mortgages of real estate were provided for , and the non-registry was deemed a badge of fraud . 4 The trial by jury , although a privilege resulting from their general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an early declaration , that no taxes could be levied by the governor without the consent of the general assembly ; and when raised , they were to 1 I refer upon these subjects to Henning , Stat. 122 , 123 , 144 , 149 , 155 , 180 , 240 , 268 , 277 , 434 ; 2 Hen .

The burgesses , also , during their attendance upon the assembly , were free from arrest . In respect to domestic trade , a general freedom was guaranteed to all the inhabitants to buy and sell to the greatest advantage , and all engrossing was prohibited . 1 The culture of tobacco seems to have been a constant object of solicitude ; and it was encouraged by a long succession of acts , sufficiently evincing the public feeling , and the vast importance of it to the prosperity of the colony . 2 We learn from Sir William Berkeley 's answers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of the colony was at that time about 40,000 ; that the restrictions of the navigation act , cutting off all trade with foreign countries , were very injurious to them , as they were obedient to the laws .

" This language is sufficiently significant of the restlessness of New England under these restraints upon its commerce . But his answer to the question respecting religious and other instruction in the colony , would in our times create universal astonishment . " I thank God , " says he , " there are no free schools nor printing ; and I hope we shall not have these hundred years ; for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the world , and printing has divulged them , and libels against the best government .

That company possessed fewer resources and less enterprise than the Southern ; and though aided by men of high distinction , and among others , by the public spirit and zeal of Lord Chief Justice Popham , its first efforts for colonization were feeble and discouraging . Captain John Smith , so well known in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transient lustre to their attempts ; and his warm descriptions of the beauty and fertility of the country procured for - it from the excited imagination of the Prince , afterwards King Charles the First , the flattering name of New England , a name which effaced from it that of Virginia , and which has since become dear beyond expression to the inhabitants of its harsh but salubrious climate . 1 53 . While the company was yet languishing , an event occurred which gave a new and unexpected aspect to its prospects . It is well known that the religious dissensions consequent upon the Reformation , while they led to a more bold and free spirit of discussion , failed at the same time of introducing a corresponding charity for differences of religious opinion . Each successive sect entertained not the slightest doubt of its own infallibility in doctrine and worship , and was eager to obtain proselytes , and denounce the errors of its opponents . If it had stopped here , we might have forgotten , in admiration of the sincere zeal for Christian truth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lurked within the inner folds of their devotion . But , unfortunately , the spirit of intolerance was abroad , in all its stern and unrelenting severity . To tolerate errors was to sacrifice Christianity to mere temporal interests . Truth , and truth alone , was to be followed at the hazard of all consequences ; and religion allowed no compromises between conscience and 1 Robertson 's America , B. 10 ; Marsh . Amer . Col. ch. 3 , p. 77 , 78 ; 1 Haz . Coll . 103 , 147 , 404 ; 1 Belknap 's New Hampshire , ch. 1 . /z/ worldly comforts . Heresy was itself a sin of a deadly nature , and to extirpate it was a primary duty of all who were believers in sincerity and truth . Persecution , therefore , even when it seemed most to violate the feelings of humanity and the rights of private judgment , never wanted apologists among those of the purest and most devout lives . It was too often received with acclamations by the crowd , and found an ample vindication from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil magistrate , and the blind zeal of the ecclesiastic . Each sect , as it attained power , exhibited the same unrelenting firmness in putting down its adversaries . 1 The papist and the prelate , the Puritan and the Presbyterian , felt no compunctions in the destruction of dissentients from their own faith . They uttered , indeed , loud complaints of the injustice of their enemies , when they were themselves oppressed ; but it was not from any abhorrence to persecution itself , but of the infamous errors of the persecutors . There are not wanting on the records of the history of these times abundant proofs , how easily sects , which had borne every human calamity with unshrinking fortitude for conscience ' sake , could turn upon their inoffensive , but , in their judgment , erring neighbors with a like infliction of suffering . 2 Even adversity sometimes fails of producing its usual salutary effects of moderation and compassion , when a blind but honest zeal has usurped dominion over the mind . If such a picture of human infirmity may justly add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us of the Christian duty of forbearance . And he who can look with an eye of exclusive censure on such scenes , must have forgotten how many bright examples they have afforded of the liveliest virtue , the most persuasive fidelity , and the most exalted piety . 1 Dr. Robertson has justly observed , that not only the idea of toleration , but even the word itself , in the sense now affixed to it , was then unknown. * Sir James Mackintosh , a name equally glorious in judicial and ethical philosophy , has remarked , that this giant evil ( the suppression of the right of private judgment in matters of religion ) had received a mortal wound from Luther , who , in his warfare with Rome , had struck a blow against all human authority , and unconsciously disclosed to mankind that they were entitled , or rather bound , to form and utter their own opinions , and most of all , on the most deeply interesting subjects .

Among others who suffered persecutions from the haughty zeal of Elizabeth , was a small sect called , from the name of their leader , Brownists , to whom we owe the foundation of the now widespread sect of Congregationalists or Independents . After sufferings of an aggravated nature , they were compelled to take refuge in Holland , untier the care of their pastor , Mr. John Robinson , a man distinguished for his piety , his benevolence , and his intrepid spirit . 1 After remaining there some years , they concluded to emigrate to America , in the hope that they might thus perpetuate their religious discipline , and preserve the purity of an apostolical church . 2 In conjunction with other friends in England , they embarked on the voyage with a design of settlement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intention , they were compelled to land on the shores of Cape Cod , in the depth of winter , and the place of their landing was called Plymouth , which has since become so celebrated as the first permanent settlement in New England . 3 Not having contemplated any plantation at this place , they had not taken the precaution to obtain any charter from the Plymouth Company . The original plan of their colony , however , is still preserved ; 4 and it was founded upon the basis of a community of property , at least for a given space of time , a scheme , as the event showed , utterly incompatible with the existence of any large and flourishing colony . Before their landing , they drew up and signed a voluntary compact of government , forming , if not the first , at least the best authenticated case of an original social contract for the establishment of a nation which is to be found in the annals of the world . Philosophers and jurists have perpetually resorted to the theory of such a compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments and subjects ; but for the most part it has been treated as an effort of imagination , unsustained by the history or practice of nations , and furnishing little of solid instruction for the actual concerns of life . It was little dreamed of , that America should furnish an example of it in primitive and almost patriarchal simplicity . /z/ 55 . On the llth of November , 1620 , these humble but fearless adventurers , before their landing , drew up and signed an original compact , in which , after acknowledging themselves subjects of the crown of England , they proceed to declare : " Having undertaken , for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith and the honor of our king and country , a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia , we do by these presents solemnly and mutually , in the presence of God and of one another , covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic , for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame such just and equal laws , ordinances , acts , constitutions , and officers from time to time as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony ; unto which we promise all due submission and obedience . " This is the whole of the compact , and it was signed by forty-one persons . 1 It is in its very essence a pure democracy ; and in pursuance of it the colonists proceeded soon afterwards to organize the colonial government , under the name of the Colony of New Plymouth , to appoint a governor and other officers , and to enact laws . The governor was chosen annually by the freemen , and had at first one assistant to aid him in the discharge of his trust . 2 Four others were soon afterwards added , and finally the number was increased to seven . 3 The supreme legislative power resided in , and was exercised by , the whole body of the male inhabitants , every freeman , who was a member of the church , being admitted to vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , and being at a considerable distance from each other , a house of representatives was established in 1639 ; 5 the members of which , as well as all other officers , were annually chosen .

The Plymouth colonists acted , at first , altogether under the voluntary compact and association already mentioned . But they daily felt embarrassments from the want of some general authority , derived directly or indirectly from the crown , which should recognize their settlement and confirm their legislation . After several ineffectual attempts made for this purpose , they at length succeeded in obtaining , in January , 1629 , a patent from the council established at Plymouth , in England , under the charter of King James of 1620. 2 This patent , besides a grant of the territory upon the terms and tenure of the original patent of 1620 , included an authority to the patentee ( William Bradford ) and his associates , " to incorporate by some usual or fit name and title him or themselves , or the people there inhabiting under him or them , and their successors , from time to time , to frame and make orders , ordinances , and constitutions , as well for the better government of their affairs here , and the receiving or admitting any into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his or their people , or his or their people at sea in going thither or returning from thence ; and the same to put or cause to be put in execution , by such officers and ministers , as he or they shall authorize and depute ; provided , that the said laws and orders be not repugnant to the laws of England or the frame of government by the said president and council of Plymouth Company hereafter to be established . " 3 57 . This patent or charter seems never to have been confirmed by the crown ; 4 and the colonists were never , by any act of the crown , created a body politic and corporate with any legislative powers . They , therefore , remained in legal contemplation a mere voluntary association , exercising the highest powers and prerogatives of sovereignty , and yielding obedience to the laws and magistrates chosen by themselves . 5 1 Robertson 's America , B. 10 ; 2 Hutch .

The charter of 1629 furnished them , however , with the color of delegated sovereignty , of which they did not fail to avail themselves . They assumed under it the exercise of the most plenary executive , legislative , and judicial powers , with but a momentary scruple as to their right to inflict capital punishments. 1 They were not disturbed in the free exercise of these powers , either through the ignorance or the connivance of the crown , until after the restoration of Charles the Second . Their authority under their charter was then questioned ; and several unsuccessful attempts were made to procure a confirmation from the crown . They continued to cling to it , until , in the general shipwreck of charters in 1684 , theirs was overturned . An arbitrary government was then established over them in common with the other New England colonies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the charter granted to the latter by William and Mary in 1691. 2 59 . It may not be without use to notice a few of the laws which formed what may properly be deemed the fundamentals of their jurisprudence . After providing for the manner of choosing their governor and legislature , as above stated , their first attention seems to have been directed to the establishment of " the free liberties of the free-born people of England . " It was therefore declared , 3 almost in the language of Magna Charta , that justice should be impartially administered unto all , not sold , or denied ; that no person should suffer " in respect to life , limb , liberty , good name , or estate , but by virtue or equity of some express law of the General Court , or the good and equitable laws of our nation suitable for us , in matters which are of a civil nature , ( as by the court here hath been accustomed , ) wherein we have no particular law of our own " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due course and process of law ; that in criminal and civil cases there should be a trial by jury at all events upon a final trial on appeal , with the right to challenge for just cause ; and in capital cases a peremptory right to challenge twenty jurors as in England ; that no party should be cast or condemned , unless upon the testimony of two sufficient witnesses , or other sufficient evi- 1 2 Hutch .

All processes were directed to be in the king 's name . 1 All trials in respect to land were to be in the county where it lay ; and all personal actions where one of the parties lived ; and lands and goods were liable to attachment to answer the judgment rendered in any action . All lands were to descend according to the free tenure of lands of East Greenwich , in the county of Kent ; and all entailed lands according to the law of England . All the sons were to inherit equally , except the eldest , who was to have a double share . If there were no sons , all the daughters were to inherit alike . Brothers of the whole blood were to inherit ; and if none , then sisters of the whole blood .

Undoubtedly a reverential regard for the Scriptures placed the crimes of idolatry , blasphemy , and false witness , and cursing and smiting father and mother , among the capital offences . And , as might well be presumed from the religious sentiments of the people , ample protection was given to the church ; and the maintenance of a public orthodox ministry and of public schools was carefully provided for . 2 60 .

The charter also declares that all the territory shall be holden of the crown , as of the royal manor of East Greenwich , in Kent County , in free and common socage , and not in capite , nor by knight service ; 2 and that all subjects , inhabitants of the plantation , and their children and posterity born within the limits thereof , shall have and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural subjects within any other of the dominions of the crown , to all intents and purposes , as if they had been abiding and born within the kingdom of England , or any other dominions of the crown . 3 The charter also authorized the council to transport to the plantation any subjects , or strangers who were willing to become subjects and live under the king 's allegiance . But it prohibited papists to be transported , by requiring all persons going there to take the oath of supremacy , and authorizing the president of the council to administer the oath. * 62 . Some of the powers granted by this charter were alarming to many persons , and especially those which granted a monopoly of trade . 5 The efforts to settle a colony within the territory were again renewed , and again were unsuccessful . 6 The spirit of religion , however , soon effected what the spirit of commerce had failed to accomplish .

Other persons were soon induced to unite with them , if a charter could be procured from the crown which should secure to the adventurers the usual powers of government .

It also created the associates a body politic by the name of " The Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England , " with the usual powers of corporations .

In these great and general assemblies , ( which were composed of the governor , deputy , assistants , and freemen present , ) freemen were to be admitted free of the company , officers were to be elected , and laws and ordinances for the good and welfare of the colony made ; " so as such laws and ordinances be not contrary or repugnant to the laws and statutes of this our realm of England . " At one of these great and general assemblies held in Easter Term , the governor , deputy , and assistants , 1 These are not the descriptive words of the grant , but a statement of the substance of it .

The company were further authorized to transport any subjects or strangers willing to become subjects of the crown to the colony , and to carry on trade to and from it , without custom or subsidy for seven years , and were to be free of all taxation of imports or exports to and from the English dominion for the space of twenty-one years , with the exception of a five per cent duty . The charter further provided that all subjects of the crown who should become inhabitants , and their children born there , or on the seas going or returning , should enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects , as if they and every of them were born within the realm of England . Full legislative authority was also given , subject to the restriction of not being contrary to the laws of England , as also for the imposition of fines and mulcts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 Many other provisions were added , similar in substance to those found in the antecedent colonial charters of the crown . 64 . Such were the original limits of the colony of Massachusetts Bay , and such were the powers and privileges conferred on it . It is observable that the whole structure of the charter presupposes the residence of the company in England , and the transaction of all its business there . The experience of the past had not sufficiently instructed the adventurers that settlements in America could not be well governed by corporations resident abroad ; 2 or if any of them had arrived at such a conclusion , there were many reasons for presuming that the crown would be jealous of granting powers of so large a nature , which were to be exercised at such a distance as would render control or responsibility over them wholly visionary . They were content , therefore , to get what they could , hoping that the future might furnish more ample opportunities for success ; that their usurpations of authority would not be closely watched ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the crown might feel it a duty to yield , what it was now useless to contend for , as a dictate of wisdom and justice . 3 The charter did not include any clause providing for the free exercise of religion or the rights of conscience , ( as has been often erroneously supposed. ) 4 It gave authority to 1 Hutch .

But a bolder step was soon afterwards taken by the company itself . It was ascertained that little success would attend the plantation , so long as its affairs were under the control of a distant government , knowing little of its wants , and insensible to its difficulties . 4 Many persons , indeed , possessed of fortune and character , warmed with religious zeal , or suffering under religious intolerance , were ready to embark in the enterprise , if the corporation should be removed , so that the powers of government might be exercised by the actual settlers . 5 The company had already become alarmed at the extent of their own expenditures , and there were but faint hopes of any speedy reimbursement . They entertained some doubts of the legality of the course of transferring the charter . But at length it was determined , in August , 1629 , " by the general consent of the company , that the government and patent should be settled in New England . " 6 This resolution infused new life into the association ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had signified an intention to remove to America . The government and charter were accordingly removed ; and henceforth the whole management of all the affairs of the colony was confided to persons and magistrates resident within its own bosom . The fate of the colony was thus decided ; and it grew with a rapidity and strength that soon gave it a great ascendency among the New England settlements , and awakened the jealousy , distrust , and vigilance of the parent country . 1 But see 1 Grahame , Hist ch. 1 , p. 245 , note . 2 Robertson 's America , Book 10 , and note ; 1 Chalm .

It has been justly remarked , that this transaction stands alone in the history of English colonization . 1 The power of the corporation to make the transfer has been seriously doubted , and even denied . 2 But the boldness of the step is not more striking than the silent acquiescence of the king in permitting it to take place . The proceedings of the royal authority a few years after sufficiently prove that the royal acquiescence was not intended as any admission of right . The subsequent struggles between the crown and the colony , down to the overthrow of the charter , under the famous quo warranto proceedings , in 1684 , manifest a disposition on the part of the colonists to yield nothing which could be retained ; and , on the part of the crown , to force them into absolute subjection . 67 . The government of the colony , immediately after the removal of the charter , was changed in many important features ; but its fundamental grants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their original validity . 3 It is true , as Dr. Robertson has observed , 4 that , as soon as the Massachusetts emigrants had landed on these shores , they considered themselves , for many purposes , as a voluntary association , possessing the natural rights of men to adopt that mode of government which was most agreeable to themselves , and to enact such laws as were conducive to their own welfare . They did not , indeed , surrender up their charter , or cease to recognize its obligatory force . 5 But they extended their acts far beyond its expression of powers ; and , while they boldly claimed protection from it against the royal demands and prerogatives , they nevertheless did not feel that it furnished any limit upon the freest exercise of legislative , executive , or judicial functions . They did not view it as creating an English corporation , under the narrow construction of the common law , but as affording the means of founding a broad political government , subject to the crown of England , but yet enjoying many exclusive privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See 1 Hutch .

The General Court , in their address to Parliament , in 1646 , in answer to the remonstrance of certain malecontents , used the following language : 1 " For our government itself , it is framed according to our charter and the fundamental and common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , ( taking the words of eternal truth and righteousness along with them , as that rule hy which all kingdoms and jurisdictions must render account of every act and administration in the last day , ) with as bare allowance of the disproportion between such an ancient , populous , wealthy kingdom , and so poor an infant , thin colony , as common reason can afford . " And they then proceeded to show the truth of their statement by drawing a parallel , setting down in one column the fundamental and common laws and customs of England , beginning with Magna Charta , and in a corresponding column their own fundamental laws and customs . Among other parallels , after stating that the supreme authority in England is in the high court of Parliament , they stated : " The highest authority here is in the General Court , both by our charter and by our own positive laws . " 69 . For three or four years after the removal of the charter , the governor and assistants were chosen , and all the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large in a General Court . But the members having increased , so as to make a general assembly inconvenient , an alteration took place , and in 1634 the towns sent representatives to the General Court . They drew up a general declaration that the General Court alone had power to make and establish laws and to elect officers , to raise moneys and taxes , and to sell lands ; and that therefore every town might choose persons as representatives , not exceeding two , who should have the full power and voices of all the freemen , except in the choice of officers and magistrates , wherein every freeman was to give his own vote . 2 The system thus proposed was immediately established by common consent , 3 although it is nowhere provided for in the charter ; and thus was formed the second house of representatives ( the first being in Virginia ) in 1 1 Hutch .

It may be well to state , in this connection , that the council established in Plymouth in a very short period after the grant of the Massachusetts charter ( in 1635 ) finally surrendered their own patent back to the crown . They had made other grants of territory , which we shall hereafter have occasion to notice , which had greatly diminished the value as well as importance of their charter . But the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolies granted to them , which roused the attention of Parliament and of the nation at large , and compelled them to resign what they could scarcely maintain against the strong current of public opinion . The surrender , so far from working any evil , rather infused new life into the colonies which sprung from it , by freeing them from all restraint and supervision by a superior power , to which they might perhaps have been held accountable . 3 Immediately after this surrender legal proceedings were instituted against the proprietors of the Massachusetts charter . Those who appeared were deprived of their franchises . But fortunately the measure was not carried into complete execution against the absent proprietors acting under the charter in America . 4 71 . After the fall of the first colonial charter in 1684 , 5 Massachusetts remained for some years in a very disturbed state under the arbitrary power of the crown .

It confirmed all prior grants made of lands to all persons , corporations , colleges , towns , villages , and schools . It reserved to the crown the appointment of the governor , and lieutenant-governor , and secretary of the province , and all the officers of the Court of Admiralty . It provided for the appointment annually of twenty-eight counsellors , who were to be chosen by the General Court , and nominated the first board . The governor and counsellors were to hold a council for the ordering and directing of the affairs of the province . The governor was invested with authority , with the advice and consent of the council , to nominate and appoint " judges , commissioners of over and terminer , sheriffs , provosts , marshals , justices of the peace , and other officers to the council and courts of justice belonging .

He had also the power of calling the General Court , and of adjourning , proroguing , and dissolving it . He had also a negative upon all laws passed by the General Court . The General Court was to assemble annually on the last Wednesday of May , and was to consist of the governor and council for the time being , and of such representatives being freeholders as should be annually elected by the freeholders in each town , who possessed a freehold of forty shillings ' annual value , or other estate to the value of forty pounds . Each town was entitled to two representatives ; but the General Court was from time to time to decide on the number which each town should send .

All laws , however , were to be sent to England for approbation or disallowance ; and if disallowed , and so signified /q/ under the sign manual and signet , within three years , the same thenceforth to cease and become void ; otherwise to continue in force according to the terms of their original enactment . The General Court was also invested with authority to grant any lands in the colonies of Massachusetts , New Plymouth , and province of Maine , with certain exceptions . The governor and council were invested with full jurisdiction as to the probate of wills and granting administrations . The governor was also made commander-inchief of the militia with the usual martial powers ; but was not to exercise martial law without the advice of the council . In case of his death , removal , or absence , his authority was to devolve on the lieutenant-governor , or , if his office was vacant , then on the council . With a view also to advance the growth of the province by encouraging new settlements , it was expressly provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the worship of God to all Christians except Papists " ; and that all subjects inhabiting in the province and their children born there , or on the seas going or returning , should have all the liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects , as if they were born within the realm of England . And in all cases an appeal was allowed from the judgments of any courts of the province to the King in the Privy Council in England , where the matter in difference exceeded three hundred pounds sterling . And finally there was a reservation of the whole admiralty jurisdiction to the crown , and of a right to all subjects to fish on the coasts . 1 Considering the spirit of the times , it must be acknowledged that , on the whole , this charter contains a liberal grant of authority to the province , and a reasonable reservation of the royal prerogative . It was hailed with sincere satisfaction by the colony , after the dangers which had for so long a time menaced its liberties and its peace . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts during its colonial state , the first and most important consideration is the early care with which the public rights of the inhabitants were declared and established .

But they reserved to the civil authority the further power to punish offences , and " the liberty to see the peace , ordinances , and rules of Christ observed . " 2 Every church had liberty to elect its own officers , and " no injunction was to be put upon any church , church officer , or member in point of doctrine , worship , or discipline , whether for substance or circumstance , besides the institution of the Lord .

As early as 1647 , the General Court , " to the end , " as the preamble of the act declares , 1 " that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers in church and commonwealth , " provided , under a penalty , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for the instruction of children in writing and reading , " and that every town of one hundred householders " shall set up a grammar school , the master thereof being able to instruct youth so far as may be fitted for the university . " This law has , in substance , continued down to the present times ; and it has contributed more than any other circumstance to give that peculiar character to the inhabitants and institutions of Massachusetts for which she , in common with the other New England States , indulges an honest and not unreasonable pride . 76 . After the grant of the provincial charter , in 1691 , the legislation of the colony took a wider scope , and became more liberal as well as more exact . At the very first session an act passed , declaring the general rights and liberties of the people , and embracing the principal provisions of Magna Charta on this subject . Among other things , it was declared that no tax could be levied but by the General Court ; that the trial by jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lands shall be free from escheats and forfeitures , except in cases of high treason . 2 A habeas corpus act was also passed at the same session ; but it seems to have been disallowed by the crown . 3 Chalmers asserts that there is no circumstance in the history of colonial jurisprudence better established than the fact that the habeas corpus act was not extended to the plantations until the reign of Queen Anne . 4 77 . It does not seem necessary to go into any minute examination of the subsequent provincial legislation . In its general character it did not materially vary from that antecedently adopted , except so far as the charter required , or a progressive spirit of improvement invited a change . Lands were made liable to the payment of debts ; the right of choosing their ministers was , after some struggles , secured in effect to the concurrent vote of the church and congregation in each parish ; and the spirit of /z/ religious intolerance was in some measure checked , if not entirely subdued . Among the earliest acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act for the prevention of frauds and perjuries , conformable to that of Charles the Second ; an act for the observance of the Lord 's Day ; an act for solemnizing marriages by a minister or a justice of peace ; an act for the support of ministers and schoolmasters ; an act for regulating towns and counties ; and an act for the settlement and distribution of the estates of persons dying intestate . 1 These and many other acts of general utility have continued substantially in force down to our day . Under the act for the distribution of estates , the half-blood were permitted to inherit equally with the whole blood . 2 Entails were preserved and passed according to the course of descents of the common law ; but the general policy of the State silently reduced the actual creation of such estates to comparatively narrow limits . i 2 Hutch .

In November , 1629 , Captain John Mason obtained a grant from the . Council of Plymouth of all that part of the mainland in New England " lying upon the sea-coast , beginning from the middle part of Merrimack River , and from thence to proceed northwards along the sea-coast to Piscataqua River , and so forwards up within the said river and to the furthest head thereof ; and from thence northwestwards until threescore miles be finished from the first entrance of Piscataqua River ; and also from Merrimack through the said river and to the furthest head thereof , and so forwards up into the lands westwards , until threescore miles be finished ; and from thence to cross overland to the end of the threescore miles accounted from Piscataqua River , together with all islands and islets within five leagues ' distance of the premises . " l This territory was afterwards called New Hampshire . The land so granted was expressly subjected to the conditions and limitations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Mason , that he would establish such government therein , and continue the same , " as shall be agreeable , as near as may be , to the laws and customs of the realm of England " ; and that if charged with neglect , he would reform the same according to the discretion of the president and council ; or in default thereof , that the aggrieved inhabitants or planters , tenants of the lands , might appeal to the chief court of justice of the president and council . A further grant was made to Mason by the Council of Plymouth about the time of the surrender of their charter , ( 22 April , 1635 , ) " beginning from the middle part of Naumkeag River Salem and 1 1 Haz . Coll . 289 ; 1 Holmes 's Annals , 199 ; 1 Belk . N.

No patent of confirmation of this grant appears to have been made by the crown after the surrender of the Plymouth patent . 2 80 . Various detached settlements were made within this territory ; and so ill defined were the boundaries , that a controversy soon arose between Massachusetts and Mason in respect to the right of sovereignty over it . 8 In the exposition of its own charter Massachusetts contended that its limits included the whole territory of New Hampshire ; and , being at that time comparatively strong and active , she succeeded in establishing her jurisdiction over it , and maintained it with unabated vigilance for forty years . 4 The controversy was finally brought before the king in council ; and in 1679 it was solemnly adjudged against the claim of Massachusetts . And it being admitted that Mason , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government , a commission was , in the same year , issued by the crown for the government of New Hampshire . 5 By the form of government described in this commission the whole executive power was vested in a president and council appointed by the crown , to whom also was confided the judiciary power with an appeal to England .

New Hampshire seems also to have had more facility than some other colonies , in introducing into her domestic code some of the most beneficial clauses of the acts of Parliament of a general nature , and applicable to its local jurisprudence. 1 We also find upon its statute book , without comment or objection , the celebrated Plantation Act of 7 &; 8 William 3 , ch. 22 , as well as the acts respecting inland bills of exchange , ( 9 &; 10 William 3 , ch. 17 , ) and promissory notes , ( 4 Ann , ch .. 9 , ) and others of a less prominent character . 1 N.

" 3 Of this province he was made Lord Palatine , with all the powers , jurisdiction , and royalties belonging to the Bishop of the County Palatine of Durham ; and the lands were to be holden as of the manor of East Greenwich . The charter contains a reservation of faith and allegiance to the crown , as having the supreme dominion ; and the will and pleasure of the crown is signified , that the religion of the Church of England be professed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also authorizes the Palatine , with the assent of the greater part of the freeholders of the province , to make laws not repugnant or contrary , but as near as conveniently may be to the laws of England , for the public good of the province ; and to erect courts of judicature for the determination of all civil and criminal causes , with an appeal to the Palatine . But all the powers of government so granted were to be subordinate to the " power and regement " of the lords commissioners for foreign plantations for the time being . The Palatine also had authority to make ordinances for the government of the province , under certain restrictions , and a grant of full admiralty powers , subject to those of the Lord High Admiral of England . And the inhabitants , being subjects of the crown , were /z/ to enjoy all the rights and privileges of natural-born subjects in England . 83 . Under these ample provisions Gorges soon established a civil government in the province , and made ordinances . The government , such as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any powers of legislation . The province languished in imbecility under his care , and began to acquire vigor only when he ceased to act as proprietary and lawgiver. 2 Massachusetts soon afterwards set up an exclusive right and jurisdiction over the territory , as within its chartered limits , and was able to enforce obedience and submission to its power . 3 It continued under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts until 1665 , when the commissioners of the crown separated it for a short period ; but the authority of Massachusetts was soon afterwards re-established . 4 The controversy between Massachusetts and the Palatine , as to jurisdiction over the province , was brought before the Privy Council at the same time with that of Mason respecting New Hampshire , and the claim of Massachusetts was adjudged void . 5 Before a final adjudication was had , Massachusetts had the prudence and sagacity , in 1677 , to purchase the title of Gorges for a trifling sum ; and thus , to the great disappointment of the crown , ( then in treaty for the same object , ) succeeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependency , until the fall of its own charter ; and it afterwards , as we have seen , was incorporated with Massachusetts in the provincial charter of 1691. 6 1 1 Haz .

Possession under the title of Lord Say and Seale and others was taken at the mouth of the Connecticut in 1635. 3 The settlers there were not , however , disturbed ; and finally , in 1644 , they extinguished the title of the proprietaries , or lords , and continued to act under the constitution of government which they had framed in 1638 .

All persons , who were inhabitants and freemen , and who took the oath of fidelity , were entitled to vote in the elections . Church-membership was not , as in Massachusetts , an indispensable qualification . The supreme power , legislative , executive , and judicial , was vested in the General Court . 2 85 .

The charter of Connecticut , which has been objected to by Chalmers as establishing " a mere democracy , or rule of the people , " contained , indeed , a very ample grant of privileges . It incorporated the inhabitants by the name of the Governor and Company of the Colony of Connecticut in New England in America . It ordained that two general assemblies shall be annually held ; and that the assembly shall consist of a governor , deputy-governor , twelve assistants , and two deputies , from every town or city , to be chosen by the freemen , ( the charter nominating the first governor and assistants ) . The general assembly had authority to appoint judicatories , make freemen , elect officers , establish laws and ordinances " not contrary to the laws of this realm of England , " to punish offences " according to the course of other corporations within this our kingdom of England , " to assemble the inhabitants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial law in cases of necessity . The lands were to be holden as of the manor of East Greenwich , in free and common socage . The inhabitants and their children born there were to enjoy and possess all the liberties and immunities of free , naturalborn subjects , in the same manner as if born within the realm . The right of general fishery on the coasts was reserved to all subjects ; and finally the territory bounded on the east by the Narraganset River , where it falls into the sea , and on the north by Massachusetts , and on the south by the sea , and in longitude , as the line of the Massachusetts colony running from east to west , that from Narraganset Bay to the South Sea , was granted and confirmed to the colony . 3 The charter is silent in regard to religious rights and privileges . 1 1 Haz .

Ill 1685 , a quo warranto was issued by King James against the colony for the repeal of the charter . No judgment appears to have been rendered upon it ; but the colony offered its submission to the will of the crown ; and Sir Edward Andros , in 1687 , went to Hartford , and in the name of the crown declared the government dissolved . 1 They did not , however , surrender the charter ; but secreted it in an oak , which is still venerated ; and immediately after the revolution of 1688 , they resumed the exercise of all its powers . The successors of the Stuarts silently suffered them to retain it until the American Revolution , without any struggle or resistance . 2 The charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , until the year 1818 , when a new constitution of government was framed and adopted by the people . 89 . The laws of Connecticut were , in many respects , similar to those of Massachusetts . 3 At an early period after the charter they passed an act which may be deemed a bill of rights . By it , it was declared that " no man 's life shall be taken away ; no man 's honor or good , name shall be stained ; no- man 's person shall be arrested , restrained , banished , dismembered , nor any ways punished ; no mau shall be deprived of his wife or children ; no man 's goods or estate shall be taken away from him , nor any way endangered under color of law , or countenance of authority , unless it be by virtue or equity of some express law of this colony , warranting the same , established by the General Court , and sufficiently published ; or in case of the defects of a law in any particular case , by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the whole court shall concur . " 4 The trial by jury , in civil and criminal cases , was also secured ; and if the court were dissatisfied with the verdict , they might send back the jury to consider the same a second and third time , but not further . 5 The governor was to be chosen , as the charter provided , by the freemen . Every town was to send one or two deputies or representatives to the General Assembly ; but every freeman was to give his 1 1 Holmes 's Ann . 415 , 421 , 429 , 442 ; 1 Chalm Ann . 297 , 298,301,304,306 ; 1 Hutch .

In respect to offences , their criminal code proceeded upon the same general foundation as that of Massachusetts , declaring those capital which were so declared in the Holy Scriptures , and citing them as authority for this purpose . Among the capital offences were idolatry , blasphemy of Father , Son , or Holy Ghost , witchcraft , murder , murder through guile by poisoning or other devilish practices , bestiality , sodomy , rape , man-stealing , false witness , conspiracy against the colony , arson , children cursing or smiting father or mother , being a stubborn or rebellious son , and treason . 3 91 . In respect to religious concerns , their laws provided that all persons should attend public worship , and that the towns should support and pay the ministers of religion . And at first the choice of the minister was confided to the major part of the householders of the town ; the church , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in 1708 , an act was passed , ( doubtless by the influence of the clergy , ) by which the choice of ministers was vested in the inhabitants of the town who were church-members ; and the same year the celebrated platform at Saybrook was approved , which has continued down to our day to regulate , in discipline and in doctrine , the ecclesiastical concerns of the State . 4 92 . The spirit of toleration was not more liberal here than in most of the other colonies . No persons were allowed to embody themselves into church estate without the consent of the General Assembly , and the approbation of the neighboring churches ; and no ministry or church administration was entertained or authorized separate from , and in opposition to , that openly and publicly observed and dispensed by the approved minister of the place , except with the approbation and consent aforesaid. 5 Quakers , Ranters , Adamites , and other notorious heretics , ( as they were called , ) were to be committed to prison or sent out of the colony , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , folio , ( New Lon don , ) p. 27 , 30. /z/ by order of the governor and assistants . 1 Nor does the zeal of persecution appear at all to have abated until , in pursuance of the statutes of 1 William and Mary , dissenters were allowed the liberty of conscience without molestation. 2 93 . In respect to real estate , the descent and distribution was directed to be among all the children , giving the eldest son a double share ; conveyances in fraud of creditors were declared void ; lands were made liable to be set off to creditors on executions by the appraisement of three appraisers. 3 The process in courts of justice was required to be in the name of the reigning king . 4 Persons having no estate might be relieved from imprisonment by two assistants ; but if the creditor required it , he should satisfy the debt by service . 6 Depositions were allowed as evidence in civil suits . 6 No person was permitted to plead in behalf of another person on trial for delinquency , except directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our annals , though in entire conformity to the English law in capital felonies . Bills and bonds were made assignable , and suits allowed in the name of the assignees. 8 Magistrates , justices of the peace , and ministers were authorized to marry persons ; and divorces a vinculo allowed for adultery , fraudulent contract , or desertion for three years . Men and women , having a husband or wife in foreign parts , were not allowed to abide in the colony , so separated , above two years , without liberty from the General Court . Towns were required to support public schools under regulations similar , for the most part , to those of Massachusetts ; 9 and an especial maritime code was enacted , regulating the rights and duties and authorities of ship-owners , seamen , and others concerned in navigation . 10 Such are the principal provisions of the colonial legislation of Connecticut . 1 Colony Laws of Conn. , edition by Greene , 1715-1718 , folio , ( New London , ) p. /z/ 2 Id . p. 134. 8 Id . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41. 6 Id . p. 6. 6 Id . p. 116. 7 Id . p. 26. 8 Id . p. 7. 9 Id . p. 84. 10 Id . p. 70 . A similar code existed in Massachusetts , enacted in 1668. /q/ /z/ // Massachusetts , fleeing thither to escape from religious persecution ; and it still boasts of Roger Williams as its founder , and as the early defender of religious freedom and the rights of conscience . One body of them purchased the island which has given the name to the State , and another the territory of the Providence Plantations from the Indians , and began their settlements in both places nearly at the same period , viz. in 1686 and 1638. 1 They entered into separate voluntary associations of government . But finding their associations not sufficient to protect them against the encroachments of Massachusetts , and having no title under any of the royal patents , they sent Roger Williams to England in 1643 to procure a surer foundation both of title and government . He succeeded in obtaining from the Earl of Warwick ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2 and also , in 1644 , a charter from the two houses of Parliament ( Charles the First being then driven from his capital ) for the incorporation of the towns of Providence , Newport , and Portsmouth , for the absolute government of themselves , but according to the laws of England . 3 95 . Under this charter an assembly was convened in 1647 , consisting of the collective freemen of the various plantations. 4 The legislative power was vested in a court of commissioners of six persons , chosen by each of the four towns then in existence . 1 1 Hutch .

Summ. 80. /z/ The whole executive power seems to have been vested in a president and four assistants , who were chosen from the freemen , and formed the supreme court for the administration of justice . Every township , forming within itself a corporation , elected a council of six for the management of its peculiar affairs , and for the settlement of the smallest disputes . 1 The council of state of the Commonwealth soon afterwards interfered to suspend their government ; but the distractions at home prevented any serious interference by Parliament in the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their former government until the restoration of Charles the Second . 2 That event seems to have given great satisfaction to these plantations . They immediately proclaimed the king , and sent an agent to England ; and in July , 1663 , after some opposition , they succeeded in obtaining a charter from the crown . 3 96 . That charter incorporated the inhabitants by the name of the Governor and Company of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England in America , conferring on them the usual powers of corporations . The executive power was lodged in a governor , deputy-governor , and ten assistants , chosen by the freemen. 4 The supreme legislative authority was vested in a General Assembly , consisting of a governor , deputygovernor , ten assistants , and deputies from the respective towns , chosen by the freemen , ( six for Newport , four for Providence , Portsmouth , and Warwick , and two for other towns , ) the governor or deputy and six assistants being always present .

It then granted and confirmed unto them all that part of the king 's dominions in NewEngland containing the Narraganset Bay and the countries and parts adjacent , bounded westerly to the middle of Pawcatuck River , and so along the river northward to the head thereof , thence by a straight line due north , until it meet the south line of Massachusetts , extending easterly three English miles to the most eastern and northeastern parts of Narraganset Bay , as the bay extendcth southerly unto the mouth of the river running towards Providence , and thence along the easterly side or bank of the said river up to the falls , called Patucket Falls , and thence in a straight line due north till it meets the Massachusetts line . 1 The territory was to be holden as of the manor of East Greenwich in free and common socage . It further secured a free trade with all the other colonies . 97 . But the most remarkable circumstance in the charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colony , is the provision respecting religious freedom . The charter , after reciting the petition of the inhabitants , " that it is much in their hearts ( if they be permitted ) to hold forth a lively experiment , that a most flourishing civil state may stand , and be best maintained , and that among our English subjects , with a full liberty in religious concernments , and that true piety , rightly grounded upon gospel principles , will give the best and greatest security to sovereignty , " proceeds to declare : 2 " We being willing to encourage the hopeful undertaking of our said loyal and loving subjects , and to secure them in the free exercise and enjoyment of all their civil and religious rights appertaining to them as our loving subjects , and to preserve to them that liberty in the true Christian faith and worship of God , which they have sought with so much travail , and with peaceful minds and loyal subjection to our royal progenitors and ourselves to enjoy ; and because some of the people and inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , conform to the public exercise of religion according to the liturgy , form , and ceremonies of the Church of England , or 1 This is the substance but not the exact words of the boundaries in the charter , which is given at large in 2 Haz .

" * This is a noble declaration , and worthy of any prince who rules over a free people . It is lamentable to reflect how little it comports with the domestic persecutions authorized by the same monarch during his profligate reign . It is still more lamentable to reflect how little a similar spirit of toleration was encouraged either by the precepts or examples of any other of the New England colonies . 98 . Rhode Island enjoys the honor of having been , if not the first , at least one of the earliest of the colonies , and indeed of modern States , in which the liberty of conscience and freedom of worship were boldly proclaimed among its fundamental laws . 2 If at any time afterwards the State broke in upon the broad and rational principles thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled course of its policy . 3 At the present day , acting under this very charter , it continues to maintain religious freedom with all the sincerity and liberality and zeal which belonged to its founder . It has been supposed , that in the laws passed by the General Assembly first convened under this charter , ( 1644 , ) Roman Catholics were excluded from the privileges of freemen .

It is said that the general conduct of Rhode Island seems to have given entire satisfaction to Charles the Second during the residue of his reign . 2 Upon the accession of James the inhabitants were among the first to offer their congratulations , and to ask protection for their chartered rights . That monarch , however , disregarded their request . They were accused of a violation of their charter , and a quo warranto was filed against them . They immediately resolved , without much hesitation , not to contend with the crown , but to surrender their charter , and passed an act for that purpose which was afterwards suppressed . 3 In December , 1686 , Sir Edmund Andros , agreeably to his orders , dissolved their government , and assumed the administration of the colony . The Revolution of 1688 put an end to his power ; and the colony immediately afterwards resumed its charter , and , though not without some interruptions , continued to maintain and exercise its powers down to the period of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same charter , as a fundamental law , it being the only State in the Union which has not formed a new constitution of government . It seems , that until the year 1696 , the governor , assistants , and deputies of the towns sat together ; but by a law then passed they were separated , and the deputies acted as a lower house , and the governor and assistants as an upper house . 6 100 . In reviewing the colonial legislation of Rhode Island some peculiarities are discernible , though the general system is like that of the other parts of New England . 6 No persons but those who were admitted freemen of the colony were allowed to vote at elections , and they might do it in person or by proxy ; and none but free'men were eligible to office . Wills of real estate were required to have three witnesses . The probate of wills 1 1 Chalm . Annals , 276 ; 1 Holmes 's Annals , 336 ; R.

VOL. i. 5 /z/ and the granting of administrations of personal estate were committed to the jurisdiction of the town councils of each town in the colony , with an appeal to the governor and council as supreme ordinary . 1 Every town was a corporate body , entitled to choose its officers , and to admit persons as freemen. 2 Sports and labor on Sunday were prohibited . 3 Purchases of land from the Indians were prohibited . 4 By a formal enactment , in 1700 , it was declared , that in all actions , matters , causes , and things whatsoever , where no particular law of the colony is made to decide and determine the same , then in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to issue , determine , and decide the same , any usage , custom , or law to the contrary notwithstanding . 5 About the same period the English navigation laws were required , by an act of the colonial legislature , to be executed . 6 Twenty years ' peaceful possession of lands , under the claim of a title in feesimple , was declared to give a good and rightful title to the fee ; 7 and thus a just and liberal effect was given to the statute of limitations , not as a bar of the remedy , but of the right . The acknowledgment and registration of conveyances of lands in a public town registry were provided for . The support of the ministry was made to depend upon free contributions . Appeals to the king in council , in cases exceeding X300 in value , were allowed . 8 A system of redress , in cases of abuses of property devoted to charitable uses , was established ; 9 fines and common recoveries were regulated ; and the trial by jury established . The criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not affect to follow the punishments denounced in the Scripture against particular offences . 10 Witchcraft , however , was , as in the common law , punished with death . At a later period , lands of persons living out of the colony or concealing themselves therein were made liable to the payment of their debts . 11 In respect to the descent of real estates , the canons of the common law were adopted , and the eldest son took the whole inheritance by primogeniture . This system was for a short period repealed by an act ( 4 &; 5 George I. , 1718 ) which divided the estate among all the children , giving the eldest son a double share . 12 But the common 1 R.

Contracts for things above the value of ten pounds were required to be in writing ; and conveyances in fraud of creditors were declared void . And we may also trace in its legislation provision respecting hue and cry in cases of robbery ; and of forfeiture in cases of accidental death , by way of deodand. 1 101 . We have now finished our review of all the successive colonies established in New England . The remark of Chalmers is in general well founded . " Originally settled , " says he , 2 " by the same kind of people , a similar policy naturally rooted in all the colonies of New England . Their forms of government , their laws , their courts of justice , their manners , and their religious tenets , which gave birth to all these , were nearly the same . " Still , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island , for instance , the rigid spirit of Puritanism softened down ( as we have seen ) into general toleration . On the other hand , the common-law rules of descents were adhered to in its policy with singular zeal , down to the year 1770 as necessary to prevent the destruction of family estates , while the neighboring colonies adopted a rule dividing the inheritance among all the children . 3 102 . One of the most memorable circumstances in the history of New England is the early formation and establishment of a confederation of the colonies for amity , offence and defence , and mutual advice and assistance . The project was agitated as early as 1637 ; but difficulties having occurred , the articles of union were not finally adopted until 1643. 4 In the month of May of that year , the colonies of Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Haven , and Plymouth formed a confederacy by the name of the United Colonies of New England , and entered into a perpetual league of friendship and amity , for offence and defence , and mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive and defensive , were to be borne in common , and according to an apportionment provided for in the articles ; and in case of invasion of any colony , 1 Rhode Island Colony Laws ( 1719 ) , p. 5 , 8. 2 1 Chalm .

This union , so important and necessary for mutual defence and assistance during the troubles which then agitated the parent country , was not objected to by King Charles the Second , on his restoration ; and with some few alterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charters were prostrated by the authority of King James . 2 Rhode Island made application to be admitted into this union , but was refused , upon the ground that the territory was within the limits of Plymouth colony .

THE province of Maryland was included originally in the patent of the Southern or Virginia company ; and upon the dissolution of that company it reverted to the crown . King Charles the First , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cecilius Calvert Lord Baltimore , the son of George Calvert Lord Baltimore , to whom the patent was intended to have been made , but he died before it was executed . 1 By the charter the king erected it into a province , and gave it the name of Maryland , in honor of his queen , Henrietta Maria , the daughter of Henry the Fourth of France , to be held of the crown of England , he yearly , forever , rendering two Indian arrows . The territory was bounded by a right line drawn from Watkin 's Point , on Chesapeake Bay , to the ocean on the east , thence to that part of the estuary of Delaware on the north which lieth under the 40th degree , where New England is terminated ; thence in a right line , by the degree aforesaid , to the meridian of the fountain of Potomac ; thence following its course by the farther bank to its confluence with the Chesapeake ; and thence to Watkin 's Point . 2 104 . The territory thus severed from Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted in full and absolute propriety to Lord Baltimore and his heirs , saving the allegiance and sovereign dominion to the crown , with all the rights , regalities , and prerogatives , which the Bishop of Durham enjoyed in that palatinate , to be held of the crown as of Windsor Castle , in the county of Berks , in free and common socage , and not in capite , or by knight 's service . The charter further provided that the proprietary should have authority , by and with the consent of the freemen , or their delegates assembled for the purpose , to make all laws for the province , " so that such laws be consonant to 1 1 Holmes 's Ann . 213 ; 1 Chalin .

" 1 The proprietary was also vested with full executive power ; and the establishment of courts of justice was provided for . The proprietary was also authorized to levy subsidies , with the assent of the people in assembly . The inhabitants and their children were to enjoy all the rights , immunities , and privileges of subjects born in England . The right of the advowsons of the churches , according to the establishment of England , and the right to create manors and courts baron , to confer titles of dignity , to erect ports and other regalities , were expressly given to the proprietary . An exemption of the colonists from all talliages on their goods and estates , to be imposed by the crown , was expressly covenanted for in perpetuity ; an exemption which had been conferred on other colonies for years only . 2 License was granted to all subjects to transport themselves to the province ; and its products were to be imported into England and Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . And the usual powers in other charters to repel invasions , to suppress rebellions , fcc. , were also conferred on the proprietary . 105 . Such is the substance of the patent . And Chalmers has with some pride asserted , that " Maryland has always enjoyed the unrivalled honor of being the first colony which was erected into a province of the English Empire and governed regularly by laws enacted in a provincial legislature . " 3 It is also observable that there is no clause in the patent which required any transmission of the province laws to the king , or providing for his approbation or assent . Under this charter Maryland continued to be governed , with some short intervals of interruption , down to the period of the American Revolution , by the successors of the original proprietary . 4 106 . The first emigration made under the auspices of Lord Baltimore was in November , 1632 , and consisted of about two hundred gentlemen of considerable fortune and rank , and their adherents , being chiefly Roman Catholics . " He laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " upon the broad basis of security to property and of freedom of religion , granting in absolute fee fifty 1 1 Haz . Coll . 3 7 , &c.; ; 1 Chalra .

The wisdom of his choice soon converted a dreary wilderness into a prosperous colony . " It is certainly very honorable to the liberality and public spirit of the proprietary , that he should have introduced into his fundamental policy the doctrine of general toleration and equality among Christian sects ( for he does not appear to have gone further ) ; and have thus given the earliest example of a legislator inviting his subjects to the free indulgence of religious opinion . 1 This was anterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enviable rank of being the first recognition among the colonists of the glorious and indefeasible rights of conscience . Rhode Island seems , without any apparent consciousness of co-operation , to have gone further , and to have protected an universal freedom of religious opinion in Jew and Gentile , in Christian and Pagan , without any distinction to be found in its legislation . 2 107 . The first legislative assembly of Maryland , held by the freemen at large , was in 1634 - 1635 ; but little of their proceedings is known . No acts appear to have been adopted until 1638 - 1639 , 3 when provision was made , in consequence of an increase of the colonists , for a representative assembly , called the House of Assembly , chosen by the freemen ; and the laws passed by the assembly , and approved by the proprietary or his lieutenant , were to be of full force . The assembly was afterwards divided into an upper and lower house . At the same session , an act , which may be considered as in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other things , that " Holy Church within this province shall have all her rights and prerogatives " ; " that the inhabitants shall have all their rights and liberties according to the great charter of England " ; and that the goods of debtors , if not sufficient to pay their debts , shall be sold and distributed pro rata , saving debts to the proprietary . 4 In 1649 an act was passed , pun- 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 213 , 218 , 219 , 363. 2 Walsh 's Appeal , 429 , Note B. 3 That is to say , none were agreed upon by the assembly and the proprietary ; but acts appear to have been passed by the assembly which were rejected by the proprietary , and others were proposed by the proprietary which the assembly refused to adopt . See Bozman , History of Maryland , 295 , 300-318 . This author conjectures , though the records are silent on the subject , that the difficulty between the proprietary and the assembly was that each claimed the right to originate the laws. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with death and confiscation of goods and lands ; l and , strangely enough after such a provision , in the same act , after a preamble , reciting that the confining of conscience in matters of religion hath frequently fallen out to be of dangerous consequence , it is enacted that no person " professing to believe in Jesus Christ , " shall be molested for or in respect to his religion , or the free exercise thereof , nor any way compelled to the belief or exercise of any other religion . 2 It seems not to have been even imagined that a belief in the divine mission of Jesus Christ could , in the eyes of any sect of Christians , be quite consistent with the denial of the Trinity . This act was confirmed among the perpetual laws in 1676. 108 . The legislation of Maryland does not , indeed , appear to have afforded an uniform protection in respect to religion , such as the original policy of the founder would seem to indicate . Under the protectorate of Cromwell , Roman Catholics were expressly denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who profess faith in God by Jesus Christ , though differing in judgment from the doctrine , worship , or discipline publicly held forth , " were not to be restrained from the exercise of their religion . 3 In 1696 the Church of England was established in the province ; and in 1702 , the liturgy and rites and ceremonies of the Church of England were required to be pursued in all the churches , with such toleration for dissenters , however , as was provided for in the act of 1 William and Mary . 4 And the introduction of the test and abjuration acts , in 1716 , excluded all Roman Catholics from office . 6 109 . It appears to have been a policy adopted at no great distance of time after the settlement of the colony to provide for the public registration of conveyances of real estates . 6 In the silence of the statute-book until 1715 , it is to be presumed that the system of descents of intestate estates was that of the parent country . In that year an act passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annals , 223 , 365 ; Bacon 's Laws of Maryland , 1 649. 2 Bacon 's Laws of Maryland , 1649 , ch. 1 ; 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 218 , 219 , 235. 3 Bacon 's Laws of Maryland , 1654 , ch. 4 ; Marsh .

Maryland , too , like the other colonies , was early alive to the importance of possessing the sole power of internal taxation ; and accordingly , in 1650 , 1 it was declared that no taxes should be levied without the consent of the general assembly . 110 . Upon the Revolution of 1688 , the government of Maryland was seized into the hands of the crown , and was not again restored to the proprietary until 1716 . From that period no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland , at least as early as 1614. 1 Trading-houses were established on Manhattan Island by them , under the auspices of the Dutch West India Company , about 1621. 2 But the permanent establishment of a Dutch colony there does not appear to have been fixed until about 1629 , when it seems to have acquired the name of the New Netherlands . 3 But the English government seems at all times to have disputed the right of the Dutch to make any settlement in America ; and the territory occupied by them was unquestionably within the chartered limits of New England granted to the council of Plymouth . 4 Charles the Second , soon after his restoration , instigated as much by personal antipathy as by a regard for the interest of the crown , determined to maintain his right , and in March , 1664 , granted a patent to his brother , the Duke of York and Albany , by which he conveyed to him the region extending from the western bank of the Connecticut to the eastern shore of the Delaware , together with Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil and military . 5 Authority was given ( among other things ) to correct , punish , pardon , govern , and rule all subjects that should inhabit the territory , according to such laws , ordinances , fcc. , as the Duke should establish , so always that the same " were not contrary , but as near as might be agreeable to the laws and statutes and government of the realm of England , " saving to the crown a right to hear and determine all appeals . The usual authority was also given to use and exercise martial law in cases of rebellion , insurrection , mutiny , and invasion . 6 A part of this tract was afterwards conveyed by 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 567 , 568. 2 Id . 570. 3 4 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 568 , 569 , 570 , 572 ; Marsh .

By this latter grant they were entitled to all the tract adjacent to New England , lying westward of Long Island and bounded on the east by the main sea and partly by Hudson 's River , and upon the west by Delaware Bay or River , and extending southward to the main ocean as far as Cape May at the mouth of Delaware Bay , and to the northward as far as the northernmost branch of Delaware Bay or River , which is 41 degrees 40 minutes latitude ; which tract was to be called by the name of Nova Caosarea , or New Jersey . 1 So that the territory then claimed by the Dutch as the New Netherlands was divided into the colonies of New York and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch colony was surprised by a British armament which arrived on the coast , and was compelled to surrender to its authority . By the terms of the capitulation the inhabitants were to continue free denizens and to enjoy their property . The Dutch inhabitants were to enjoy the liberty of their conscience in divine worship and church discipline , and their own customs concerning their inheritances. 2 The government was instantly assumed by right of conquest in behalf of the Duke of York , the proprietary , and the territory was called New York . Liberty of conscience was granted to all settlers . No laws contrary to those of England were allowed ; and taxes were to be levied by authority of a general assembly . 3 The peace of Breda , in 1667 , confirmed the title in the conquerors by the rule of uti possidetis. * In the succeeding Dutch war the colony was reconquered ; but it was restored to the Duke of York upon the succeeding peace of 1674. 5 113 . As the validity of the original grant to the Duke of York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was deemed questionable , he thought it prudent to ask , and he accordingly obtained a new grant from the crown in June , 1674. 6 It confirmed the former grant , and empowered him to govern the inhabitants by such ordinances as he or his assigns should estab- 1 Smith 's New York , 31 , 32 10 , 11 ; 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 613. 2 Smith 's New York , 44 , 45 19 , 20 ; 1 Chalm .

It authorized him to administer justice according to the laws of England , allowing an appeal to the king in council . 1 It prohibited trade thither without his permission ; and allowed the colonists to import merchandise upon paying customs according to the laws of the realm . Under this charter he ruled the province until his accession to the throne . 2 No general assembly was called for several years ; and the people having become clamorous for the privileges enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , authorized to call an assembly , which was empowered to make laws for the general regulation of the State , which , however , were of no force without the ratification of the proprietary . 3 Upon the Revolution of 1688 , the people of New York immediately took side in favor of the Prince of Orange . 4 From this era they were deemed entitled to all the privileges of British subjects , inhabiting a dependent province of the state . No charter was subsequently granted to them by the crown ; and therefore they derived no peculiar privileges from that source . 5 114 . The government was henceforth administered by governors appointed by the crown . But no effort was made to conduct the administration without the aid of the representatives of the people in general assembly . On the contrary , as soon as the first royal governor arrived in 1691 , an assembly was called which passed a number of important acts . Among others was an act virtually declaring their right of representation , and their right to enjoy the liberties and privileges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative power shall forever reside in a governor and council appointed by the crown , and the people by their representatives ( chosen in the manner pointed out in the act ) convened in general assembly . It further declared that all lands should be held in free and common socage according to the tenure of East Greenwich in England ; that in all criminal cases there should be a trial by jury ; that estates of femes covert should be conveyed only by deed upon privy examination ; that wills in 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 579 , 580. a 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 581 , 583 ; Smith 's New York , 123 , 125 , 126 72 , 75. 8 1 Chalm .

In the year 1683 certain fundamental regulations were passed by the legislature , which will be found in an Appendix to the second volume of the old edition of the New York Laws . * 1 Holmes 's Annals , 429 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 585 , 590 , 591 , 592. 6 1 Holmes 's Annals , 435 ; Smith 's New York , 127 75 , 76 ; Acts of 1691. /q/ writing , attested by three or more credible witnesses , should be sufficient to pass lands ; that there should be no fines upon alienations , or escheats and forfeitures of lands , except in cases of treason ; that no person should hold any office unless upon his appointment he would take the oaths of supremacy , and the test prescribed by the act of Parliament ; 1 that no tax or talliage should be levied but by the consent of the general assembly ; and that no person professing faith in Jesus Christ should be disturbed or questioned for different opinions in religion , with an exception of Roman Catholics . The act , however , was repealed by King William in 1697. 2 Another act enabling persons who were scrupulous of taking oaths , to make in lieu thereof a solemn proimse to qualify them as witnesses , jurors , and officers . In the year 1693 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches of the Protestant religion . New York ( like Massachusetts ) seemed at all times determined to suppress the Romish Church . In an act passed in the beginning of the last century it was declared that every Jesuit and Popish priest who should continue in the colony after a given day should be condemned to perpetual imprisonment ; and if he broke prison or escaped and was retaken , he was to be put to death . And so little were the spirit of toleration and the rights of conscience understood at a much later period , that one of her historians 3 a half-century afterwards gave this exclusion the warm praise of being worthy of perpetual duration . And the constitution of New York , of 1777 , 4 required all persons naturalized by the State to take an oath of abjuration of all foreign allegiance , and subjection in all matters , ecclesiastical as well as civil . This was doubtless intended to exclude all Catholics , who acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the Pope , from the benefits of naturalization. 5 In examining the subsequent legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any very striking deviations from the laws of England ; and the common law , beyond all question , was the basis of its jurisprudence .

By this constitution it was provided that the executive government should be administered by a governor and council , who should have the appointment of officers ; and that there should be a legislative or general assembly , to be composed of the governor and council , and deputies chosen by the people . The general assembly were to have power to make all laws for the government of the province , so that " the same be consonant to reason , and as near as may be conveniently agreeable to the laws and customs of his Majesty 's realm of England " ; to constitute courts , to levy taxes , to erect manors and ports and incorporations. 2 The registry of title-deeds of land and the granting thereof , as a bounty to planters , were also provided for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molestation guaranteed on account of any difference in opinion or practice in matters of religious concernments , so always that the civil peace was not disturbed . But the general assembly were to be at liberty to appoint ministers and establish their maintenance , giving liberty to others to maintain what ministers they pleased . Every inhabitant was bound to swear or subscribe allegiance to the king ; and the general assembly might grant naturalization. 3 116 .

The proprietors also of West Jersey drew up another set of concessions for the settlers within that territory . They contain very ample privileges to the people . It was declared that the common law , or fundamental rights and privileges of West New Jersey , therein stated , are to be the foundation of government , not alterable by the legislature . Among these fundamentals were the following : " That no man , nor number of men upon earth , hath power or authority to rule over men 's consciences in religious matters " ; 2 that no person shall be anyways called in question or in the least punished , or either , for the sake of his opinion , judgment , faith , or worship towards God in matters of religion ; that there shall be a trial by jury in civil and criminal cases ; that there shall be a general assembly of representatives of the people , who shall have power to provide for the proper administration of the government , and to make laws , so " that the same be , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ancient , and fundamental laws of England . " 3 117 . Whether these concessions became the general law of the province seems involved in some obscurity . There were many difficulties and contests for jurisdiction between the governors of the Duke of York and the proprietors of the Jerseys ; and these were not settled until after the Duke , in 1680 , 4 finally surrendered all right to both by letters-patent granted to the respective proprietors . 5 In 1681 , the governor of the proprietors of West Jersey , with the consent of the general assembly , made a frame of government embracing some of the fundamentals in the former concessions . 6 There were to be a governor and council , and a general assembly of representatives of the people . The general assembly had the power to make laws , to levy taxes , and to appoint officers . Liberty of conscience was allowed , and no persons rendered inca- 1 Smith 's New Jersey , 61 , 79 , 80 , 87 ; 1 Chalm .

West Jersey continued to be governed in this manner until the surrender of the proprietary government , in 1702. * 118 . Carteret died in 1679 , and being the sole proprietor of East Jersey , by his will he ordered it to be sold for payment of his debts ; and it was accordingly sold to William Penn and eleven others , who were called the Twelve Proprietors . They afterwards took twelve more into the proprietaryship ; and to the twenty-four thus formed , the Duke of York , in March , 1682 , made his third and last grant of East Jersey . 2 Yery serious dissensions soon arose between the two provinces themselves , as well as between them and New York , which banished moderation from their councils , and threatened the most serious calamities . A quo warranto was ordered by the crown , in 1686 , to be issued against both provinces . East Jersey immediately offered to be annexed to West Jersey , and to submit to a governor appointed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be annexed to New England ; and the proprietors of East Jersey made a formal surrender of its patent , praying only for a new grant , securing their right of soil . Before this request could be granted , the Revolution of 1688 took place , and they passed under the allegiance of a new sovereign . 3 119 . From this period both of the provinces were in a great state of confusion and distraction , and remained so until the proprietors of both made a formal surrender of all their powers of government , but not of their lands , to Queen Anne , in April , 1702 . The queen immediately reunited both provinces into one ; and by commission appointed a governor over it . He was thereby authorized to govern with the assistance of a council , and to call general assemblies of representatives of the people to be chosen by the freeholders , who were required to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy , and the tests provided by the acts of Parliament . The general assembly , with the consent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinances for the welfare of the people " not repugnant , but , as near as may be , agreeable unto the laws and statutes of this our kingdom of England " ; which laws were , however , to be subject to the approbation or dis- 1 Smith 's New Jersey , 154. a Smith 's New Jersey , 157 ; 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 620 , 621 ; Marshall 's Colon . 180. 8 1 Chalm .

Liberty of conscience was allowed to all persons but Papists. 120 . From this time to the American Revolution the province was governed without any charter under royal commissions , substantially in the manner pointed out in the first . The people always strenuously contended for the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many struggles occurred from time to time between their representatives and the royal governors on this subject . 2 1 Smith 's New Jersey , 220 to 230 , 231 to 261. 2 Smith 's New Jersey , ch. 14 , and particularly p. 265 , &c.,; p. 269 , &c.,; 275 , 292 , 304 .

The charter constituted Penn the true and absolute proprietary of the territory thus described , ( saving to the crown the sovereignty of the country , and the allegiance of the proprietary and 1 1 Chalm .

All laws were to be sent to England within five years after the making of them , and if disapproved of by the crown within six months , to become null and void . 3 It also authorized the proprietary to appoint judges and other officers ; to pardon and reprieve criminals ; to establish courts of justice , with a right of appeal to the crown from all judgments ; to create cities and other corporations ; to erect ports and manors , and courts baron in such manors .

" Such are the most important clauses of this charter , which has been deemed one of the best drawn of the colonial charters , and which underwent the revision , not merely of the law-officers of the crown , but of the then Lord Chief Justice ( North ) of England . 4 It has been remarked , as a singular omission in this charter , that there is no provision that the inhabitants and their children shall be deemed British subjects , and entitled to all the liberties and immunities thereof , such a clause being found in every other charter . 5 Chalmers 6 has observed that 1 1 Proud , Penn . 176 ; Lavrs of Pennsyl. , ed. of Franklin , 1742 , App. ; 2 1 Proud , Penn . 175 , 176 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 1 Clialm Annals , 636 , 637. 6 1 Graham 's Hist , of Colon . 41 , note ; 1 Chalm .

Penn immediately invited emigration to his province by holding out concessions of a very liberal nature to all settlers ; l and under his benign and enlightened policy a foundation was early laid for the establishment of a government and laws which have been justly celebrated for their moderation , wisdom , and protection of the rights and liberties of the people . 2 In the introduction to his first frame of government , he lays down this proposition , which was far beyond the general spirit of that age , that " any government is free to the people under it , whatever be the frame , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those laws ; and more than this is tyranny , oligarchy , or confusion . " 8 In that frame of government , after providing for the organization of it under the government of a governor , council , and general assembly , chosen by the people , it was declared that all persons acknowledging one Almighty God , and living peaceably , shall be in no ways molested for their religious persuasion or practice in matters of faith or worship , or compelled to frequent or maintain any religious worship , place , or ministry . 4 Provisions were also made securing the right of trial by jury , and the right to dispose of property by will , attested by two witnesses ; making lands in certain cases liable to the payment of debts ; giving to seven years ' quiet possession the efficacy of an unquestionable title ; requiring the registry of grants and conveyances , and declaring that no taxes should be levied but by a law for that purpose made . 6 Among other things truly honorable to the memory of this great man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he manifested for the rights of the Indians , and the duties of the settlers towards them . They are exhibited in his original plan of concessions , as well as in various other public documents , and were exemplified in his subsequent conduct . 6 In August , 1682 , in order to secure his title against adverse claims , he procured a patent /z/ from the Duke of York , releasing all his title derived under any of his patents from the crown . 1 124 . It was soon found that the original frame of government , drawn up before any settlements were made , was ill adapted to the state of things in an infant colony . Accordingly it was laid aside , and a new frame of government was , with the consent of the general assembly , established in 1683. 2 In 1692 , Penn was deprived of the government of Pennsylvania by William and Mary ; but it was again restored to him in the succeeding year . 3 A third frame of government was established in 1696. 4 This again was surrendered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1701 , with the consent of the general assembly , established , under which the province continued to be governed down to the period of the American Revolution . It provided for full liberty of conscience and worship ; and for the right of all persons professing to believe in Jesus Christ , to serve the government in any capacity . 5 An annual assembly was to be chosen of delegates from each county , and to have the usual legislative authority of other colonial assemblies , and also power to nominate certain persons for office to the governor . The laws were to be subject to the approbation of the governor , who had a council of state to assist him in the government . 6 Provision was made in the same charter , that if the representatives of the province and territories ( meaning by territories the three counties of Delaware ) should not agree to join together in legislation , they should be represented in distinct assemblies . 7 125 . In the legislation of Pennsylvania , early provision was made ( in 1683 ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were to be divided among all the children , the eldest son having a double share ; and this provision was never afterwards departed from . 8 Notwithstanding the liberty of conscience recognized in the charters , the legislature seems to have felt itself at liberty to narrow down its protection to persons who believed in the Trinity , and in the divine inspiration of the Scriptures . 9 1 1 Proud , Penn . 200. 2 1 Proud , Penn . 239 ; 2 Proud , Penn .

That level region , which stretches from the 36th degree of north latitude to Cape Florida , afforded an ample theatre for the early struggles of the three great European powers , Spain , France , and England , to maintain or acquire an exclusive sovereignty . Various settlements were made under the auspices of each of the rival powers , and a common fate seemed for a while to attend them all . 1 In March , 1662 April , 1663 , Charles the Second made a grant to Lord Clarendon and others of the territory lying on the Atlantic Ocean , and extending from the north end of the island called Hope Island , in the South Virginian Seas , and within 36 degrees of north latitude , and to the west as far as the South Seas , and so respectively as far as the river Mathias upon the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so west in a direct line to the South Seas , and erected it into a province , by the name of Carolina , to be holden as of the manor of East Greenwich in Kent , in free and common socage , and not in capite , or by knight service , subject immediately to the crown , as a dependency , forever . 2 129 . The grantees were created absolute lords proprietaries , saving the faith , allegiance , and supreme dominion of the crown , and invested with as ample rights and jurisdictions as the Bishop of Durham possessed in his palatine diocese . The charter seems to have been copied from that of Maryland , and resembles it in many of its provisions . It authorized the proprietaries to enact laws with the assent of the freemen of the colony , or their delegates , to erect courts of judicature , to appoint civil officers , to grant titles of honor , to erect forts , to make war , and in cases of necessity to exercise martial law , to build harbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy customs and subsidies im- 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 513 , 514 , 515. 2 1 Chalm .

" 3 And it declared that the inhabitants and their children , born in the province , should be denizens of England , and entitled to all the privileges and immunities of Britrsh-born subjects . 130 . The proprietaries immediately took measures for the settlement of the province , and at the desire of the New England settlers within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant theme of reproach ) published proposals , forming a basis of government . 4 It was declared that there should be a governor chosen by the proprietaries from thirteen persons named by the colonists , and a general assembly , composed of the governor , council , and representatives of the people , who should have authority to make laws not contrary to those of England , which should remain in force until disapproved of by the proprietaries. 5 Perfect freedom of religion was also promised , and a hundred acres of land offered at a half-penny an acre , to every settler within five years . 131 . In 1665 , the proprietaries obtained from Charles the Second a second charter , with an enlargement of boundaries . It recited the grant of the former charter , and declared the limits to extend north and eastward as far as the north end of Currituck River or Inlet , upon a straight westerly line to Wyonoak Creek , which lies within or about 36 degrees 30 minutes of north latitude , and so west in a direct line as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the degrees of 29 inclusive of northern latitude , and so west in a direct line as far as the South Seas . 6 1 1 Holmes 's Annals , 327 , 328 .

It also gave them power to make laws , with the assent of the freemen of the province , or their delegates , provided such laws were consonant with reason , and as near as conveniently may be , agreeable to the laws and customs of the realm of England . 1 It also provided that the inhabitants and their children should be denizens and lieges of the kingdom of England , and reputed and held as the liege people born within the kingdom , and might inherit and purchase lands , and sell and bequeath the same , and should possess all the privileges and immunities of naturalborn subjects within the realm . Many other provisions were added , in substance like those in the former charter . 2 Several detached settlements were made in Carolina , which were at first placed under distinct temporary governments ; one was in Albemarle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various independent and separate colonies were established , each of which had its own assembly , its own customs , and its own laws ; a policy which the proprietaries had afterwards occasion to regret , from its tendency to enfeeble and distract the province . 4 132 . In the year 1669 , the proprietaries , dissatisfied with the systems already established within the province , signed a fundamental constitution for the government thereof , the object of which is declared to be , " that we may establish a government agreeable to the monarchy , of which Carolina is a part , that we may avoid making too numerous a democracy . " 5 This constitution was drawn up by the celebrated John Locke , and his memory has often been reproached with the illiberal character of some of the articles , the oppressive servitude of others , and the general disre- 1 1 1 Williams 's N.

Probably there were many circumstances attending this transaction which are now unknown , and which might well have moderated the severity of the reproach , and furnished , if not a justification , at least some apology for this extraordinary instance of unwise and visionary legislation . 133 . It provided that the oldest proprietary should be the palatine , and the next oldest should succeed him . Each of the proprietaries was to hold a high office . The rules of precedency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were instituted , with suitable estates , which were to descend with the dignity . The provincial legislature , dignified with the name of parliament , was to be biennial , and to consist of the proprietaries or their deputies , of the nobility , and of representatives of the freeholders chosen in districts . They were all to meet in one apartment ( like the ancient Scottish Parliament ) , and enjoy an equal vote . No business , however , was to be proposed , until it had been debated in the grand council ( which was to consist of the proprietaries and forty-two counsellors ) , whose duty it was to prepare bills . No act was of force longer than until the next biennial meeting of the parliament , unless ratified by the palatine and a quorum of the proprietaries . All the laws were to become void at the end of a century , without any formal repeal . The Church of England ( which was declared to be the only true and orthodox religion ) was alone to be allowed a public maintenance by parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of its own minister . Every man of seventeen years of age was to declare himself of some church or religious profession , and to be recorded as such ; otherwise he was not to have any benefit of the laws . And no man was to be permitted to be a freeman of Carolina , or have any estate or habitation , who did not acknowledge a God , and that God is to be publicly worshipped . In other respects there was a guaranty of religious freedom . 1 There was to be a public registry of all deeds and conveyances of lands , and of marriages and births . Every freeman 1 1 Hewatt 's South Car . 42 to 47 , 321 , &c.; ; Carolina Charters , 4to , London , p. 33 , &c.; ; I Chalm . Annals , 526 ; 1 Holmes 's Annals , 350 , 351 ; 1 Williams 's N.

" No civil or criminal cause was to be tried but by a jury of the peers of the party ; but the verdict of a majority was binding . With a view to prevent unnecessary litigation , it was ( with a simplicity , which at this time may excite a smile ) provided that " it shall be a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward " ; and that " since multiplicity of comments , as well as of laws , have great inconveniences , and serve only to obscure and perplex , all manner of comments and expositions on any part of these fundamental constitutions , or on any part of the common or statute law of Carolina , are absolutely prohibited . " l 134 . Such was the substance of this celebrated constitution . It is easy to perceive that it was ill adapted to the feelings , the wants , and the opinions of the colonists . The introduction of it , therefore , was resisted by the people , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found impracticable . 2 Public dissatisfaction daily increased , and after a few years ' experience of its ill arrangements , and its mischievous tendency , the proprietaries , upon the application of the people ( in 1693 ) , abrogated the constitution , and restored the ancient form of government . Thus perished the labors of Mr. Locke ; and thus perished a system , under the administration of which , it has been remarked , the Carolinians had not known one day of real enjoyment , and that introduced evils and disorders , which ended only with the dissolution of the proprietary government . 3 Perhaps in the annals of the world there is not to be found a more wholesome lesson of the utter folly of all efforts to establish forms of government upon mere theory , and of the dangers of legislation without consulting the habits , manners , feelings , and opinions of the people upon which they are to operate . 135 . After James the Second came to the throne , the same general course was adopted of filing a quo warranto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other colonies . The proprietaries , with a view to elude the storm , prudently offered 1 Carolina Charters 4to , p. 45 , 70 , p. 47 , 80 ; 1 Hewatt 's South Car . 321 , &c.; 2 1 Ramsay 's South Car . 39 , 43 , 88 ; 1 Hewatt 's South Car 45 ; 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 527 , 528 , 529 , 530 , 532 , 550 ; Marsh .

In April , 1698 , the proprietaries made another system of fundamental constitutions , which embraced many of those propounded in the first , and indeed , was manifestly a mere amendment of them . 136 . These constitutions ( for experience does not seem to have imparted more wisdom to the proprietaries on this subject ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hereditary nobility of the former constitutions , and shared a common fate . They were never generally assented to by the people of the colony , or by their representatives , as a body of fundamental laws . Hewatt says , 2 that none of these systems ever obtained " the force of fundamental and unalterable laws in the colony . What regulations the people found applicable , they adopted at the request of their governors ; but observed these on account of their own propriety and necessity , rather than as a system of laws imposed on them by British legislators . " 3 137 . There was at this period a space of three hundred miles between the southern and northern settlements of Carolina ; * and though the whole province was owned by the same proprietaries , the legislation of the two great settlements had been hitherto conducted by separate and distinct assemblies , sometimes under the same governor and sometimes under different governors . The legislatures continued to remain distinct down to the period when a final surrender of the proprietary charter was made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the name of North Carolina and South Carolina , and the laws of each obtained a like appellation . Cape Fear seems to have been commonly deemed in the commissions of the governor the boundary between the two colonies . 6 138 . By the surrender of the charter , the whole government of the territory was vested in the crown ; ( it had been in fact ex- 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 549 ; 1 Holmes 's Annals , 416. 2 1 Hewatt 's South Carol . 45. 8 Dr. Ramsay treats these successive constitutions as of no authority whatsoever in the province , as a law or rule of government .

At a later period 1732 , for the convenience of the inhabitants , the province was divided ; and the divisions were distinguished by the names of North Carolina and South Carolina . 2 139 . The form of government conferred on Carolina when it became a royal province was in substance this : It consisted of a governor and council appointed by the crown , and an assembly chosen by the people , and these three branches constituted the legislature . The governor convened , prorogued , and dissolved the legislature , and had a negative upon the laws , and exercised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court of chancery , of the admiralty , of supreme ordinary , and of appointing magistrates and militia officers . All laws were subject to the royal approbation or dissent ; but were in the mean time in full force . 140 . On examining the statutes of South Carolina , a close adherence to the general policy of the English laws is apparent . As early as the year 1712 , a large body of the English statutes was , by express legislation , adopted as part of its own code ; and all English statutes respecting allegiance , all the test and supremacy acts , and all acts declaring the rights and liberties of the subjects , or securing the same , were also declared to be in full force in the province . All and every part of the common law , not altered by these acts or inconsistent with the constitutions , customs , and laws of the province , was also adopted as part of its jurisprudence . An exception was made of ancient abolished tenures , and of ecclesiastical matters inconsistent with the then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving of the liberty of conscience , which was allowed to be enjoyed by the charter from the crown and the laws of the province . 4 This liberty of conscience did not amount to a right to deny the Trinity . 6 /z/ The Church of England had been previously established in the province in 1704 and all members of the assembly were required to be of that persuasion . 1 Fortunately Queen Anne annulled these obnoxious laws ; and though the Church of England was established , dissenters obtained a toleration , and the law respecting the religious qualification of assemblymen was shortly afterwards repealed . 141 . The laws of descents of intestate real estates , of wills , and of uses , existing in England , seem to have acquired a permanent foundation in the colony , and remained undisturbed , until after the period of the American Revolution . 2 As in the other colonies , the registration of conveyances of lands was early provided for , in order to suppress fraudulent grants . 142 . In respect to North Carolina , there was an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the common law was and should be in force in the colony . All statute laws for maintaining the royal prerogative and succession to the crown , and all such laws made for the establishment of the church , and laws made for the indulgence to Protestant dissenters ; and all laws providing for the privileges of the people , and security of trade ; and all laws for the limitation of actions and for preventing vexatious suits , and for preventing immorality and fraud , and confirming inheritances and titles of land , were declared to be in force in the province . 3 The policy thus avowed was not departed from down to the period of the American Revolution ; and the laws of descents and the registration of conveyances in both the Carolinas were a silent result of their common origin and government . J 1 Holmes 's Annals , 489 , 490 , 491 ; 1 Hewatt 's South Carol . 166 to 177. 2 2 Ramsay 's South Car . 130 . The descent of estates was not altered until 1791. 8 Iredell 's North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ /z/ 143 . IN the same year in which Carolina was divided 1732 , a project was formed for the settlement of a colony upon the unoccupied territory between the rivers Savannah and Altarnaha. 1 The object of the projectors was to strengthen the province of Carolina , to provide a maintenance for the suffering poor of the mother country , and to open an asylum for the persecuted Protestants in Europe ; and in common with all the other colonies to attempt the conversion and civilization of the natives . 2 Upon application , George the Second granted a charter to the company , ( consisting of Lord Percival and twenty others , among whom was the celebrated Oglethorpe , ) and incorporated them by the name of the Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America . 3 The charter conferred the usual powers of corporations in England , and authorized the trustees to hold any territories , jurisdictions , etc. , in America for the better settling of a colony there . The affairs of the corporation were to be managed by the corporation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place nominated by the crown , and afterwards , as vacancies occurred , filled by the corporation . The number of common-councilmen might , with the increase of the corporation , be increased to twenty-four . The charter further granted to the corporation seven undivided parts of all the territories lying in that part of South Carolina which lies from the northern stream of a river , there called the Savannah , all along the sea-coast to the southward unto the southernmost stream of a certain other great river , called the Altamaha , and westward from the heads of the said rivers respectively in direct lines to the South Seas , to be held as of the manor of Hampton Court , in Middlesex , in free and common socage , and not in capite . It then erected all the territory into an independent province by the name of Georgia . It authorized the 1 1 Holmes 's Annals , 552 ; Marsh .

The affairs of the corporation were ordinarily to be managed by the common council . It was further declared that all persons born in the province should enjoy all the privileges and immunities of natural-born subjects in Great Britain . Liberty of conscience was allowed to all inhabitants in the worship of God , and a free exercise of religion to all persons , except Papists . The corporation were also authorized , for the term of twentyone years , to erect courts of judicature for all civil and criminal causes , and to appoint a governor , judges , and other magistrates . The registration of all conveyances of the corporation was also provided for . The governor was to take an oath to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to obey all royal instructions pursuant thereto . The governor of South Carolina was to have the chief command of the militia of the province ; and goods were to be imported and exported without touching at any port in South Carolina . At the end of the twentyone years the crown was to establish such form of government in the province , and such method of making laws therefor , as in its pleasure should be deemed meet ; and all officers should be then appointed by the crown . 144 . Such is the substance of the charter , which was obviously intended for a temporary duration only ; and the first measures adopted by the trustees , granting lands in tail male , to be held by a sort of military service , and introducing other restrictions , were not adapted to aid the original design , or foster the growth of the colony . 1 It continued to languish , until at length the trustees , wearied with their own labors , and the complaints of the people , in June , 1751 , surrendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed as a royal province , enjoying the same liberties and immunities as other royal provinces ; and in process of time it began to flourish , and at the period of the American Revolution it had attained considerable importance among the colonies . 3 1 Marshall 's Colon , ch. 9 , p. 248 , 249 , 250 ; 2 Holmes 's Annals , 4 - 45 ; 2 Hewatt 's South Car . 41 , 42 , 43. 2 2 Holmes 's Annals , 45. 3 Stokes 's Hist , of Colonies , 115 , 119 ; 2 Hewatt 's South Car . 145 ; 2 Holmes 's Annals , /z/ /q/ 145 . In respect to its ante-revolutionary jurisprudence , a few remarks may suffice . The British common and statute law lay at the foundation . 1 The same general system prevailed as in the Carolinas , from which it sprung . Intestate estates descended according to the course of the English law . The registration of conveyances was provided for , at once to secure titles and to suppress frauds ; and the general interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of public justice , were protected by ample colonial regulations . l Stokes 's Hist , of Colon . 119 , 136. /z/ 146 . WE have now finished our survey of the origin and political history of the colonies , and here we may pause for a short time for the purpose of some general reflections upon the subject . 147 . Plantations or colonies in distant countries are either such as are acquired by occupying and peopling desert and uncultivated regions by emigrations from the mother country , 1 or such as , being already cultivated and organized , are acquired by conquest or cession under treaties . There is , however , a difference between these two species of colonies in respect to the laws by which they are governed , at least according to the jurisprudence of the common law . If an uninhabited country is discovered and planted by British subjects , the English laws are said to be immediately in force there ; for the law is the birthright of every subject . So that wherever they go they carry their laws with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 148 . This proposition , however , though laid down in such general terms by very high authority , requires many limitations , and is to be understood with many restrictions . Such colonists do not carry with them the whole body of the English laws , as they then exist ; for many of them must , from the nature of the case , be wholly inapplicable to their situation , and inconsistent with their comfort and prosperity . There is , therefore , this necessary limitation implied , that they carry with them all the laws applicable to their situation , and not repugnant to the local and political circumstances in which they are placed . 149 . Even as thus stated , the proposition is full of vagueness and perplexity ; for it must still remain a question of intrinsic difficulty to say what laws are or are not applicable to their situation ; and whether they are bound by a present state of things , or are at liberty to apply the laws in future by adoption , as the growth 1 1 Bl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bl . Comm. 107 ; 2 Salk. 411 ; Com . Dig . Ley . C. ; Rex v. Vaughan , 4 Burr . E. 2500 ; Chitty on Prerog. ch. 3 , p. 29 , &c.; /q/ or interests of the colony may dictate . 1 The English rules of inheritance , and of protection from personal injuries , the rights secured by Magna Charta , and the remedial course in the administration of justice , are examples as clear perhaps as any which can be stated as presumptively adopted , or applicable . And yet in the infancy of a colony some of these very rights and privileges and remedies and rules may be in fact inapplicable , or inconvenient and impolitic. 2 It is not perhaps easy to settle what parts of the English laws are or are not in force in any such colony , until either by usage or judicial determination they have been recognized as of absolute force . 150 . In respect to conquered and ceded countries , which have already laws of their own , a different rule prevails . In such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institute new ones . But until such new laws are promulgated , the old laws and customs of the country remain in full force , unless so far as they are contrary to our religion , or enact anything that is malum in se ; for in all such cases the laws of the conquering or acquiring country shall prevail . This qualification of the rule arises from the presumption that the crown could never intend to sanction laws contrary to religion or sound morals . 3 But although the king has thus the power to change the laws of ceded and conquered countries , the power is not unlimited . His legislation is subordinate to the authority of parliament . He can not make any new change contrary to fundamental principles ; he can not exempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion , as for instance from the laws of trade , or from the power of parliament ; and he can not give him privileges exclusive of other subjects . 4 151 .

" x 152 . There is great reason to doubt the accuracy of this statement in a legal view . We have already seen that the European nations by whom America was colonized treated the subject in a very different manner . 2 They claimed an absolute dominion over the whole territories afterwards occupied by them , not in virtue of any conquest of , or cession by , the Indian natives , but as a right acquired by discovery . 3 Some of them , indeed , obtained a sort of confirmatory grant from the papal authority . But as between themselves they treated the dominion and title of territory as resulting from priority of discovery ; 4 and that European power which had first discovered the country and set up marks of possession was deemed to have gained the right , though it had not yet formed a regular colony there . 6 We have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a right of propriety and dominion , but as a mere right of occupancy . 6 As infidels , heathen , and savages , they were not allowed to possess the prerogatives belonging to absolute , sovereign , and independent nations . 7 The territory over which they wandered , and which they used for their temporary and fugitive purposes , was , in respect to Christians , deemed as if it were inhabited only by brute animals . There is not a single grant from the British crown , from the earliest of Elizabeth down to the latest of George the Second , that affects to look to any title except that founded on discovery . Conquest or cession is not once alluded to . And it is impossible that it should have been ; for at the time when all the leading grants were re- 1 1 Bl .

On the contrary , it was opposed by some of the most enlightened ecclesiastics and philosophers of those days , as unjust and absurd ; and especially by two Spanish writers of eminent worth , Soto and Victoria . See Sir James Macintosh 's elegant treatise on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy , Philadelphia edit . 1832 , pp. 49 , 50. /q/ spectively made , there had not been any conquest or cession from the natives of the territory comprehended in those grants . Even in respect to the territory of New York and New Jersey , which alone afford any pretence for a claim by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from the natives , and were ceded to England by the treaty of Breda in 1667 . But England claimed this very territory , not by right of this conquest , but by the prior right of discovery . 1 The original grant was made to the Duke of York in 1664 , founded upon this right , and the subsequent confirmation of his title did not depart from the original foundation . 153 . The Indians could in no just sense be deemed a conquered people , who had been stripped of their territorial possessions by superior force . They were considered as a people not having any regular laws , or any organized government , but as mere wandering tribes . 2 They were never reduced into actual obedience , as dependent communities ; and no scheme of general legislation over them was ever attempted . For many purposes they were treated as independent communities , at liberty to govern themselves , so always that they did not interfere with the paramount rights of the European discoverers. 3 154 . For the most part at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not any possession or occupation of the territory by any British emigrants . The main object of these charters , as stated in the preliminary recitals , was to invite emigrations , to people the country , to found colonies , and to Christianize the natives . Even in case of a conquered country , where there are no laws at all existing , or none which are adapted to a civilized community , or where the laws are silent , or are rejected and none substituted , the territory must be governed according to the rules of natural equity and right . And Englishmen removing thither must be deemed to carry with them those rights and privileges which belong to them in their native country . 4 1 4 Wheaton , 575 , 576 , 588 . See also 1 Tuck .

The very ground , therefore , assumed by England , as the foundation of its title to America , and the invitations to its own subjects to people it , carry along with them a necessary implication that the plantations , subsequently formed , were to be deemed a part of the ancient dominions ; and the subjects inhabiting them to belong to a common country , and to retain their former rights and privileges . The government , in its public policy and arrangements , as well as in its charters , proclaimed that the colonies were established with a view to extend and enlarge the boundaries of the empire . The colonies , when so formed , became a part of the state equally with its ancient possessions . 1 It is not , therefore , without strong reason , that it has been said that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they had freely placed themselves with the consent of the crown , as they had been in the old , carried with them their birthright , the laws of their country , because the customs of a free people are a part of their liberty ; " and that " the jurisprudence of England became that of the colonies , so far as it was applicable to the situation at which they had newly arrived , because they were Englishmen residing within a distant territory of the empire . " 2 And it may be added , that as there were no other laws to govern them , the territory was necessarily treated as a deserted and unoccupied country , annexed by discovery to the old empire , and composing a. part of it . 3 Moreover , even if it were possible to consider the case as a case of conquest from the Indians , it would not follow , if the natives did not remain there , but deserted it and left it a vacant territory , that the rule as to conquests would continue to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown should choose to found an English colony in such vacant territory , the general principle of settlements in desert countries would govern it . It would cease to be a conquest , and become a colony , and as such be affected by the British laws . This doctrine is laid down with great clearness and force by Lord Mansfield , in his celebrated judgment in Hall v. Campbell . In a still more recent case it 1 Vattel , B. 1 , eh . 18 , $ 209 ; 1 Chalm . Annals , 676 , 677 , 678 , 679 ; 8 Wheat . R. 595 ; Grotius , B. 2 , eh . 9 , 10. 2 1 Chalm .

R. 204 , 211 , 212. /q/ was laid down by Lord Ellenborough that the law of England might properly be recognized by subjects of England in a place occupied temporarily by British troops , who would impliedly carry that law with them . 1 156 . The doctrine of Mr. Justice Blackstone , therefore , may well admit of serious doubt upon general principles . But it is manifestly erroneous , so far as it is applied to the colonies and plantations composing our Union . In the charters under which all these colonies were settled , with a single exception , 2 there is , as has been already seen , an express declaration that all subjects and their children inhabiting therein shall be deemed naturalborn subjects , and shall enjoy all the privileges and immunities thereof . There is also in all of them an express restriction that no laws shall be made repugnant to those of England , or that as near as may be conveniently , they shall be consonant with and conformable thereto ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of England so far as applicable shall be in force there . Now this declaration , even if the crown previously possessed a right to establish what laws it pleased over the territory , as a conquest from the natives , being a fundamental rule of the original settlement of the colonies , and before the emigrations thither , was conclusive , and could not afterwards be abrogated by the crown . It was an irrevocable annexation of the colonies to the mother country , as . dependencies governed by the same laws and entitled to the same rights . 3 157 . And so has been the uniform doctrine in America ever since the settlement of the colonies . The universal principle ( and the practice has conformed to it ) has been , that the common law is our birthright and inheritance , and that our ancestors brought hither with them upon their emigration all of it which was applicable to their situation . The whole structure of our present jurisprudence stands upon the original foundations of the common law . 4 1 Rex v.

It would be a most extraordinary state of things that the common law should be the basis of the jurisprudence of the States originally composing the Union , and yet a government ingrafted upon the existing system should have no jurisprudence at all . If such be the result , there is no guide and no rule for the courts of the United States , or , indeed , for any other department of government , in the exercise of any of the powers confided to them , except so far as Congress has laid , or shall lay , down a rule . In the immense mass of rights and duties , of contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , ( upon which positive legislation has hitherto done little or nothing , ) what is the rule of decision , and interpretation , and restriction ? Suppose the simplest case of contract with the government of the United States , how is it to be construed ? How is it to be enforced ? What are its obligations ? Take an act of Congress , how is it to be interpreted ? Are the rules of the common law to furnish the proper guide , or is every court and department to give it any interpretation it may please , according to its own arbitrary will ? My design is not here to discuss the subject , ( for that would require a volume , ) but rather to suggest some of the difficulties attendant upon it .

" It is clear , " says Mr. Justice McLean , in Wheaton v. Peters , 8 Pet . 658 , " that there can be no common law of the United States . The Federal government is composed of twenty-four sovereign and independent States ; each of which may have its local usages , /z/ customs , and common law . There is no principle which pervades the Union , and has the authority of law , that is not embodied in the Constitution or laws of the Union . The common law could be made a part of our Federal system only by legislative adoption . When , therefore , a common-law right is asserted , we must look to the State in which the controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. United States , 12 Pet . 524 ; Lorman v. Clarke , 2 McLean , 568 . Therefore the United States can not exercise a common-law jurisdiction in criminal cases .

The crown also appointed a council who , besides their legislative authority , were to assist the governor in the discharge of his official duties ; and power was given him to suspend them from office , and in case of vacancies to appoint others , until the pleasure of the crown should be known .

The governors also had power , with the advice of council , to establish courts , and to appoint judges and other magistrates and officers for the province ; to pardon offences , and to remit fines and forfeitures ; to collate to churches and benefices ; to levy military forces for defence ; and to execute martial law in time of invasion , war , and rebellion . 1 Appeals lay to the king in council , from the decisions of the highest courts of judicature of the province , as , indeed , they did from all others of the colonies .

Secondly , proprietary governments . These ( as we have seen ) were granted out by the crown to individuals , in the nature of feudatory principalities , with all the inferior royalties and subordinate powers of legislation which formerly belonged to the owners of counties palatine . 3 Yet still there were these express conditions , that the ends for which the grant was made should be substantially pursued ; and that nothing should be done or attempted which might derogate from the sovereignty of the mother country . In the proprietary government , the governors were appointed by the proprietaries , and legislative assemblies were convened under their authority ; and indeed all the usual prerogatives were exercised which in provincial governments belonged to the crown . 4 Three only existed at the period of the American Revolution , namely , the proprietary governments of Maryland , Pennsylvania , and Delaware . 5 The former had this peculiarity in its character , that its laws were not subject to the supervision and control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision and control were expressly or impliedly provided for . 6 161 .

Their general assemblies , which are their house of commons , together with their council of state , being their upper house , with the concurrence of the king , or his representative the governor , make laws suited to their own emergencies . " This is by no means a just or accurate description of the charter governments . They could not properly be considered as mere civil corporations of the realm , empowered to pass by-laws ; but rather as great political establishments or colonies , possessing the general powers of government and rights of sovereignty , dependent , indeed , and subject to the realm of England , but still possessing within their own territorial limits the general powers of legislation and taxation . 1 The only charter governments existing at the period of the American Revolution were those of Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut . The first charter of Massachusetts might be open to the objection that it provided only for a civil corporation within the realm , and did not justify the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were afterwards exercised upon the removal of that charter to America . And a similar objection might be urged against the charter of the Plymouth colony . But the charter of William and Mary , in 1691 , was obviously upon a broader foundation , and was in the strictest sense a charter for general political government , a constitution for a state , with sovereign powers and prerogatives , and not for a mere municipality . By this last charter the organization of the different departments of the government was , in some respects , similar to that in the provincial governments ; the governor was appointed by the crown ; the council annually chosen by the general assembly ; and the house of representatives by the people . But in Connecticut and Rhode Island , the charter governments were organized altogether upon popular and democratical principles ; the governor , council , and assembly being annually chosen by the freemen of the colony , and all other officers ap- 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 274 , 275 , 293 , 687 ; 1 Tuck .

The circumstances in which the colonies were generally agreed , notwithstanding the diversities of their organization into provincial , proprietary , and charter governments , were the following : 163. ( 1 . ) They enjoyed the rights and privileges of Britishborn subjects , and the benefit of the common laws of England ; and all their laws were required to be not repugnant unto , but as near as might be , agreeable to , the laws and statutes of England . 3 This , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an express clause of all the charters , and could not be transcended without a clear breach of their fundamental conditions . A very liberal exposition of this clause seems , however , always to have prevailed , and to have been acquiesced in , if not adopted , by the crown . Practically speaking , it seems to have been left to the judicial tribunals in the colonies to ascertain what part of the common law was applicable to the situation of the colonies ; 4 and of course , from a difference of interpretation , the common law , as actually administered , was not in any two of the colonies exactly the same . The general foundation of the local jurisprudence was confessedly composed of the same materials ; but in the actual superstructure they were variously combined and modified , so as to present neither a general symmetry of design nor a unity of execution . 164 .

" 2 165 . It was under the consciousness of the full possession of the rights , liberties , and immunities of British subjects , that the colonists in almost all the early legislation of their respective , assemblies insisted upon a declaratory act , acknowledging and confirming them . 3 And for the most part they thus succeeded in obtaining a real and effective Magna Charta of their liberties . The trial by jury in all cases , civil and criminal , was as firmly and as universally established in the colonies as in the mother country . 166. ( 2 . ) In all the colonies local legislatures were established , one branch of which consisted of representatives of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing a negative upon all laws . 4 We have seen that in the original structure of the charters of the early colonies no provision was made for such a legislative body . But accustomed as the colonists had been to possess the rights and privileges of Englishmen , and valuing as they did above all others the right of representation in Parliament , as the only real security for their political and civil liberties , it was easy to foresee that they would not long endure the exercise of any arbitrary power ; and that they would insist upon some share in framing the laws by which they were to be governed . We find accordingly that at an early period 1619 a house of burgesses was forced upon the then proprietors of Virginia . 5 In Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Hamp- 1 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 139 , 140 , 671 , 675 , 684 , 687 ; 1 Tucker 's Black .

Mr. Hutchinson 's remarks are entitled to something more than this brief notice , and a quotation is therefore made of the leading passage . " It is observable that all the colonies before the reign of King Charles the Second , Maryland excepted , settled a model of government for themselves . Virginia had been many years distracted under the government of presidents and governors , with councils , in whose nomination or removal the people had no voice , until in the year 1620 a house of burgesses broke out in the colony ; the king nor the grand council at home not having given any powers or directions for it The governor and assistants of the Massachusetts at first intended to rule the people ; and , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted two or three years only ; and although there is no color for it in the charter , yet a house of deputies appeared suddenly , in 1634 , to the surprise of the magistrates , and the disappointment of their schemes for power . Connecticut soon after followed the plan of the Massachusetts . New Haven , although the people had the highest reverence for their leaders , and for near thirty years in judicial proceedings submitted to the magistracy ( it must , however , be remembered , that it was annually elected ) without a jury ; yet in matters of legislation the people , from the beginning , would have their share by their representatives . New Hampshire combined together under the same form with Massachusetts . Lord Say tempted the principal men of the Massachusetts , to make them and their heirs nobles and absolute governors of a new colony ; but , under this plan , they could find no people to follow them . Barbadoes and the leeward islands , began in 1625 , struggled under governors , and councils , and contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arbitrary sentences of courts-martial , or other acts of violence , as one side or the other happened to prevail . At length , in 1645 , the assembly was called , and no reason given but this , viz. : That , by the grant of the Earl of Carlisle , the inhabitants were to enjoy all the liberties privileges , and franchises of English subjects ; and therefore , as it is also expressly mentioned in the grant , could not legally be bound , or charged by any act without their own consent . This grant , in 1627 , was made by Charles the First , a prince not the most tender of the subjects ' liberties . After the restoration , there is no instance of a colony settled without a representation of the people , nor any attempt to deprive the colonies of this privilege , except in the arbitrary reign of King James the Second . " /q/ mental principle of the compact . But in the provincial governments it was often a matter of debate whether the people had a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privilege enjoyed by the favor and during the pleasure of the crown . The former was the doctrine of the colonists ; the latter was maintained by the crown and its legal advisers . Struggles took place from time to time on this subject in some of the provincial assemblies , and declarations of rights were there drawn up , and rejected by the crown as an invasion of its prerogative . 1 The crown also claimed , as within its exclusive competence , the right to decide what number of representatives should be chosen , and from what places they should come . 2 The provincial assemblies insisted upon an adverse claim . The crown also insisted on the right to continue the legislative assembly for an indefinite period , at its pleasure , without a new election , and to dissolve it in like manner . The latter power was admitted , but the former was most stoutly resisted , as in effect a destruction of the popular right of representation , frequent elections being deemed vital to their political safety , " a right " ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and formidable to tyrants only . " 3 In the colony of New York the crown succeeded at last 1743 4 in establishing septennial assemblies , in imitation of the septennial Parliaments of the parent country , which was a measure so offensive to the people that it constituted one of their grievances propounded at the commencement of the American Revolution . 5 168 . For all the purposes of domestic and internal regulation , the colonial legislatures deemed themselves possessed of entire and exclusive authority . One of the earliest forms in which the spirit of the people exhibited itself on this subject was the constant denial of all power of taxation , except under laws passed by themselves . The propriety of their resistance of the claim of the crown to tax them seems not to have been denied by the most strenuous of their opponents . 6 It was the object of the 1 1 Pitk .

The colonists , with a firmness and public spirit which strikes us with surprise and admiration , claimed for themselves and their posterity a total exemption from all taxation not imposed by their own representatives . A declaration to this effect will be found in some of the earliest of colonial legislation , in that of Plymouth , of Massachusetts , of Virginia , of Maryland , of Rhode Island , of New York , and indeed of most of the other colonies . 1 The general opinion held by them was , that Parliament had no authority to tax them , because they were not represented in Parliament . 2 169 . On the other hand , the statute of 6 Geo. 3 , ch. 12 , contained an express declaration by Parliament that " the colonies and plantations in America have been , are , and of right ought to be , subordinate unto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that the king , with the advice and consent of Parliament , " had , hath , and of right ought to have , full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America in all cases whatsoever . " 3 170 . It does not appear that this declaratory act of 6 Geo. 3 met with any general opposition among those statesmen in England who were most friendly to America . Lord Chatham , in a speech on the 17th of December , 1765 , said : " I assert the authority of this country over the colonies to be sovereign and supreme in every circumstance of government and legislation . But ( he added ) taxation is no part of the governing or legislative power ; taxes are the voluntary grant of the people alone .

See also Marshall on Colon , ch. 13 , p. 353 ; Vaughan , R. 300 , 400 ; 1 Pitkin 's Hist. 123. 4 Mr. Burke has sketched with a most masterly hand the true origin of this resistance to the power of taxation . The passage is so full of his best eloquence , and portrays with such striking fidelity the character of the colonists ' , that , notwithstanding its length , I am tempted to lay it before the reader in this note . " In this character of the Americans , a love of freedom is the predominating feature , which marks and distinguishes the whole ; and as an ardent is always a jealous affection , your colonies become suspicious , restive , and untractable , whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only advantage worth living for . This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in /q/ /z/ Burke , who may justly be deemed the leader of the colonial advocates , maintained the supremacy of Parliament to the full extent the English colonies probably than in any other people of the earth : and this from a great variety of powerful causes ; which , to understand the true temper of their minds , and the direction which this spirit takes , it will not be amiss to lay open somewhat more largely . " First , the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen . England , Sir , is a nation which still , I hope , respects , and formerly adored , her freedom . The colonists emigrated from you , when this part of your character was most predominant ; and they took this bias and direction the moment they parted from your hands . They are therefore not only devoted to liberty , but to liberty according to English ideas , and on English principles . Abstract liberty , like other mere abstractions , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ; and every nation has formed to itself some favorite point , which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happiness . It happened , you know , Sir , that the great contests for freedom in this country were from the earliest times chiefly upon the question of taxing . Most of the contests in the ancient commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magistrates ; or on the balance among the several orders of the state . The question of money was not with them so immediate . But in England it was otherwise . On this point of taxes the ablest pens and most eloquent tongues have been exercised , the greatest spirits have acted and suffered . In order to give the fullest satisfaction concerning the importance of this point , it was not only necessary for those who in argument defended the excellence of the English constitution to insist on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact , and to prove that the right had been acknowledged in ancient parchments and blind usages , to reside in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went much further ; they attempted to prove , and they succeeded , that in theory it ought to be so , from the particular nature of a house of commons , as an immediate representative of the people , whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not . They took infinite pains to inculcate , as a fundamental principle , that in all monarchies the people must in effect themselves mediately or immediately possess the power of granting their own money , or no shadow of liberty could subsist . The colonies draw from you , as with their life-blood , these ideas and principles . Their love of liberty , as with you , fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing . Liberty might be safe , or might be endangered in twenty other particulars , without their being much pleased or alarmed . Here they felt its pulse ; and as they found that beat , they thought themselves sick or sound . I do not say whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own case . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corollaries . The fact is , that they did thus apply those general arguments ; and your mode of governing them , whether through lenity or indolence , through wisdom or mistake , confirmed them in the imagination , that they , as well as you , had an interest in these common principles . " They were further confirmed in this pleasing error by the form of their provincial legislative assemblies . Their governments are popular in an high degree ; some are merely popular ; in all , the popular representative is the most weighty ; and this share of the people in their ordinary government never fails to inspire them with lofty sentiments , and with a strong aversion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief importance . " If anything were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of government , religion would have given it a complete effect . Religion , always a principle of energy , in this new people , is no way worn out or impaired ; and their mode of professing it is /z/ of the declaratory act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 But he deemed the power of taxation in Parliament as an also one main cause of this free spirit . The people are Protestants ; and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion . This is a persuasion not only favorable to liberty , but built upon it . I do not think , Sir , that the reason of this- averseness in the dissenting churches from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be sought in their religious tenets , as in their history . Every one knows that the Roman Catholic religion is at least coeval with most of the governments where it prevails ; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them ; and received great favor and every kind of support from authority . The Church of England , too , was formed from her cradle under the nursing care of regular government . But the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world , and could justify that opposition only on a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim . All Protestantism , even the most cold and passive , is a sort of dissent . But the religion most prevalent in our Northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance ; it is the diffidence of dissent ; and the Protestantism of the Protestant religion . This religion , under a variety of denominations , agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty , is predominant in most of the Northern provinces ; where the Church of England , notwithstanding its legal rights , is in reality no more than a sort of private sect , not composing most probably the tenth of the people . The colonists left England when this spirit was high , and in the emigrants was the highest of all : and even that stream of foreigners , which has been constantly flowing into these colonies , has , for the greatest part , been composed of dissenters from the establishments of their several countries , and have brought with them a temper and character far from alien to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can perceive by their manner , that some gentlemen object to the latitude of this description , because in the Southern colonies the Church of England forms a large body , and has a regular establishment . It is certainly true . There is , however , a circumstance attending these colonies , which , in my opinion , fully counterbalances this difference , and makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those of the northward . It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas they have a vast multitude of slaves . Where this is the case in any part of the world , those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom . Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment , but a kind of rank and privilege . Not seeing there that freedom , as in countries where it is a common blessing , and as broad and general as the air , may be united with much abject toil , with great misery , with all the exterior of servitude , liberty looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not mean , Sir , to commend the superior morality of this sentiment , which has at least as much pride as virtue in it ; but I can not alter the nature of man . The fact is so ; and these people of the Southern colonies are much more strongly , and with an higher and more stubborn spirit , attached to liberty , than those to the northward . Such were all the ancient commonwealths ; such were our Gothic ancestors ; such in our days were the Poles ; and such will be all masters of slaves , who are not slaves themselves . In such a people the haughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of freedom , fortifies it , and renders it invincible . " Permit me , Sir , to add another circumstance in our colonies , which contributes no mean part towards the growth and effect of this untractable spirit . I mean their educa- 1 Burke 's Speech on Taxation of America in 1774 ; Burke 's Speech on Conciliation with America , 22 March , 1775 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1777. /q/ instrument of empire , and not as a means of supply ; and therefore that it should be resorted to only in extreme cases for the tion . In no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study . The profession itself is numerous and powerful , and in most provinces it takes the lead . The greater number of the deputies sent to Congress were lawyers . But all who read and most do read endeavor to obtain some smattering in that science . I have been told by an eminent bookseller , that in no branch of his business , after tracts of popular devotion , were so many books as those on the law exported to the plantations . The colonists have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own use . I hear that they have sold nearly as many of Blackstone 's Commentaries in America as in England . General Gage marks out this disposition very particularly in a letter on your table . He states that all the people in his government are lawyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been enabled , by successful chicane , wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal constitutions . The smartness of debate will say that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legislature , their obligations to obedience , and the penalties of rebellion . All this is mighty well . But my honorable and learned friend the Attorney-General on the floor , who condescends to mark what I say for animadversion , will disdain that ground . He has heard , as well as I , that when great honors and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to the service of the state , it is a formidable adversary to government . If the spirit be not tamed and broken by these happy methods , it is stubborn and litigious . Abeunt studia in mores . This study renders men acute , inquisitive , dexterous , prompt in attack , ready in defence , full of resources . In other countries , the people , more simple and of a less mercurial cast , judge of an ill principle in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , and judge of the pressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle . They augur misgovernment at a distance , and snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze . " The last cause of this disobedient spirit in the colonies is hardly less powerful than the rest , as it is not merely moral , but laid deep in the natural constitution of things . Three thousand miles of ocean lie between you and them . No contrivance can prevent the effect of this distance in weakening government . Seas roll , and months pass , between the order and the execution ; and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point is enough to defeat a whole system . You have , indeed , winged ministers of vengeance , who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remotest verge of the sea . But there a power steps in , that limits the arrogance of raging passions and furious elements , and says , ' So far shalt thou go , and no farther . ' Who are you , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ? Nothing worse happens to you than does to all nations who have extensive empire ; and it happens in all the forms into which empire can be thrown . In large bodies the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremities . Nature has said it . The Turk can not govern Egypt and Arabia and Curdistan as he governs Thrace ; nor has he the same dominion in Crimea and Algiers which he has at Brusa and Smyrna . Despotism itself is obliged to truck and huckster . The Sultan gets such obedience as he can . He governs with a loose rein , that he may govern at all ; and the whole of the force and vigor of his authority in his centre , is derived from a prudent relaxation in all his borders . Spain , in her provinces , is , perhaps , not so well obeyed as you are in yours . She complies too ; she submits ; she watches times . This is the immutable condition , the eternal law , of extensive and detached empire . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent ; of form of government ; of religion in the Northern provinces ; of manners in the Southern ; of education ; of tho /z/ former purposes . With a view to conciliation , another act was passed at a late period , ( in 18 Geo. 3 , ch. 12 , ) which declared that Parliament would not impose any duty or tax on the colonies , except for the regulation of commerce ; and that the net produce of such duty , or tax , should be applied to the use of the colony in which it was levied . But it failed of its object . The spirit of resistance had then become stubborn and uncontrollable . The colonists were awake to a full sense of all their rights , and habit had made them firm , and common sufferings had made them acute , as well as indignant in the vindication of their privileges .

The colonial legislatures , with the restrictions necessarily arising from their dependency on Great Britain , were sovereign within the limits of their respective territories . But there was this difference among them , that in Maryland , Connecticut , and Rhode Island the laws were not required to be sent to the king for his approval ; whereas , in all the other colonies the king possessed the power of abrogating them , and they were not final in their authority until they had passed under his review . 1 In respect to the mode of enacting laws , there were some differences in the organization of the colonial governments . 2 In Connecticut and Rhode Island the governor had no negative upon the laws ; in Pennsylvania the council had no negative , but was merely advisory to the executive ; in Massachusetts the council was chosen by the legislature , and not by the crown , but the governor had a negative on the choice . 172.

No traces are to be found of copyhold , or gavelkind , or burgage tenures . In short , for most purposes , our lands may be deemed to be perfectly allodial , or held of no superior at all , though many of the distinctions of the feudal law have necessarily insinuated themselves into the modes of acquiring , transferring , and transmitting real estates . One of the most remarkable circumstances in our colonial history is the almost total absence of leasehold estates . The erection of manors , with all their attendant privileges , was , indeed , provided for in several of the charters . But it was so little congenial with the feelings , the wants , or the interests of the people , that after their erection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our day are but shadows of the past , the relics of faded grandeur in the last steps of decay , enjoying no privileges , and conferring no power . 173 . In fact , partly from the cheapness of land , and partly from an innate love of independence , few agricultural estates in the whole country have at any time been held on lease for a stipulated rent . The tenants and occupiers are almost universally the proprietors of the soil in fee-simple . The estates of a more limited duration are principally those arising from the acts of the law , such as estates in dower and in curtesy . Strictly speaking , therefore , there has never been in this country a dependent peasantry . The yeomanry are absolute owners of the soil on which they tread , and their character has from this circumstance been marked by a more jealous watchfulness of their rights , and by a more steady spirit of resistance against every encroachment , than can be found among any other people , whose habits and pursuits are less homogeneous and independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by political circumstances . /z/ 174. ( 4 . ) Connected with this state of things , and , indeed , as a natural consequence flowing from it , is the simplicity of the system of conveyances , by which the titles to estates are passed , and the notoriety of the transfers made . From a very early period of their settlement the colonies adopted an almost uniform mode of conveyance of land , at once simple and practicable and safe . The differences are so slight that they became almost evanescent . All lands were conveyed by a deed , commonly in the form of a feoifment , or a bargain and sale , or a lease and release , attested by one or more witnesses , acknowledged or proved before some court or magistrate , and then registered in some public registry . When so executed , acknowledged , and recorded , it had full effect to convey the estate without any livery of seisin , or any other act or ceremony whatsoever . This mode of conveyance prevailed , if not in all , in nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now become absolutely universal . It is hardly possible to measure the beneficial influences upon our titles arising from this source , in point of security , facility of transfer , and marketable value . 175. ( 5 . ) All the colonies considered themselves , not as parcel of the realm of Great Britain , but as dependencies of the British crown , and owing allegiance thereto , the king being their supreme and sovereign lord . 1 In virtue of its general superintendency , the crown constantly claimed and exercised the right of entertaining appeals from the courts of the last resort in the colonies ; and these appeals were heard and finally adjudged by the king in council . 2 This right of appeal was secured by express reservation in most of the colonial charters . It was expressly provided for by an early provincial law in New Hampshire , when the matter in difference exceeded the true value or sum of 300 sterling . So , a like colonial law of Rhode Island was enacted by its local legislature in 1719. 3 It was treated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of any such reservation . 4 And so in divers cases it was held by the courts of England .

Notwithstanding the clearness with which this appellate jurisdiction was asserted , and upheld by the principles of the common law , the exercise of it was not generally assumed until about 1680 ; and it was not then conceded as a matter of right in all the colonies . 2 On the contrary , Massachusetts resisted it under her first charter ( the right of appeal was expressly reserved in that of 1691 ) ; and Rhode Island and Connecticut at first denied it , as inconsistent with , or rather as not provided for , in theirs . 3 Rhode Island soon after surrendered her opposition . 4 But Connecticut continued it to a later period . 5 In a practical sense , however , the appellate jurisdiction of the king in council was in full and undisturbed exercise throughout the colonies at the time of the American Revolution ; and was deemed rather a protection than a grievance . 6 177.

The great question was , whether an appeal or writ of error lay ; and the judges of the supreme court , and the council held , that no appeal lay , for that would be to re-examine facts settled by the verdict of a jury . The lieutenant governor dissented .

Each was independent of all the others ; each , in a limited sense , was sovereign within its own territory . There was neither alliance nor confederacy between them . The assembly of one province could not make laws for another ; nor confer privileges , which were to be enjoyed or exercised in another , further than they could be in any independent foreign state . As colonies , they were also excluded from all connections with foreign states . They were known only as dependencies ; and they followed the fate of the parent country both in peace and war , without having assigned to them , in the intercourse or diplomacy of nations , any distinct or independent existence . 1 They did not possess the power of forming any league or treaty among themselves which should acquire an obligatory force without the assent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often induced them to associate for common purposes of defence , these confederacies were of a casual and temporary nature , and were allowed as an indulgence rather than a right .

But although the colonies were independent of each other in respect to their domestic concerns , they were not wholly alien to each other .

It is plain that the several American States were never fully and in all respects , as regards each other , independent States , as that term is applied in the law of nations . On the contrary , the learned author takes pains to point out that our present government is the successor , with modified powers , of that which formerly possessed authority over them all . Prior to the Revolution , certain powers of government were exercised over all the colonies , either as pertaining to the crown of Great Britain or the Parliament ; but the rightful extent of those powers and how far possessed by the Parliament , and how far resting in the crown , were the questions in dispute which led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of peace and war , and had the general direction of commercial intercourse with other nations , was often formally conceded by the colonies . And the disputes between them and the home government related principally to other matters which the colonists insisted were within the exclusive control of the local legislatures . The tendency among the colonists to establish a more intimate and voluntary union among themselves might form the subject of one of the most interesting chapters in American history . The New England Confederacy of 1643 , the temporary Congress of 1690 , the plan of Union agreed upon in the Convention of 1754 , the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 , and finally the Continental Congress of 1774 , were all the offspring of a desire among the scattered colonies of Great Britain in America to strengthen and extend the common ties for their mutual safety and protection . To all this the jealousy of the home government constituted a serious impediment , but the difficulty in reaching an arrangement as to the proper measure of authority to be conceded to any proposed confederacy or congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Convention of 1754 is particularly instructive . See Mr. Everett upon its work , N. A. Rev. , Vol . XXXVIII. p. 73 , et seq . At last the colonies , by formal declaration , threw off allegiance to the crown ; but even then they did not cease to have a common national head , for it was through the revolutionary Congress that independence was declared , and that body had already , by common consent , taken upon itself those powers of external control which before had been conceded to the crown or the Parliament , together with such others as the emergency seemed to call for . Those powers being undefined , the Congress as a national authority could answer a temporary purpose only , but what was done thereafter , in establishing the Articles of Confederation , and then in substituting for these the work of the Convention of 1787 , was not for the purpose of creating for the first time a common authority for States before wholly independent of each other , but was done by way of modifying , defining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered some of the particulars in which the political organization and public rights and juridical policy of the colonies were nearly similar , it remains to notice a few in which there were important differences . ( 1 . ) As to the course of descents and distribution of intestate estates . And here the policy of different colonies was in a great measure determined by the nature of their original governments and local positions . All the Southern colonies , including Virginia , adhered to the course of descents at the common law ( as we have had occasion to see ) down to the American Revolution . As a natural consequence , real property was in these colonies generally held in large masses by the families of ancient proprietors ; the younger branches were in a great measure dependent upon the eldest ; and the latter assumed and supported somewhat of the pre-eminence which belonged to baronial possessions in the parent country . Virginia was so tenacious of entails , that she would not even endure the barring of them by the common means of fines and recoveries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of descents under the government of the crown , as royal provinces . On the other hand , all New England , with the exception of Rhode Island , from a very early period of their settlements , adopted the rule of dividing the inheritance equally among all the children , and other next of kin , giving a double share to the eldest son . Maryland , after 1715 , and Pennsylvania almost from its settlement , in like manner distributed the inheritance among all the children and other next of kin . New Hampshire , although a royal province , steadily clung to the system of Massachusetts , which she had received when she formed an integral part of the latter . But Rhode Island retained ( as we have already seen ) its attachment to the common-law rule of descents down almost to the era of the American Revolution . 1 and enduring an existing authority , through which alone they were known in the family of nations . " The Union , " it is said in the inaugural address of President Lincoln , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact by the Articles of Association of 1774 . It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence of 1776 . It was further matured , and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the Articles of Confederation in 1778 , and finally , in 1787 , one of the declared objects in ordaining and establishing the Constitution was ' to form a more perfect Union . ' " For a brief account of the Colonial Confederacies , the reader is referred to Mr. Towle 's Analysis of the Constitution , p. 298 , et seq. i To 1770 , Gardner v. Collins , 2 Peters 's Sup . Ct . B. 58. /q/ 180 . In all the colonies , where the rule of partible inheritance prevailed , estates were soon parcelled out into moderate plantations and farms ; and the general equality of property introduced habits of industry and economy , the effects of which are still visible in their local customs , institutions , and public policy . The philosophical mind can scarcely fail to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the apportionment of property among the mass of a nation and the popular form of its government . The former can scarcely fail , first or last , to introduce the substance of a republic into the actual administration of the government , though its forms do not bear such an external impress . Our Revolutionary statesmen were not insensible to this silent but potent influence ; and the fact , that at the present time the law of divisible inheritances pervades the Union , is a strong proof of the general sense , not merely of its equity , but of its political importance . 181 . A very curious question was at one time l agitated before the king in council , upon an appeal from Connecticut , how far the statutes of descents and distributions , dividing the estate among all the children , was conformable to the charter of that colony , which required the laws to be " not contrary to the laws of the realm of England . " It was upon that occasion decided , that the law of descents , giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real estate , was repugnant to the charter , and therefore void . This determination created great alarm , not only in Connecticut , but elsewhere ; since it might cut deep into the legislation of the other colonies , and disturb the foundation of many titles . The decree of the council , annulling the law , was upon the urgent application of some of the colonial agents revoked , and the law reinstated with its obligatory force . 2 At a still later period the same question seems to have been presented in a somewhat different shape for the consideration of the law-officers of the crown ; and it may now be gathered as the rule of construction , that even in a colony , to which the benefit of the laws of England is expressly extended , the law of descents of England is not to be deemed as necessarily in force there , if it is inapplicable to their situation ; or at least , that a change of it is not beyond the general competency of the colonial legislature . 3 /z/ 182. ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong tendency of the colonies to make lands liable to the payment of debts . In some of them , indeed , the English rule prevailed of making lands liable only to an extent upon an elegit . But in by far " the greatest number , lands were liable to be set off upon appraisement , or sold for the payment of debts . And lands were also assets , in cases of a deficiency of personal property , to be applied in the course of administration to discharge the debts of the party deceased . This was a natural result of the condition of the people in a new country , who possessed little moneyed capital , whose wants were numerous , and whose desire of credit was correspondently great . The true policy in such a state of things was to make land , in some degree , a substitute for money , by giving it all the facilities of transfer , and all the prompt applicability of personal property . It will be found that the growth of the respective colonies was in no small degree affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly , that undue priorities in payment of debts were given to the inhabitants of the colony over all other creditors ; and that occasional obstructions were thrown in the way of collecting debts . 1 But the evil was not general in its operation ; and the policy , wherever it was pursued , retarded the growth and stinted the means of the settlements . For the purpose , however , of giving greater security to creditors , as well as for a more easy recovery of debts due in the plantations and colonies in America , the statute of 5 Geo. 2 , ch. 7 1782 , among other things declared , that all houses , lands , negroes , and other hereditaments and real estates in the plantations should be liable to , and chargeable with , the debts of the proprietor , and be assets for the satisfaction thereof , in like manner as real estates are by the law of England liable to the satisfaction of debts due by bond or other specialty , and shall be subject to like remedies in courts of law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposing of the same , toward satisfaction of such debts , in like manner as personal estates in any of such plantations are seized , extended , sold , or disposed of , for satisfaction of debts . This act does not seem to have been resisted on the part of any of the colonies to whom it peculiarly applied . 2 183 . In respect to the political relations of the colonies with 1 1 Chalm . Annals , 692 , 693. 2 Telfair v. Stead , 2 Cranch , 407. /q/ the parent country , it is not easy to state the exact limits of the dependency which was admitted , and the extent of sovereignty which might be lawfully exercised over them , either by the crown or by Parliament . In regard to the crown , all of the colonies admitted that they owed allegiance to the king , as their sovereign liege lord , though the nature of the powers which he might exercise , as sovereign , were still undefined . 1 184 . In the silence of express declarations we may resort to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an exact , at least a comprehensive view of the claims of the royal prerogative over the colonial establishments . They considered it not necessary to maintain that all the royal prerogatives exercisable in England were of course exercisable in the colonies , but only such fundamental rights and principles as constituted the basis of the throne and its authority , and without which the king would cease to be sovereign in all his dominions . Hence the attributes of sovereignty , perfection , perpetuity , and irresponsibility , which were inherent in the political capacity of the king , belonged to him in all the territories subject to the crown , whatever was the nature of their laws and government in other respects . Everywhere he was the head of the Church and the fountain of justice ; everywhere he was entitled to a share in the legislation ( except where he had expressly renounced it ) ; everywhere he was generalissimo of all forces , and entitled to make peace or war . But minor prerogatives might be yielded , where they were inconsistent with the laws or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the people . In every question that respected the royal prerogatives in the colonies , where they were not of a strictly fundamental nature , the first thing to be considered was , whether the charter of the particular colony contained any express provision on the subject . If it did , that was the guide . If it was silent , then the royal prerogatives were in the colony precisely the same as in the parent country ; for in such cases the common law of England was the common law of the colonies for such purposes . Hence , if the colonial charter contained no peculiar grant to the contrary , the king might erect courts of justice and exchequer therein ; and the colonial judicatories , in point of law , were deemed to emanate from the crown , under the modifications made by the colonial assemblies under their charters . The king also 1 Marshall 's Colon , ch. 13 , p. 353 ; 3 Wilson 's Works , 236 , 237 , 238 , 241 , 242 , 243. /z/ might extend the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might control , and enter a nolle prosequi in criminal prosecutions , and pardon crimes , and release forfeitures . He might present to vacant benefices ; and he was entitled to royal moneys , treasure-trove , escheats , and forfeitures . No colonial assemblies had a right to enact laws , except with the assent of the crown by charter , or commission , or otherwise ; and if they exceeded the authority prescribed by the crown , their acts were void . The king might alter the constitution and form of the government of the colony , where there was no charter or other confirmatory act by the colonial assembly , with the assent of the crown ; and it rested merely on the instructions and commissions given , from time to time , by the crown to its governors . The king had power also to vest in the royal governors in the colonies , from time to time , such of his prerogatives as he should please ; such as the power to prorogue , adjourn , and dissolve the colonial assemblies ; to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as captain-general of the public forces , to appoint public officers , to act as chancellor and supreme ordinary , to sit in the highest court of appeals and errors , to exercise the duties of vice-admiral , and to grant commissions to privateers . These last , and some other of the prerogatives of the king , were commonly exercised by the royal governors without objection . 185 . The colonial assemblies were not considered as standing on the same footing as Parliament in respect to rights , powers , and privileges ; but as deriving all their energies from the crown , and limited by the respective charters , or other confirmatory acts of the crown , in all their proceedings . The king might , in respect to a colonial assembly , assent to an act of assembly before it met , or ratify it , or dissent from it , after the session was closed . He might accept a surrender of a colonial charter , subject to the rights of third persons previously acquired , and give the colony a new charter or otherwise institute therein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even contended that the king might , in cases of extraordinary necessity or emergency , take away a charter , where the defence or protection of the inhabitants required it , leaving them in possession of their civil rights . 186 . Such are some of the royal prerogatives which were supposed to exist by the crown-writers in the colonial establishments , when not restrained by any positive charter or bill of rights . /q/ Of these , many were undisputed ; but others were resisted with pertinacity and effect in the colonial assemblies . 1 1ST . In regard to the authority of Parliament to enact laws which should be binding upon them , there was quite as much obscurity and still more jealousy spreading over the whole subject . 2 The government of Great Britain always maintained the doctrine that the Parliament had authority to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever . 3 No acts of Parliament , however , were understood to bind the colonies , unless expressly named therein . 4 But in America , at different times and in different colonies , different opinions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be the policy of the colonies as much as possible to withdraw themselves from any acknowledgment of such authority , except so far as their necessities , from time to time , compelled them to acquiesce in the parliamentary measures expressly extending to them . We have already seen that they resisted the imposition of taxes upon them without the consent of their local legislatures , from a very early period . 6 188 . But it was by no means an uncommon opinion in some of the colonies , especially in the proprietary and charter governments , that no act of Parliament whatsoever could bind them without their own consent . 7 An extreme reluctance was shown by Massachusetts to any parliamentary interference as early as 1640 ; 8 and the famous Navigation Acts of 1651 and 1660 were perpetually evaded , even when their authority was no longer denied , throughout the whole of New England . 9 Massachusetts , in 1 The reader will find the subject of the royal prerogative in the colonies discussed at large in Chitty on the Prerogatives of the Crown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Constitution of the Colonies , passim ; in Chalmers 's Annals of the Colonies ; and in Chalmers 's Opinions , 2 vols. passim .

There is not a member of the General Court , and we know no inhabitant within the bounds of the government , that ever questioned this authority .

Perhaps the best general summary of the rights and liberties asserted by all the colonies is contained in the celebrated declaration drawn up by the Congress of the Nine Colonies assembled at New York , in October , 1765. 3 That declaration asserted that the colonists " owe the same allegiance to the crown of Great Britain that is owing from his subjects born within the realm , and all due subordination to that august body , the Parliament of Great Britain . " That the colonists " are entitled to all the inherent rights and liberties of his the king 's natural-born subjects within the kingdom of Great Britain .

That the only representatives of these colonies are persons chosen therein by themselves ; and that no taxes ever have been , or can be , constitutionally imposed upon them , but by their respective legislatures . That all supplies of the crown being free gifts from the people , it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the principles and spirit of the British Constitution for the people of Great Britain to grant to his Majesty the property of the colonies . And that the trial by jury is the inherent and invaluable right of every British subject in these colonies . " 4 191 . We here observe that the superintending authority of 1 1 Pitk .

" 2 And they contended that there is a vast difference between the exercise of parliamentary jurisdiction in general acts for the amendment of the common law , or even in general regulations of trade and commerce through the empire , and the actual exercise of that jurisdiction in levying external and internal duties and taxes on the colonists , while they neither are , nor can be , represented in Parliament . " 3 And in the petition of the same body to the House of Commons , there is the following declaration : " We most sincerely recognize our allegiance to the crown , and acknowledge all due subordination to the Parliament of Great Britain , and shall always retain the most grateful sense of their assistance and protection . " * But it is added , there is " a material distinction in reason and sound policy between the necessary exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law , and the regulation of trade and commerce through the whole empire , and the exercise of that jurisdiction by imposing taxes on the colonies " ; 5 thus admitting the former to be rightful , while denying the latter . 6 192 . But after the passage of the Stamp Act , in 1765 , many of the colonies began to examine this subject with more care , and to entertain very different opinions as to parliamentary authority . 1 Marsh .

Doubts were soon infused into their minds , and from doubts they passed by an easy transition to a denial , first , of the power of taxation , and next , of all authority whatever to bind them by its laws . 1 One of the most distinguished of our writers 2 during the contest admits that he entered upon the inquiry " with a view and expectation of being able to trace some constitutional line between those cases in which we ought , and those in which we ought not , to acknowledge the power of Parliament over us . In the prosecution of his inquiries , he became fully convinced that such a line does not exist ; and that there can be no medium between acknowledging and denying that power in all cases . " 193 . If other colonies did not immediately arrive at the same conclusion , it was easy to foresee that the struggle would ultimately be maintained upon the general ground ; and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of independence , would gradually bring all the colonies to feel the absolute necessity of adhering to it , as their truest and safest defence . 3 In 1773 , Massachusetts found no difficulty in contending in the broadest terms for an unlimited independence of Parliament ; and in a bold and decided tone denied all its power of legislation over them . A distinction was taken between subjection to Parliament , and allegiance to the crown . The latter was admitted ; but the former was resolutely opposed . 4 It is remarkable that the Declaration of Independence , which sets forth our grievances in such warm and glowing colors , does not once mention Parliament , or allude to our connection with it ; but treats the acts of oppression therein referred to as acts of the king , in combination " with others " for the overthrow of our liberties . 5 1 1 Jefferson 's Corresp. 6 , 7 , 12 , 104 to 116. 2 3 Wilson 's Works , 203 ; Mass .

The colonies generally did not , however , at this period concur in these doctrines of Massachusetts , and some difficulties arose among them in the discussions on this subject .

Botta 's American War , b. 4. 2 As this document is very important , and not easily found , the material clauses will be here extracted . After reciting many acts of grievance , the Declaration proceeds as follows : " The good people of the several colonies of New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , Connecticut , New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , and South Carolina , justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of Parliament and administration , have severally elected , constituted , and appointed deputies to meet and sit in general congress , in the city of Philadelphia , in order to obtain such establishment , as that their religion , laws , and liberties may not be subverted : Whereupon the deputies so appointed being now assembled , in a full and free representation of these colonies , taking into their most serious consideration the best means of attaining the ends aforesaid , do in the first place , as Englishmen , their ancestors , in like cases have usually done , for asserting and vindicating their rights and liberties , DECLARE , " That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North America , by the immutable laws of nature , the principles of the English constitution , and the several charters or compacts have the following EIGHTS .

The principal grounds on which Parliament asserted the right to make laws to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever were , that the colonies were originally established under charters from the crown ; that the territories were dependencies of the realm , and the crown could not by its grants exempt them from the supreme legislative power of Parliament , which extended wherever the sovereignty of the crown extended ; that the colonists in their elusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures , where their right of representation can alone be preserved , in all cases of taxation and internal polity , subject only to the negative of their sovereign , in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed . But from the necessity of the case , and a regard to the mutual interests of both countries , we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British Parliament as are bona fide restrained to the regulation of our external commerce , for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluding every idea of taxation , internal or external , for raising a revenue on the subjects in America without their consent .

That these , his Majesty 's colonies , are likewise entitled to all the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters , or secured by their several codes of provincial laws .

It is indispensably necessary to good government , and rendered essential by the English Constitution , that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent of each other ; that , therefore , the exercise of legislative power in several colonies , by a council appointed , during pleasure , by the crown , is unconstitutional , dangerous , and destructive to the freedom of American legislation . " All and each of which the aforesaid deputies , in behalf of themselves and their constituents , do claim , demand , and insist on , as their indubitable rights and liberties , which can not be legally taken from them , altered , or abridged by any power whatever , without their own consent , by their representatives in their several provincial legislatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York in 1775 explicitly admits , " that from the necessity of the case Great Britain should regulate the trade of the whole empire for the general benefit of the whole , but not for the separate benefit of any particular part .

The Stamp Act was repealed ; but within a few years afterwards duties of another sort were laid , the object of which was to raise a revenue from importations into the colonies . These of course became as offensive to the colonies as the prior attempt at internal taxation , and were resisted upon the same grounds of unconstitutionality. 3 It soon became obvious that the great struggle in respect to colonial and parliamentary rights could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain was resolutely bent upon enforcing her claims by an open exercise of military power ; and , on the other hand , America scarcely saw any other choice left to her but unconditional submission or bold and unmeasured resistance . 1 1 Pitk .

WE have now completed our survey of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period of the Revolution . We have examined the more important coincidences and differences in their forms of government , in their laws , and in their political institutions . We have presented a general outline of their actual relations with the parent country ; of the rights which they claimed ; of the dependence which they admitted ; and of the controversies which existed at this period , in respect to sovereign powers and prerogatives on one side , and colonial rights and liberties on the other . 199 . We are next to proceed to a historical review of the origin of that union of the colonies which led to the declaration of independence ; of the effects of that event , and of the subsequent war upon the political character and rights of the colonies ; of the formation and adoption of the Articles of Confederation ; of the sovereign powers antecedently exercised by the continental congress ; of the powers delegated by the confederation to the general government ; of the causes of the decline and fall of the confederation ; and finally , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having disposed of these interesting and important topics , we shall then be prepared to enter upon the examination of the details of that Constitution , which has justly been deemed one of the most profound efforts of human wisdom , and which ( it is believed ) will awaken our admiration , /z/ and warm our affections more and more , as its excellences are unfolded in a minute and careful survey . 200 . No redress of grievances having followed upon the many appeals made to the king and to Parliament , by and in behalf of the colonies , either conjointly or separately , it became obvious to them that a closer union and co-operation were necessary to vindicate their rights and protect their liberties . If a resort to arms should be indispensable , it was impossible to hope for success but in united efforts . If peaceable redress was to be sought , it was as clear that the voice of the colonies must be heard , and their power felt in a national organization . In 1774 , Massachusetts recommended the assembling of a continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and according to her recommendation , delegates were appointed by the colonies for a congress to be held in Philadelphia in the autumn of the same year . In some of the legislatures of the colonies , which were then in session , delegates were appointed by the popular or representative branch ; and in other cases they were appointed by conventions of the people in the colonies . 1 The congress of delegates ( calling themselves in their more formal acts " the delegates appointed by the good people of these colonies " ) assembled on the 4th of September , 1774 ; 2 and having chosen officers , they adopted certain fundamental rules for their proceedings . 201 . Thus was organized under the auspices and with the consent of the people , acting directly in their primary , sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries , to whom the ordinary powers of government were delegated in the colonies , the first general or national government , which has been very aptly called " the revolutionary government , ' * since in its origin and progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress thus assembled , exercised de facto and de jure a sovereign authority ; not as the delegated agents of the governments de facto of the colonies , but in virtue of original powers derived from the people . The revolutionary government , thus formed , terminated only when it was regularly superseded by the confederated government under the articles finally ratified , as we shall hereafter see , in 1781. 4 1 1 Journ. of Cong . 2 , 3 , &c.; 27 , 45 ; 9 Dane 's Abridg .

The first and most important of their acts was a declaration that in determining questions in this congress , each colony or province should have one vote ; and this became the established course during the Revolution . 1 They proposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May in the next year . They appointed committees to take into consideration their rights and grievances .

" 2 They adopted a declaration of rights , not differing in substance from that of the congress of 1765 , 3 and affirming that the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England , and the benefit of such English statutes as existed at the time of their colonization , and which they have by experience respectively found to be applicable to their local and other circumstances . They also , in behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of association , containing an agreement of nonimportation , non-exportation , and non-consumption , in order to carry into effect the preceding resolves : and also an agreement to discontinue the slave-trade . They also adopted addresses to the people of England , to the neighboring British colonies , and to the king , explaining their grievances , and requesting aid and redress . 203 . In May , 1775 , a second congress of delegates met from all the States . 4 These delegates were chosen , as the preceding had been , partly by the popular branch of the State legislatures , when in session , but principally by conventions of the people in the various States . 5 In a few instances the choice by the legisla- 1 Equality of representation and authority was also insisted upon by the weaker colonies in the confederacy of 1643 , and was the principal source of the controversies which arose to weaken its efficiency .

They prohibited the receipt and negotiation of any British government bills , and the supply of any provisions or necessaries for the British army and navy in Massachusetts , or transports in their service . 3 They recommended to Massachusetts to consider the offices of governor and lieutenant governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council by the representatives in assembly , by whom the powers of government should be exercised , until a governor of the king 's appointment should consent to govern the colony according to its charter .

They had previously authorized certain military measures , and especially the arming of the militia of New York , and the occupation of Crown Point and Ticonderoga . They authorized the emission of two millions of dollars in bills of credit , pledging the colonies to the redemption thereof . They framed rules for the government of the army . They published a solemn declaration of the causes of their taking up arms , an address to the king , entreating a change of measures , and an address to the people of Great Britain , requesting their aid , and admonishing them of the threatening evils of a separation .

They authorized the exportation and importation of all goods to and from foreign countries , not subject to Great Britain , with certain exceptions , and prohibited the importation of slaves , and declared a forfeiture of all prohibited goods . 5 They recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of the colonies , where no government sufficient to the exigencies had been established , to adopt such government as in the opinion of the representatives should best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular , and America in general , and adopted a preamble which stated " that the exercise of every kind of authority under the crown of Great Britain should be totally suppressed .

These minute details have been given , not merely because they present an historical view of the actual and slow progress towards independence , but because they give rise to several very important considerations respecting the political rights and sovereignty of the several colonies , and of the union which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies . 207 . In the first place , antecedent to the Declaration of Independence none of the colonies were , or pretended to be , sovereign states , in the sense in which the term " sovereign " is sometimes applied to states . 2 The term " sovereign " or " sovereignty " is used in different senses , which often leads to a confusion of ideas , and sometimes to very mischievous and unfounded conclusions . By " sovereignty " in its largest sense is meant supreme , absolute , uncontrollable power , the jus summi imperii ? the absolute right to govern . A state or nation is a body politic , or society of men , united together for the purpose of promoting their mutual safety and advantage by their combined strength . 4 By the very act of civil and political association , each citizen subjects himself to the authority of the whole ; and the authority of all over each member essentially belongs to the body politic. 5 A state which pos- 1 Journals of Congress of 1776 , p. 207. 2 3 Dall. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abridg .

It may be exercised by the people at large , as in a pure democracy ; or by a select few ? as in an absolute aristocracy ; or by a single person , as in an absolute monarchy . 2 But " sovereignty " is often used in a far more limited sense than that of which we have spoken , to designate such political powers as in the actual organization of the particular state or nation are to be exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any superior authority . It is in this sense that Blackstone employs it , when he says that it is of " the very essence of a law that it is made by the supreme power . Sovereignty and legislature are , indeed , convertible terms ; one can not subsist without the other . " 3 Now , in every limited government the power of legislation is , or at least may be , limited at the will of the nation ; and therefore the legislature is not in an absolute sense sovereign . It is in the same sense that Blackstone says , " the law ascribes to the king of England the attribute of sovereignty or pre-eminence , " 4 because , in respect to the powers confided to him , he is dependent on no man , accountable to no man , and subjected to no superior jurisdiction . Yet the king of England can not make a law ; and his acts , beyond the powers assigned to him by the Constitution , are utterly void . 208 . In like manner the word " state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged sense it means the people composing a particular nation or community . In this sense the state means the whole people , united into one body politic ; and the state and the people of the state are equivalent expressions . 5 Mr. Justice Wilson , in his Law Lectures , uses the word " state " in its broadest sense . " In free states , " says he , " the people form an artificial person , or body politic , the highest and noblest that can be known . They form that moral person , which in one of my 1 2 Dall. 456 , 457 , per Wilson , J. 2 Vattel , B. 1 , ch. 1 , 2 , 3. 3 1 Bl . Comm. 46 . See also 1 Tucker 's Black . Comm .

To this moral person we assign , by way of eminence , the dignified appellation of STATE . " 2 But there is a more limited sense in which the word is often used , where it expresses merely the positive or actual organization of the legislative , executive , or judicial powers . 3 Thus , the actual government of a state is frequently designated by the name of the state . We say , the state has power to do this or that ; the state has passed a law , or prohibited an act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that purpose , have power to do the act , or have passed the law , or prohibited the particular action . The sovereignty of a nation or state , considered with reference to its association , as a body politic , may be absolute and uncontrollable in all respects , except the limitations which it chooses to impose upon itselfA But the sovereignty of the government organized within the state may be of a very limited nature . It may extend to few or to many objects . It may be unlimited as to some , it may be restrained as to others . To the extent of the power given , the government may be sovereign , and its acts may be deemed the sovereign acts of the state . Nay , the state , by which we mean the people composing the state , may divide its sovereign powers among various functionaries , and each in the limited sense would be sovereign in respect to the powers confided to each , and dependent in all other cases . 5 Strictly speaking , in our republican forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the nation ; and the 1 1 Wilson 's Lect. 304 , 305. 2 2 Wilson 's Lect. 120 , 121. 8 Mr. Madison , in his elaborate report in the Virginia legislature in January , 1800 , adverts to the different senses in which the word " state " is used . He says , " It is indeed true , that the term ' states ' is sometimes used in a vague sense , and sometimes in different senses , according to the subject to which it is applied . Thus it sometimes means the separate sections of territory occupied by the political societies within each ; sometimes the particular governments established by those societies ; sometimes those societies , as organized into those particular governments ; and lastly , it means the people composing those political societies , in their highest sovereign capacity . " 4 2 Dall. 433 , Iredell , J. ; Id . 455 , 456 , per Wilson , J. 5 3 Dall. 93 , per Iredell , J. ; 2 Dall. 455 , 457 , per Wilson , J. /q/ residuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its public functionaries , is in the people of the State . 1 209 . There is another mode in which we speak of a state as sovereign , and that is in reference to foreign states . Whatever may be the internal organization of the government of any state , if it has the sole power of governing itself and is not dependent upon any foreign state , it is called a sovereign state ; that is , it is a state having the same rights , privileges , and powers as other independent states . It is in this sense that the term is generally used in treatises and discussions on the law of nations . A full consideration of this subject will more properly find place in some future page . 2 210 . Now it is apparent that none of the colonies before the Revolution were , in the most large and general sense , independent or sovereign communities . They were all originally settled under , and subjected to , the British crown . 3 Their powers and authorities were derived from , and limited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of these charters controlled their legislation by prohibiting them from making laws repugnant or contrary to those of England .

Adams , in his oration on the 4th of July , 1831 , published after the preparation of these Commentaries , uses the following language : " It is not true that there must reside in all governments an absolute , uncontrollable , irresistible , and despotic power ; nor is such power in any manner essential to sovereignty . Uncontrollable power exists in no government on earth . The sternest despotisms in any region and in every age of the world are and have been under perpetual control . Unlimited power belongs not to man ; and rotten will be the foundation of every government leaning upon such a maxim for its support . Least of all can it be predicated of a government professing to be founded upon an original compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , existing in every government somewhere , is incompatible with the first principles of natural right . " ' 2 Dr. Hush , in a political communication , 1786 , uses the term " sovereignty " in another and somewhat more limited sense . He says , " The people of America have mistaken the meaning of the word ' sovereignty/ Hence each State pretends to be sovereign . In Europe it is applied to those states which possess the power of making war and peace , of forming treaties , and the like . As this power belongs only to Congress , they are the only sovereign power in the United States . We commit a similar mistake in our ideas of the word ' independent . ' No individual State , as such , has any claim to independence . She is independent only in a union with her sister States in Congress . " 1 Amer . Museum , 8 , 9 .

They denied all power of taxation , except by their own colonial legislatures ; but at the same time they admitted themselves bound by acts of the British Parliament for the regulation of external commerce , so as to secure the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country , and the commercial benefits of its respective members . 2 So far as respects foreign states , the colonies were not , in the sense of the laws of nations , sovereign states , but mere dependencies of Great Britain . They could make no treaty , declare no war , send no ambassadors , regulate no intercourse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereigns , in the negotiations usual between independent states . In respect to each other , they stood in the common relation of British subjects ; the legislation of neither could be controlled by any other ; but there was a common subjection to the British crown . 3 If in any sense they might claim the attributes of sovereignty , it was only in that subordinate sense to which we have alluded as exercising within a limited extent certain usual powers of sovereignty . They did not even affect to claim a local allegiance . 4 211 . In the next place , the colonies did not severally act for themselves , and proclaim their own independence . It is true , that some of the States had previously formed incipient governments for themselves ; but it was done in compliance with the recommendations of Congress . 5 Virginia , on the 29th of June , 1776 , by a convention of delegates , declared " the government of this country , as formerly exercised under the crown of Great Britain , totally dissolved " ; and proceeded to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Colonies , p. 483 ; Journals of Congress , 1774 , p. 29. 2 Journal of Congress , 1774 , p. 27 , 29 , 38 , 39 ; 1775 , p. 152 , 156 ; Marshall 's Hist , of Colonies , ch. 14 , p. 412 , 483. 3 1 Chalmers 's Annals , 686 , 687 ; 2 Dall. 470 , per Jay , C.

New Hampshire also formed a government in December , 1775 , which was manifestly intended to be temporary , " during ( as they said ) the unhappy and unnatural contest with Great Britain . " x New Jersey , too , established a frame of government on the 2d of July , 1776 ; but it was expressly declared that it should be void upon a reconciliation with Great Britain . 2 And South Carolina , in March , 1776 , adopted a constitution of government ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accommodation between Great Britain and America could be obtained . " 3 But the declaration of independence of all the colonies was the united act of all . It was " a declaration by the representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled " ; " by the delegates appointed by the good people of the colonies , " as in a prior declaration of rights they were called . 4 It was not an act done by the State governments then organized , nor by persons chosen by them . It was emphatically the act of the whole people of the united colonies , by the instrumentality of their representatives , chosen for that among other purposes . 6 It was not an act competent to the State governments , or any of them , as organized under their charters , to adopt . Those charters neither contemplated the case nor provided for it . It was an act of original , inherent sovereignty by the people themselves , resulting from their right to change the form of government , and to institute a new one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Independence treats it . No State had presumed of itself to form a new government , or to provide for the exigencies of the times , without consulting Congress on the subject ; and when any acted , it was in pursuance of the recommendation of Congress . It was , therefore , the achievement of the whole for the benefit of the whole . The people of the united colonies made the united colonies free and independent States , and absolved them from all allegiance to the British crown . The Declaration of Independence has accordingly always been treated as an act of paramount and sovereign authority , complete and perfect per se , and ipso facto working an entire dissolution of all political connection with , and allegiance to , Great /z/ Britain . And this , not merely as a practical fact , but in a legal and constitutional view of the matter by courts of justice . 1 212 . In the debates in the South Carolina legislature , in January , 1788 , respecting the propriety of calling a convention of the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the following language : " This admirable manifesto ( that is , the Declaration of Independence ) sufficiently refutes the doctrine of the individual sovereignty and independence of the several States .

' The separate independence and individual sovereignty of the several States were never thought of by the enlightened band of patriots who framed this declaration . The several States are not even mentioned by name in any part , as if it was intended to impress the maxim on America that our freedom and independence arose from our union , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us then consider all attempts to weaken this union , by maintaining that each State is separately and individually independent , as a species of political heresy , which can never benefit us , but may bring on us the most serious distresses.

Mr. Adams , in his oration on the 4th of July , 1831 , which is valuable for its views of constitutional principles , insists upon the same doctrine at considerable length . Though it has been published since the original preparation of these lectures , I gladly avail myself of an opportunity to use his authority in corroboration of the same views . " The union of the colonies had preceded this declaration of independence , and even the commencement of the war . The declaration was joint , that the united colonies were free and independent States , but not that any one of them was a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Declaration of Independence was a social compact , by which the whole people covenanted with each citizen , and each citizen with the whole people , that the united colonies were , and of right ought to be , free and independent States . To this compact , union was as vital as freedom or independence . The Declaration of Independence announced the severance of the thirteen united colonies from the rest of the British Empire , and the existence of their people , from that day forth , as an independent nation . The people of all the colonies , speaking by their rep213. /q/ In the next place , we have seen that the power to do this act was not derived from the State governments , nor was it done generally witli their co-operation . The question then naturally presents itself , if it is to be considered as a national act , in what manner did the colonies become a nation , and in what manner did Congress become possessed of this national power ? The true answer must be , that as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature national , to that extent the people , from whose acquiescence and consent they took effect , must be considered as agreeing to form a nation . 1 The Congress of 1774 , looking at the general terms of the commissions under which the delegates were appointed , seem to have possessed the power of concerting such measures as they deemed best to redress the grievances and preserve the rights and liberties of all the colonies . Their duties seem to have been principally of an advisory nature ; but the exigencies of the times led them rather to follow out the wishes and objects of their constituents , than scrupulously to examine the words in which their authority was communicated . 2 The Congress of 1775 and 1776 were clothed with more ample powers , and the language of their commissions generally was sufficiently broad to embrace the right to pass measures of a national character and obligation . The caution necessary at that period of the Revolutionary struggle rendered that language more guarded than the objects really in view would justify ; but it was foreseen that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further a general union and resistance against the British claims . The Congress of 1775 accordingly assumed at once ( as we have seen ) the exercise of some of the highest functions of sovereignty . They took measures for national defence and resistance ; they followed up the prohibitions upon trade and intercourse with Great Britain ; they raised a national army and navy , and authorized limited national hostilities against Great Britain ; they raised money , emitted bills of credit , and contracted debts upon national account ; they established a national resentatives , constituted themselves one moral person before the face of their fellowmen . The Declaration of Independence was not a declaration of liberty merely acquired , nor was it a form of government . The people of the colonies were already free , and their forms of government were various . They were all colonies of a monarchy . The king of Great Britain was their common sovereign . " /z/ post-office ; and finally they authorized captures and condemnation of prizes in prize courts , with a reserve of appellate jurisdiction to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took bolder steps , and exerted powers which could in no other manner be justified or accounted for , than upon the supposition that a national union for national purposes already existed , and that the Congress was invested with sovereign power over all the colonies for the purpose of preserving the common rights and liberties , of all . They accordingly authorized general hostilities against the persons and property of British subjects ; they opened an extensive commerce with foreign countries , regulating the whole subject of imports and exports ; they authorized the formation of new governments in the colonies ; and finally they exercised the sovereign prerogative of dissolving the allegiance of all colonies to the British crown . The validity of these acts was never doubted or denied by the people . On the contrary , they became the foundation upon which the superstructure of the liberties and independence of the United States has been erected . Whatever , then , may be the theories of ingenious men on the subject , it is historically true that before the declaration of independence these colonies were not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event did not find them or make them such ; but that at the moment of their separation they were under the dominion of a superior controlling national government whose powers were vested in and exercised by the general Congress with the consent of the people of all the States . 1 215 . From the moment of the declaration of independence , if not for most purposes at an antecedent period , the united colonies must be considered as being a nation de facto , having a gen- 1 This whole subject is very amply discussed by Mr. Dane in his Appendix to the ninth volume of his Abridgment of the Laws ; and many of his views coincide with those stated in the text . The whole of that Appendix is worthy of the perusal of every constitutional lawyer , even though he might differ from some of the conclusions of the learned author . He will there find much reasoning from documentary evidence of a public nature , which has not hitherto been presented in a condensed or accurate shape . Some interesting views of this subject are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 4th of May , 1822 , appended to his Message respecting the Cumberland Road . See , especially , pages 8 and 9 . When Mr. Chief Justice Marshall , in Ogden v. Gibbons , ( 9 Wheat . B. 187 , ) admits that the States , before the formation of the Constitution , were sovereign and independent , and were connected with each other only by a league , it is manifest that he uses the word " sovereign " in a very restricted sense . Under the confederation there were many limitations upon the powers of the States . /q/ eral government over it , created and acting by the general consent of the people of all the colonies . The powers of that government were not , and indeed could not be , well defined . But still its exclusive sovereignty , in many cases , was firmly established ; and its controlling power over the States was in most , if not in all , national measures universally admitted . 1 The Articles of Confederation , of which we shall have occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress until November , 1777 ; 2 they were not signed or ratified by any of the States until July , 1778 ; and they were not ratified , so as to become obligatory upon all the States , until March , 1781 . In the intermediate time , Congress continued to exercise the powers of a general government , whose acts were binding on all the States . And though they constantly admitted the States to be " sovereign and independent communities/ ' 3 yet it must be obvious that the terms were used in the subordinate and limited sense already alluded to ; for it was impossible to use them in any other sense , since a majority of the States could by their public acts in Congress control and bind the minority . Among the exclusive powers exercised by Congress were the power to declare war and make peace ; to authorize captures ; to institute appellate prize courts ; to direct and control all national , military , and naval operations ; to form alliances and make treaties ; to contract debts , and issue bills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were politically known as the United States only ; and it was in our national capacity , as such , that we sent and received ambassadors , entered into treaties and alliances , and were admitted into the general community of nations , who might exercise the right of belligerents , and claim an equality of sovereign powers and prerogatives. 4 216 . In confirmation of these views , it may not be without use to refer to the opinions of some of our most eminent judges , delivered on occasions which required an exact examination of the subject . In Chisholm 's Executors v. The State of Georgia ? Mr. Chief Justice Jay , who was equally distinguished as a Revolution- 1 See Penhallow v. Doane , 3 Ball . B. 54 ; Ware v.

Museum , 15 ; 1 Kent , Comm. 197 , 198 , 199. /z/ ary statesman and a general jurist , expressed himself to the following effect : " The Revolution , or rather the declaration of independence , found the people already united for general purposes , and at the same time providing for their more domestic concerns by State conventions and other temporary arrangements . From the crown of Great Britain the sovereignty of their country passed to the people of it ; and it was then not an uncommon opinion , that the unappropriated lands which belonged to that crown passed , not to the people of the colony or States within whose limits they were situated , but to the whole people . On whatever principle this opinion rested , it did not give way to the other ; and thirteen sovereignties were considered as emerging from the principles of the Revolution , combined by local convenience and considerations . The people , nevertheless , continued to consider themselves , in a national point of view , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their national concerns accordingly . " In Penhallow v. Doane ? Mr. Justice Patterson ( who was also a Revolutionary statesman ) said , speaking of the period before the ratification of the confederation : " The powers of Congress were revolutionary in their nature , arising out of events adequate to every national emergency , and coextensive with the object to be attained . Congress was the general , supreme , and controlling council of the nation , the centre of force , and the sun of the political system . Congress raised armies , fitted out a navy , and prescribed rules for their government , fec. , &c.; These high acts of sovereignty were submitted to , acquiesced in , and approved of by the people of America , &c.,; &c.; The danger being imminent and common , it became necessary for the people or colonies to coalesce and act in concert , in order to divert or break the violence of the gathering storm . They accordingly grew into union , and formed one great political body , of which Congress was the directing principle and soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individually , were not known nor recognized as sovereign by foreign nations , nor are they now . The States collectively under Congress , as their connecting point or head , were acknowledged by foreign powers as sovereign , particularly in that acceptation of the term which is applicable to all great national concerns , and in the exercise of which other sovereigns would be more immediately interested . " In Ware v. Hylton ? Mr. Justice Chase ( himself also a i 3 Dall. 54. 2 3 Dall. 199. /q/ Revolutionary statesman ) said : " It has been inquired , what powers Congress possessed from the first meeting in September , 1774 , until the ratification of the confederation on the 1st of March , 1781 . It appears to me that the powers of Congress during that whole period were derived from the people they represented , expressly given through the medium of their State conventions or State legislatures ; or that after they were exercised , they were impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people , &c.; The powers of Congress originated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only limited by events ; or , in other words , they were revolutionary in their nature . Their extent depended on the exigencies and necessities of public affairs . I entertain this general idea , that the several States retained all internal sovereignty ; and that Congress properly possessed the rights of external sovereignty . In deciding on the powers of Congress , and of the several States before the confederation , I see but one safe rule , namely , that all the powers actually exercised by Congress before that period were rightfully exercised on the presumption not to be controverted , that they were so authorized by the people they represented , by an express or implied grant ; and that all the powers exercised by the State conventions or State legislatures were also rightfully exercised on the same presumption of authority from the people . " J 217 . In respect to the powers of the Continental Congress exercised before the adoption of the Articles of Confederation , few questions were judiciously discussed during the Revolutionary contest ; for men had not leisure in the heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arma silent leges . The people , relying on the wisdom and patriotism of Congress , silently acquiesced in whatever authority they assumed . But soon after the organization of the present government , the question was most elaborately discussed before the Supreme Court of the United States , in a case calling for an exposition of the appellate jurisdiction of Congress in prize causes before the ratification of the confederation . 2 The 1 See also 1 Kent , Comm .

And that the actual powers exercised by Congress , in respect to national objects , furnisfied the best exposition of its constitutional authority , since they emanated from the representatives as the people , and were acquiesced in by the people . /q/ /z/ 218 .

It was obvious to reflecting minds that such a future separation of the States into absolute , independent communities , with no mutual ties or controlling national government , would be fraught with the most imminent dangers to their common safety and peace , and expose them not only to the chance of reconquest by Great Britain , after such separation in detached contests , but also to all the hazards of internal warfare and civil dissensions . So that those who had stood side by side in the common cause against Great Britain might then , by the intrigues of their enemies and the jealousies always incident to neighboring nations , become instruments in the hands of the ambitious abroad or the corrupt at home , to aid in the mutual destruction of each other ; and thus all successively fall the victims of a foreign or domestic tyranny .

It is a mortifying truth , that if the possession of power sometimes leads to mischievous abuses , the absence of it also sometimes produces a political debility , quite as ruinous in its consequences to the great objects of civil government . 221 .

On the llth of June , 1776 , the same day on which the committee for preparing the Declaration of Independence was appointed , Congress resolved that " a committee be appointed to prepare and digest the form of a confederation to be entered into between these colonies " ; and on the next day a committee was accordingly appointed , consisting of a member from each colony . 2 Nearly a year before this period , ( viz. on the 21st of July , 1775 , ) Dr. Franklin had submitted to Congress a sketch of articles of confederation , which does not , however , appear to have been acted 1 The first volume of the United States Laws , published by Bioren and Duane , contains a summary view of the proceedings in Congress for the establishment of the confederation , and also of the convention for the establishment of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given at large in the first volume of the Secret Journals , published by Congress in 1821 , p. 283 et seq . 2 Journals of 1776 , p. 207. /q/ on .

On the 12th of July , 1776 , the committee appointed to prepare Articles of Confederation presented a draft , 1 which was in the handwriting of Mr. Dickenson , one of the committee , and a delegate from Pennsylvania . The draft , so reported , was debated from the 22d to the 31st of July , and on several days between the 5th and 20th of August , 1776 . On this last day Congress , in committee of the whole , reported a new draft , which was ordered to be printed for the use of the members . 2 224 . The subject seems not again to have been touched until the 8th of April , 1777 , and the articles were debated at several times between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . On this last day the articles were reported with sundry amendments , and finally adopted by Congress . A committee was then appointed to draft , and they accordingly drafted a circular letter , requesting the States respectively to authorize their delegates in Congress to subscribe the same in behalf of the State . The committee remark in that letter " that to form a permanent union , accommodated to the opinions and wishes of the delegates of so many States , differing in habits , produce , commerce , and internal police , was found to be a work which nothing but time and reflection , conspiring with a disposition to conciliate , could mature and accomplish . Hardly is it to be expected that any plan , in the variety of provisions essential to our union , should exactly correspond with the maxims and political views of every particular State . Let it be remarked , that after the most careful inquiry and the fullest information , this is proposed , as the best which could be adapted to the circumstances of all , and as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Permit us , then , ( add the committee , ) earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective States . Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining , in one general system , the various sentiments and interests of a continent , divided into so 1 The draft of Dr. Franklin , and this draft , understood to be by Mr. Dickenson , were never printed until the publication of the Secret Journals by order of Congress in 1821 , where they will be found under pages 283 and 290. /z/ many sovereign and independent communities , under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength , to maintain and defend our common liberties . Let them be examined with a liberality becoming brethren and fellow-citizens , surrounded by the same imminent dangers , contending for the same illustrious prize , and deeply interested in being forever bound and connected together by ties the most intimate and indissoluble . And , finally , let them be adjusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , while they are concerned for the prosperity of their own more immediate circle , are capable of rising superior to local attachments , when they may be incompatible with the safety , happiness , , and glory of the general confederacy. " 225 . Such was the strong and eloquent appeal made to the States . It carried , however , very slowly , conviction to the minds of the local legislatures . Many objections were stated , and many amendments were proposed . All of them , however , were rejected by Congress , not probably because they were all deemed inexpedient or improper in themselves , but from the danger of sending the instrument back again to all the States for reconsideration . Accordingly , on the 26th of June , 1778 , a copy , engrossed for ratification , was prepared , and the ratification begun on the 9th day of July following . It was ratified by all the States , except Delaware and Maryland , in 1778 ; by Delaware in 1779 , and by Maryland on the 1st of March , 1781 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and * was joyfully announced by Congress . /z/ 226 . In reviewing the objections taken by the various States to the adoption of the confederation in the form in which it was presented to them , at least so far as those objections can be gathered from the official acts of those States , or their delegates in Congress , some of them will appear to be founded upon a desire for verbal amendments conducing to greater accuracy and certainty ; and some of them upon considerations of a more large and important bearing upon the interests of the States respectively , or of the Union . 2 Among the latter were the objections taken and alterations proposed in respect to the apportionment of taxes , and of the quota of public forces to be raised among the States , 1 Secret Journals , 401 , 418 , 423 , 424 , 426 ; 3 Kent 's Comm. 196 , 197. 2 2 Pitk . Hist. ch. 11 , p. 19 to 36 ; 1 Kent 's Comm. 197 , 198. /q/ by Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jealousy of the power to keep up a standing army in time of peace . 2 227 . But that which seemed to be of paramount importance , and which , indeed , protracted the ratification of the confederation to so late a period , was the alarming controversy in respect to the boundaries of some of the States and the public lands held by the crown within those reputed boundaries . On the one hand , the great States contended that each of them had an exclusive title to all the lands of the crown within its boundaries ; and these boundaries , by the claims under some of the charters , extended to the South Sea , or to an indefinite extent into the uncultivated western wilderness . On the other hand , the other States as strenuously contended that the territory , unsettled at the commencement of the war , and claimed by the British crown , which was ceded to it by the treaty of Paris of 1763 , if wrested from the common enemy by the blood and treasure of the thirteen States , ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of Congress for the general good . 3 Rhode Island , Delaware , New Jersey , and Maryland insisted upon some provision for establishing the western boundaries of the States , and for the recognition of the unsettled western territory as the property of the Union . 228 . The subject was one of a perpetually recurring interest and irritation , and threatened a dissolution of the confederacy . New York , at length , in February , 1780 , passed an act authorizing a surrender of a part of the western territory claimed by her . Congress embraced the opportunity , thus afforded , to address the States on the subject of ceding the territory , reminding them " how indispensably necessary it is to establish the Federal Union on a fixed and permanent basis , and on principles acceptable to all its respective members ; how essential to public credit and confidence , to the support of our army , to the vigor of our councils , and the success of our measures ; to our tranquillity at home , our reputation abroad ; to our very existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They recommended , with earnestness , a cession of the western territory ; and at the same time they as earnestly recommended to Maryland to subscribe the 1 Secret Journals , 371 , 373 , 376 , 378 , 381 ; 2 Pitk . Hist. ch. 11 , p. 19 to 32. /z/ Articles of Confederation . 1 A cession was accordingly made by the delegates of New York on the 1st of March , 1781 , the very day on which Maryland acceded to the confederation . Virginia had previously acted upon the recommendation of Congress ; and by subsequent cessions from her , and from the States of Massachusetts , Connecticut , South Carolina , and Georgia , at still later periods , this great source of national dissension was at last dried up .

See Hildreth , Hist of U. S. III . 398. /q/ /z/ 229 . IN pursuance of the design already announced , it is now proposed to give an analysis of the Articles of Confederation , or , as they are denominated in the instrument itself , the " Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States , " as they were finally adopted by the thirteen States in 1781. 230 . The style of the confederacy was by the first article declared to be " The United States of America . " The second article declared that each State retained its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right which was not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled . The third article declared that the States severally entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their common defence , the security of their liberties , and their mutual and general welfare , binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them , or any of them , on account of religion , sovereignty , trade , or any other pretence whatever . The fourth article declared that the free inhabitants of each of the States ( vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted ) should be entitled to all the privileges of free citizens in the several States ; that the people of each State should have free ingress and regress to and from any other State , and should enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce , subject to the same duties and restrictions as the inhabitants ; that fugitives from justice should , upon demand of the executive of the State from which they fled , be delivered up ; and that full faith and credit should be given in each of the States , to the records , acts , and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other State . 231 . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next article ( 5th ) provided for the organization of a general Congress , declaring that delegates should be chosen in such manner as the legislature of each State should direct , to meet in Congress on the first Monday in every year , with a power /z/ reserved to each State , to recall any or all of the delegates , and to send others in their stead . No State was to be represented in Congress by less than two nor more than seven members . No delegate was eligible for more than three , in any term of six years ; and no delegate was capable of holding any office of emolu ment under the United States . Each State was to maintain its own delegates , and in determining questions in Congress was to have one vote . Freedom of speech and debate in Congress was not to be impeached or questioned in any other place ; and the members were to be protected from arrest and imprisonment during the time of their going to and from , and attendance on Congress , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 232 . By subsequent articles Congress was invested with the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war , unless in case of an invasion of a State by enemies , or an imminent danger of an invasion by Indians ; of sending and receiving ambassadors ; entering into treaties and alliances , under certain limitations , as to treaties of commerce ; l of establishing rules for deciding all cases of capture on land and water , and for the division and appropriation of prizes taken by the land or naval forces in the service of the United States ; of granting letters of marque and reprisal in times of peace ; of appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas ; and of establishing courts for receiving and finally determining appeals in all cases of captures. 233 . Congress was also invested with power to decide in the last resort , on appeal , all disputes and differences between two or more States concerning boundary , jurisdiction , or any other cause whatsoever ; and the mode of exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private right of soil , claimed under different grants of two or more States before the settlement of their jurisdiction , were to be finally determined in the same manner , upon the petition of either of the grantees . But no State was to be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States . 234 . Congress was also invested with the sole and exclusive 1 " No treaty of commerce shall be made , whereby the legislative power of the States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners as their own people are subjected to , or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever .
