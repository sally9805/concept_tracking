txt /z/ SOME years have elapsed , since I formed the design of composing a general History of Nature , in imitation of Aristotle , Pliny , Chancellor Bacon , and several illustrious modern authors . The field appeared to me so vast , that I could not believe the possibility of its being entirely preoccupied . Nature invites to the cultivation of herself , persons of every age and country ; especially those who , like myself , pause at every step they advance , transported at the beauty of her divine productions . In Nature herself alone , we must expect to find the laws of Nature ; and we plunge into difficulty and distress , only in proportion as we deviate from those laws . I proposed , therefore , to begin my Work , when I had ceased from observing , and collected all the materials necessary to a History of Nature ; but I found myself in the condition of the child , who , with a shell , had dug a hole in the sand , to hold the water of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a human being , limited on every side . Not only her general history , but that of the smallest plant , far transcends my highest powers . Permit me to relate , on what account I became sensible of this . One day , in summer , while busied in the arrangement of some observations which I had made , respecting the harmonies discoverable in this globe of ours , I perceived , on a strawberry plant , accidentally placed in my window , some small winged insects , so very beautiful that I took a fancy to describe them . Next day a different sort appeared , which I proceeded likewise to describe . In the course of three weeks , no less than thirty-seven species , totally distinct , had i isited my strawberry plant ; at length they came in such /z/ crowds , and presented such variety , that I was constrained to relinquish the amusement for want of leisure , and , to say the truth , for want of expression . However minute these objects may be , they surely merited my attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I refuse them a place in my general history , when she had given them one in the system of the Universe For a still stronger reason , had I written the history of my strawberry plant , I must have given some account of the insects attached to it . Plants are the habitation of insects ; and it is impossible to give the history of a city , without saying something of its inhabitants . Besides , my strawberry plant was not in its natural situation , in the open country , on the border of a wood , or by the brink of a rivulet , where it could have been frequented by many other species of living creatures . It was confined to an earthen pot , amidst the smoke of Paris , and I observed it only at vacant moments . I knew nothing of the insects which visited it during the course of the day ; still less of those which might come only in the night , attracted by simple emanations , or perhaps , by a phosphoric light , which escapes our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might frequent it , at other seasons of the year , and of the endless other relations which it might have with reptiles , with amphibious animals , fishes , birds , quadrupeds , and , above all , with man , who undervalues every thing which he can not convert to his own use . But it was not sufficient to observe it , from the heights ot my greatness , if I may use the expression ; for in this case , my knowledge would have been greatly inferior to that of one of the insects , who made it their habitation . Not one of them , on examining it with his little spherical eyes , but must have distinguished an infinite variety of objects , which I could not perceive without the assistance of a microscope , and after much laborious research . Nay , their eyes are inconceivably superior even to this instrument ; for it shews us objects only which are in its focus , that is at the distance of a few lines ; whereas they perceive , by a mechanism of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which are far off . Their eyes , therefore , are at once microscopes and telescopes . Besides , by their circular disposition round the head , they have the advantage of viewing the whole /q/ circuit of the heavens at the same instant , while those of the astronomer can take in , at most , but the half . My winged insects , accordingly , must discern in the strawberry plant , at a single glance , an arrangement and combination of parts , which , assisted by the microscope , I can observe only separate from each other , and in succession . On examining the leaves of this vegetable , with the aid of a lens which had but a small magnifying power , I found them divided into compartments , hedged round with bristles , separated by canals , and strewed with glands . These compartmenis appeared similar to large verdant enclosures , their bristles to vegetables of a particular order ; of which some were upright , some inclined , some forked , some hollowed into tubes , from the extremity of which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their glands , seemed full of a brilliant liquor . In plants of a different species , these bristles , and these canals , exhibit forms , colours , and fluids , entirely different . There are even glands , which resemble basons , round , square , or radiated . Now , Nature has made nothing in vain . Wherever she has prepared a habitation , she immediately peoples it . She is never straitened for want of room . She has placed animals , furnished with fins , in a single drop of water , and in such multitudes , that Leewenhoek , the natural philosopher , reckoned up to thousands of them . Many others after him , and among the rest Robert Hook , have seen , in one drop of water , as small as a grain of millet , some 10 , others 20 , and some as far as 45 thousand . Those who know not how far the patience and sagacity of an observer can go , might , perhaps , call in question the accuracy of these observations , if Lyonnet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ii . chap . 3 , had not demonstrated the possibility of it , by a piece of mechanism abundantly simple . We are certain , at least , of the existence of those beings whose different figures have actually been drawn . Others are found , whose feet are armed with claws , on the body of the fly , and even on that of the flea . It is credible , then , from analogy , that there are animals feeding on the leaves of plants , like the cattle in our meadows , and on our mountains ; which repose under the shade of a down imperceptible to the naked eye , and which , from goblets formed like so many suns , quaff nectar of the colour /z/ of gold and silver . Each part of the flower must present to them a spectacle of which we can form no idea . The yellow anthers of flowers , suspended by fillets of white , exhibit to their eyes double rafters of gold in equilibrio , on pillars fairer than ivory ; the corolla , an arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topaz ; rivers of nectar and honey ; the other parts of the flowret , cups , urns , pavilions , domes , which the human architect and goldsmith have not yet learned to imitate . I do not speak thus from conjecture ; for having examined one day , by the microscope , the flowers of thyme , I distinguished in them , with equal surprise and delight , superb flagons , with a long neck , of a substance resembling amethyst , from the gullets of which seemed to flow ingots of liquid gold . I have never made observation of the corolla simply , of the smallest flower , without finding it composed of an admirable substance , half transparent , studded with brilliants , and shining in the most lively colours . The beings which live under a reflex thus enriched , must have ideas very different from ours , of light , and of the other phenomena of Nature . A drop of dew , filtering in the capillary and transparent tubes of a plant , presents to them thousands of cascades ; the same drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its prickles , an ocean without a shore ; evaporating into air , a vast aerial sea . In these ephemerous beings , we must find the youth of a single morning , and the decrepitude of one day . If they possess historical monuments , they must have their months , years , ages , epochs , proportioned to the duration of a flower . Thus , in proportion as man brings the elements of Nature near him , the principles of science disappear . Such , therefore , must have been my strawberry plant , and its natural inhabitants , in the eyes of the winged insects , which had alighted to visit it ; but supposing I had been able to acquire , with them , an intimate knowledge of this new world , I should still have arrived no farther than at the history of the genus , and not that of the species . The varieties would still have remained unknown , which have each its particular character , according as they have flowers single , in pairs , or disposed in clusters ; according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fruit ; according to the size , the figure , the edging , the smoothness , or the downy clothing of /q/ their leaves . One of our most celebrated botanists , Sebastian le Vaillant , author of Botanicon Parisiense , has found , in the environs of Paris alone , five distinct species , three which bear flowers , without producing fruit . In our gardens , we cultivate at least twelve different sorts of foreign strawberries ; but how many varieties are there , to us totally unknown ! Has not every degree of latitude a species peculiar to itself 1 Bearing in mind , therefore , that all species , varieties , analogies , affinities , have , in every particular latitude , necessary relations with a multitude of animals , and that these relations are altogether unknown to us , we shall find , that a complete history of the strawberry-plant would be ample employment for all the naturalists in the world . What a task then , would it be , to write the history , in like manner , of all the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The celebrated Linnaeus reckoned up from seven to eight thousand of them ; but he had not travelled . The famous Sherard , it is said , was acquainted with sixteen thousand . Another botanist swells his catalogue up to twenty thousand . Finally , one still more modem , boasts of having himself made a collection of twentyfive thousand ; and he estimates the number of those which he has not seen , at four or five times as many . But all these enumerations must be extremely defective , if it is considered , as has been remarked by this last observei himself , that we know little or nothing of the interior of Africa ; of that of the three Arabias , and even of the two Americas ; very little of New Guinea , New Holland , and New Zealand , and of the innumerable islands of the South Sea , the greatest part of which are themselves still undiscovered . We know hardly any thing of the isle of Ceylon , except a little of the coast ; and of the great island of Madagascar ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of almost all the Asiatic islands . As to that vast Continent , with the exception of some great roads in the interior , and some part of the coast resorted to by the traffic of Europe , we may affirm that it is wholly unknown to us . How many immense districts are there in Tartary , in Siberia , and even in many of the kingdoms of Europe , where the foot of botanist never trod ! Some , indeed , have given us a herbal of Malabar , Japan , China , &c.; but if we reflect , that , in these countries , their researches never penetrated be- /z/ yond the sea-coast , and were generally confined to one season of the year , when a part only of the plants , peculiar to each climate , appear ; that they have visited only the narrow regions adjoining to our European factories ; that they have never dared to plunge into deserts , where they could have found neither subsistence nor guide ; nor ventured themselves among the numerous tribes of barbarous nations , whose language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude , that their boasted collections , however valuable , are still extremely defective . In order to be convinced of this , we have only to compare the time employed by them , in making their collections of plants in foreign countries , with that which it cost Le Vaillant to collect those of the vicinity of Paris only . The learned Tournefort made botany a particular study ; and , after a master so indefatigable , Le Vaillant had the courage to retrace the same ground , and discovered so many distinct species , overlooked by Tournefort , that he doubled , at least , the catalogue of our plants . He made it amount to fifteen or sixteen hundred ; not including in this enumeration those which differ only in the colour of the flowers , and the spots of the leaves , though Nature frequently employs such signs as these in the vegetable world , to distinguish the species , and to form their true characters . Sebastian le Vaillant , accordingly , employed no less than twenty-six whole years , in his own country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botanical description of the plants of a few square leagues ; whereas the persons who pretend to give us the botany of many foreign countries , were alone and unassisted , and despatched the business in a few months . But , though his sagacity and perseverance seem to have left us nothing more to wish for , I have my doubts , whether he has made a complete collection of all the gifts which Flora scatters over our plains ; and whether he has seen , if I may use the expression , to the bottom of the basket . For my own part , if I might be permitted to hazard a conjecture , respecting the number of distinct species of plants , spread over the earth , such is my idea of the immensity of Nature , and of her subdivisions , that I am disposed to believe , there is not a square league of earth but what presents some one plant peculiar to itself , or , at the least , which thrives there /q/ better , and appears more beautiful , than in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primordial species of vegetables amount to several millions , diffused over as many millions of square leagues , of which the surface of our globe consists . The farther south we advance , the more their variety increases within spaces of the same dimension . The isle of Otaheite , in the South Sea , was found to have a botany peculiar to itself , and which had nothing in common with that of the places in Africa and America , situated in the same latitude ; nay , totally different from that of the adjacent islands . And if we reflect , that each plant has several different names , in its own country ; that every nation imposes particular denominations , and that all these names , at least the greater part , are varying every age , what difficulties does not the vocabulary alone oppose to the study of botany . All these preliminary notions , however , would still form only an useless science , did we even know , in the most complete detail , all the parts of which plants are composed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants , their port , their elegance , the harmonies which they form , when grouped , or in contrast with each other , which it would be interesting to determine . I do not know that any thing has been so much as attempted on this subject . As to their virtues , it may be affirmed , that they are for the most part unknown , neglected , or abused . Their qualities are frequently perverted , in making cruel experiments on innocent animals , while they might be usefully employed as miraculous remedies , to counteract the ills of human life . We have preserved , for example , in the Royal Cabinet at Paris , arrows more formidable than those of Hercules , though dipped in the blood of the snake of Lerna . Their points are impregnated with the juice of a plant so venomous , that , though exposed to the air for many years , they can , with the slightest puncture , destroy the most robust of animals in a few minutes . The blood of the creature , be the wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , at the same instant , is made to swallow a small quantity of sugar , the circulation is immediately restored . Both the poison and the antidote have been discovered by the savages who inhabit the banks of the Amazon ; and it is of importance to observe , that they never employ in war , but only in the chase , this murderous method of destroying life . /z/ Wherefore do not we , who pretend to so much humanity and illumination , endeavour to ascertain by experiment , whether this poison might not be rendered medicinal , in cases of a sudden dissolution of the blood ; and sugar , in cases of sudden coagulation Alas ! how is it to be expected that we should apply to the preservation of mankind the malignant and destructive qualities of a foreign vegetable , we who are continually abusing , for mutual destruction , the precious gifts which Nature has bestowed , ' in the view of rendering human life innocent and happy 1 The elm and the beech , under the shade of which our shepherds and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for mounting the thundering artillery . We intoxicate our soldiers into madness , that they may kill each other , without hatred , with that very juice of the vine which Providence has given to be the means of reconciliation among enemies . The lofty fir-trees , planted by the benignant hand of Nature , amidst the snows of the north , to shelter and warm the inhabitants , are converted into masts , for the vessels of Europe , to carry the flames of devouring fire against the peaceful inhabitants of the southern hemisphere ; and the canvass , designed for the humble clothing of the village maid , becomes a sail for the plundering corsair , to extend his ravages to remotest India . Our crops and our forests are wafted over the ocean , to spread desolation over both the Old and New Worlds . But let us drop the history of Man , and resume that of Nature . If , from the vegetable , we make a transition to the animal kingdom , a field of incomparably greater extent presents itself . An intelligent naturalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in possession of more than thirty thousand distinct species of animals . I know not whether the King 's magnificent Cabinet may not contain more ; but I know well , that his herbals contain only eighteen thousand plants , and that about six thousand are in a state of cultivation in the Royal Botanic Garden . This number of animals , however , so superior to that of vegetables , is a mere nothing , in comparison with what exists on the globe . When we recollect , that every species of plant is a point of union for different genera of insects , and that there is not , perhaps , a single one , but which has , peculiar to itself , a species of fly , butterfly , gnat , beetle , lady-bird , snail , and the like ; that these insects serve for food to other species , and /q/ these too exceedingly numerous , such as the spider , the dragon-fly , the ant , the formicalea ; and to the immense families of small birds , of which many classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other kind of nourishment ; that these birds are , in their turn , devoured by birds of prey , such as kites , falcons , buzzards , rooks , crows , hawks , vultures , and others ; that the general spoil of these animals , swept off by the rains , into the rivers , and thence to the sea , becomes the aliment , of almost innumerable tribes of fishes , to the greatest part of which the naturalists of Europe have not hitherto given a name ; that numberless legions of river and sea-fowls prey upon these fishes ; we shall have good ground for believing , that every species of the vegetable kingdom serves as a basis to many species of the animal kingdom , which multiply around it , as the rays of a circle round its centre . At the same time , I have not included in this superficial representation , either quadrupeds , with which all the intervals of magnitude are filled , from the mouse , which lives under the grass , up to the camelopard , who can feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen feet ; or reptiles ; or polypuses , of which we have a knowledge so slender ; or sea insects , some families of which , such as the crab-fish , shrimp , and the like , would be alone sufficient to fill the greatest cabinets , were you to introduce ! but a single individual of every species . I do not include the madrepore , with which the bottom of the sea is paved between the tropics , and which present so many different species , that I have seen , in the Isle of France , two great halls filled with those which were produced in the immediate vicinity of that isle , though there was but a single specimen of each sort . I have made no mention of insects of many kinds , as the louse and the maggot , of which every animal species has its particular varieties , proper to itself , and which triple , at least , the kingdom of creatures existing by respiration . Neither have I taken into the account , that infinite number of living things , visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed determination , and which Nature has scattered about , through the air , over the earth , and along the depths of the ocean . What an undertaking , then , would it be , to describe each of these beings , with the sagacity of a Reaumur 1 The life /z/ of one man of genius would be scarcely sufficient to compose the history of a few insects . However curious may be the memoirs transmitted to us , respecting the manners , and the anatomy , of the animals most familiarly known , in vain do we still flatter ourselves with having acquired a complete acquaintance . The principal requisite , in my opinion , is yet wanting ; I mean , the origin of their friendships and of their feuds . In this consists , if I am not mistaken , the essence of their history , to which must be referred their instincts , their loves , their wars ; the attire , the arms , and the very form which Nature gives them . I know not of any naturalist who has engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain these wonderful and innate instincts , by their ingenious fictions . The swallow Progne flies the forest ; her sister Philomela delights to sing in solitary places . Progne thus , one day , addresses her : Why waste such sweetness on the desert air ? Come , charm the city with thy tuneful note ; Think too , in solitude , that form so fair Felt violation : flee the horrid thought . Ah ! sister dear , sad Philomel replies , ' T is this that makes me shun the haunte of men : Tereus and Courts the anguish 'd heart allies , And hastes , for shelter , to the woods again . I never hear the enchantingly melancholy song of a nightingale , shrouded in shrubbery , and the lengthened pioupiou , which interrupt , like sighs , the music of that solitary warbler , without believing , that Nature had revealed her adventure to the sublime La Fontaine , at the time she inspired him to compose these verses . Philosophers of name , unfaithful to the testimony of their reason and conscience , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them blind instincts , which regulate all their actions , without passion , without will , without choice , and even without any degree of sensibility . I expressed my astonishment one day to J. J. Rousseau , that men of genius should maintain a position so extravagant . He very sagely replied , " The solution is this , When man begins to reason , he ceases to feel . " In order to confute the opinions of such philosophers , I shall have recourse , not to those animals whose sagacity and industry excite our admiration , such as the beaver , the bee , /q/ the ant , and such like . I shall produce only one example , taken from the class of those which are most indocile , namely fishes , and shall select it from among a species , governed by an instinct the most impetuous and the most stupid , that of gluttony . The shark is so voracious , that he will not only devour his own species , when pressed by hunger , but swallows , without distinction , every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cloth , pitch , wood , iron , nay , even knives . Nevertheless , I have witnessed his abstinence , in two remarkable circumstances ; the one is , however urged by famine , he never touches a kind of small fish , speckled with yellow and black , called the pilot-fish , which swims just before his snout , to guide him to his prey , which he can not see till he is close to it ; for Nature , as a counterbalance to the ferocity of this fish , has rendered him almost blind . The other case is this , when you throw into the sea a dead fowl , the noise brings him to the spot , but on discovering it to be a fowl , he immediately retires , without devouring it : this has furnished sailors with a proverb , ' The shark flies from the feather . ' It is impossible , in the first case , not to ascribe to him some portion of understanding , which represses his voracity , in favour of his guide ; and not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , to that universal reason , which , destining him to live along the shallows , where cadaverous substances , of creatures perishing in the sea , fall and are deposited , inspires him with an aversion for feathered animals , that he may not destroy the sea-fowls , which resort thither in great numbers , employed , like himself , in looking out for a livelihood , and in cleansing the shores from impurities . Other philosophers , on the contrary , have ascribed the manners of animals , as those of men , to education ; and their natural affections , as well as their animosities , to resemblance or dissimilitude of form . But if friendship is founded in similitude of form , how comes it that the hen , who walks in security at the head of her brood , among the horses and oxen of a farm-yard , though part of her family is sometimes accidentally crushed by the feet of those animals , collects her jroung , with anxious inquietude , at the sight of the hawk , a feathered animal like herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whom , perhaps , she hardly , if ever , saw before ? Why does the dog in the yard fall a barking in the /z/ night time , at the smell only of the fox , an animal which has a strong resemblance to himself 1 If habits of long standing could influence animals , as they do men , how has it been possible to render the ostrich of the desert familiar to such a degree , that he has been made to carry children on his plumeless crupper ; whereas no skill has , hitherto , been able to tame the swallow , a bird which has , from time immemorial , built her nest in our houses 1 Where can we find , among the historians of Nature , a Tacitus , who shall unveil to us these mysteries of the cabinet of Heaven , without an explanation of which , it is impossible to write the history of a single animal on the earth 1 We find no one species deviating , like the human , from the laws imposed upon it by Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did in the time of Esop . The common fly has always been a vagabond , one of a herd without any police or restraint . How comes it that , among these , no Lycurgus has ever yet arisen , to reduce them into order , for the general good ; and to prescribe to them , as philosophers tell us the first legislators among men did , laws dictated by their weakness , and by the necessity of uniting in society ? To the difficulties opposed to us by Nature , let us add those which we ourselves throw in the way . First , methods and systems of all sorts prepare , in every man , his manner of viewing objects . Let us examine notions the most universally admitted , and supported by the highest authority . To begin with geographers . They represent the earth as divided into four principal parts , whereas , in reality , there are only two . Instead of the rivers which water it , the rocks which form its barriers , the chains of mountains which divide it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speckled all over with party-coloured lines , which divide and subdivide it into empires , principalities , &c.; They have disfigured the originals , or substituted names without a meaning , in place of those the native inhabitants of every country had given them , and which so well expressed their nature . They call , for example , a city , near to that of Mexico , where the Spaniards shed such oceans of blood , the City of Angels , but to which the Mexicans give the name of Ceut-lax-coupan , that is , The snake in the water , because that of two fountains , which issue from thence , one is poisonous ; they call the Mississippi , that great river of North /q/ America , which the natives denominate/Jfec/iamp , the father of waters ; and so of an infinite number of other proper names . They have stripped the works of Nature of their distinctive characters , and nations of their monuments . On reading these ancient names , with their explanations , in Garcillaso de la Vega , in Thomas Gage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a few simple words , the landscape of every country , and something of its natural history , without taking into the account the respect attached to their antiquity . Those only of the Chinese , who traffic with the Europeans , know that their country is called China . The name given by the inhabitants is Chium-hoa , the middle kingdom . They change the name of it , when the families of their sovereigns become extinct . Europeans have destroyed all these correspondencies ; for , obstinately persevering to give what names they please to the countries which they seize , or in which they settle , it comes to pass that , when you see the same countries on maps , or in Dutch , English , Portuguese , Spanish , or French books of travels , you are utterly incapable of distinguishing anything . Their very longitude is changed , for every nation now makes its own capital the first meridian . Botanists mislead us still more . I have spoken of the perpetual variations of their dictionaries ; but their method is no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to class the trees of a forest . It is not sufficient to see them standing and covered with leaves , the botanist must examine the flower , and frequently the fruit too . The clown knows them all perfectly , in the boughs which compose his fagot . To show me the character of a flower , it is presented to me dry , discoloured , and spread out on the leaf of a herbary . Who can discover the queen of flowers in a dried rose 1 In order to its being an object at once of love and of philosophy , it must be viewed when , issuing from the cleft of a humid rock , it shines on its native verdure , when the zephyr balances it , on a stem armed with thorns ; when Aurora has bedewed it with her tears ; when , by its lustre and its fragrance , it invites the hands of lovers . A cantharide , sometimes , lurking in its corolla , heightens the glowing carmine , by presenting the contrast of his emerald-coloured robe ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of pleasure , from her charms , and the rapidity of her decay , like pleasure too she carries danger around her , and repentance in her bosom . /z/ Naturalists betray us into still wider deviations from Nature , in attempting to explain , by uniform laws , arid by the mere action of air , water , and heat , the expansion of so many plants , growing on the same dunghill , of colours , forms , savours , and perfumes , so different . Do they try to decompound the principles of them Poison and food present , in their stoves , the same results . Thus Nature sports herself with their art , as with their theory . The corn-plant alone , gathered in handfuls only by the vulgar , answers a thousand valuable purposes , while a multitude of vegetables have remained entirely useless , in the laboratories of the learned . I remember having read , many years ago , several grave dissertations on the manner of employing the horse-chestnut as food for cattle . Every academy in Europe has , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their learned disquisitions was , that the horse-chesnut was useless , unless prepared by a very expensive process , and that , even then , it was good only in the manufacture of tapers and hair-powder . I was astonished at this : not that naturalists should be ignorant of its use , and that they had studied it merely as an article of luxury , but that Nature should have produced a fruit of no use even to the brute creation : I was at last cured of my ignorance , by the brutes themselves . I happened to take my walk one day to the Bois de Boulogne , * with a branch of the horse-chestnut in my hand , when I perceived a goat feeding . I went up , and amused myself with stroking her . As soon as she perceived the horse-chesnut bough , instantly she seized and snapped it up . The lad who tended her told me , that the goats were all very fond of this plant , and that it contributed greatly to the increase of their milk . I perceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to the Chateau de Madrid , a herd of cows eagerly looking for horse-chesnuts , which they greedily devoured , without sauce or pickle . Thus , our learned and ingenious systems conceal from us natural truths , with which every peasant is acquainted . What a spectacle do our cabinets of preserved animals present 1 To no purpose has the art of a Daubenton endeavoured to keep up the appearance of life . Let industry do its utmost to preserve the form , their stiff and motionless * The Bois de Boulogne , and Chateau de Madrid , are a wood and castle , not many miles from Paris . /q/ attitude , their fixed and staring eyes , their bristly hair , all declare that they have been smitten with the stroke of death . In such a state , even beauty itself inspires horror ; whereas objects the most homely are agreeable , when placed in the situation which Nature has assigned them . Our books of natural history are merely the romance of Nature , and our cabinets her tomb . The history of man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the interest which religion , or humanity , has prompted some good men to take , in favour of their fellow-creatures , historians have written under the impulse of a thousand different passions . The politician represents man , as divided into nobility and commonalty , into papists and huguenots , into soldiers and slaves ; the moralist , into the avaricious , the hypocritical , the debauched , the proud ; the tragic poet , into tyrants and their victims ; the comic , into drolls and buffoons ; the physicia'n , into the pituitous , the bilious , the phlegmatic . They are universally exhibited as subjects of aversion , of hatred , of contempt ; Man has been universally dissected , and now nothing is shown of him but the carcass . Thus the master-piece of Creation , like every thing else in Nature , has been degraded by our learning . I do not mean to affirm , however , that from such partial means , no useful discovery has proceeded ; but all these circles , within which we circumscribe the Supreme Power , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human genius . We accustom ourselves to crowd all our own ideas into that narrow space , and dishonestly to reject all that does not accord with them . We act the part of the tyrant of Sicily , who fitted the unhappy traveller to his bed of iron ; he violently stretched , to the length of the bed , the limbs of those who were shorter , and cut short the limbs of those who were longer . It is thus we apply all the operations of Nature to our pitiful methods , in order to reduce the whole to one common standard . Fiction embellishes the history of man only , it degrades that of Nature . Nature is herself the source of all that is ingenious , amiable , and beautiful . By applying to her the violence of our imaginary laws , or by extending to all her operations those with which we are acquainted , we conceal others , worthy of the highest admiration , with which we are totally unacquainted . We add , to the cloud with which /z/ she veils her divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , in our search after truth , the passions of the college and of the world , intolerance and envy . Those who enter first on the career , oblige those who come after them to walk in their footsteps , or to give it up ; as if Nature were their patrimony , or , as if the study of Nature were an exclusive trade , that did not admit of participation . What trouble did it cost to eradicate , in France , the metaphysics of Aristotle , which had become a species of religion 1 The philosophy of Descartes , which supplanted it , might have subsisted to this day , had its revenues been ample . That of Newton , with its attractions , is not more solidly established . I have an unbounded respect for the memory of those great men , whose very deviations have assisted us , in opening great highways through the vast empire of Nature ; but , on more occasions than one , I shall combat their principles , and , especially , the general applications which have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animals , the simple vocabulary of which no scholar , no academy , no one nation , will ever be able perfectly to acquire ; but it is to be presumed , that the human race is acquainted with all their properties . In vain do enlightened nations boast , that they are the great repositories of all the arts and sciences . It is to savages , to men utterly unknown , that we are indebted for the first observations , which are the source of all science . It is neither to the polished Greeks nor Romans , but to nations which we denominate barbarous , that we owe the use of simples , of bread , of wine , of domestic animals , of cloths , of dyestuffs , of metals , and of every thing most useful , and most agreeable , for human life . Modern Europe glories in her discoveries ; but the invention of the art of printing , one of the fairest titles to immortality , is to be ascribed to a person so obscure , that several cities of Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discovery as their own . Galileo would never have calculated the gravity of air , but for the observation of a fountainplayer , who remarked that water could rise only up to thirtytwo feet in the tubes of a forcing engine . Newton had never read the starry heavens , unless a spectacle-maker 's children , in Zealand , had , at play with the lenses in their father 's shop , suggested the first idea of the telescopic cylinder . Our artiilery /q/ would never have subjugated the New World , but for the accidental discovery of gunpowder by a lazy monk ; and whatever glory Spain may pretend to derive from the discovery of that vast continent , the savages of Asia had planted empires there , long before the arrival of Christopher Columbus . -x X Advancing no higher claim , I presume to contribute my humble offering . It is the fruit of many years of application , which , amidst storms long and severe , stole away in these calm researches , like a single day of serenity . I earnestly wished , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to stop , to communicate to others , at least the pleasure which I had enjoyed on my way . I have conveyed my observations in the best style of which I am capable ; and have adopted the most simple method , without which , the confusion of the matter must have still more increased the insufficiency of the Author . In the FIRST PART I will display the blessings bestowed by Nature , on the age in which we live ; and the objections which have been started in it , against the providence of its /z/ In the SECOND PART , I shall apply the laws of Nature to the globe ; examine its form , extent , the division of its hemispheres ; and as it is composed of parts similar , and of parts contrary , I shall consider its different elements , and the manner of their adaptation to each other . I shall point out the effect of the sun 's heat and light ; shall speak of heaven , the moon , and stars ; of fire , air , and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and examine for what reason Nature has divided the globe into two hemispheres ; what has rendered the communication of all its parts easy to a being so small and so feeble as man , and possible only to him ; demonstrating that the same Intelligence , whose productions we so justly admire in plants and animals , presides equally in the edifice which we inhabit . In the THIRD PART , I will show how the different parts of plants correspond with the elements , so that , far from being a necessary production of theirs , as some philosophers pretend , they are almost always in opposition to . their action . I shall adhere , however , to the exterior characters by which Nature seems to divide them into different genera . Their principal character is very difficult to determine , not only because the simplest plant unites a very great variety of relations to all /z/ the elements , but because Nature does not place the character of her works in any one of the parts , but in their combination . In the FOURTH PART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations to the elements ; and we shall observe , as in the case of plants , that so man ) ' different configurations , far from being , in animals , mechanical effects of the action of the elements in which they live , are , on the contrary , almost always in the inverse ratio of these very causes . In the nests of animals , we shall look for their character ; and from these determine the element in which they must live , the aliment best adapted to their constitution , and the first lessons of industry , of love , or of ferocity , which they receive from their parents . However strange these indications may appear , they are those of Nature , who seems to tell us , that we may distinguish the characters of her children , like her own , in the fruits of love , and in the care which they take of their posterity . Attempts have frequently been made to propagate the breed of foreign animals in our parks ; but they all languish and die , because no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see them always restless , with the head hanging down , scratching up the ground , as if demanding from it the nourishment they had lost . A single herb would have been sufficient to quiet them , by recalling the tastes of their early life , the breezes which used to fan them , the cool fountains and refreshing shades of their native country ; less unhappy , however , than man , who can be cured of regret only by total loss of memory . In the FIFTH PART , I shall speak of MAN . Every work of Nature has presented to us , hitherto , only partial relations ; man will furnish such as are universal . Examining those in which he stands to the elements , we shall observe , that his eyes are turned , not towards heaven , but to the horizon ; so that he may view , at once , the heaven which illuminates , and the earth which supports him . His visual rays take in near half of the celestial hemisphere , and of the plane on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand , which he tramples under foot , to the star which shines over his head , at immeasurable distance . He alone , of animals , can enjoy equally day and night ; can bear to live within the torrid , and upon the ices of the frigid zone . If certain animals partake with him these advantages , /q/ it is only by means of his instructions , and under his protection . For all this he is indebted to the element of fire , of which he alone is the sovereign lord . Some authors pretend , that certain of the brute creation understand the management of it , and that the monkeys in America keep up the fires kindled by travellers in the forests . No one denies that they love its heat , and resort to it for warmth , when man retires . But as they have perceived its utility , why have they not preserved the use of it 1 However simple the manner of keeping up fire may be , by supplying it with fuel , not one of them will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more intelligent than the monkey , a witness every hour of the effects of fire , accustomed , in our kitchens , to live only on meat that is dressed , if you give him raw flesh , will never dream of roasting it on the coals . This barrier , which separates man from the brute , weak as it may appear , is insurmountable to animals . And this is one of the great blessings of Providence , bestowed for the general security ; for how many unforeseen and irreparable conflagrations would take place , were fire at their disposal ? God has intrusted the first agent in Nature , to that being alone whom reason has qualified to make a right use of it . While some historians bestow this faculty on the brutes , others deny it to man . They allege that many nations were destitute of it , till the arrival of Europeans among them . To prove this , they quote the inhabitants of the Marianne Islands , otherwise called the Isle of Thieves , by a calumnious imputation so common among sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , on the very natural astonishment expressed by these islanders , on seeing ( heir villages set on fire by the Spaniards , * whom they had received with kindness . They contradict themselves , by rela ting , that these very people used canoes , daubed over with bitumen , which necessarily supposes , in the case of savages unacquainted with iron , that fire had been employed in hollowing their canoes , or , at least , in careening them . Finally , we are told , that they fed on rice , the preparation of which , however simple , requires , of necessity , the application of fire . /z/ This element is universally necessary to human existence , even in the hottest climates . By means of fire alone , man guards his habitation , by night , from ravenous beasts of prey ; drives away the insects which thirst for his blood ; clears the ground of the trees and plants which cover it ; in a word , in every country , with fire he prepares his food , dissolves metals , vitrifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to all the productions of the earth , the forms and combinations which his necessities require . The benefits which he derives from the air are no less extensive . Few animals are , like him , capable of respiring , with equal ease , at the level of the sea , and on the summit of the loftiest mountains . Man is the only being who gives it all the modulations of which it is susceptible . With his voice alone , he imitates the hissing , the cries , the singing of all animals ; while he enjoys the gift of speech , denied to every other . Sometimes he communicates sensibility to the air ; he makes it sigh in the pipe , complain in the flute , threaten in the trumpet , and to animate to the tone of his passions the brass , the box-tree , and the reed . Sometimes he makes it his slave ; forces it to grind , bruise , and move , to his advantage , an endless variety of machinery . In a word , he yokes it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the billows of the ocean . That element , in which few of the inhabitants of earth are able to live , presents to man alone the easiest of communications . He swims , he dives in it , he pursues the sea-monster to the abysses of the deep ; he hunts and stabs the whale even under mountains of ice ; alights on every island in the bosom of the sea , and asserts his empire over it . Whatever irregularity may appear on the surface of the earth , man is the only being formed with the capacity of pervading all its parts . There is established , among all his limbs , an equilibrium so perfect , so difficult to be preserved , so contrary to the laws of our mechanism , that there is no sculptor capable of forming a statue resembling man , broader and heavier above than below , which shall be able to maintain an erect position , and remain immoveable , on a basis so small as his feet . It would be quickly overset by the slightest breath of wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it walk like him ? There is no animal whose body is susceptible of so many different movements ; who unites /q/ in himself all the possible varieties of animal motion ; who is equally adapted to clamber to the summit of the rock , to walk on the surface of the snow , to traverse the river and the forest , to pick the moss of the fountain , and the fruit of the palm-tree ; to feed the bee , and to tame the elephant . In man Nature has collected every thing that is lovely in colour and in form , whether from harmony or contrast . To these she has added movements the most majestic and the most graceful . Indeed , so wonderful are these combinations , that all animals , in their natural state , are struck , at sight of him , with terror , or with love ; and as he is the only being who has the disposal of fire , the principle of life , so he alone practises agriculture , which is its support . The ox never thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn-floor , nor the monkey , the maize of the field which he plunders . Man alone raises his intelligence up to that of Nature . He not only pursues her plans , but recedes from them . He covers regions destined for forests , with corn and wine . He says to the pine of Virginia , and to the chesnut of India , " You shall grow in Europe . " Nature seconds his efforts , and seems , by her complaisance , to invite him to prescribe laws to her . For man Nature has covered the earth with plants , and though their species be infinite , not a single one but may be converted to his use . She has selected some out of every class , to minister to his pleasure or support , wherever he pleases to fix his habitation . She permits the plants most useful to him to grow in all climates ; but the domestic ones , from the cabbage up to the corn , alone , like man himself , are citizens of the world . The others serve for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for medicine , at least for fuel . The animals are wonderfully formed , at once to live in situations the most rugged , and , animated by an instinct the most tractable , to associate with man . Every region is supporting a race of servants for him ; but those animals , in which are united the greatest number of utilities , live with him over the whole face of the earth . Delighting to pasture , each according to its nature , there is no corner of the earth where the whole vegetable crop may not be reaped ; and in the evening all return to the habitation of man , with murmurs , with bleatings , with cries of joy , bringing back to him the delicious tribute of innumerable plants , transformed , by a /z/ process the most inconceivable , into honey , milk , butter , eggs , and cream . While some philosophers assign to every species of dog a common origin , others ascribe a difference of origin to man . Their system is founded on the variety of size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor stature , are distinctive characters , in the judgment of all naturalists . According to them , colour is merely accidental ; superior stature only a greater expansion of forms . Difference of species arises from the difference of proportions : now this characterizes that of dogs . The proportions of the human body no where vary ; the black colour , within the tropics , is simply the effect of the heat of the sun , which tinges man in proportion as he approaches the line ; and it is one of the blessings of Nature . His size is invariably the same in every age , and in all places , notwithstanding the influence of food and climate , by which other animals are so powerfully affected ; but from the tallest to the shortest of the human race , there is not , at most , the difference of a foot . Their stature is the same , at this day , as in the time of the Egyptians ; at Archangel as in Africa , as is evident from the length of mummies , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberia , along the banks of the river Petzora . The somewhat contracted stature of the Laplanders is to be imputed , I presume , to their sedentary mode of living ; for I have observed , among ourselves , a similar contraction of size in persons of occupations requiring little exercise . That of the Patagonians , on the contrary , is more expanded than that of the Laplanders , though they inhabit a latitude as cold , from their greater disposition to be moving about . The Laplander passes the greater part of the year shut up amidst , his herds of reindeer ; whereas the Patagonian is perpetually a stroller , for he lives entirely by hunting and fishing . Besides , the first travellers to whom we are indebted for our knowledge of these two nations , have greatly exaggerated the smallness of the one , and the magnitude of the other . Man , over the whole globe , is at the centre of all magnitudes , of all movements , and of all harmonies . His stature , his limbs , his organs , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she has rendered them invariable as their combination . He constitutes , himself alone , a genus which has neither class nor species , dignified , by way of /q/ excellence , with the title of MANKIND . In every age , man has been the friend of man , not merely from the interests of commerce , but by the more sacred , the more indissoluble bands of humanity . We are all bondsmen for each other . The happiness of every individual is attached to the happiness of mankind . He is under obligation to exert himself for the general good , because his own depends upon it . Instinct discovers to the animal its necessities only ; but man alone has raised himself from the dark womb of profound ignorance , to the knowledge and belief of a GOD : and on this knowledge are founded all the associations of the human race , without a single exception . As man has formed his intellect on that of Nature , he has been obliged to regulate his moral sense by that of her AUTHOR . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of all good , it was necessary to contribute to the general good ; hence the efforts made by man , in every age , to raise himself to GOD , by the practice of virtue . Thither he directs , without perceiving it , his hopes , his feat 's , his pleasures , his pains , his loves ; and passes his life in pursuing , or in combating , these fugitive impressions of DEITY . We shall have frequent occasion to remark , that the works of Nature exhibit contrasts , harmonies , and transitions , which wonderfully unite their different empires to each other . We shall examine by what magic it is , that the contrasts are productive at once of pleasure and pain , of friendship and hatred , of existence and destruction . From them proceeds that great principle of LOVE , which divides all the individuals into two great classes , objects loving and beloved . It opposes individual to individual by difference of sex , and genus to genus by that of forms , in order to extract from them harmonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , heat to cold , earth to water , and their accords produce lights , temperatures , views , the most agreeable . In vegetables , in the forests of the north , the thick and gloomy foliage , the tranquil attitude and the pyramidical form of the fir , contrast with the tender verdure and moveable foliage of the birch , which presents the appearance of a pyramid inverted . The same oppositions reign in the animal kingdom ; from the bee and the butterfly , up to the elephant and the canielopard , there is not a single animal on the earth but what has /z/ its contrast , man only excepted . The contrasts of man are all within himself . Two opposite passions , love and ambition , balance all his actions . To love , are referable all the pleasures of the senses ; to ambition , all those of the soul . These two passions are in perpetual counterpoise in the same subject ; and while the first is accumulating on man every kind of corporeal enjoyment , and insensibly sinking him below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim at universal dominion , and to exalt himself , at length , up to the DEITY . Nature , however , has bestowed these two passions on man as a source of happiness . She produces an equal number of each sex , to direct the love of every man to a single object , and in that object she has united all the harmonies which are scattered over her most beautiful productions . There is between man and woman a wonderful analogy of forms , inclinations , and tastes ; but there is a difference still greater , of these very qualities . Love results only from contrasts , and the greater they are , the more powerful is its energy ; which might easily be demonstrated by the evidence of a thousand historical facts . The influence of contrasts in love is so certain , that on seeing the lover , it would be easily possible to draw the portrait of the beloved object , without having seen it , provided only it were known that the passion was extremely violent . Of this I myself have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city where I was entirely a stranger . A gentleman of the place , one of my friends , carried me to visit his sister , a very virtuous young lady , and he informed me , as we were going , that she was violently in love . Being arrived at her apartments , and love happening to become the subject of conversation , it came into my head to say to her , that I knew the laws which determined our choice in love , and that , if she would permit me , I could draw her lover 's picture , though he was utterly unkown to me . She bid me defiance : upon this , taking the opposite to her tall and buxom figure , to her temperament and character , which her brother had been describing to me , I painted her favourite as a little man , not overloaded with flesh , with blue eyes , and fair hair , somewhat fickle , eager after information . Every word I uttered made her blush up to the eyes , and she became seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ her secret . This , however , was not the case , and he was fully as much astonished as herself . The government of a good king has been compared to that of a father ; but the empire of a virtuous father can be compared only to that of GOD himself . Virtue is , to man , the true law of Nature . It is the harmony of all harmonies . Virtue alone can render love sublime , and ambition beneficent . It can derive the purest gratification even from privations the most severe . Rob it of love , friendship , honour , the sun , the elements , it feels that , under the administration of a Being just and good , abundant compensation is reserved for it , and it acquires an increase of confidence in GOD , even from the cruelty and injustice of man . The spheres of all beings have a communication , by means of rays , which seem to unite their extremities ; and we shall find perhaps in our common gardens , appearances of Nature still more surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing out its tendrils , precisely at the height where they begin to stand in need of support , and curling them round the boughs , with an address which can hardly be ascribed to chance . This seems to suppose intelligence ; but is a demonstration of goodness , not in the vegetable , but in the hand which formed it . The sphere of animals extends still farther these wonderful harmonies . From the motionless shelly race , which pave and strengthen the capacious bed of the sea , to the fly who wings his way by night , over the plains of the torrid zone , glittering with rays of light like a star , you will find in them the configuration of rocks , of vegetables , of stars . Some of them compose noisy republics , others live in profound solitude . The whole life of some is employed in waging war , that of others in making love , not less varied than their animosities . One must have his seraglio ; another is satisfied with a transient mistress ; a third unites himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the separation . Man unites , in his enjoyments , their pleasures and their transports ; and , satiated , sighs , and demands of Heaven felicity of a different kind . We shall examine , simply by the light which reason supplies , whether man , subjected , by his body , to the condition of the animal creation , all whose necessities he unites in himself , is not , by his soul , allied to creatures of a superior order ; /z/ and whether Nature has not reserved to herself some extraordinary means of interposing for the relief , even of the human race , undoubtedly as being the most wretched species of all . That order which pervades the general combination of the spheres , subsists in the parts of each of the individuals which compose them . There is not a single one which has , in its organs , either deficiency or redundancy . Their mutual adaptation is so perceptible , and they possess characters so very striking , that if you were to show to a naturalist of ability any representation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen , he could tell , from the harmony of its parts , whether it were a creature of the imagination , or a copy after Nature . Even the instincts of animals appear to be less adapted to their own personal utility , than to that of man ; and are sometimes in harmony with the nature of the soil they inhabit , sometimes in opposition to it . The gluttonous hog delights to live in the mire , from which he is intended to purify the habitation of man ; and the sober camel , to force his way through the burning sands of Africa , impervious , but for him , to every effort of the traveller . The appetites of these animals do not grow out of the places which they inhabit ; for the ostrich , who is a fellow-tenant of the same deserts with the camel , is still more voracious than the hog . No one law of magnetism , of gravity , of attraction , of electricity , of heat , or of cold , governs the world . These pretended general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences mislead us , by ascribing to Nature a false providence . They are not afraid of excluding from the heart of man that sentiment of the divine qualities , which communicates to him so much force ; and of accumulating on his mind the weights and movements which oppress him . We can know that only which she makes us feel ; and we can form no judgment of her works but in the place , and at the time , she is pleased to display them . All that we imagine , beyond this , presents only contradiction , doubt , error , or absurdity . Pain and death are among the proofs of her goodness . But for pain , we should be bruising ourselves every step we took , without perceiving it . But for death , new beings could not be raised into existence ; and supposing those which already are in the world could be rendered eternal , that eternity would involve in it the ruin of the whole system of actual happiness . /q/ In vain do we search , in our cradles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , like the future , covers our mysterious destiny with an impenetrable veil . In vain do we apply to it the light which illumines us , and seek , in the origin of things , the weights , the times , and the measures , which we find in their enjoyment ; but the order which produced them has , with relation to GOD , neither time , weight , nor measure . The divisions of matter and time were made only for circumscribed , feeble , transient man . The universe , said Newton , was produced at a single cast . We are seeking for youth in what was always old , for old age in what is always young ; for germs in species , births in generations , epochs in nature ; but when the sphere , in which we live , issued from the hand of its divine AUTHOR , all times , all ages , all proportions , manifested themselves in it at once . To glance only on those general harmonies of the globe best known to us , behold how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , while night covers the other with her shade . How many contrasts and concords result from their ever-changing oppositions 1 There is not a single point in the two hemispheres , in which there does not appear , by turns , a dawn , a twilight , an aurora , a noon , a setting of burnished gold , and a night sometimes studded with stars , sometimes clothed in a sable mantle . The seasons walk hand in hand under his eye , like the hours of the day . Spring , crowned with flowers , precedes his flaming car ; Summer surrounds it with her golden sheaves ; and Autumn follows it , bearing her cornucopia running over with glossy fruit . In vain would Winter and night , retiring to the poles of the world , attempt to set bounds to his majestic career ; in vain do they raise out of the bosom of the polar seas of the north and of the south , new continents , with their valleys , their mountains , and their icy coruscations ; the father of day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without descending from his throne , resumes the empire of the universe . Nothing can screen itself from his prolific heat . From the bosom of the ocean , he raises into the air the rivers which are afterwards to flow through the Old and New Worlds . He gives commandment to the winds to distribute them over islands and continents . These invisible children of the air transport them from place to place , pouring them out on the moun- /z/ tains in dews , in rains , in hail , in snow , in impetuous torrents ; so that every part of the earth annually receives from them neither more nor less than its accustomed portion of water . Every place possesses and presents in rotation , harmonies peculiar to itself . Run over , at pleasure , a meridian , or a parallel , you will find on it mountains of ice , and of fire ; plains of every level , hills of every curve ; islands of all forms , and rivers of all currents ; some spouting up , as if they issued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cataracts , as if descending from the clouds . Nevertheless , this globe , agitated with such a variety of convulsive movements , advances in a steady and unalterable course through the immensity of the heavens . Beauties of a different order decorate its architecture , and render it habitable to sensible beings . A girdle of palm trees , to which are suspended the date and the cocoa , surrounds it between the burning tropics ; and forests of mossy firs begird it under the polar circles . The banana advances from the line to the southern shore of the Mediterranean . The orange crosses that sea , and embellishes , with its golden fruit , the southern extremities of Europe . The most necessary plants , such as corn and the gramineous tribes , penetrate the farthest , and , strong from their weakness , stretch , in the shelter of the valleys , from the banks of the Ganges to the shores of the Frozen Ocean . Others advancing from the rude climates of the north , make their way , under favour of the snows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fir and cedar clothe the mountains of Arabia and Cachemire , and view at their feet the scorched plains of Aden and Lahore , where the date and the sugar-cane are reaped . But every soil has its Flora and its Pomona . The rocks , morasses , mire , and sand , have each vegetables peculiar to itself . The very shallows of the sea are fertile . The cocoatree thrives only on the strand , and suspends its milky fruit over the billows of the briny deep . Other plants are adapted to the winds , to the seasons , to the hours of the day , with such exact precision , that , by means of them , Linnaeus constructed botanical almanacs and timepieces . Who is capable of describing the infinite variety of their figure 1 What cradles , arches , avenues , pyramids of verdure , loaded with fruits , present the most enchanting habitations ! What happy republics lodge under their tranquil shade ! What /q/ delicious banquets are there prepared ! Nothing of them is lost . The quadrupeds eat the tender foliage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rind , and insects feed on the offal . Other tribes hold vegetables in contempt , and are adapted to the elements , to day , to night , to tempests , and to different parts of the globe . The eagle trusts her nest to the rock which loses itself in the clouds ; the ostrich , to the parched sands of the desert ; the rose-coloured flamingo , to the mires of the Southern Ocean . The white bird of the tropic , and the black frigate , take pleasure to sweep along , in company , over the vast extent of the seas , to view , from the highest regions of the atmosphere , the fleets of India toiling after them in vain , and to circumscribe the globe from east to west , disputing rapidity of flight with the sun himself . In the same latitudes , the turtle-dove and the parroquet , less daring , travel only from isle to isle , having their young ones in their train , and picking up , in the forests , the grains of spicery which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While fowls of this description preserve an equal temperature , under the same parallels , others find it in the track of the same meridian . Long triangles of wild-geese and of swans go and come every year from south to north , stop only at the hoary limits of winter , hurry , without desire or astonishment , over the populous cities of Europe , and look down with disdain on their fertile plains , which present the furrows of green corn in the midst of snow ; to such a degree does liberty appear preferable to abundance , even in the eyes of the animal creation ! On the other hand , legions of heavy quails cross the sea , and go to the south , in quest of the summer 's heat . Toward the end of September , they avail themselves of a northerly wind to take their departure from Europe , and flapping one wing , while they present the other to the gale , half sail , half oar , they graze the billows of the Mediterranean , with their fattened rump , and bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as food to the famished inhabitants of Zara . There are animals which travel only by night . Millions of crabs , in the Antilles , descend from the mountains by the light of the moon , clashing their claws ; and present to the Caraibs , on the steril strand of their isles , innumerable shells /z/ replenished with excellent marrow . At other seasons , on the contrary , the tortoise quits the sea , and lands on the same shores , to accumulate layers of eggs in their barren sands . The very ices of the pole are inhabited . We find in their seas , and under their floating promontories of crystal , the black enormous whale , with more oil on his back than a whole plantation of olives could produce . Foxes clothed in precious furs , find the means of living on shores abandoned by the sun ; herds of reindeer there scratch up the snow in search of moss , and advance , braying , into those desolate regions of night , by the glimmering light of the aurora borealis . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unprolific present to man , in the greatest abundance , provisions , clothing , lamps , and firing , not of his own production . How delightful would it be to behold the human race collecting all these various blessings , and communicating them to each other , in peace , from climate to climate ! We look with expectation , every winter , to the period when the swallow and nightingale shall announce to us the return of serenity . How much more affecting would it be , to behold the people of distant lands arrive with the spring , on our shores , not with the dreadful noise of artillery , like modern Europeans , but with the sound of the flute and of the hautboy , as the ancient navigators , in the earlier ages of the world ! Winter itself would be no interruption to the communication of mankind . The Laplander , covered with warm fur , would arrive , under favour of the snow , in his sledge drawn by the reindeer , and expose for sale , in our markets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every sea would be navigated , every region would be explored , all their productions would be collected . What a gratification of curiosity would it be to listen to the adventures of these foreign travellers , attracted to us by the gentleness of our manners ! They would not be slow in communicating to our hospitality the secrets of their plants , of their industry , and of their traditions , which they will for ever conceal from our ambitious commerce . Among the members of the vast family of mankind are the fragments of their history scattered . How interesting to learn that of our ancient separation , why each tribe chose a separate habitation , on an unknown globe ; and traversed , /q/ as chance directed , mountains which presented no path ; and rivers without a name ! What pictures would be presented to us in the descriptions of those countries , decorated with a pompous magnificence , as they proceeded from the hands of Nature , but wild , and unadapted to the necessities of man destitute of experience ! They would paint to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new plants which every new climate exhibited to their view , and the trials which they made of them as the means of subsistence ; how they were aided , no doubt , in their necessitous circumstances , and in their industry , by some celestial Intelligence , who commiserated their distress ; how they gradually formed an establishment ; what was the origin of their laws , of their customs , and of their religions . What acts of virtue , what instances of generous love , have ennobled the deserts , and are unknown to our pride ! We flatter ourselves we have got a clear insight into the history of foreign nations , because we have collected a few anecdotes picked up at random by travellers . But this is much the same as if they were to compose ours from the tales of a mariner , or the artificial representations of a courtier , amidst the jealousies of war , or the corruptions of commerce . The knowledge and sentiments of a nation are not deposited in books . They repose in the heads , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth such a thing as a secure asylum for truth . If it be delightful to acquire knowledge , it is much more so to diffuse it . The noblest reward of science is the pleasure of the ignorant man instructed . What a sublime satisfaction should it be to us , to enjoy their joy , to behold their dances in our public squares , and to hear the drums of the Tartar , and the ivory cornet of the Negro re-echo round the statues of our kings ! Ah , if we were good , I figure them to myself struck with astonishment and sorrow at the excessive and unhappy populousness of our cities , inviting us to spread ourselves over their solitudes , to contract marriages with them , and by new alliances to reunite the branches of the human race which are unhappily separating farther and farther , and which national prejudices disunite still more than ages and climates !

Almost every where he is the slave of his equal , while the feeblest of animals maintain their liberty against the strongest . Nature , who designed him for love , denied him arms , and he has forged them for himself , to combat his fellow . She presents to all her children asylums and festivals ; and the avenues of our cities announce our approach to them only by the sad spectacle of wheels and gibbets . The history of Nature exhibits blessings only , that of man nothing but robbery and madness . His heroes are the persons who have rendered themselves the most tremendous . Every where he despises the hand which spins the garment that clothes him , and which cultivates for him the fertile bosom of the earth .

To the investigation of the divine harmonies of Nature I have devoted my life , and this work . If I have gone astray , at least my errors shall not be fatal to religion , the natural bond of mankind , and the hope of our sublime passions . Happy if I have been able sometimes to prop , with my feeble support , that sacred edifice , assailed , in these times , on every side ! However bold some of my speculations may be , they have nothing to do with bad people ; and I shall have the full recompense of my labour , if so much as one unfortunate wretch , ready to sink at the melancholy spectacle which the world presents , shall revive , on beholding in Nature a father , a friend , a rewarder .

O my God ! give to these labours of a man , not the duration , or the spirit of life , but the freshness of the least of thy works ! Let their divine graces be transfused into my writings , and bring back a corrupted age to Thee ! Opposed to Thee , all power is weakness ; supported by Thee , weakness becomes irresistible strength . When the rude northern blasts have ravaged the earth , thou callest for the feeblest of winds ; at the sound of thy voice , the zephyr breathes , the verdure revives , the gentle primrose , and the humble violet , cover the bosom of the bleak rock with a mantle of gold and purple . /z/ MOST men , in policed nations , look on Nature with indifference . They are in the midst of her works , and admire only human grandeur . What charm can render the history of man so interesting ! It has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , of bloody victories , or , at most , of useless labours . If Nature sometimes finds a place in it , we alre called upon to observe only the ravages she has committed , and to hear her charged with a thousand calamities , which may be all traced up to our own imprudence. * Fenelon , on the Existence of God . /z/ With what unremitting attention , on the contrary , is this common mother providing for us the means of happiness ! She has diffused her benefits from pole to pole , in the view of engaging us to unite in a mutual communication of them . She recalls us from the prejudices which unhappily separate mankind , to the universal laws of justice and humanity , by frequently putting our ills in the hands of the so highly vaunted conquerors , and our pleasures in those of the oppressed , whom we hardly deign to favour with our pity .

While they were exterminating its inoffensive inhabitants , a Caraib , in token of peace , set the sailors a smoking his calumet ; the perfume of tobacco dissipated their chagrin , and the use of it is dis . seminated over the universe . To whom are we indebted for the use of sugar , of chocolate , of so many agreeable means of subsistence , and so many salutary medicines ? To naked Indians , to poor peasants , to wretched negroes . The spade of slaves has done more good than the sword of conquerors has done mischief . But in which of our great squares are we to look for the statues of our obscure benefactors ! Our histories have not vouchsafed to name them . Where is now the time , when our forefathers wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting , and not daring to trust to Nature ? Her simplest phenomena filled them with terror , and they trembled at sight of an eclipse . I will suppose , that a philosopher , such as Newton , were then to have treated them with the spectacle of some of our natural sciences , and shown them , with the microscope , forests in moss , mountains in grains of sand , thousands of animals in drops of water ; that afterwards , discovering to them , in the heavens , a progression of greatness equally infinite , he had shown them , in the planets , hardly perceptible to the naked eye , worlds much greater than ours , Saturn , three hundred millions of leagues distant ; in the fixed stars , /q/ infinitely more remote , suns which probably illuminate other worlds ; in the whiteness of the milky way , stars , that is suns , innumerable , scattered about in the heavens , as grains of dust on the earth , without man 's knowing whether all this may not be more than the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed a spectacle which we , at this day , behold without emotion 1 But I would rather suppose , that , unprovided with the magic of science , a man like Fenelon had presented himself to them , in all the majesty of virtue , and thus addressed the Druids : ' You frighten yourselves , my friends , with the groundless terrors which you instil into the people . God is righteous . He conveys to the wicked terrible apprehensions , which recoil on those w r ho communicate them . But He speaks to all men in the blessings which He bestows . Your religion would govern men by fear ; mine draws them with cords of love , and imitates his sun in the firmament , whom He causes to shine on the evil and on the good .

These are only the smallest part of the blessings for which their opulent descendants stand indebted to Nature . An infinite number of arts are employed at home , to diffuse knowledge and delight ; and there is not a spot of the earth , or sea , but what furnishes them with some article of enjoyment . Even the sands of Africa , where they have no game-keeper , send them in clouds , quails , and other birds of passage , which cross the sea in spring , to load their table in Autumn ; and the northern pole , where they have no cruiser , pours on their shores , every summer , legions of mackarel , fresh cod , and turbots , fattened in the long nights of winter . Not only the fowls and the fishes change for them their climate , but the very trees themselves . They have no longer occasion for suns : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hot-houses , the heats of Syria to exotic plants , at the very season their hinds are perishing with the cold of /z/ the Alps , in their hovels . Not only every thing that actually exists , but ages past , all contribute to their felicity . The sublime geniuses , of all ages and countries , celebrating , without concert , the undecaying lustre of virtue , and the providence of Heaven , in the punishment of vice , add the authority of their reason to the universal instinct of mankind , and multiply , in their favour , the hopes of another life , of long duration , and more exalted felicity . But it is from the very lap of plenteousness and pleasure , that the voice of murmuring against Providence now arises .

Here it is deluged by vast seas ; there it is parched with thirst , and presents only wildernesses of barren sand . A centrifugal force , occasioned by its diurnal rotation , has heaved out its equator into enormous mountains , while it flattened the poles ; for the globe was originally in a state of softness ; whether it was a mud recovered from the empire of the waters , or , what is more probable , a scum detached from the sun . The volcanoes , which are scattered over the whole earth , demonstrate that the fire which formed it is still under our feet . Over this scoria , so wretchedly levelled , the rivers run as chance directs . Some of them inundate the plains ; others are swallowed up , or precipitate themselves in cataracts , and no one of them presents any thing like a regular current .

Amidst this conflict of contending elements , this baked lump grows harder and harder , colder and colder , every day .

' In the vegetable world the disorder increases upon us. * Plants are a fortuitous production , of humid and dry , of hot and cold , the mould of the earth merely . The heat of the sun makes them spring up , the cold of the poles kills them . Their sap obeys the same mechanical laws with the liquid in the thermometer , and in capillary tubes .

Besides , the earth is an ill-assorted garden , which presents , almost every where , useless weeds , or mortal poisons . ' As to the animals , which we know better , because they are brought nearer to us , by similar affections , and similar wants , they present still greater absurdities , f They proceeded at first from the expansive force of the earth , in the first ages of the world , and were formed out of the fermented mire of the ocean and of the Nile , as certain historians assure us ; among others Herodotus , who had his information from the priests of Egypt .

Such are , in part , the varieties of the human species , every where equally odious to Nature . No where does she nourish him with perfect good will . He is the only sensible being laid under the necessity of cultivating the earth , in order to subsist : and , as if this unnatural mother were determined to persecute , with unrelenting severity , the child whom she has brought forth , insects devour the seed as he sows it , hurricanes sweep away his harvests , ferocious animals prey on his cattle , volcanoes and earthquakes destroy his cities ; and the pestilence which , from time to time , makes the circuit of the globe , threatens at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hands for his intelligence , his morality is the creature of climate , his governments are founded in force , and his religion in fear .

And what other laws should he look for If they sometimes lead him astray , is not Nature , who bestowed them upon him , an accomplice at least , in his criminality 1 But he is made sensible of their impulse , only as a warning never to gratify them .

How must the world have been astonished at such a metaphysical idea , when man first , under the influence of terror , thought proper to cry out that there was a GOD ! What could have made him GOD ?

Did these murmurings proceed from some wretched mariner , or some oppressed peasant , my astonishment would be less : but it is amidst the luxury of Greece and Rome , in the bosom of the wealth of Indostan , of the pomp of Persia , of the voluptuousness of China , of the overflowing abundance of European capitals , that men first started up who dared to deny the existence of a DEITY . On the contrary , the houseless Tartars ; the savages of America , continually pressed with famine ; the Negroes , without foresight , and without a police ; the inhabitants of the rude climates of the north , such as the Laplanders , the Greenlanders , the Esquimaux , see gods every where , even in a flint , in a pebble . In all countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air , and in the fields . They believe , from a sentiment natural to weak minds , that the objects of their religious worship will be at their disposal in proportion as they are within their reach . Hence it is that the devotions of the common people , in every country , are presented in the fields , and have natural objects for their centre . It always attracts the religion of the peasantry . A hermitage on the side of a mountain , a chapel at the source of a stream , an image of the Virgin in wood , niched in the trunk of an oak , have , to them , a much more powerful attraction than the gilded altars of our cathedrals . The principal religious acts of the people in Turkey , Persia , the Indies , and China , are pilgrimages in the fields . The rich , on the contrary , prevented in all their wants and wishes by men , no longer look up to GOD for any thing . Their whole life is passed within doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insensibly lose sight of those of Nature . They fail not to interpret her sublime operations by the mechanism of the arts most familiar to them . Hence so many systems , which enable you to guess at the occupation of their authors . Epicurus framed his world arid /q/ his atomg , with which Providence has nothing to do , out of his own apathy ; the geometrician forms it with his compasses ; the chymist compounds it of salts ; the mineralist extracts it from the fire ; and they who apply themselves to nothing , suppose it , like themselves , in a state of chaos , and moving at random . Thus , the corruption of the heart is the original source of our errors . Replies to the Objections against Providence , founded on the Disorders of the Globe . Though ignorant of the means employed by Nature in the government of the world , it is sufficient to glance on a geographical chart , and to have read a little , to be enabled to demonstrate that those by which her operations are pretendediy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From human insufficiency spring the objections levelled at the Divine Providence . It appears to me no more natural to compose the uniform motion of the earth through the heavens , of the two motions of projection and attraction , than to attribute to similar causes that of a man walking on the earth . The centrifugal and centripetal forces seem no more to exist in the heavens , than the two circles denominated the equator and the zodiac . However ingenious these hypotheses may be , they are only scaffoldings imagined by men of genius for rearing the fabric of science , but which no more assist us in penetrating into the sanctuary of Nature , than those employed in the construction of our churches can introduce us into the sanctuary of religion . If a centrifugal force had swelled the mountains of the globe , in a state of fusion , there must have been mountains much more elevated than the Andes of Peru and Chili . That of Chimborazo , the highest of them , is only 3220 or 3350 fathoms . This elevation , nearly the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third part of a line would be on a globe of six feet diameter . Now , a mass of melted metal presents , in proportion to its size , scoriae much more considerable . Look at the anfractuosities of a simple morsel of iron-dross . What frightful swellings , then , must have been formed on a globe of heterogeneous and fermenting materials , more than 3000 leagues thick 1 The moon , whose /z/ diameter is much less considerable , contains , according to Cassini , mountains three leagues high . But what would be the case if , with the action of the heterogeneousness of our terrestrial materials , all in fusion , we should besides suppose that of a centrifugal force , produced by the earth 's rotatory motion round its axis ? I imagine that this force must have been necessarily exerted in the direction of its equator , and instead of forming it into a globe , must have flattened it out in the heavens , like those large plates of glass which glassblowers expand with their breath . Not only the diameter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than under its meridians , but the mountains there are not more elevated than elsewhere . The noted Andes of Peru commence several degrees southward of the equator , arid coasting along Peru , Chili , and Magellan 's Land , stop at the 55th degree of southern latitude , in the Terra del Fuego , where they present to the ocean a promontory of ice , of a prodigious height . Through the whole extent of this immense track , they never open but at the Straits of Magellan , forming throughout a rampart fortified with pyramids of ice , inaccessible to men , to quadrupeds , and even to birds . The mountains on the isthmus of Panama , on the contrary , placed nearly under the line , have but a trifling elevation , compared with the Andes . The highest mountains of Asia are without the tropic . The chain of Taurus and Imaus , commences in Africa , at Mount Atlas , toward the 30th degree of northern latitude . It runs across Africa and Asia , between the 38th and 40th degrees of northern latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt ; a proof of considerable elevation . Mount Ararat , a part of this chain , -s perhaps , more elevated than any mountain of the New " World : and the Peak of Teneriffe is visible 40 leagues off . The Felices of Norway , called also the Alps of the North , are visible at sea 50 leagues distant ; and are said to be 3000 fathoms high . But if the pretended centrifugal force once had the power of heaving up mountains , why does it not possess , at this day , the power of tossing up a straw into the air ? It ought not to leave a single detached body on the surface of the earth . They are affixed to it , I shall be told , by the centripetal force , or gravity . But if this last power , in fact , forces every body toward it , why have not the mountains too submitted to this /q/ universal law , when they were in a state of fusion ? I can not conceive what reply can be made to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of mountains , than the centrifugal force is . How is it possible to imagine the possibility of its having thrown them out of its womb ? In vain would we ascribe to it revolutions from west to east ; never will it have the power of raising any thing above its level . If certain ports of the Mediterranean are produced as instances , which the sea has actually left dry , it is no less certain , that there is a much greater number , on the same coasts , which the water has not deserted . The ports of Marseilles , Carthage , Malta , Rhodes , Cadiz , and many others , are still frequented by navigators , as they were in the remotest antiquity . The Mediterranean could not have sunk at any one point of its shores , without sinking at every other , for water in the bason always comes to its level . This reasoning may be extended to all the coasts of the ocean . If there are found any where tracks of land abandoned , it is not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . This is the effect of alluvions occasioned frequently by the overflowing of rivers , and sometimes by the ill-advised labours of man . The encroachments of the sea on the land are equally local , and are the effects of earthquakes , which can be extended to no great distance . As these reciprocal invasions of the two elements are particular , and frequently in opposition on the same coasts , which have , in other respects , constantly preserved their ancient level , it is impossible to deduce from them any general law for the movements of the ocean . To account for the origin of marine fossils extracted from the bed of the sea , naturalists suppose a primitive earth whose height equalled that of the present elevation of the highest peaks of the Andes , &c.; which remain so many evidences of the existence of that primeval soil : after this , they employ snows , rains , winds , and I know not what besides , to lower this original continent to the brink of the sea ; so that we inhabit only the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ; first , because it terrifies ; and then , because it is conformable to that picture of apparent ruin which the globe presents ; but it vanishes away before this simple question . What has become of the earth and the rocks of this tremendous riddance 1 If it is said , They have /z/ been thrown into the sea ; we must suppose , prior to all degradation , the existence of the bed of the sea , and its excavation would then present a great many other difficulties . But let us admit it . How comes it that those ruins have not , in part , accumulated ? Why has not the sea overflowed 1 How can it have happened , on the contrary , that it should have deserted such immense tracts of land , as are sufficient to form the greatest part of two vast continents ! Our systems , therefore , can not account for the steepy elevation of mountains of granite , by any kind of degradation , because they know not how to dispose of the fragments ; nor for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean , because in its actual state it is incapable of covering them . Bays , gulfs , and mediterranean seas , are no more the effects of irruptions of the ocean into the land , than mountains are productions of the centrifugal motion . These pretended disorders are necessary to the harmony of all parts of the earth . Let us suppose , for example , that the Straits of Gibraltar were closed , as it has been said was formerly the case , and that the Mediterranean existed no longer . What would become of so many rivers of Europe , Asia , and Africa , which are kept flowing by the vapours which ascend out of that sea , and bring back their waters to it , in a wonderful exactness of proportion , as the calculations of many ingenious men have demonstrated ? The north winds , which refresh Egypt in summer , and convey the emanations of the Mediterranean to supply the sources of the Nile , blowing , in this case , over a space destitute of water , would carry drought and barrenness over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior of that continent . The southern parts of Europe would fare still worse ; for the hot and parching winds of Africa , loaded with rainy clouds as they cross the Mediterranean , now blowing over the dry bed of that sea , without tempering the heat by humidity , would blast all that vast region of Europe , extending from Gibraltar to the Euxine Sea , and utterly dry up all the countries through which , at present , flow a multitude of rivers , such as the Rhone , the Po , the Danube , and the rest . It is not sufficient to suppose , that the ocean forced a passage into the bed of the JVfediterranean ; it must be imagined the tract of land inundated was lower than the ocean , a phenomenon /q/ no where to be met with , those parts excepted which have been wrested from the deep by human industry , as in Holland . A lateral sinking of the earth must also have taken place all round the bason of the Mediterranean , to regulate the circuits , declivities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which come from such a distance to empty themselves into it , and this sinking must have been effected with admirable proportions . It is not , then , to an irruption of the ocean that we are to ascribe the Mediterranean , but to an excavation of the globe , executed with dispositions so happy and so favourable to the circulation of so many lateral rivers , that were I to trace the course of any single one , it would be evident how destitute of all foundation the supposition is which I am combating . Indeed , if these interior waters did not exist , not a fountain would remain in the greatest part of the habitable globe . Nature , in forming basons to receive the seas , neither rounded the borders , nor applied the line to them ; but contrived deep bays , sheltered from the general currents of the ocean , that , daring stormy weather , the rivers might discharge themselves into it in security , and that the finny legions might resort thither , for refuge , at all seasons . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making their currents flow , not in a straight line , agreeably to the laws of hydraulics , but to wind about for a long time through the bosom of the land , before they pour themselves into the sea . In order to regulate the course of those rivers , and to accelerate or retard it , conformably to the level of the countries through which they flow , she pours into them lateral rivers , which accelerate it in a flat country , when they form an acute angle with the source of the main river ; or retard it in a mountainous country , by forming a right , and sometimes an obtuse angle , with the source of the principal stream . Rivers also , on throwing themselves into the sea , produce , in their turn , by the direction of their mouths , acceleration or retardation in the course of the tides ; and these facts will doubtless convince the candid reader , that the bed of the seas was scooped out expressly for the purpose of receiving them . To remove every possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by a sinking down of the solid parts /z/ of the globe , the shores of the sea , under water , would have the same declivities with the adjoining continent ; but this is not found to be the case on any coast whatever . The declivity of the bason of the sea is much steeper than that of the bounding lands , and by no means a prolongation of it . Paris , for example , is raised above the level of the sea about 26 fathoms , reckoning from the base of the bridge of NotreDame . The Seine , accordingly , from this point to where it empties itself into the sea , has a declivity of little more than 130 feet , in a distance of 40 leagues ; whereas , measuring from the mouth of the river , out into the sea , only a league and a half , you find , at once , an inclination of from 60 to 80 fathoms , the depth at which vessels anchor , in the road of Havre-de-Grace . The declivity of the excavations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitely wise : for were it the same with that of the adjacent lands , the billows of the sea , whenever the wind blew toward the shore , would considerably encroach on the land . This actually happens in the case of storms and extraordinary tides , when the waves overflow their usual bounds . Holland is exposed to inundations , because it has encroached on the bed of the sea . It is principally on the shores of the ocean that the invisible boundary is fixed , which the AUTHOR of Nature has prescribed to its waves . It is there you are at the intersection of two different planes , the one of which terminates the declivity of the land , and the other commences that of the sea . It can not be alleged , that it was by currents of the sea the bed was hollowed out ; for where could the earth that filled it before be deposited 1 They could raise nothing above their own level . It can not even be alleged that the channels of rivers have been excavated by the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subterraneous passage through masses of solid rock . Besides , on the supposition which we are examining , these rivers must have formed , at the place of their falling into the ocean , banks of sand , accumulations of earthy substances , proportional to the quantity of ground cleared away in forming their channels . Most of them , on the contrary , empty themselves at the bottom of bays , hollowed out expressly for receiving them . How is it that they have not completely filled up those bays , as they are incessantly hurling down into them substances /q/ separated from the land 1 Why is not the very bed of the ocean choked up , from the constant accumulation of the spoils of vegetables , sands , rocks , and the wreck of earth , which , on every shower that falls , tinge with yellow the rivers which fall into it ? The waters of the ocean have not risen a single inch since man began to make observations , as might easily be demonstrated from the state of the most ancient sea-ports of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same level . The means employed by Nature for the construction , support , and purification , of this immense bason , would suggest fresh subject of admiration : but enough has been said to prove , that what in nature may appear the effect of ruin , or chance , is , in many cases , the result of intelligence the most profound . Nbt only no hair falls from our head , and no sparrow from heaven to the ground , but not a pebble rolls on the shore of the ocean , without the permission of GOD . Independent of geographical proofs without number , which demonstrate that the ocean , by its irruptions , has not hollowed out one single bay on the globe , nor detached any one part of the continent from the rest , many may be deduced from the vegetable and animal kingdoms , and from man . I shall just quote an observation from the vegetable world , which proves that Britain never was united to the European continent , but from the beginning separated by the channel . Caesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in that island , he had never seen either the beech tree or the fir ; though they were very common in Gaul , along the banks of the Seine and Rhine . If , therefore , these rivers had ever flowed through any part of Britain , they must have carried with them the seeds of the vegetables which grew at their sources , or upon their banks . The beech and the fir , which at this day thrive exceedingly well in Britain , must , of necessity , have been found growing there in the time of Julius Ceesar . Besides , from whence could the Seine , the Rhine , the Thames , and so many other rivers , whose currents are supplied from the Channel , have been fed with water 1 The Thames , then , must have flowed through France , or the Seine through England ; or , to speak more conformably to truth and nature , the countries now watered by these rivers would have been completely dry . By our geographical charts , as by most other instruments /z/ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many retreatings and projections along the coasts of the continent , we imagine these irregularities must have been occasioned by violent currents of the sea . It has just been demonstrated that this effect was not thus produced ; I now proceed to show that it could not possibly have been the case . The English navigator Dampier says : ' Bays scarcely have any currents , or if there be such a thing , they are only counter-currents running from one point to another . ' * He quotes many observations in proof of this , and many others , of a similar nature , may be found in the journals of navigators . Though he has treated only of the currents between the tropics , we shall generalize this principle , and apply it to the principal bays of continents . I reduce to two general currents those of the ocean . Both proceed from the poles , and are produced , in my opinion , by the alternate fusion of the ices . This appears so natural , so new , and of such curious investigation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry with me if I give him an idea of it . The poles are the sources of the sea , as the icy mountains are those of the principal rivers . The snow and the ice which cover our pole , annually renovate the waters of the sea , comprehended between our continent and that of America , the projecting and retreating parts of which have , besides , a mutual correspondence , like the banks of a river . It may be remarked , at first sight , on a map of the world , that the bed of the Atlantic Ocean becomes narrower toward the north , and widens toward the south ; and that the prominent part of Africa corresponds to that great retreating part of America , at the bottom of which is the Gulf of Mexico ; as the prominent part of South America corresponds to the vast Gulf of Guinea ; so that this bason has , in its configuration , the proportions , the sinuosities , the source , and the mouth , of a vast fluviatic channel . Let us now observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of January , on our hemisphere , a cupola , the arch of which extends more than 2000 leagues over the two continents , with a thickness of some lines in Spain , some inches in France , several feet in Germany , several fathoms in Russia , and of some hundreds of feet beyond the 60th degree of lati* Treatise on Winds and Tides , vol. ii . page 385. /q/ tilde , such as the ices which Henry Ellis , * and other navigators of the north , encountered there at sea , even in the midst of summer , some of which were from 15 to 1800 feet above its level ; for their elevation must probably go on increasing , up to the very pole , in conformity to the proportions observable in those which cover the summits of our icy mountains ; and this must give them , under the pole itself , a- height which there is no possibility of determining . From this simple outline is perceptible what an enormous aggregation of water is fixed by the cold of winter , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think myself warranted to ascribe to the periodical fusion of this ice , the general movement of our ocean , and that of the tides . We may apply , in like manner , the effects of the fusion of the ices of the south pole , which are there still more enormous , to the movements of its ocean . No conclusion has , hitherto , been drawn , relative to the movements of the sea , from the two masses of ice so considerable , alternately accumulated and dissolved at the two poles of the world . They must , however , occasion a very perceptible augmentation of its waters , on their return to it , by the action of the sun , which partly melts them once every year ; and a great diminution , on being withdrawn , by the efTect of the evaporations , which reduce them to ice at the poles , when the sun retires . I shall now deduce , from the alternate dissolution of the polar ices , the general movements of the seas , hitherto ascribed to gravitation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equator . It is impossible to deny that the currents and the tides come from the pole , in the vicinity of the polar circle . Frederick Martens , who , in his Voyage to Spitzbergen , in 167i , advanced to the 81st degree of northern latitude , positively asserts , that the currents , amidst the ices , set in toward the south . He adds , farther , that he can affirm nothing with certainty respecting the flux and the reflux of the tides . Let this be carefully remarked . Henry Ellis observed with astonishment , in his voyage to Hudson 's Bay , in 1746 and 1747 , that the tides there came from the north , and were accelerated , as the latitude increased . He assures us that these effects , so contrary to their effects * Ellis 's Voyage to Hudson 's Bay . /z/ on our coasts , where they come from the south , demonstrate that the tides , in those high latitudes , do not come from the line , nor from the Atlantic Ocean . He ascribes them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Sea ; a communication he with much ardour sought for , and indeed was the object of his voyage ; but now we have complete assurance that it does not exist , from the fruitless attempts lately made by Captain Cook to find it by the South Sea , to the north of California . Ellis further observed , that the course of these northern tides of America was so violent at Wager 's Strait , about 65 37 ' north latitude , that it ran at the rate of from eight to ten leagues an hour . He compares it to the sluice of a mill . He remarked that the surface of the water was there very fresh , which puzzled him exceedingly , by damping his hope of a communication between this bay and the South Seas . John Huguez de Linschoten , a Dutchman , corroborates these remarks on the c.urrents of the northern tides of Europe , * and his compatriot , the unfortunate William Barents , f who ended his days on the northern coasts of Nova Zembla , found , north and south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting in from the east , with a rapidity , which he compares , as Ellis does , to a sluice . He found there some Russian fishermen from Petzorah , who made presents of fat geese to the Dutch mariners , with strong demonstrations of friendship ; for calamity has , in all climates , a powerful tendency to conciliate affection between man and man . These effects , then , can proceed only from the effusions of the ices which surround the pole . The ices , flowing with such rapidity to the north of America and of Europe , towards July and August , greatly contribute to our high equinoctial tides , in September ; and when their effusions are stopped in October , then our tides begin to diminish . I shall now proceed to demonstrate , that there is no one tide , on any coast whatever , but what owes its origin to polar effusions . An observation of Dampier 's : will serve as a basis to my reasonings . That careful and ingenious observer dis- * See the first and second Voyages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , vol. iv . page 204. f Consult the second and third Voyages of the Dutch by the north , in the first volume of the Voyages of the East India Company . J Dampier on Winds and Tides . /q/ linguistics between currents and tides . He lays it down as a principle , that currents are scarcely ever felt but at sea , and tides upon the coasts . This being admitted , the polar effusions , which are the tides of the north and east to those who are in the vicinity of the poles or bays having a communication with it , take their general course to the middle of the Atlantic channel , attracted toward the line by the diminution of the waters , which the sun is there incessantly evaporating . They produce , by their general current , two contrary currents , or collateral whirlpools , similar to those which rivers produce on their banks . I am not taking for granted , without any foundation , the existence of the counter-currents , or vortices . These vortices are hydraulic reactions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is completely ascertained by experience . If you look at a small running book , you will frequently see straws floating along the brink , and carried upward in a direction opposite to the general current of the stream ; on arriving at the points , where the counter-currents cross the general , you observe them agitated by these two opposed powers , turning and spinning round a considerable time , till they are at last carried down the general current . These counter-currents are still more perceptible , when such a rivulet flows through a bason which has itself no flux ; for the reaction is , in that case , so considerable round the whole circumference of the bason , that the counter-currents carry about all bodies floating in it , to the very place where the river disengages itself . These lateral counter-currents are so perceptible on the banks of rivers , that the watermen frequently take the advantage of them , to make their way in the direction opposite to the general course . They are still more decidedly remarkable on the banks of lakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers which throw themselves into Lake Michigan , produce , in the middle of its waters , strong contrary currents : ' But these strong currents , ' says he , * ' are perceptible only in the middle of the channel , and produce on the banks vortices , or counter-currents , of which those avail themselves who have to coast along the shore , as is the case with persons who are obliged to take the water iu canoes make of bark . ' /z/ Dampier 's work is filled with observations on counter-currents of the ocean ; but as I believe he did not even suspect the existence of its general current , though he has thoroughly investigated the two currents , or monsoons of the Indian Ocean , I shall proceed to adduce certain facts , which establish the most perfect conformity between the Atlantic current and those which he observed in the Indian Ocean and South Seas . These facts will further prove to a demonstration , the existence of those polar effusions : for , wherever those effusions meet , in their progress southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they produce , by their collision , tremendous tides , whose direction is diametrically opposite . Let us consider them only at their point of departure toward the north of Europe , where they begin to leave our coasts , and stretch out into the open sea . Pont Oppidan says , in his History of Norway , that there is above Bergen a place called Maelstrom , where the sea forms a prodigious vortex , in which many vessels have been swallowed up . James Beverell* says positively , that in the Orkney islands are two opposite tides , one running from the north-west , the other from the south-east ; that they dash their roaring billows up to the clouds , and convert the separating strait into an enormous mass of foam . The Orkneys lie a little under the latitude of Bergen , that is , at the confluence of the polar effusions and of their counter-currents . Other islands of the sea are in similar positions . The channel of Bahama , for example , which runs so rapidly north , between the continent of America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general current of that sea , tides similar to those of the Orkneys . These counter-currents to the course of the Atlantic Ocean , produce , then , our European and American tides , which set in to the north on the coast , while its general current runs southward , at least in the summer time . I shall adduce another instance , which from its importance and authenticity will be sufficient for my purpose . Christopher Columbus sailed from the Canaries about the beginning of September , and steered west . He found , at first , the currents carried him north-east . When he had advanced two * See James Beverell , Beauties of Scotland , vol. vii . p. 1405. /q/ or three hundred leagues from land , he perceived their direction was southward . This terrified his companions , who believed that the sea was there driving to a precipice . Finally , as he approached the Lucayo islands , he again found the currents setting in northward . The journal of this important voyage may be found in Herrera . My opinion is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , with so much rapidity , and is so violent towards its source , according to the experience of Ellis and Linschoten , crosses the equinoctial line , as its flux is not stemmed by the effusions of the south pole , which , at that season , are consolidated into ice . I presume , for the same reason , that it extends beyond the Cape of Good Hope , thence directed to the torrid zone , from which it is attracted by the diminution of the waters , which the sun is there incessantly pumping up ; that being directed eastward , by the position of Africa and Asia , it forces the Indian Ocean into the same direction , contrary to its usual motion . I consider it , therefore , as the prime mover of the westerly monsoon , which takes place in the seas of India , in April , and continues till September . I am likewise of opinion , that the general current which issues , during our winter , from the south pole , then heated by the rays of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is besides determined , on this side , by the easterly winds of the torrid zone , when nothing deranges their course . I farther presume , that this current , in its motion northward , by the position of America , produces various other changes in our tides . It now appears possible to explain the principal phenomena of our tides , from these polar effusions . It will be evident why those of the evening should be stronger , in summer , than those of the morning ; because the sun acts more powerfully by day than night , on the ices of the pole , on the same meridian with ourselves . It will farther be evident , how our morning tides , in winter , rise higher than those of the evening ; and why the order of our tides changes every six months , as Bouguer* has well remarked ; because the sun being alternately toward both poles , the effects of the tides must necessarily be opposite , like the causes which produce them . /z/ But I beg leave to suggest harmonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking . At the solstices the tides are lower than at any other season of the year ; and these , likewise , are the seasons when there is most ice on the two poles , consequently least water in the sea . The reason is obvious . The winter solstice is , with respect to us , the season of the greatest cold ; there is , accordingly , at that time , on our pole and hemisphere , the greatest possible accumulation of ice . It is , indeed , at the south pole , the summer solstice ; but there is little ice melted on this pole , because the greatest heat is not felt there , as with us , but when the earth has an acquired heat , superadded to the actual heat of the sun , which takes place only in the six weeks that follow the summer solstice ; and these give us , likewise , in our summer , the hottest season of the year , which we call the dog-days . At the equinoxes , on the contrary , we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is least ice at the two poles , of course the greatest mass of water in the ocean . At our autumnal equinox , in September , the greatest part of the ices of the north pole , which has undergone all the heats of summer , is melted , and those of the south pole begin to dissolve . It is farther remarkable , that the tides at our vernal equinox , in March , rise higher than those of September , because it is the end of summer to the south pole , which contains much more ice than ours , and consequently sends to the ocean a much greater mass of water . And it contains more ice , because the sun is six days less in that hemisphere than in ours . If I am asked , Why the sun does not communicate his light and heat , in exactly equal proportions , to both poles I shall leave it to the learned to assign the cause , but shall ascribe the reason of it to the Divine Goodness , which has bestowed the larger share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest quantity of dry land , and the greatest number of inhabitants . Admitting , therefore , these alternate effusions of the polar ices , which it is impossible to call in question , and with the greatest facility all the phenomena of the tides and currents of the ocean will be explained . These phenomena present , in the journals of the most enlightened navigators , a perpetual obscurity , and a multitude of contradictions , as often as they /q/ persist in ascribing the causes of them to the constant pressure of the moon and sun on the equator , without paying attention to the alternate currents from the poles , which direct their course to the equator ; to their counter-currents , which , returning 1 toward the poles , produce tides ; and to the revolutions which winter and summer effect on these two movements . It has been supposed indeed in modern times , that the sea must be clear of ice under the poles , and this is founded on the groundless assertion , that the sea freezes only along the shore ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in contradiction to the experience of the most celebrated navigators . The efforts of Captain Cook , toward the south , demonstrate its erroneousness . That intrepid mariner , in the month of February , the dog-days of the southern hemisphere , never could approach nearer to that pole , where there is no land , than the 70th degree of latitude , that is , than 500 leagues , though he had coasted round its cupola of ice for a whole summer ; besides , this distance did not compass half the magnitude of the cupola , for he was permitted to advance so far only under favour of a bay , opened in a part of its circumference , every where else of much greater extent . These bays , or openings , are formed in the ice , merely by the influence of the nearest adjacent lands , where Nature has distributed sandy zones , to assist in accelerating the fusion of the polar ices , at the proper season . The winds , in summer , convey the igneous particles of those zones toward the poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ices ; it being easy to conceive , independent of experience , that the sands multiply the heat of the sun , by the reflection of their specular and brilliant parts , and preserve it a long time in their interstices . There can remain , therefore , no doubt that the poles are covered with a cupola of ice , conformably to the experience of navigators , and the dictates of natural reason . We have taken a glance of the icy dome of our own pole , which covers it , in winter , to an extent of more than 2000 leagues over the continents . It is not so easy to determine its elevation at the centre , and under the very pole ; but the height must be immense . The detached masses , half melted , torn every year from the circumference of this cupola , and met with at sea , pro- /z/ digiously distant from the pole , about the 55th degree of latitude , are of such an elevation , that Ellis , Cook , Martens , and other navigators , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lofty as a ship under sail ; nay , Ellis assigns to them an elevation of from 1500 to 1800 feet . They are unanimous in affirming , that these vast fragments emit coruscations , which render them perceptible before they come to the horizon . I shall remark , that the aurora borealis , or northern light , may probably owe its origin to similar reflections from the polar ices , the elevation of which may one day be determined by the extent of those very lights . The ices in question are more than half melted before they reach the banks of Newfoundland ; for they scarcely go any farther . It is the summer 's heat which detaches them from the north , and they are carried toward the line by the current , where they arrive in a state of dissolution , to replace the waters which the sun evaporates in the torrid zone . These polar ices , of which our mariners see only the borders and the crumbs , must have , at their centre , an elevation proportioned to their extent . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two mountains with their bases applied to each other at the line , the poles as their icy summits , and the seas as rivers flowing from those summits . If , then , we consider the proportions which the glaciers of Switzerland have to their mountains , and the rivers which flow from them , we shall be able to form some faint idea of those proportions which the glaciers of the poles bear to the globe , and the ocean . The Cordilleras of Peru , only molehills compared to the two hemispheres , and their rivers only rills of water compared to the sea , have selvages of ice , from 20 to 30 leagues broad , bristled , at their centre , with pyramids of snow from 12 to 1500 fathoms high . What then must be the elevation of these two domes of polar ice , which have , in winter , bases of 2000 leagues in diameter ! I can have no doubt , that their thickness at the poles must have represented the earth as oval , in central eclipses of the moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this configuration I deduce another consequence . If the elevation of the polar ices is capable of changing in the heavens the apparent form of the globe , their weight must be sufficiently considerable to produce some influence on its motion in the ecliptic . There is , in fact , a very singular /q/ correspondence between the movement , by which the earth alternately presents its two poles to the sun , in one year , and the alternate effusions of the polar ices , which take place in the course of the same year . Let me endeavour to explain my conception of the way in which this motion of the earth is the effect of these effusions . Admitting- , with astronomers , the laws of attraction among the heavenly bodies , the earth must certainly present to the sun , which attracts it , the weightiest part of its globe . Now this weightiest part must be one of its poles , surcharged with a cupola of ice , of an extent of 2000 leagues , and of an . elevation superior to that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which its gravity inclines toward the sun , melts in proportion to its vertical approximation to the source of heat , and as the ice of the opposite pole increases in proportion to its removal , consequently the first pole becoming lighter , and the second heavier , the centre of gravity passes alternately from the one to the other , and from this reciprocal preponderancy must ensue that motion of the globe in the ecliptic which produces our summer and winter . From this alternate preponderancy , our hemisphere , containing more land than the southern , and consequently heavier , must incline longer toward the sun ; this too corresponds to the matter of fact , for our summer is five or six days longer than our winter . A farther consequence is , that our pole can not lose its centre of gravity , till the opposite pole becomes loaded with a weight of ice superior to the gravity of our continent , and of the ices of our hemisphere ; this , likewise , is agreeable to fact , the ices of the south pole being more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mariners have not been able to penetrate farther than to the 70th degree of south latitude , whereas they have advanced no less than to 82 degrees north . Here we have a glimpse of the reasons that determined Nature to divide this globe into two hemispheres , the one to contain the most dry land , the other the greatest quantity of water ; so that this movement of the globe should possess consistency and versatility . It is farther evident why the south pole is placed immediately in the midst of the seas , far from any land ; that it might load itself with a greater mass of marine evaporations , and that these , accumulated into ice around it , might balance the weight of the continents of our hemisphere . /z/ Here I lay my account with being opposed by this very formidable objection . If the polar effusions occasion the earth 's motion in the ecliptic , the moment would come in which , its two poles being in equilibrio , it could present to the sun the equator . To this difficulty I reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AUTHOR of Nature , who is pleased to destroy the instant of this equilibrium , and who re-establishes the balancing of the earth on its poles , by laws to us unknown . This concession , however , no more weakens the probability of the hydraulic cause , which I apply to it , than that of the principle of the attraction of the heavenly bodies , which attempts to explain it , I am bold to say , with much less clearness . This very attraction would soon deprive the earth of motion , if it acted on the stars only . If we would be sincere , it is in the acknowledgment of an intelligence , superior to our own , that all the mechanical causes of our most ingenious systems must issue . The will of GOD is the ultimatum of all human knowledge . Prom this objection I shall deduce consequences , diffusing new light on the ancient effects of polar effusions , and the manner in which they might have produced the deluge . On the supposition then of the re-establishment of the equilibrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its equator to the sun , it is extremely probable that it would be set on fire . In fact , on this hypothesis , the waters under the equator being evaporated by the sun , would become irrevocably fixed in ice at the poles , receiving without effect the influence of that luminary , to them constantly in the horizon . The continents being thus dried up , under the torrid zone , and inflamed by an increasing heat , would quickly catch fire . Now , if it be probable that the earth would perish by fire , were the sun 's motion confined to the equator , it is no less probable , that it must be deluged with water , if the course of the sun were in the direction of the meridian . Opposite means produce contrary effects . We have just seen , that the alternate effusions of part of the polar ices only are sufficient for renewing the waters of the ocean , for producing the phenomena of the tides , and effecting the balancing of the earth in the ecliptic . We believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion to take place all at once . Let it but be remarked , that /q/ the effusion of only a part of the ices of the Cordilleras in Peru , produces an annual overflow of the Amazon , the Oronoco , and several other great rivers of the New World , and inundates a great part of Brazil , Guiana , and the Terra Firma of America ; that the melting of part of the snows on the Mountains of the Moon in Africa , occasions every year the inundations of Senegal , contributes to those of the Nile , and overflows vast tracks of country in Guinea , and all Lower Egypt ; and that similar effects are annually reproduced in a part of southern Asia , in the kingdoms of Bengal , Siam , Pegu , and Cochin-China , and in the districts watered by the Tigris , the Euphrates , and many other rivers of Asia , which have their sources in chains of mountains perpetually covered with ice , namely , Taurus and Imaus : and who can doubt , that the total fusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every barrier , and completely inundate the two continents /z/ For my own part , if I may venture to declare my opinion , I ascribe the general deluge to a total effusion of the polar ices , the ices of the Cordilleras and of Mount Taurus , and the waters diffused over the atmosphere , in clouds , and imperceptible vapours . My supposition then is , that , at the epocha of this tremendous catastrophe , the sun , deviating from the ecliptic , advanced from south to north , and pursued the direction of one of the meridians which passes through the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and South Sea. * In this course he heated only a zone of water , frozen as well as fluid , which , through the greatest part of the circumference has a breadth of 4500 leagues . He extracted long belts of land and sea-fogs , which accompany the melting of all ices exposed to his direct influence . He quickly set on fire , with his vertical flame , the constellation of the bear , and of the cross of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both poles , smoked on every side . All these vapours , united to those of the ocean , covered the earth with * I find an historical testimony in support of this hypothesis , in the History of China by Father Martini , book i . ' During the reign of Yaus , the seventh emperor , the annals of the country relate , that for six days together the sun never eet , so that a general conflagration was apprehended . ' The result , on the contrary , was a deluge which inundated the whole of China . The epoch of this Chinese deluge , and that of the universal deluge , are in the same century . /z/ a universal rain . The action of the sun 's heat was farther augmented by that of the burning winds of the sandy zones of Africa and Asia , which blowing , as all winds do , toward the parts of the earth where the air is most rarified , precipitated themselves , like battering rams of fire , toward the poles of the world , where the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately burst from the north pole , then the most loaded with ice , as the deluge commenced on the 17th of February , the season when winter has exerted its full power over our hemisphere . These torrents issued at once from every flood-gate of the north ; their roaring currents rushed furiously down , partly through the channel of the Atlantic Ocean , hurled it up from the abysses of its profound bason , drove impetuously beyond the line , and their collateral counter-tides forced back upon them , and increased by the currents from the south pole , flowing at the same time , poured upon our coasts the most formidable of tides . They rolled along , in their surges , a part of the spoils of the ocean , situated between the ancient and new continent . They spread vast beds of shells , which pave the bottom of the seas at the Antilles and Cape-de-Verd Islands , over the plains of Normandy ; and carried even those of the rocks of Magellan 's Straits , to the plains watered by the Saone . Encountered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their confluences horrible counter-tides , conglomerating , in their vast funnels , sands , flints , and marine bodies , into masses of indigested granite , into irregular hills , and pyramidical rocks , whose protuberances variegate the soil of France and Germany . These two general currents of the poles meeting between the tropics , tore up from the bed of the seas huge banks of madrepores , and tossed them unseparated on the shores of the adjacent islands , where they subsist to this day . In other places , their waters spread themselves over the ground in vast sheets , and deposited , by repeated undulations , in horizontal layers , the wreck and viscidities of an infinite number of fishes , sea-urchins , sea-weeds , shells , corals , and formed them into strata of gravel , pastes of marble , of marie , of plaster and calcareous stones , which constitute to this day the soil of a considerable part of Europe . Every layer of our fossils was the effect of a universal tide , which deposited on the /q/ soil of China , strata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep . Then all the plans of Nature were reversed . Islands of floating ice , loaded with white bears , ran aground among the palm-trees of the torrid zone , and the elephants of Africa were tossed amidst the fir-groves of Siberia , where their large bones are still found to this day . The vast plains of the land no longer presented a career to the nimble courser , and those of the sea , roused into fury , ceased to be navigable . In vain did man fly for safety to the lofty mountains : thousands of torrents rushed down their sides , and mingled the confused noise of their waters with the howling of the winds , and the roaring of thunder . Black tempests gathered round their summits , and diffused a night of horror in the very midst of day . In vain did he turn an eager eye to that quarter of the heavens where Aurora was to have appeared : he perceived nothing in the horizon but piles of dark clouds heaped upon each other ; a pale glare here and there furrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , veiled by their lurid coruscations , emits scarcely light sufficient to afford a glimpse of his bloody disk , wading through new constellations . To the disorder reigning in the heavens , man , in despair , yields up the safety of the earth . Unable to find in himself the last consolation of virtue , that of perishing free from the remorse of a guilty conscience , he seeks , at least , to conclude his last moments in the bosom of love , or of friendship . But in that age of criminality , when all the sentiments of nature were stifled , friend repelled friend , the mother her child , the husband the wife of his bosom . Every thing was swallowed up of the waters : there remained on the earth no trace of the glory and felicity of the human race , in those days of vengeance , when Nature involved in one ruin all the monuments of her greatness . Such convulsions , of which traces without number still remain on the surface , and in the bowels of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a universal rain . I am aware that the letter of Scripture is express in respect to this ; but the circumstances which the sacred historian combines , seem to admit the means which , on my hypothesis , effected that tremendous revolution . In the book of Genesis it is said , that it rained over the whole earth for forty days and forty nights . That rain was /z/ the result of vapours produced by the melting of the ices , both of the land and sea , and by the zone of water which the sun passed over , in the direction of the meridian . As to the period of forty days , that time appears abundantly sufficient to the vertical action of the sun on the polar ices , to reduce them to the level of the seas , as scarcely more than three weeks are necessary , of the proximity of the sun to the Tropic of Cancer , to melt a considerable part of those on our pole . Nay , at that season , there seems to be wanting but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice the southern coast of Nova Zembla , and to clear the strait of Waigats , as has been observed by Martens , Barents , and other navigators of the north . It is farther said , in the book of Genesis , ' all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . ' The expression , the fountains of the great deep , can , in my opinion , be applied only to an effusion of the polar ices , the real sources of the sea , as the effusions of ice on mountains are the sources of all great rivers . The expression , the windows , or cataracts , of heaven , denotes likewise , if I am not mistaken , the universal solution of the waters diffused over the atmosphere , which are there supported by the cold , their foci being then destroyed at the poles . It is afterwards said , in Genesis , that after it had rained for forty days , GOD made a wind to blow , which caused the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back to the poles tie evaporations of the ocean , which fixed themselves anew In ice . The Mosaic account , finally , adds circumstances which seem to refer all the effects of this wind to the poles of the world , for it is said , Gen. viii . 2 , 3 , * The fountains also of the deep , and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ; and the waters returned off the earth continually , and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated . ' The continual agitation of these waters perfectly agrees to the motion of the seas , from the line to the poles , then performed without any obstacle , the globe being certainly aquatic ; and its annual balancing in the ecliptic , of which the polar ices are the moving power and counterpoise , had degenerated into a diurnal titubation , a consequence of its first motion . These waters retired from the ocean , converted anew into ice upon the poles ; and it is worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty days , which they took to fix themselves in /q/ their former station , is precisely the time each of the poles annually employs to load itself with its periodical congelations . In the sequel of this historical account of the deluge , we find expressions analogous to the same causes : * GOD said again to Noah , While the earth remaineth , seed-time and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night , shall not cease . ' Gen. ch. viii . v. 22 . There must be nothing superfluous in the words of the AUTHOR of Nature , as there is nothing of this description in his works . The deluge commenced on the 17th day of the second month of the year , which was among the Hebrews , as with us , the month of February . Man had cast the seed into the ground , but reaped not the harvest . That year there was neither winter nor cold , from the general fusion of the polar ices , their natural foci ; and the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because then there was no night at the poles , which there is alternately one of six months ; because the sun , pursuing the direction of a meridian , illuminated the whole earth , as is the case now , when he is in the equator . We may , farther , arrive at complete assurance of the general effect of the polar effusions of the ocean , from the particular effects of the icy effusions of mountains on the lakes and rivers of the continent . I shall relate some examples of these last ; for the human mind , from its natural weakness , loves to particularize all the objects of its studies . Addison , in his remarks on Misson 's Tour to Italy , page 322 , says , that there is in the lake of Geneva , in summer , towards evening , a kind of flux and reflux , occasioned by the melting of the snows , which fall into it in greater quantities after noon than at other seasons of the day . About the middle of the Euripus , a strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island of Eubea , now Negropont , the water is known to flow sometimes north , sometimes south , ten , twelve , fourteen times a day , with the rapidity of a torrent . These multiplied and frequently unequal movements , can not possibly be referred to the tides of the ocean , scarcely perceptible in the Mediterranean . A Jesuit , quoted by Spon , * endeavours to reconcile these to the phases /z/ of the moon ; but supposing his table of them to be accurate , their regularity and irregularity is a difficulty of no easy solution . He adds , that in the sea of Persia the flux never takes place but in the night-time ; and that under the arctic pole , on the contrary , it is perceptible twice in the day-time , without ever being observed in the night . It is not so , says he , with the Euripus . I shall observe that his remark with respect to the pole evinces that its two diurnal fluxes are the effects of the sun , who acts , only during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Worlds . As to the Euripus , the variety , number , arid rapidity of its fluxes , prove their origin is also in icy mountains , situated under different aspects of the sun . For , according to that same Jesuit , the island of Eubea , on one side of the strait , contains mountains covered with snow for six months of the year : and we know that Boeotia , on the other side , contains mountains of an equal elevation , and even some crowned with ice all the year round , such as Mount Oeta . If these fluxes and refluxes of the Euripus take place as frequently in winter , which is not affirmed , the cause must be ascribed to the rains which then fall on these lofty collateral mountains . I have no doubt that objections may be started against the hasty explanation given of the course of the tides , of the earth 's motion in the ecliptic , and of the universal deluge , occasioned by the effusions of the polar ices ; but these physical causes present themselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the general progress of Nature , than the astronomical causes so far beyond our reach , by which attempts have been made to explain them . It belongs , however , to the impartial reader to decide . Let us now return to the form of the great bason of the ocean . Two principal currents cross it from east to west , and from north to south . The first , coming from the south pole , puts in motion the seas of India , and , directed along the eastern extent of the old continent , runs from east to west , and from west to east , in the course of the same year , forming , in the Indian Ocean , what are called the monsoons . This we have already remarked ; but what has not been hitherto brought forward , though it well deserves to be so , is , that all the bays , creeks , and mediterraneans of southern Asia , such as the gulfs of Siam and Bengal , the Persian Gulf , the Red /q/ Sea , and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and south , so as not to be stemmed by it . The second current , issuing- from the north pole , gives an opposite movement to our ocean , and , enclosed between the continent of America and ours , proceeds from north to south , and returns from south to north in the same year , forming , like that of India , real monsoons , though not so carefully observed by navigators . All the bays and mediterraneans of Europe , and those on the eastern coast of America , are directed relatively to this current , east and west , so that their mouth only is crossed by them , and their depth is not exposed to the impulsions of the general movements of the ocean . From the calmness of bays many vessels run thither in quest of anchoring ground ; and for this reason Nature placed , in their bottoms , the mouths of most rivers , that their waters might be discharged into the ocean , without being driven furiously back by the direction of its currents . She has employed similar precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into the sea . Not an experienced seaman who does not know there is scarcely a creek but what has its little rivulet . But for the wisdom apparent in these dispositions , the streams , destined to water the earth , must frequently have deluged it . Nature employs still other means for securing the course of rivers , and especially for protecting their discharges into the sea . The chief of these are islands which present channels of different directions , that if the winds or currents of the ocean should block up one of their outlets , the waters might have a free passage through another . Here I can not help observing that we recede very widely from the intentions of Nature , in reuniting the islands of a river to the adjoining continent , for then its waters flow in a single channel only , and when the winds blow in opposition to the current , they can escape neither to the right nor to the left ; they swell , overflow , inundate the plains , carry away the bridges , and occasion most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently endamage our cities . Bays and gulfs are not situated at the extremities of the currents of the ocean , but of islands . At the extremity of the great current of the Indian Ocean is placed the island of Madagascar , which protects Africa against its violence . The islands of the Terra del Fuego defend the southern extremity /z/ of America , at the confluence of the eastern and western currents of the South Seas . The numerous archipelagoes of the Indian Ocean and South Sea are situated about the line , where the two general currents ' of the north and south seas meet . With islands too Nature protects the inlets of bays and mediterraneans . All currents bear upon them , and many are noted for their prodigious swells and their gusts of wind . Not that they contain within themselves the causes of such phenomena , but from their being placed in the foci of the revolutions of the ocean and the atmosphere , for the purpose of weakening their effects . They are in positions nearly similar to those of capes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Hence the sea proverb to double the cape , to express the surmounting of some great difficulty . The ocean instead of bearing upon the retiring parts of the continent , sets in upon and must speedily have destroyed those most prominent , had not Nature most wonderfully fortified them . Every isle has its proper fortification , proportioned to its danger , from the billows , of the ocean . It is not necessary to suppose the water roused into a tempest , to form an idea of their fury . The simple action of the trade-winds , however uniform , gives them the most violent impulsion ; but their course is retarded by the currents which cross it , and the calms which slacken , and above all , by the banks , shallows , and islands which break it . Islands , then , are not fragments separated by violence from the continents . Their position in the ocean , the manner they are defended , and their duration , constitute a complete demonstration of this . Considering how long the sea has been battering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this time , reduced to a state of total ruin . Scylla and Charybdis , nevertheless , emit to this day their ancient roarings , so as to be heard at the extremities of Sicily . Islands have existed , such as we now see them , from the origin of the globe , and are in no one respect the work of chance . They contain , as continents themselves do , mountains , peaks , rivers , and lakes , proportioned to their magnitude . To demonstrate this new truth , I shall again touch upon the distribution of the globe . The chains of mountains in both continents are parallel to /q/ the seas of their coasts : so that if you see the plan of those chains , with its branches , you can determine the shore of the sea which corresponds to them , the mountains being always parallel . You may also , on seeing the sinuosities of a shore , determine those of the chains of mountains in the interior of a country ; for the gulfs of a sea always correspond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These correspondencies are perceptible in the two great chains of the Old and New Worlds . That of Taurus runs east and west , as does the Indian Ocean , enclosing the different gulfs by branches to the extremities of most of their capes . On the contrary , the chain of the Andes , in America , runs north and south , like the Atlantic Ocean . It is also worthy of remark , that these chains of mountains are opposed to the regular winds which cross those seas , and convey emanations from them , their elevation being greater the farther they are removed from the shore . For this reason the chain of the Andes along the South Sea receives the emanations of the Atlantic Ocean , wafted by the east wind over the vast continent of America . The broader that continent becomes , the greater is the elevation of that chain . Toward the isthmus of Panama , where the continent has no great breadth , the elevation of the mountains is inconsiderable ; but they suddenly rise as the American continent widens . The situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility of this grand division of the New World ; for if , instead of stretching lengthwise by the South Sea , it had extended along the coasts of Brazil , it would have intercepted all the vapours conveyed over the continent by the east wind ; and if it were not elevated to a region of the atmosphere to which no vapour could ascend , because of the subtlety of the air and intenseness of the cold , all the clouds borne by the east wind would be carried beyond it into the South Sea . On either of these suppositions , most of the rivers of South America would be dried up . The same reasoning may be applied to the chain of Taurus ; but I shall subjoin some farther observations respecting the configuration of those mountains , to confirm the use to which they are destined by Nature . They are crowned , from distance to distance , by long peaks , mostly of granite , which attract the vapours of the atmosphere in such a quantity , that they themselves frequently disappear . /z/ I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Peak of Piterboth , in the Isle of France , is composed , and perceived on its surface small grains of copper . No doubt it must be impregnated with that metal ; and to the copper we may perhaps ascribe its virtue of attracting the clouds ; this metal , as well as iron , having the property of attracting thunder . I do not know of what materials other peaks are composed , but at the summit and on the ridges of the Andes are found the gold and silver mines of Chili and Peru ; and all mines of iron and copper are at the source of rivers , and in elevated situations , where they discover themselves by the fogs which surround them . Whether this attractive quality be common to granite , to rocks of a different nature , or depends on some metal amalgamated with them , I consider all the peaks in the world as real electric needles . But it was not sufficient that clouds should collect and fix on the tops of mountains ; the rivers which have their sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end , must have ceased to flow , had not Nature contrived lakes in the vicinity of their peaks , to furnish a regular and constant supply . Most of those lakes , of an incredible depth , answer other purposes ; such as receiving the melted snow of mountains , which would otherwise flow too rapidly . When once full they are long in exhausting . They exist , internally or externally , at the source of all regular currents of water ; when external they are proportioned by their extent , depth , and discharges , to the size of the river they are designed to emit , as well as the peaks in the vicinity . These correspondencies undoubtedly were known to antiquity ; for I have seen ancient medals , on which rivers were represented by figures leaning on an urn , and stretched at the basis of a pyramid , probably designed to denote their source and their discharge . The islands which deviate from these dispositions , but few in number , have remote relations still more wonderful , and well worthy of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions , other proofs that they are continents in miniature . Every island has its champaign country , its valleys , its hills , its hydraulic pyramids , and its Naiads , in proportion to its extent . Some few islands , it is true , contain mountains more elevated than their territory may seem to require , as Teneriffe . But that island has mountains of no great elevation proportioned /q/ to its bays . Its peak , covered with ice , is directly opposite the entrance of the great sandy desert , called Zahara , and refreshes its shores and atmosphere by the effusion of its snows , in the midst of summer . Nature has placed other glaciers besides at the entrance of this burning desert , such as Mount Atlas . The icy mountains are principally designed to cool the shores of the seas between the tropics , and the zones of sand to accelerate the fusion of the polar ices . We can indicate only those wonderful harmonies ; but it is sufficient to peruse the journals of navigators , and to study geographical charts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Africa is situated in such a manner , that the wind of the north pole blows most constantly on its coasts ; and that the shore of South America projects beyond the line , so as to be cooled by the wind of the south pole . The trade-winds in the Atlantic Ocean participate of the influence of both poles ; that on our side draws considerably toward the north , and that beyond the line depends greatly on the south pole . These two winds are not oriental , as erroneously imagined , they blow nearly in the directions of the channel which separates America from Africa . The warm winds in the torrid zone blow , in their turn , the most constantly toward the poles ; and it is singularly remarkable , that as Nature has placed icy mountains in its vicinity to cool its seas , conjointly with those of the poles , she has likewise extended a long zone of sand , to increase the heat of the south wind on its way to warm the seas of the north . This zone commences beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extending from the most westerly point of Africa to the most easterly extremity of Asia , in a reduced distance of more than three thousand leagues . Some branches of it deviate from the general direction , and advance directly toward the north . Every icy mountain too has its sandy girdle , which accelerates the fusion of its snows . These zones of sand surround not only their bases , but there are some of them on the higher regions of the mountains up to the very peaks . These sandy belts contribute also to the repair of the waste which the territory of the mountain , from time to time , undergoes : perpetual clouds of dust issue from them , rising on the shores of the sea , where the ocean forms the first deposits of these sands , reduced /z/ to an impalpable powder by the dashing of the waves upon them ; we afterwards find these clouds of dust in the vicinity of lofty mountains . The conveyance of the sands is made from the shores of the sea into the interior of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most considerable happens at the equinoxes , for then the winds blow from the sea into the land . The icy and sandy zones are found in a different harmony on the continent of the New World . They run , like its seas , from north to south , whereas those of the old continent are directed , conformably to the lengthwise direction of the Indian Ocean , from west to east . The influence of icy mountains extends farther over the ocean than the land . Those of the two poles take the direction of the channel of the Atlantic Ocean . The snows which cover the long chain of the Andes , in America , serve to cool the whole of the South Sea , by the action of the east wind which passes over it ; but as part of that sea and its shores , sheltered from this wind , by the very height of the Andes , would have been exposed to an excessive heat , Nature has formed an elbow westward , at the mest southerly part of America , covered with icy mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , may graze along the shores of Chili and Peru . These breezes , denominated the southerly , prevail there all the year round . They do not , in truth , come from the south pole , for if so , no vessel could ever double Cape Horn , but they come from the extremity of Magellan 's Land , which is evidently bent backward , with relation to the shores of the South Sea . The ices of the poles , then , renovate the waters of the sea , as the ices of mountains renovate those of the great rivers . These effusions of the polar ices press toward the line , from the action of the sun , who is incessantly pumping up the waters of the sea in the torrid zone , and determines , by this diminution of bulk , the waters of the poles to rush thitherward . This is the first cause of the motion of the South Seas , as has been already observed . It would appear highly probable that the polar effusions are proportioned to the evaporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of the rivers , all the spoils of vegetable and animal productions . Its shores , within the torrid zone , would have been quickly liable to putrefaction , had not Nature employed different methods to keep them cool . It is for this reason , as certain philosophers allege , /q/ that the sea is salt between the tropics ; but it is likewise so to the north ; nay , more so , if we may rely on the recent experiments of the interesting M. de Pages . The saltness of the sea , however , does not preserve its waters from corruption , as is vulgarly believed . Manners well know that if a bottle or cask is filled , in hot climates , with sea water , it soon becomes putrid . Sea water is not a pickle , but a real lixivial , which quickly dissolves dead bodies . Though salt to the taste , it takes out salt sooner than fresh water , as our sailors employ no other in freshening their salt provisions . The bones of all animals , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red , &c.; on being put into sea water , on the brink of the shore , soon became white as snow . Sea water is impregnated not only with salt but bitumen , and other substances not known ; but salt is in it , to assist the dissolution of floating cadaverous bodies , as that we mingle with our food assists digestion . Had Nature made it a pickle , the ocean would be covered with all the impurities of the earth , thus kept in a state of perpetual preservation . These observations will indicate the use of volcanoes . They do not proceed from the internal fires of the earth , but derive their origin and materials from the waters . There is not a single volcano in the interior of continents , unless in the vicinity of some great lake , such as that of Mexico . They are situated mostly in islands , at the extremity or confluence of the currents of the sea , and in the counter-tide of their waters . This is the reason why we find them in such numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Sea , where the south wind brings back all the substances swimming about in a state of dissolution . Another proof that they owe their support to the sea is , that , in their eruptions , they frequently vomit out torrents of salt water . Newton ascribed their origin and duration to caverns of sulphur in the bowels of the earth : but that great man had not reflected on the position of volcanoes in the vicinity of water , nor calculated the prodigious quantity of sulphur the magnitude and duration of their fires must have required . Besides , Nature does nothing in vain . What purpose could be answered by such magazines of sulphur in the interior of the earth ? They would remain entire in places not consumed by the fire . What , besides , could renovate them Avhen exhausted A supply so constant for keeping up volcanoes is not in the earth , but in the sea . It is furnished by the oils , gO STUDIES OF NATURE . bitumens , and nitres of vegetables and animals , conveyed by the rains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies is completed . Volcanoes take fire , and feed themselves with all these substances . If Nature had not kindled these furnaces on the shores of the ocean , its waters would be covered with vegetables and animals , which could never evaporate , for they resist the action of the air . Nature purifies the waters by the fire of volcanoes , as she purifies the air by those of thunder ; and as storms are more common in hot countries , she has in these likewise multiplied volcanoes , and for the same reason . We find lavas , indeed , in the interior of countries ; but a proof they owe their origin to the water is , that the volcanoes which produced them became extinct when the waters failed them . These volcanoes were kindled by the vegetable and animal fermentations of the earth after the deluge , when the spoils of so many forests and animals , whose trunks and bones are still found in our quarries , floated on the surface of the ocean , and formed prodigious deposits , when the currents accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in this state by the effect of fermentation merely , just as we see stacks of damp hay catch fire in our meadows . It now remains only to refute the opinion of those who maintain that the earth is a secretion from the sun . The chief arguments by which they support it are its volcanoes , its granites , and its progressive refrigeration from year to year . We have demonstrated that volcanoes do not proceed from the interior of the earth ; and granites do not present in the aggregation of their grains the remotest vestige of the action of fire . Agates , flints , and every species of the silex , seem to be analogous to vitrifications , from their half-transparency , and their being usually found in beds of marie , resembling banks of lime extinguished ; but these substances are not the productions of fire , for lavas never present any thing similar . I have picked up , on the flinty hills of Lower Normandy , O3 7 stershells , perfectly complete , amalgamated with black flints , called bisets . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcined , or , at least , altered the oyster-shells which adhered to them ; but - these were as sound as if just taken out of the water . It is a geometrical impossibility that our globe should have been detached from the sun , by the transit of a comet , because it must have , on the very hypothesis of this impulsion , /q/ been hurried along in the sphere of the comet 's attraction , or carried back into that of the sun . It has , in truth , remained in the sphere of the sun 's attraction ; but it is not easy to conceive how it never approached nearer , and maintains the distance of almost 32,000,000 of leagues , while no comet prevents its returning to the place from which it set out . The sun , it is said , has a centrifugal force . The globe of the earth , therefore , must be retiring from it . No , it is alleged , because the earth has a constant tendency towards that luminary . It must , accordingly , have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , as being a portion of the sun . It is also a physical impossibility , that the earth should contain in its bowels so many heterogeneous substances , supposing it a separation from a body so homogeneous as the sun ; it is impossible they should be in any respect considered as the wreck of solar and vitrified substances , seeing some of our terrestrial elements , as water and fire , are absolutely incompatible . But I shall confine myself to the refrigeration ascribed to the earth , because the evidence on which this opinion rests is level to the comprehension of all men , and is of importance to their security . If the earth is becoming colder , the sun , from which it is said to have been separated , must be getting cold in proportion ; and the mutual diminution of heat in these two globes must become perceptible in a course of ages , at least on the surface of the earth , in the evaporations of the seas , in the diminution of rains , and especially in the destruction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the diminution of only a few degrees of heat , when the climate is changed upon them . Not a single plant , however , has been lost of all those which were known to Circe , the most ancient of botanists , whose herbal Homer has , in some measure , preserved for us . The plants celebrated in song by Orpheus , and their virtues , subsist to this day . Such are the testimonies adduced from the vegetable kingdom , respecting the uniformity and constancy of the temperature of the globe : let us examine those of the human race . There are some of the inhabitants of Switzerland , it is alleged , who have perceived a progressive accumulation of the ices on their mountains . I could oppose to this evidence that of other modern observers , who pretend , with as little founda-/z/ tion , that the cold is diminishing there ; but I shall adhere to the testimony of the ancients , who say , that if the refrigeration of the earth is perceptible in the life of one man , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the temperatures described by the most ancient historians , as Tacitus , Caesar , Plutarch , and Xenophon , are precisely the same at this day as they were at the time when those several historians wrote . The book of Job , which contains more profound views of Nature than is generally imagined , the most common whereof were unknown to us two centuries ago , makes frequent mention of the falling of the snows in Arabia , toward the 30th degree of north latitude . Mount Lebanon bears the Arabian name of Liban , white , on account of the snows with which its summit is covered all the year round . If , during a period of more than 3000 years , the cold had gone on increasing from year to year , in all these climates , their winters must now have been as long and severe as in Greenland . But Lebanon , and the lofty provinces of Asia , have preserved the same temperature . The little isle of Ithaca is still covered in winter with the hoar-frost ; and it produces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the olive . /z/ THE earth , say the objectors , is a garden injudiciously laid out . Men of wit , who never travelled , have painted it , when proceeding from the hand of Nature , as if the giants had been fighting in it . They represent its rivers flowing at random ; its morasses as vast collections of mud ; the trees of its forests turned upside down ; its plains buried under rocks , or overspread with thorns ; all its highways impassable ; its culture the puny efforts of human genius . Such representations have sometimes afflicted and inspired me with distrust of the AUTHOR of Nature . To no purpose had He in other respects loaded man with benefits ; one of /q/ our most pressing necessities had been overlooked , if He had neglected to care for our habitation . The inundations of rivers , such as the Amazon , Oronoco , and many others , are periodical They manure the lands they inundate ; and it is well known that the banks of those rivers swarmed with populous nations before Europeans settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the abundance of the fisheries and the fertility of the lands . So far from considering them as convulsions of Nature , they received them as blessings from Heaven , just as the Egyptians prized the overflowings of the Nile . Was it , then , a mortifying spectacle to see their deep forests intersected with water , which they could traverse in their canoes , and pick the fruits at their ease ? Nay , certain tribes of the Oronoco , determined by these accommodations , had acquired the singular habit of dwelling on the tops of trees , and seeking under their foliage an habitation , food , and a fortress . Most of them , however , inhabited only the banks of rivers , and preferred them to the surrounding deserts , though not exposed to inundations . We see order only where we can see corn grow . Our habit of confining the channels of rivers within dikes and mounds , of gravelling and paving our high roads , of applying the straight line to our garden-alleys and basons of water , of squaring our parterres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider every deviation from our rectangles as abandoned to confusion . But it is in places with which we have been tampering , that we frequently see real disorder . We set fountains a playing on the tops of mountains ; plant poplars and limes upon rocks , throw our vineyards into valleys , and raise our meadows to the declivities of hills . Let these laborious exertions but be relaxed , and all this culture , the work of man , will disappear ; demonstrating how inefficient his power is , when struggling against that of Nature . I have not had the felicity , like the primitive navigators , who discovered uninhabited islands , to contemplate the face of the ground as it came from the hand of the CREATOR ; but I have seen portions of it which had undergone alterations sufficiently inconsiderable to satisfy me that nothing could then equal their virgin beauties . To the influence of these first aspects I ascribe the superior talents of the earlier writers who have painted Nature , and the sublime enthusiasm /z/ which a Homer and an Orpheus have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian of Anson 's expedition , Cook , Banks , Solander , and others , have described these natural sites , in the islands of Tinian , Masso , Juan Fernandez , and Otaheite , delighting all persons of real taste , though these islands had been , in part , degraded by the Indians and Spaniards . The Author here goes on to lament that he had seen only countries frequented by Europeans , and desolated by war or by slavery . He , however , excepts two places he had visited in the course of his travels , the one in the Isle of France , the other in Russian Finland . He dwells at great length on the manner in which Nature disposes her plans in climates so very opposite , and concludes his observations by stating , that it would be no easy matter to describe the hospitable reception we found in the solitary mansions of those northern regions . Their masters exerted themselves , in every possible way , to detain us among them for many days together . They sent to the distance of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations , to come and assist them to entertain us ; and the days and the nights passed away in dancing and festivity . Plants are not scattered about at random over the earth ; there is order in their combination . If we examine their expansion , attitude , magnitude , and proportions , we shall find as much harmony in the aggregation of their parts , as in that of their species . It is impossible , in any respect , to consider them as mere mechanical productions of heat and cold , of dryness and humidity , as all these physical causes united could not have determined the port of one single moss . It has been laid down as an indubitable principle , that their saps ascend through the wood , and redescend through the rind . To this I shall oppose the instance of a great chestnut tree , in the garden of the Thuilleries , which , for twenty years past , has had no bark round its under part , and is nevertheless in perfect vigour . On the other hand , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , how is it possible to apply this principle of vegetation to a multitude of plants , some composed entirely of tubes , and others having no rind , but enclosed only in dry pellicles * ? Neither is there more truth in the supposition that they /q/ rise in a perpendicular line , that to this direction they are determined by the action of columns of air . Some , it must be allowed , do follow this direction ; but creeping plants of every species deviate from it . Others ascend vertically , and having arrived at a certain height , in an air perfectly unobstructed , fork off in various tiers , and send out their branches horizontally . All these attitudes may be seen under the same bearing of wind . Nay , some assume forms that all the art of the gardener could hardly impress upon them ; such is the badamier of the Indies . There are plants uncommonly vigorous which recede from the vertical line the moment they get above ground ; such is the false potatoe of India , which loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratan of China , which frequently grows in similar situations . These plants do not crawl from weakness . The scions of the ratan are so strong that the Chinese make cordage of them for their shipping ; and when on the ground , they serve as a trap for the deer , who can not disengage themselves . They are nets spread out by the hand of Nature . I should never have done were I to touch but slightly on the different ports of vegetables ; what I have said will demonstrate that there is not a single one whose direction is determined by the vertical column of the air , an error that has gained currency from its being taken for granted that plants affected the greatest volume of air . Plants , it has been said , are mechanical bodies . Try then to construct a body so slim , tender , and fragile , as a leaf , which shall for whole years resist the winds , the rains , the keenest frost , the most ardent sun . A spirit of life , independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants .

How many Greek and Roman sepulchral monuments of stone riveted with iron , have disappeared ! Nothing remains around their ruins but the cypresses which shaded them ! It is the sun , say they , who gives existence to vegetables , and maintains it . But that all-powerful agent of Nature is not the sole cause even of their expansion . If his heat invites most of those of our climates to open their flowers , it /z/ obliges others to shut them : nay , his remoteness from our hemisphere does not destroy in it the power of Nature . At that season vegetate most of the mosses of the rocks , and then the trunks of trees cover themselves , in humid situations , with plants imperceptible to the naked eye , called minium and lichen , which give them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze . These vegetations , in the severity of winter , overturn all our reasonings respecting the universal effects of heat , as plants of an organization so extremely delicate require a temperature the most gentle . Again , the fall of the leaf itself , considered as an effect of the sun 's absence , is not occasioned by cold . If the palm retains its foliage all the year in the south , the fir is equally an evergreen in the north . The birch , the larch , and other species of trees , shed their leaves in northern climates , on the approach of winter ; but a similar depredation is likewise made on other trees , to the southward . It is the resinous substance , we are told , which preserves the foliage of the fir in the north : but the larch , likewise a resinous plant , is stripped of its verdure in winter ; whereas the filaria , the ivy , the privet , and many other species , not resinous , continue in full verdure at all seasons . Without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves on an attempt to generalize them , why not recognise , in these varieties of vegetation , the steady and uniform direction of a Providence ? That Providence has assigned to the south , trees always green , clothed with a broad foliage , to shelter the animal creation from heat . The animals of hot climates have otherwise been tenderly cared for , in being provided with clothing denuded of hair , consequently light and cool ; and in having their habitations garnished with green ferns and liannes , ever fresh and comfortable . Neither has bountiful Nature neglected the animals of the north . She has spread as a roof over their heads , the evergreen firs , whose lofty and tufted pyramids ward off the snow from their roots , and whose branches are so well furnished with long gray mosses , that the trunk is rendered almost invisible ; for a bed , she has accumulated a bank of moss on the ground , a foot in thickness , and the soft and dry leaves of many trees , which fall precisely at the approach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the fruits of those very trees , then arrived at full maturity . But one of the greatest blessings of Providence conferred on the animals of the north , is their clothing of long and thick hair , which grows in winter , and falls off in summer . Naturalists account for this growth and decay , from the influence of heat . They pretend to support their system by instancing the human hair and beard , which grow rapidly in summer . But I would ask them how , in cold countries , horses , which in summer are sleek and smooth , assume in winter a long and shaggy coat , like the fleece of a sheep ? To this they reply , The internal heat of their body , increased by the external action of the cold , produces this wonderful phenomenon . To this I object , that cold does not produce this effect on the human beard and hair , for it retards their growth ; that in the case of animals , the hair is longer and thicker on those parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail , which is very bushy in horses , martens , foxes , and wolves ; that this hair is short and thick on those parts which have most natural heat , as the belly . Their backs , ears , and frequently their very paws , are most amply furnished with hair . But I merely suppose this last objection ; the external and internal heat of an African lion ought surely to be , at least , as ardent as that of a Siberian wolf ; whence is it , then , that the first is smooth , as if newly shaven , whereas the other is shagged up to the eyes . The cold , deemed one of the greatest obstacles to vegetation , is as necessary to certain plants as heat is to others . Vegetable transmigrations , however , might be effected by employing ice , in the south , for the propagation of the plants of hot climates , as I have seen ice imported from Etna 60 leagues distant , and preserved for months in the sultry temperature of Malta ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe . So far is cold from being the enemy of all plants , that in the north we find forests of the tallest growth and greatest extent in the world ; and at the foot of the eternal snows of mount Lebanon , the cedar , the king of vegetables , rises in all his majesty . The fir , next to him the greatest tree of our forests , arrives at a prodigious size only on icy mountains , and in the cold climates of Norway and Russia . /z/ I shall conclude this Study with refuting an error advanced by some celebrated writers , and highly prejudicial to rural economy , namely , that cold is diminished in the north in proportion as the forests are cut down . One day in summer , about two o'clock , being about to cross the forest of Ivry , I saw some shepherds with their flocks , at a distance from it , reposing under the shade of some trees . I asked them why they did not take shelter in the forest from the heat of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the day , and that they never drove their sheep thither , except in the morning and evening . Being desirous however of traversing the forest , I engaged a lad to attend me as a guide . I felt all the way a stifling heat , much more ardent than was at that hour felt in the open country . I did not begin to respire freely till I had got fairly clear of it , and had made my escape from the edge of the forest more than the distance of three musket shot . I have since reflected on what the shepherds told me , respecting the heat of the woods , and on what I myself had experienced ; and I have in fact remarked that in the spring all plants are more forward in the vicinity of woods , and that you find violets in flower on their borders much earlier than you gather them on the open plain , or on a naked hill . Clearing ground of woods so greatly increases the heat in warm countries , as I have had occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the coast , that the very grass which pushes a way during the rainy season is soon burned up by the sun ; and there results from this parchedness of the coast , the drying up of many rivulets ; for the trees planted on the heights attract thither the humidity of the air , and fix it there . Besides , by destroying the trees on the high grounds , the valleys are robbed of their natural manure , and the plains of the pallisades which shelter them from the high winds . These winds desolate to such a degree the cultivation in many places , that nothing will grow . I ascribe to this the sterility of the heaths in Britanny . In vain has the attempt been made to restore their ancient fertility ; it never can succeed till their shelter and temperature are recalled , by resowing their forests . But there is a requisite prior even to this ; the peasantry must be rendered happy . The prosperity of a country depends , above all things , on that of its inhabitants . /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , to overturn the prejudice which ascribes this principle of life , in plants and animals , only to the heat of the south . I could expatiate on the numerous and extensive chases of elks , rein-deer , water-fowls , heath-cocks , hares , white bears , wolves , foxes , martens , ermines , beavers , &c.,; which the inhabitants of the northern districts annually carry on , the very peltry of which forms a considerable branch of commerce for the markets of all Europe : but I shall confine myself to their fisheries , because these precious gifts of the waters , presented to all nations , are no where so abundant as in the north . From the rivers and lakes of the north are extracted incredible multitudes of fishes . John SchsefTer , in his History of Lapland , tells us they catch annually at Torneo , no less than 1300 boat-loads of salmon ; the pikes are found there as long as a man , and that every year they salt as many as support four kingdoms of the north . But these fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whence is dragged the enormous whale , usually about 60 feet in length , 20 feet broad over the body and at the tail , 18 feet high , and which yields to 130 barrels of oil . The fat is two feet thick , and in cutting it off they use knives six feet long . From these seas of the north issue annually innumerable shoals of fishes , enriching the fishers of Europe . Their size is larger than in temperate latitudes , and their species more numerous . There are computed twelve species of the whale tribe ; and plaice are caught of the enormous weight of 400lbs . But of fishes best known to us , herrings for example , it is an incontestable fact , that these seas every year send out more than sufficient to feed all the inhabitants of Europe . The herring fishery was carried on so far back as the year /z/ non and Seeland . Philip de Mesieres relates , that in 1389 , during September and October , the quantity of herrings in these straits was so prodigious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut them with a sword ; and it is credibly reported , that 40,000 boats are employed for two months in catching herrings ; each boat containing at least six persons , and many not less than ten . ' He makes the number of persons employed 300,000 Prussians and Germans . In 1610 , the Dutch , who carry on the herring-fishery still farther north , where the fish is better , derived a revenue from it of 2,650 , OOO/. sterling . I myself have witnessed in Amsterdam , in 1762 , the joy of the populace expressed by displaying streamers over the shops where that fish was exposed to sale , on the first arrivals ; and in every street this was the case . In 1782 , at the mouth of Gothela , a small river which washes the walls of Gottenburg , 139,000 barrels were cured by salt , 3,700 smoked , and 2,845 casks of oil extracted from what could not be preserved . The Gazette of France , * which contains an account of this fishery , remarks that , previous to 1752 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ascribe their desertion of this coast to the noise of some naval engagement , as is the case with the turtle of the island of Ascension , which forsake the road for weeks together , when vessels passing that way discharge their great guns . It may be likewise accounted for from a conflagration of the forests , which might have destroyed the vegetables that attracted them to the coast . Pont-Oppidan , the Fenelon of Norway , relates , ! that when the herrings coasted along the shores of Norway , * The whales , which pursue them in great numbers , and dart their water-spouts into the air , give to the sea the appearance of being covered over with smoking chimnies . The herrings , to elude the pursuit , throw themselves close in shore into every little bay or creek ; they branch off in such quantities that you may take them out in baskets-full , and the country people can even catch them by the hand . ' After all the united efforts of these fishers can effect , hardly any impression /q/ is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , and Spain , as far as the Straits of Gibraltar ; devoured on their passage , night and day , by multitudes of fishes and sea-fowls , till the column is lost on the shores of Africa , or returns , as other authors tell us , to the north . For my own part , I no more believe herrings return from whence they came , than that fruits reascend the trees from which they have once dropped ; Nature being so magnificent in the entertainment which she provides for man , that she never serves up the dishes a second time . . The immense glut of herrings is astonishing ; but how is that astonishment increased , when it is considered that this column is not half of what annually issues from the north ! It separates at the northern extremity of Iceland , and while one division diffuses plenty over the shores of Europe , the other pushes forward to convey similar benefits to those of America , accompanied by an incredible multitude of pilchers and cod , which renders fish so plenty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to meal with a grindstone , to serve as food for their oxen and horses . It would appear that another column of those fishes issues from the north pole to the eastward of our continent , and passes through the channel which separates America from Asia . But as these seas are not much known to us , I shall pursue this fish no farther . I must however observe , that more than half those herrings are filled with eggs , and if the propagation were to go on to its full extent for three or four generations only , the ocean itself would be unable to contain them . The south pole is not less productive of fishes than the north . The nations nearest to it live on fish , and practise husbandry of no kind . Sir John Narborough says , in his Journal of a Voyage to the South Seas , there must be on these shores an infinite number of fishes to support the seacalves , penguins , and other fowls , which live solely on fish , and are all equally fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day killed 400 sea-lions in half an hour . Their flesh is as tender and white as lamb , and excellent food when fresh , but still better when it has been some time in salt . Here I must observe , that the fish of cold countries only take in salt easily , and retain part of their flavour . It seems as if Nature intended thus to communicate to all the nations /z/ of the globe the abundance of the fisheries which issue from the frigid zones . The western coast of America is not less amply supplied with fish . ' Along the whole coast , ' says Garcillaso de la Vega , * ' from Arequipa to Tarapaca , a tract of more than 200 leagues , they dung the land with the excrement of certain fowls , called sea-sparrows , whose numbers exceed all belief . They inhabit the desert islands on the coast , and by the accumulation of their ordure , they whiten them to such a degree , that , at some distance , they might be taken for mountains covered with snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those islands , as a royal boon to such and such a favourite prince . This dung was entirely the produce of the fishes on which those fowls constantly fed . It will be no easy task , 1 confess , to refer to the beneficence of Nature the wars which animals wage with each other . Why should beasts of prey exist ? Supposing me incapable of resolving this difficulty , Nature must not be accused of cruelty because I am deficient in mental ability . She has arranged what we do know with such consummate wisdom , that we are bound to give her credit for the same character of wisdom in cases where we can not find her out unto perfection . I will , however , declare my opinion , and offer a reply to that question . Beasts of prey are necessary . What otherwise would become of the carcasses of so many animals which perish on the land and in the water , which would consequently be poisoned with infection . Several species of carnivorous animals devour their prey alive . But who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their nature ? Man knows very little of his own history : how is it possible he should know that of the beasts 1 Captain Cook observed , in a desert island in the southern ocean , that the sea-lions , the sea-calves , white bears , sots , eagles , and vultures , lived in perfect concord . I have observed a similar good agreement among the fool and the frigate of the island of Ascension . But , after all , it was merely an association of plunderers ; they lived peaceably together , that they might devour unmolested their common prey , the fishes , which they all gulped down alive . * History of the Incas , book v. chap . iii . /q/ Let us revert to the great principle of Nature : she has made nothing in vain . She destines few animals to die of old age ; nay , I believe , she permits man only to complete his career of life , because his old age alone can be useful to his fellow-creatures . To what purpose would serve , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into existence in the maturity of their experience ? On the other hand , what assistance could decrepit parents find among children which abandon them the instant they have learned to swim , fly , or walk ? Old age would be to them a burthen from which they are delivered by the ferocious animals . Besides , from their unobstructed generations would arise a posterity without end , which the globe is not sufficient to contain . The preservation of individuals would involve the extinction of the species . Animals might always live , I shall be told , in a proportion adapted to the places they inhabit ; but in that case they must cease to multiply ; and from that moment farewell the loves , the nests , the alliances , the foresight , and all the harmonies which subsist among them . Every thing that is born is doomed to die . But Nature , in devoting them to death , does not render the instant of it cruel . It is usually in the night time , in the hour of sleep , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty strokes , sent home in one instant to the sources of life , afford no leisure to reflect that they are going to lose it . That fatal moment , is not imbittered to them by any of the feelings which render it so painful to the human race , regret for the past , and solicitude about futurity . Their unanxious spirits vanish in the midst of a life of innocence , and frequently during the indulgence of the fond illusions of love . Unknown compensations may , perhaps , farther sweeten this last transition . I shall observe at least , as a circumstance deserving attentive consideration , that the animal species whose life is sacrificed to the support of that of others , such as that of insects , do not appear possessed of any sensibility . If the leg of a fly happens to be torn away , she goes and comes as if she had lost nothing ; the cutting off a limb so considerable is followed by no fainting , convulsion , scream , nor symptom of pain whatever . Cruel children amuse themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air thus empaled ; they walk about and perform all /z/ their usual motions , without seeming to mind it . Others take lady-birds , tear off a large limb , run a pin through the nerves and cartilages of the thigh , and attach them with a slip of paper to a stick . These unfeeling insects fly humming round and round the stick , unweariedly , and without any appearance of suffering pain . Reaumur one day cut off the fleshy and muscular horn of a large caterpillar , which continued to feed as if no mutilation had taken place . Is it possible to think , that beings so tranquil in the hands of children and philosophers , endure any feeling of pain when they are gobbled down in the air by the birds These observations might be extended much farther , particularly to that class of fishes having neither bone nor blood , and of these consist the greatest number of the inhabitants of the seas , and they appear to be equally void of sensibility . I have seen , between the tropics , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooped out a large slice of the flesh with a stroke of the harpoon , which was forced backward to his head ; he followed the ship for several weeks , and was outdone by no one of his companions , either in speed or friskiness . I have seen sharks , after being struck with musket bullets , return to bite at the hook , from which they had just before escaped , with their mangled throat . We shall find a great analogy between fishes and insects , if we consider that , neither have bones nor blood ; that their flesh is impregnated with a glutinous liquid , apparently the same in both , from its emitting a similar odour when burned ; that most fishes pass , on their birth , through the state of insects , issuing from their eggs in the form of worms ; that both are cased in scales ; that many fishes are provided with beards and horns , like insects ; finally , that their constitutions , metamorphoses , manners , and fecundity being the same , there is a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensibility . As to animals which have blood , let Malebranche say what he pleases , they are sensible , expressing a sense of pain by the same signs which we do . Let us now proceed to consider the generation of animals . Certain Egyptians told Herodotus , that particular species of animals were formed of the fermented mires of the ocean and of the Nile . Whatever respect I have for the ancients , I absolutely reject their authority in physics . If some of them /q/ have advanced that every thing proceeded from corruption , others , more honest and sincere , have refuted them , even in the earliest times . Corruption produces no one living- body , but is fatal to all , especially to those which have blood , and chiefly to man . No air is unwholesome but where there is corruption . How could such a principle have generated , in animals provided with toes , nails , and claws ; skins clothed with hair and plumage ; jaws pallisadoed with teeth adapted for cutting and grinding ; heads adorned with eyes furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of corruption have collected those scattered members ; unite them by nerves and muscles ; support them by bony substances , fitted with pivots and hinges ; feed them with veins filled with blood which circulates , whether the animal be in motion or at rest ; cover them with skins precisely adapted to the climates they inhabit ; afterwards , make them move by the combined action of a heart and a brain , and give to all these machines , produced in the same place , and formed of the same slime , appetites and instincts so entirely different How could it have kindled in them the desire of reproducing themselves by any other method than that which originally gave them existence ? Corruption , so far from conferring life , must have deprived them of it , for it generates tubercles , inflames the eye , dissolves the blood , and produces an infinite number of diseases in most animals. * The fermentation of any substance whatever could never have formed an organized animal , nor even the egg from which it issued . Indeed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg with the smallest aperture loses its prolific power . The slightest contact with the exterior air , extinguishes in it the radical principles of life . It is neither matter , then , nor degrees of heat , which are wanting to man to imitate Nature in the pretended creation of beings ; and this power , ever young and active , has by no means wasted itself , as it is always exerting itself in their * From this may be concluded how dangerous the putrid emanations from our church-yards must be to the inhabitants of cities . Parish churches , in which so many corpses are interred , become impregnated with an air so corrupted , especially in spring , when the ground begins to grow warm , that I consider this as one of the chief sources of the small-pox , and of the putrid fevers which arc prevalent at that season . /z/ reproduction ; a display of omnipotence equally wonderful with that of conferring existence at the first . The wisdom with which Nature has settled their proportions is admirable . On a careful examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members , regard being had to its manners , and the situation in which it is destined to live . The large and long bill of the toucan , and his tongue formed like a feather , were necessary to a bird who hunts for insects on the humid sands of American shores . It was needful that he should be provided with a long mattock to dig , a large spoon to collect his food , arid a tongue fringed with delicate nerves to enjoy the relish of it . Long legs and neck were necessary to the heron , the crane , the flamingo , and other birds which have to walk in marshy places , and seek their prey under the water . Every animal has feet , a throat , or a bill , formed to suit the soil they tread , and to procure their food . From the different configurations of animals , naturalists derive the characters which distinguish beasts of prey from such as live on vegetable substances . These organs of animals are themselves indelible as their instincts . I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their feet the broad membranes of their species , which on the approach of rain clapped their wings , screamed aloud , and seemed to complain to heaven of the injustice of man , who had banished them from their element . Some philosophers consider the spurs appended to the heels of hogs as useless , because they do not bear upon the ground ; but this animal , destined to live in swampy places , would frequently sink under the impulse of gluttony , had not Nature placed above his heels two prominent excrescences , to assist him in getting out again . How was it possible for enlightened men to misunderstand the use of these accessory members , imitated by our country clowns in stilts ; which , from this very resemblance , they call hogs-feet , and are employed in wading through marshy ground 1 Nature , who varies her means with the obstacles to be surmounted , has bestowed excrescences on the heels of the hog , for the same reason that she has clothed the rhinoceros with a hide rolled up in several folds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal appears invested with a threefold mantle ; but being destined to live in the miry morasses of India , he would have been in danger of sinking from his /q/ enormous weight , had he not been endowed with the strange faculty of extending , by inflation , the folds of his skin , and of rendering himself lighter , by occupying a larger space . What to us appears a deficiency in certain animals , is a wonderful compensation of Providence ; and it would be an exception from the general law of Nature if she had any other than the utility and happiness of the beings which she has formed . Hence the elephant has a proboscis , which serves like a hand as he scrambles over the roughest mountains , where he delights to live , in picking up the grass of the field , and the foliage of the trees , which the inflexibility of his neck would not permit him otherwise to reach . She has infinitely varied , among the animal creation , the means of defence and subsistence . It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of habitual suffering ; for how could a race of creatures always sickly perpetuate itself , nay , become one of the most universally diffused of the whole globe 1 The sluggard , or sloth , is found in Africa , Asia , and America . His tardiness is no more a paralytic affection than that of the turtle and of the snail . The cries he utters , when you go near him , are not cries of pain . But among animals , some being destined to roam about the earth , others to remain fixed , their means of Defence vary with their manners . Some elude their enemies by flight , others repel them by hissings , hideous figures , poisonous smells , or lamentable cries . Some deceive the eye , as the snail , which assumes the colour of the walls , or of the bark of trees , whither he flies for refuge ; others , by an inconceivable magic , transform themselves at pleasure into the colour of surrounding objects , as the cameleon . O , how sterile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He has produced no one thing of which he has not borrowed the model from her works . Genius itself is neither more nor less than the art of observing . Man can not forsake the path of Nature , even when he is determined to go wrong . We are wise only with her wisdom : and we play the fool in proportion as we attempt to derange her plans . Our female friends , too , who , sweetly capricious , amuse themselves with embroidering fancy flowers on their dress , borrow their patterns from the garden . Examine on their gowns and handkeichiefs the sportive productions of their ima- /z/ gination : there you have the flower of the pink on the foliage of the myrtle ; roses on the stalk of the reed ; pomegranates in place of ears of corn . Nature alone produces rational harmonies , and assorts , in both animals and plants , none but parts adapted to the places , the air , the elements , the uses for which she has destined them . Never was a race of monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have frequently heard of living monsters announced for public exhibition at our fairs , but never had the fortune to see one . One day a placard was displayed at the fair of St. Ovide , ' A cow with three eyes , and a sheep with six feet . ' I had a curiosity to see those animals , and examine the use of organs and members to my apprehension entirely superfluous : how Nature had attached two new legs to the body of a sheep , and had formed , to put them in motion , new nerves , veins , and muscles , with their insertions . The third eye of the cow perplexed me still more . I had nothing for it , then , but , like other simpletons , to part with my money to gratify my curiosity . The people were coming out in crowds , delighted and astonished with their pennyworth . I too , at last , contemplated the marvellous sight . The two superfluous legs of the sheep were only two shrivelled pieces of skin , cut out like thongs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and incapable of being of any use whatever to the poor animal . The pretended third eye of the cow was a kind of oval wound in the middle of the forehead , without orbit , without apple , without lid , and without any membrane which presented one single organized part of an eye . I withdrew without examining whether these accidents were natural or artificial , for , in truth , it was not worth the trouble . The monsters preserved in spirits of wine , and exhibited in cabinets , such as pigs with the proboscis of an elephant , children double-bodied , or with two heads , prove much less a laboured production of Nature than the interruption of it . None of those beings could have attained a complete expansion ; and so far from demonstrating that the intelligence which produced them had fallen into a blunder , they attest the immutability of Supreme Wisdom , which has rejected them from its plan , by refusing them life . The benignity of Nature toward man challenges the highest admiration , in defying him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratify caprice ; on the other , she frequently per- /z/ mils him to derange some of them to relieve his necessities . For instance , she connives at the production of the mule from the copulation of the ass and the mare , that being serviceable in mountainous countries , but she forbids the reproduction to proceed , as the primitive species are of more general utility . It is easy to discern , in most of the works of Nature , these maternal condescensions , and , may I call them so 1 royal provisions . They manifest themselves particularly in the productions of the garden . She feeds the human race , in part only , with vegetable superabundance , bestowed as the reward of industry . However fertile the soil , vegetables of the same species with those produced in the garden degenerate in the uncultivated plain , grow wild , and spend themselves in foliages and branches . Is it not , therefore , an instance of wonderful complaisance on the part of Nature , that she should transform , under the hand of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be converted in the forest into lofty stems and tough roots 1 From time to time Nature presents man with varieties both useful and agreeable , extracted from the same genus . All our fruittrees come originally from the forest , and no one there reperpetuates itself in its species . Were she to suspend her particular laws of beneficence in the gardens of our miscreants , to establish in them her pretended general laws , what would be their astonishment to find nothing reproduced but some miserable wild carrots , and unsavoury fruits of every sort , such as she produces on the mountains for the coarse palate of the wild boar . The hen , which lays eggs much too large in proportion to her size , and for nine months uninterruptedly , contrary to all the laws of incubation among the feathered race , would then fall back into the general order , and produce , at farthest , twenty eggs in a year . The hog would lose his superfluous fat . The cow , which yields twenty-four quarts of milk a day , would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this it is replied , that this profusion of eggs , fat , and cream from our domestic animals , is the effect of their copious feeding . But neither does the mare give as much milk as the cow , nor the duck lay as many eggs as the hen , nor the ass clothe himself with fat like the hog , though these animals all feed plentifully alike . Besides , the mare , the she-goat , /z/ the ewe , the she-ass , have only two teats , whereas the cow has four . The cow deviates in a very remarkable manner from the general laws of Nature , who has adjusted , in every animal species , the number of teats in the mother to that of the young ; she , however , is furnished with four paps , though she produces but one calf , and very rarely two , because the two supernumeraries were destined to be nurses to the human race . The sow , it is granted , has only twelve teats , though intended to bring up sometimes a litter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the first has more teats than are requisite to the number of her family , and the second too few for hers , it is because the one in ordained to present man with the surplus of her milk , and the other with that of her brood . Is it not strange that when so many plants and animals exhibit proportions so beautiful , adaptations so wonderful to our necessities , and proofs so evident of a Divine benevolence , we should collect shapeless abortions , pigs with a long proboscis , as if our yards teemed with young elephants , and arrange them in our cabinets as a display of Nature 1 Those who preserve them as invaluable curiosities , and deduce from them consequences and doubts respecting the intelligence of their AUTHOR , discover as much want of taste , and act as unfairly , as one who should go into the workshop of a founder , and pick up the figures accidentally mutilated , metallic moulds which might lie scattered about , and triumphantly display them as a proof of the artist 's blundering ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spirits of wine . Oh ! if the earth were indeed abandoned to disorder , and that , after an infinity of combinations , there should at last appear , amidst the monsters which covered it , a single body well proportioned , and adapted to the necessities of man , what a source of satisfaction would it be to creatures at once sensible and unhappy , to catch but a glimmering of an INTELLIGENCE somewhere , who took an interest in their destiny ! /z/ THE arguments deduced from the varieties of the human race , and the evils accumulated by the hand of Nature , by governments , and by religions , on the head of man , attempt to demonstrate that men have neither the same origin , nor any natural superiority above the beasts ; that their virtues are destitute of all prospect of reward , and that no Providence watches over their necessities to supply them . Our discussion of this interesting subject shall commence with a reply to the objections founded on the varieties of the human species . We pretend not to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale . Some have . a beard , others little , if any . But these pretended characters are accidents merely . Horses white , bay , or black , are animals of the same species . The Jllbinoes , or white negroes , are a species of lepers , and no more form a particular race of negroes , than persons with us who have been marked by the small-pox form a race of spotted Europeans . The black colour is a blessing of Providence to the inhabitants of tropical countries . White reflects the rays of the sun , black absorbs them . The first redoubles his heat , the second weakens it . Nature has employed the opposite effects of these colours for multiplying or weakening , on the earth , the heat of the orb of day . The farther you advance south , the blacker are men and animals ; and the farther you proceed northward , the whiter is the colour of both . Nay , when the sun withdraws from the northern regions , many animals there , in summer , of different colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , to which he is approaching , then clothe themselves with tints deeper and more absorbent . It is therefore by adaptations of climate that Nature has made the inhabitants of the torrid zone black , as she has whitened those of the icy zones . She has given another preservative against the heat to the negroes of Africa , the hottest part of the globe , by reason of that broad belt of sand which crosses /z/ it ; she has covered the heads of those careless tribes with a fleece more crisp than a tissue of wool , which shelters them from the burning heat of the sun . They are so sensible of this , that they never employ a head-dress , there being no description of mankind to whom artificial coverings are more rare than among the negroes . They use those of foreign nations merely as objects of vanity and luxury , and I do not know of any one that is peculiar to their nation . The American tribes under the line are not black , but copper-coloured . I ascribe this weakening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the universal practice of rubbing themselves over with roucou , ( a kind of sweet-scented paste , ) which preserves the skin from the too vehement impression of the sun . Secondly , they inhabit a woody country , crossed by the greatest river in the world , which covers it with vapours . Thirdly , their territory rises from the shores of Brazil to the mountains of Peru , which , giving it a greater elevation , procures a greater degree of coolness . Fourthly , the east winds , which blow there incessantly , contribute to that coolness . Finally , the colour of all those nations is so much the effect of climate , that the descendants of Europeans , settled there , assume the black tint after the lapse of some generations . This is perceptible in India , in the posterity of the Moguls , tribes derived from the extremity of Asia , whose name signifies whites , at this day as black as the nations they have conquered . Taliness of stature no more characterizes species than difference of colour . A dwarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature , however , has rendered it invariable in the human species alone , because variety of magnitude would have destroyed , in the physical order , the proportions of man with the universality of her productions , and involved , in the moral order , consequences still more dangerous , by subjecting the smaller species of mankind to the greater . There are no races of dwarfs or giants . Those exhibited at fairs are little men contracted , or tall over-grown fellows , without proportion or vigour . They reproduce not themselves either in miniature or magnitude , whatever pains may have been taken by certain princes to procure a distinct propagation , among others by the late king of Prussia , Frederick II /q/ All nations have been , and still are , with little difference and very few exceptions , of the same stature . Formerly , we are told , there were real giants . The thing is possible ; but this truth is become to us inconceivable , like all others of which Nature no longer furnishes any testimony . If Polyphemuses , lofty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in walking must , in most soils , have sunk into the ground . How could their long and clumsy fingers have milked the little she-goats , reaped the corn , mowed down the grass , picked the fruits of the orchard The greatest part of our aliments would escape their eyes as well as their hands . On the other hand , had there been generations of pigmies , how could they have levelled the forests to make way for the cultivation of the earth ? They would have lost themselves among the rushes . Every brook would have been to them a river , and every pebble a rock . On either of these suppositions all the relations of natural order are burst asunder , and such discords necessarily involve the utter destruction of all social order . As much as Nature has affected variety in the species of animals of the same genus , though inhabiting the same regions , and subsisting on the same aliments , so much has she studied uniformity in the production of the human species , notwithstanding the difference of climate and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beast , but never was his noble form dishonoured by the tail , the forked feet , and the horns of the brute . In vain is the attempt made to trace an approximation of man toward the class of mere animals , by insensible transitions . There is a much greater difference still between the reason of man and that of beasts , than between their forms ; the dullest of mankind can learn the use of fire , and the practice of agriculture , of which the most intelligent of animals is absolutely incapable . Agriculture is the art of Nature , and fire her primary agent . From experience we are assured , that men have acquired by means of this element , and of this art , an intelligence , of which all their other combinations are merely consequences . Our sciences and arts are principally derived from these two sources . The importance we assign to our talents proceeds not from their utility , but from our pride . We should take a material step toward its humiliation , did we consider that the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the use of fire , attain to the greatest part of the objects of our arts and sciences , and even surpass them . I say nothing of those which build , spin , manufacture paper , cloth , hives , and practise other trades , of which we have no knowledge . But the torpedo defended himself from his enemies by means of the electric shock , before academies thought of making experiments in electricity ; and the limpet understood the power of the pressure of the air , and attached itself to the rocks , by forming the vacuum with its pyramidical shell , long before the air-pump was set a-going . The quails which annually go from Europe to Africa , have such a knowledge of the autumnal equinox , that the day of their arrival in Malta is marked on the almanacs of that island about the 22d of September , and varies every year as the equinox . The swan and wild duck know the latitude where they ought to stop , in reascending to the north , and easily find out the spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which flies over vast oceans interrupted by no land , and regains at night the rock hardly emerging out of the water which he left in the morning , possesses means of ascertaining his longitude , hitherto unknown to our most ingenious astronomers . Man , it has been said , owes his intelligence to his hands ; but the monkey , the declared enemy of all industry , has hands too . The sloth likewise has hands , and they ought to have suggested to him the propriety of digging a retreat in the earth , for himself and his posterity , exposed as they are by the slowness of their progression . So far is the intelligence of an animal from depending on the structure of its limbs , that their perfection is frequently in the inverse ratio of its sagacity , and appears a kind compensation of Nature to make up a defect . To ascribe the intelligence of man to his hands , is to deduce the cause from the means , and talent from the tool with which it works . It is still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there are some shades of variety in manners and customs . The Turks cover their heads with turbans , we cover ours with hats ; they wear long flowing robes , and we dress in coats with short skirts . In Portugal they drink off the sediment of wines , we throw it away . To all this I answer , that we would act as these people , if we /q/ were in their country ; and that they would act as we do , were they in ours . Turbans and flowing robes are adapted to hot countries , where the head and body stands in need of being cooled , by enclosing in the covering of both a greater mass of air . Hence the use of turbans among the Turks , Persians , and Indians , of the mitres of the Arabians , of the sugar-loaf bonnets of the Chinese and Siamese , and that of wide and flowing robes , Avorn by most nations of the South . From a contrary necessity , northern nations , as the Polanders , Russians , and Tartars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to have , in our rainy climates , three aqueducts upon our head , and garments shortened , because of the dirt . Instances might be multiplied to show that the very varieties of national customs prove the consistency of human reason . Climate has no greater influence in changing human morality , which is reason in perfection . I admit that extreme heat and cold produce an effect on the passions , and have remarked that the hottest days of summer , and the coldest of winter , were the seasons of the year when most crimes were committed . But I beg leave to add , that those seasons fertile in crimes , are so too of splendid actions . This effervescence of season acts on our senses like that of wine , producing an extraordinary impulsion , but indifferently to good and evil . Nature has implanted in us two powers , which ever balance each other in just proportion . When the physical sense , love , debases , the moral sentiment , ambition , raises us up again . The equilibrium necessary to the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the habits of society , or of education . Then the predominant passion assumes the command of our faculties ; but the fault is of society , which undergoes its punishment , and not that of Nature . In every country , temperature of climate hastens or retards the expansion of all plants , and the gestation of all animals , the human race excepted : let this be carefully remarked . * In the Antilles islands , ' says Father du Tertre , * the white women and the negresses go with child nine months , as in France . ' I have made the same remark in all the countries through which I have travelled ; and this observation demonstrates that the body of man is not subjected , in this respect , to the same laws with other animals . It manifests a moral intention in nature , to preserve an equilibrium in the popula-/z/ tion of nations , which would have been deranged , had the pregnancy of the women been of shorter duration in hot countries than in cold . This intention is farther manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males and females : it is compensated from north to south , so that if there be rather more women born to the south , there are rather more men to the north ; as if Nature meant to attract and unite remote nations , by means of intermarriages . Climate influences , but does not determine , morality ; and though this supposed determination may be considered as the basis of the legislation of nations , no one philosophical opinion is more completely refuted by historic testimony . ' Liberty , ' say they , ' has found her asylum in the lofty mountains ; from the north it was that the haughty conquerors of the world issued forth . In the southern plains of Asia , reign despotism , slavery , and all the political and moral vices , which may be traced up to the loss of liberty . ' There is in Europe a multitude of monarchical mountains , and many republics in plains . Each has , by turns , made trial of different sorts of government . Neither cold , nor ruggedness of soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the unjust ambition of encroaching on that of others . The peasants of Russia , Poland , and Bohemia , have been slaves for ages ; whereas the Angrias and Mahrattas are free men and tyrants in the south . The Turks , who possess the finest provinces of Europe , issued from the mild climate of Asia . The timidity of the Siamese , and of most Asiatics , has been quoted ; but it is to be imputed to the multitude of their tyrants , rather than to the heat of their countries . The Macassars , who inhabit the island of Celebes , almost under the line , are possessed of a courage so intrepid , that a small number of them , armed with poniards only , put to flight the force under the command of Count Forbin , at Bancock , consisting of Siamese and French , the former numerous , and the others armed with muskets and bayonets . If from courage we make the transition to love , we shall find that climate has no more a determining power over man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is a torrid zone to the heart of man . These appropriations of love to the nations of the south , and of courage to those of the north , have been imagined as effects of climate , applicable /q/ only to foreign nations : but all these distinctions of temperament vanish into air before this simple question : Are the turtle-doves of Russia less amorous than those of Asia ; and are the tigers of Asia less ferocious than the white bears of Nova Zembla Without seeking among men objects of comparison and contrast , from difference of place , we shall find more diversity in manners , opinions , habiliments , nay , in physiognomy , between an opera actor and a capuchin friar , than there is between a Swede and a Chinese . What a contrast is the deceitful Greek , fondly attached to life , to the honest Turk , ever devoted to death ! Their extraction , we shall be told , is not the same ; for pride , among us , ascribes a mighty influence to the power of blood . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowardly Greeks , are frequently their own children given in tribute . But in what instance was an inclination to vice or virtue communicated with the blood 1 Pompey , noted for his generosity , was the son of Strabo , infamously notorious for his avarice . Caligula , and Agrippina , the mother of Nero , were indeed brother and sister ; but they were the children of Germanicus , the darling hope of Rome . What a difference is even observable in the same man , between his youth and mature age : between Titus , stigmatized as a second Nero , in his youth , and Titus at his death , embalmed with the tears of the Senate and people of Rome , and transmitted to posterity as the delight of mankind 1 It is not climate , then , which regulates the morality of man ; it is opinion and education ; and which triumph not only over latitude , but even temperament . Neither place , climate , nation , family , temperament , determine men to vice or to virtue : they are everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring upon themselves , let us attend to those inflicted by the hand of Nature . It is demanded , Why should beasts of prey exist ? They are absolutely necessary . But for them the earth would be in. fested with cadaverous substances . There perishes annually , of a natural death , the twentieth part , at least , of quadrupeds , the tenth part of fowls , and an infinite number of insects . As the rains convey these spoils of the land to the rivers , and thence to the seas , on their shores it is that Nature has collected the animals destined to consume them . The fero- /z/ cious animals descend by night from the mountains , to hunt for prey in this direction ; there are even several classes created expressly for such situations ; as the whole amphibious race ; for example , the white bear , the otter , the crocodile . In hot countries especially , where the effects of corruption are most rapid and dangerous , Nature has multiplied carnivorous animals . Legions of voracious crabs are nestled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borders of their seas ; clouds of sea-fowls hover , with a loud noise , over their shallows , or sail round and round , at the discretion of the waves , in quest of food ; the whole species of cartilaginous fishes , which live only on flesh , such as the long shark , &c.,; and all the varieties of sea-dogs , swim there in crowds , constantly employed in devouring the wreck of bodies thrown upon the shore . The wrecks of all those bodies , after having served for food to the innumerable tribe of fishes , reduced at length into phlegms , oils , bitumens , and united to the pulps of vegetables , which descend from all quarters into the ocean , would reproduce in its waters a new chaos of putrefaction , did not the currents convey their dissolution to volcanoes , whose fires finish the process of decomposition , and give them back to the elements . Animals of prey are by no means an object of terror to man , because most of them roam abroad only in the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive them . Some savour strongly of musk ; others have shrill and piercing voices , heard by night at a great distance ; others are distinguished by party-coloured spots or streaks , perceptible a great way off , on the yellow ground of their skin : all of them have eyes which sparkle in the dark . After all , what is their ferocity to us Even supposing we were not provided with arms and sagacity far superior to all their cunning , Nature has given us dogs able to combat , nay , to subdue them ; and she has adapted their species to those of animals the most formidable . In the countries where lions are natives , dogs are likewise produced capable of engaging them in single combat . The animals formidable to man are more to be feared from their smallness than their magnitude ; there are none , however , but what may be rendered subservient to his benefit . Serpents inhabit humid and unwholesome places , from which /q/ they keep us at a distance , more by their hideous figures than their poisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits , our corn , nay , our very persons . If snails , " Maybugs , caterpillars , and locusts , ravage our plains , it is because we destroy the birds of our groves which live upon them , and would clear our fields , provided the bird-catchers were laid under a prohibition to entrap them , as they do , by whole coveys , in their nets , not to immure them in cages , but to make food of them . A fancy was adopted some years ago , in Prussia , to exterminate sparrows , as inimical to agriculture . Every peasant was subjected to an annual capitation tax of twelve heads of that bird , which were employed in the manufacture of saltpetre , for there nothing is suffered to go to waste . At the end of the second , or at farthest , of the third year , it was discovered that insects had devoured their crops , and it was found advisable to invite the sparrows from neighbouring countries , to repeople the kingdom with them . These birds , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; but these last , among others the weevil , consume the grain by bushels , nay , by whole granaries . If , however , it were possible to extinguish the whole race of insects , it would be the height of imprudence to set about it ; for we should destroy , along with them , most of the feathered tribes of our plains , which have no other food for their young while in the nest . As to the animals which fall upon our corn in the granary , and our woollens in the warehouse , such as rats , mice , mites , moths ; I find that the former are useful in purifying the earth from human excrement , which constitutes a considerable part of their food . Besides , Nature has made man a present of the cat , to clear the interior of his habitation from those vermin . She has endowed this animal with uncommon agility , with wonderful patience and sagacity , and with a spirit of domesticity perfectly adapted to her employment . The weevil and the moth commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said the common hen is sufficient to clear the granaries of them : we have , besides , the spider and the swallow , which destroy them when they take wing . I shall here consider only their political utility . On looking into those prodigious magazines where monopolizers hoard up the provision and clothing of a whole pro- /z/ vince , are we not bound to bless the Hand that created the insect which obliges them to bring these necessary commodities to market ? Were grain as incorruptible as gold and silver , it would soon become as scarce . The commonalty would be deprived of their subsistence , if it were as little susceptible of change as its representative . The mite and the moth first oblige the miser to employ many hands in stirring about and sifting his grain , till they force him at last to dispose of it altogether . How many poor wretches would go naked , if the moth did not devour the wardrobes and warehouses of the rich ? It is most wonderful that articles of luxury are not liable to perish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants of human life . It is possible to preserve coffee , silk , and cottons , even for ages ; but in India , where they are real necessaries of life , the insects quickly corrode them , particularly cotton stuffs . The insects which attack the human body equally oblige the rich to employ domestics , to keep up cleanliness around them . The Incas of Peru exacted even this tribute of the poor ; for in all countries these insects attach themselves to man , though it may have been said they did not pass the line . They are rather teazing than noxious , and draw off the bad blood . As they increase only in great heats , they invite us to bathe , so wholesome , yet so much neglected , because being expensive , it is become an object of luxury . As to other calamities of Nature 's inflicting , man feels their pressure because he deviates from her laws . If storms ravage his orchards and corn-fields , it is because he frequently places them where Nature never intended they should grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man . Forests and natural meadows never suffer in the slightest degree . Besides , they have their utility . Thunder-storms purify and cool the air . The hail , with which they are sometimes accompanied , destroys great quantities of hurtful insects ; and hails are frequent only at the season when such insects hatch and multiply , in spring and summer . But for the hurricanes of the torrid zone , the ants ' and locusts would render the islands situated between the tropics totally uninhabitable . I have already pointed out the absolute necessity of volcanoes , whose fires purify the sea , as those of thunder purify the air . Earthquakes proceed from the same cause . Nature /z/ communicates previous notices of their effects , and where their foci are situated . The inhabitants of Lisbon know well that their city has been shattered by shocks of this kind , and that it is imprudent to build in stone . To persons who can submit to live in a house of wood , they have nothingformidable . Earthquakes are not universal ; they are local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human race , and the diseases of animals , they are , in general , to be imputed to the effects of the corruption of the waters , from which arise putrid exhalations that infect the air , vegetables , and animals . This may be charged , in almost every instance , on the injudicious labours of man . The most unwholesome regions of the earth are in Asia , on the banks of the Ganges , from which proceed of men . They have for their focus the rice plantations , which are artificial morasses , formed along the Ganges , for the culture of that grain . After the crop is reaped , the roots and stalks , remaining on the ground , rot , and are transformed into infectious puddles , exhaling pestilential vapours . In the view of preventing these pernicious consequences , the culture of this plant has been prohibited in many parts of Europe , especially in Russia , round Otzchakof , where it was formerly produced in great quantities . From the ancient miry canals of Egypt , the leprosy and pestilence are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brouage , which the sea-water no longer reaches , and in which the rain waters stagnate , because they are confined , are become constant sources of distemper among the cattle . Similar diseases annually issue from the canals of Holland . The bad air of Rome , in summer , proceeds from the waters of its ancient aqueducts , which are diffused among the ruins , or have inundated the plains , the levels having been interrupted by the magnificent labours of the ancient Romans . The purple fever , dysentery , and small-pox , so common all over our plains , after the heats of summer , or in warm and humid springs , proceed from the puddles of the peasantry , wherein the refuse of plants putrefy . Many of our city distempers issue from the laystalls which surround them , and the cemeteries in and about our churches . /z/ There would not have been a single unwholesome spot on earth , if men had not put their hands to it . The malignity of the air of St. Domingo , Martinico , Porto-Bello , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural effect of climate ; but these places have been inhabited by savages , busied in diverting the course of rivers , and choking up rivulets , as essential to their defence . They imitate the beavers in the fortification of their villages , by inundating the adjacent country . I am the more induced to impute to the savages the corruption of the air , so murderous in some of the Antilles , that all the islands found uninhabited were exceedingly wholesome . As the corruption of the air is a subject peculiarly interesting , I shall venture to suggest some simple methods of remedying it . First , by substituting , in place of the stagnant puddles of our plains , the use of judiciously constructed cisterns , the waters of which are so salubrious . They are employed all over Asia . Care should be taken to prevent the throwing the bodies and other offal of dead animals into the laystalls of our cities ; they ought to be carried to the rivers , thereby rendered more productive of fish . In the case of cities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if this method is found otherwise inconvenient , attention should be paid , at least , to placing the laystalls only to the north and north-east of such cities , in order to escape , especially during summer , the fetid gusts which pass over them from the south and south-west . Secondly , to abstain from digging canals . We are acquainted with the maladies resulting from those of Egypt , in the vicinity of Rome , and elsewhere , when care is not taken to keep them in repair . Thirdly , the attempts made in France to dry the marshes , have cost many men , and frequently been left incomplete . From the bosom of rotten earth arise putrid emanations , scattering death among the workmen . To remedy these inconveniences , I beg leave to observe , that a piece of land covered with water is never unwholesome ; it becomes so , only when the water evaporates , and exposes to the air the mud of its bottom and sides . The putridity of a morass might be remedied as effectually by transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its situation must determine whether of these two objects is to be /z/ preferred . If in a bottom , and without efflux , the indication of Nature ought to be followed up , and the whole covered with water . If there is not enough to form a complete inundation , ditches might be cut , and the stuff dug out thrown on the adjoining lands . Thus we should have canals always full of water , and little isles both fertile and wholesome . Egypt avenges , by the pestilence of her canals , the oppression of the Turks , who prevent her inhabitants from keeping them in repair . America , sinking under the accumulated strokes of Europeans , exhales from her bosom a thousand maladies fatal to Europe , and drags down with her the haughty Spaniard expiring on her ruins . Thus the Centaur left with Deinira his empoisoned robe , as a present fatal to his conqueror : thus the miseries of mankind pass from huts to palaces , from the line to the poles , from age to age ; and their long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth ' Learn to be just , and oppress not the miserable . ' Not only the elements , but reason itself corrupts in the haunts of wretchedness . What torrents of error , fear , superstition , discord , have broken out in the lower regions of society , and swelled to the terror and subversion of thrones ! The more that men are oppressed , the more miserable are their oppressors , and the more feeble is the nation which they compose . First , from the haunts of misery issue forth prostitutions , thefts , murders , and a multitude of physical evils besides , which , in all countries , are the plagues that tyranny produces . But those of opinion are much more terrible . One man subjugates another , not for his property , but to command his admiration , his reverence . Ambition proposes to itself no boundary short of this . However high his condition , or reduced that of his rival , let him have at his mercy the fortune , labour , wife , person of his adversary ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oppressors are thus the oppressed , becoming the arbiters of their own happiness ; and the oppressed paying them back injustice for injustice , disturb them with false reports , religious terrors , &c.,; which engender among them jealousies , law-suits , duels , issuing in their total destruction . This reaction of evils upon each other , is in proportion to the ills they bring upon manP /z/ kind . On contemplating this tremendous balance , we must acknowledge the existence of Sovereign Justice . All governments are internally happy , and respectable abroad , which bestow on their subjects the right of acquiring fortune and honours : and the contrary takes place , when they reserve to a particular class of citizens the benefits which ought to be common to all . When human policy locks the chain round the ankle of a slave , Divine Justice rivets the other end round the neck of the tyrant . The author here enters at large into the benefits and disadvantages of every form of government , in which we lament the compass of our abridgment will not permit us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity and felicity , of injustice and misfortune , and traces the calamities of society up to their very source . For the author 's beautiful strain of reasoning on the subject , we refer the reader to the original work . Religion is now considered as the concern only of the vulgar , a mere political contrivance to keep them in order . Our philosophers oppose to it the philosophy of Socrates , Epictetus , and Marcus Aurelius , as if the morality of those sages were less austere than that of JESUS CHRIST , and the benefits to be expected from it better secured than those of the gospel ! What profound knowledge of the heart of man ; what wonderful adaptation to his necessities ; what delicate touches of sensibility , are treasured up in that divine book ! I leave its mysteries out of the question . Part of them , we are told , have been taken from Plato . But Plato himself borrowed them from Egypt , and the Egyptians were indebted for them to the Patriarchs . These mysteries are not more incomprehensible than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our examination of them we mislead ourselves . We want to penetrate to their source , and are capable only of perceiving their effects . Every supernatural cause is equally impenetrable to man , himself only an effect , a result , a combination for a moment . He can not judge of divine things according to their nature , but to his own , and from the correspondence they bear to his necessities . These testimonies of our weakness , these indications of our heart , being used in the study of religion , we shall find nothing worthy of that name on earth so perfectly adapted to the wants of human nature as the religion of the Bible . I say nothing /q/ of the antiquity of its traditions . The poets of most nations have sung the creation , the indiscreet curiosity of the first woman , and the universal deluge , as if they had copied these histories from the book of Genesis . To the Mosaic account of the creation , and the recent existence of the world , have been objected the antiquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations been accurately made 1 Volcanoes must have emitted their fiery currents more frequently in the earlier ages , when the earth was more covered with forests , and the ocean , loaded with vegetable spoils , supplied more abundant matter to their furnaces . Besides , can we distinguish between what is old and modern in the structure of the world 1 The hand of creation must have manifested the impress of ages upon it from its birth . Were we to suppose it eternal , and abandoned to the laws of motion simply , the period must be long past , when there could not have been the smallest rising on its surface . The action of the rains , of winds , and of gravity , would have brought down every particle of land to the level of the seas . It is not in the works of GOD , but of men , that we can trace epochs . Our monuments announce the late creation of the earth . If it were of high antiquity only , we should , surely , find some productions of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have substances on which time makes no very perceptible alteration . I have seen constellation-rings of gold , or Egyptian talismans , just come from the hand of the workman . Savages , who know not iron , are acquainted with gold , and search after it , as much for its durability , as for its shining colour . Instead , then , of finding antiques of only three or four thousand years , we ought to possess some of sixty , of a hundred , of two hundred thousand years . Lucretius , who ascribes the creation of the world to atoms , on a system of physics altogether unintelligible , admits it to be quite a recent production . If genial Nature gave the heavens no birth , And from eternal ages roll 'd the earth , Why neither wars nor poets sages , tell Till Homer sung how mighty Hector fell ? The religious traditions of our Scriptures serve as a founda- /z/ tion to the religion of the Turks , Persians , and Arabians : they extend over the greatest part of Africa : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all arts originally proceeded : we can trace them in the ancient religion of the Bramins ; * in the history of Brama , or Abraham ; of his wife Sarai , or Sara ; in the incarnations of Wistnou , or of Christnou ; in a word , they are diffused even among the savage tribes of America . One of the monuments of our religion universally diffused , inexplicable on the principles of physics , proves a general deluge , by the wrecks of marine bodies scattered over the globe ; another , irreconcilable to the laws of our politics , attests the reprobation of the Jews , dispersed , hated , despised , persecuted , without government or country ; nevertheless , always numerous , subsisting , and tenacious of their law . Certain illustrious authors have stated these supernatural proofs of a Divine Justice , in a very striking light . I shall satisfy myself with adducing a few still more affecting , from their correspondence to Nature and the necessities of mankind . The morality of the Gospel has been challenged , because JESUS CHRIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swine , which were precipitated into the sea and choked . c Why , ' ask the objectors , ' ruin the proprietors of those animals T JESUS CHRIST acted in this as a legislator . The owners of the swine were Jews ; they transgressed , therefore , the law which declares those animals unclean . But here again starts up a new objection , levelled at Moses , * Why are those animals pronounced unclean V Because , in the climate of Judea they are subject to the leprosy . But here is a fresh triumph to our wits . ' The law of Moses , ' say they , c was , then , relative to climate , consequently , a mere political institution . ' To this I answer , that if I found , in either the Old Testament or the New , any usage not relative to the laws of Nature , I should be still more astonished . It is the character of a religion , divinely inspired , to be perfectly adapted to the happiness of man , and the laws enacted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false religions may be detected ; and as to the point in question , the law of Moses , from its privations , was evidently intended to be the law of a particular people ; whereas that * See Rogers 's History of the Manners of the Bramins. /q/ of the Gospel , from its universality , must have been intended for the whole human race . Paganism , Judaism , Mahometanism , have all prohibited the use of certain species of animal food ; so that if one of those religions should become universal , it would produce either total destruction or unbounded multiplication , in evident violation of the plan of creation . The Jews and Turks proscribe pork ; the Indians of the Ganges reverence the heifer and the peacock . Not an animal exists but would serve as a feticha to some negro , or a manitou to some savage . The Christian religion alone permits the necessary use of all animals ; and prescribes abstinence from those of the land only at the season when they are procreating , and when those of the sea abound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with carnage , and immolated to DEITY the life of the brute creation . The Bramins themselves , so compassionate to beasts , present to their idols the blood and life of men . The Turks offer in sacrifice camels and sheep . Our religion , more pure , if we attend merely to the matter of the sacrifice , presents in homage to GOD bread and wine , the most delicious gifts bestowed on man . Nay , the vine is the most widely diffused of all fruit-trees ; corn is almost the only alimentary plant which thrives in all climates ; the liquor of the one , and the flour of the other , is capable of being preserved for ages , and transported to every corner of the earth . All religions have admitted a plurality of women in marriage : Christianity but one . All have boasted of their genealogies , and , regarding with contempt most other nations , have permitted their votaries to reduce them to a state of slavery . Ours alone has protected the liberty of all men , calling them back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians promises pleasure in this world ; that of the Jews , riches ; that of the Turks , conquests ; but ours enjoins the practice of virtue , and its reward heaven . Christianity alone knew our unbounded passions were of divine original . It has not limited love in the heart of man , to wife and children , but extends it to all mankind : it circumscribes not ambition to the sphere of a party , to the glory of one nation , but has directed it to heaven and immortality : our religion intended that our passions should minister as wings to our virtue . It diffuses charms ineffable over innocence , /z/ and communicates a divine majesty to grief . So far from uniting us on earth , to render us miserable , she bursts the chains by which we are held captive . How many calamities has she soothed ! how many tears wiped away ! how many hopes inspired , when there was no longer room for hope ! how many doors of mercy thrown open to the guilty ! how many supports given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation of the miserable , it was of course designed to promote that of the human race ! Were the Christian religion producing universally its native effects , the earth would be a paradise . Christianity has abolished slavery in the greatest part of Europe . It wrested , in France , enormous possessions from the earls and barons , and destroyed a part of their inhuman rights by the terrors of a life to come . But the people opposed another bulwark to tyranny , viz. the power of the women . Our historians remark the influence women have had under certain reigns , but never that of the sex in general . They are nothing in their eyes unless decorated with titles . It was , however , from this feeble division of society that Providence , from time to time , called forth those who have defended the nation from internal foes , more formidable than foreign assailants . Hear what the good Plutarch says on the subject : ' Before the Gauls had passed the Alps , and got possession of Italy , a violent sedition arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives , the two armies being on the point of engaging , threw themselves into the intervening space , and taking up the cause of their dissension , discussed it with so much wisdom , moderation , and equity , that they gave complete satisfaction to both parties . The result was a unanimous return to cordial friendship , reuniting city to city , and family to family ; so that ever since they consult their wives respecting war or peace , and settle all differences with neighbours and allies conformably to the advice of the women . ' The power of the women proceeds from their oppression . The commonalty , as oppressed as they , gave them their confidence , as they had given theirs to the people . Both parties were wretched , but misery attracted them to each other . They decided equitably , as they had nothing to gain or lose . To the women we must ascribe the taste for raillery , which has at all times characterized our nation . With /q/ a song simply they have often made our tyrants tremble , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the armour only of the weak , because women are the first to use it ; and as , from national prejudice , their esteem is the first of blessings , their contempt must be the most grievous calamity imaginable . Cardinal Richelieu having restored to kings the legislative authority , thereby stripped the nobility of the power of injuring each other by civil wars ; but he could not abolish their rage for duelling , because the root of this prejudice is in the people , and edicts have no power over their opinions when they are oppressed . The edict of the prince prohibits the gentleman to meet his antagonist in single combat , and the opinion of his valet-de-chambre forces him out . The nobility arrogate to themselves all the national honour , but the people determine the object of it , and allot its proportions . Gold , however , has levelled every rival influence , and triumphed over even the power of women . As most men are shocked at abuses , only by seeing them in detail , because every thing great dazzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of the effect of venality in the lower orders of society . All the subaltern conditions which naturally rank under others , of right , are become the superiors , in fact , merely because they are the richer . Accordingly , it is the apothecary , now-a-days , who has the employing of the physician ; the attorney of the advocate ; the handicraft of the merchant ; the master-mason of the architect ; the bookseller of the scholar , even those of the academy ; the chair-hirer in church of the preacher , &c.; It is easy to see to what all this leads . From this venality alone must ensue the decline of all talents . The nobility having preserved a part of their privileges in the country , trades-people , possessed of fortune , do not choose to live there , for fear of being exposed to insult or confounded with the peasantry . They like better to live in small cities , in indolence and listlessness , than to vivify the fields which degrade their cultivators . Hence small landed estates sink in value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If wealthy families were permitted to purchase the lands lying commodiously for them , such bargains would speedily become fatal to the state . I have often been astonished that there is no law in France to prevent the un- /z/ bounded accumulation of landed property . The Romans had censors , who limited the extent of a man 's possessions to seven acres , as being sufficient for the subsistence of one family . By the word acre , was understood as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in one day . As Rome increased in luxury , it was extended to 500 : but even this law was soon infringed , and the infraction hurried forward the ruin of the republic . Conquerors have always met with feeble resistance in countries where property is unequally divided . Overgrown estates destroy the spirit of patriotism in those who have every thing and those who have nothing . ' The shocks of corn , ' said Xenophon , ( inspire those who raise them , with courage to defend them . The sight of them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre to crown the conqueror . ' Such is the danger to which excessive accumulation of property exposes a state outwardly ; but the internal mischief it produces among the citizens , and on the state of lands , is not less to be deplored . It is not upon the face of vast dominions , but in the bosom of industry , that the FATHER of mankind pours out the precious fruits of the earth . Enormous property causes poverty all over the kingdom , for the very same reason which has procured it the eulogium of many of our writers , namely , that it spares men the labours of agriculture . In many places there is no employment for the peasantry during a great part of the year ; but I shall insist only on their wretchedness , which seems to increase with the riches of the district they inhabit . The district of Caux is the most fertile country in the world . Agriculture , on the great scale , is there carried to the height of perfection ; but as the laws have there assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-born , you find unbounded affluence on the one hand , and extreme indigence on the other . I happened one day to be walking through this fine country , admiring as I went its plains , so well cultivated and so extensive , that the eye loses itself in the unbounded prospect . It was in the month of March , and very early in the morning . It blew extremely cold from the north-east . I perceived something red running across the fields , about a quarter of a league before me . I got up in time to see that they were two little girls in red jackets and wooden shoes , /q/ who were scrambling through the ditch which bounded the road . The tallest , about six or seven years old , was crying bitterly . * Child , ' said I , ' what makes you cry , and whithei are you going at so early an hour ' ' Sir , ' replied she , my poor mother is veiy ill . There is not a mess of broth to be had in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom , to try if the cure of this parish can find us some . I am crying because my little sister is not able to walk any farther . ' As she spake she wiped her eyes with a bit of canvass , which served her for a petticoat . On her raising up the rag to her face , I could perceive that she had not the semblance of a shift . The abject misery of the children , in the midst of plains so fruitful , wrung my heart . The relief which I could administer was small indeed . I myself was then on my way to see misery in other forms . Indeed the number of wretches in the best cantons of this province amount to a fourth , nay , to a third of the inhabitants in every parish ; and many other provinces of the kingdom are incomparably worse than Normandy . The spirit of finance has accumulated all these woes on the heads of the people , by stripping them of the means of subsistence , and sapping the foundations of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressors by their own , opposing corruption to corruption . From the prolific womb of vulgar debauchery issue buffoons , comedians , dealers in luxury , nay , even men of letters , who , to flatter the rich , and save themselves from indigence , extend dissipation of manners and opinions to the extremity of Europe . In the class of the unmarried vulgar we find the most powerful bulwark opposed to rank and wealth . This numerous body comprehends not only the youth of both sexes , but those who , from peculiarity of condition , are deprived of the honours of society and the first pleasures of Nature ; an association which has all reputations at their mercy , disturbing the peace of families at their will . These persons retail for a dinner that inexhaustible collection of anecdotes , favourable or unfavourable , which are in every instance to regulate public opinion . A rich man can not marry a handsome wife , nor enjoy himself at home in his own way ; those persons oblige him , unless he would be laughed at , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must adopt the manners which his plebeian dictators prescribe , however contradictory to /z/ Nature , however inconsistent with conjugal felicity . While they dispose of the reputation and pleasures of the rich , two of the columns attack their fortune in front ; one employs intimidation , the other seduction . My present reflections shall not be confined to the power and wealth acquired by several religious orders , but extend to their number in general . Politicians pretend that France would become too populous were there no convents in it . Are England and Holland over-peopled , where there are none 1 It betrays , besides , little acquaintance with the resources of Nature . The more inhabitants a country contains , the more productive it is . France could maintain , perhaps , four times more people than it now contains , if parcelled out into small freeholds . We must not form our judgment of its fertility from its immense domains . Those vast deserted districts yield only one crop in two years , or , at most , two in three . But with how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , in the same field , cherrytrees growing in potato-beds ; vines clambering up the cherry-trees , and lofty walnut-trees rising above the vines ; four crops , one above another , within the earth , upon the earth , and in the air , even in the meadow land of St. Gervais , near Paris . In a word every species of vegetable is there produced by the industry of cultivation . Here a young rustic , with a basket and ladder , mounts a fruit-tree , like another Vertumnus ; while some young girl , in the adjoining valley , sings her song loud enough to be heard by him , presenting the image of another Pomona . If cruel prejudices have stricken with sterility and solitude a considerable part of France , and have henceforth allotted the possession of a great kingdom to a little handful of proprietors , how is it that , instead of founders of new orders , founders of new colonies do not arise among us , as among the Egyptians and the Greeks * ? Shall France never have to boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we force the African tribes to cultivate our lands in America , while our starving peasantry want employment at home Why not transport thither our poor by families ; children , old men , lovers , cousins , nay , the very churches and saints of our villages , that , they may find in those far distant lands the loves and the illusions of a country . Ah ! had liberty and equality been invited to those regions where Nature does so much with /q/ moderate cultivation , the cottages of the New World would , at this day , have been preferable to the palaces of the Old . Politicians consider war as necessary to a state , because , as they pretend , it takes off the superflux of mankind . In general they have a very limited knowledge of human nature . Independent of the resources of the subdivision of property , which multiplies the fruits of the earth , there is no country but what has the means of emigration within its reach , especially since the discovery of the New World . Besides , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . China and Bengal are , I believe , the countries on the globe which contain most inhabitants . In China ' , nevertheless , are many and extensive deserts , amidst its finest provinces , because avarice attracts their cultivators to the vicinity of great rivers and cities , for the conveniency of commerce . Many enlightened travellers have made this observation . Generally to the excessive number of bachelors may be ascribed that of profligate women ; they are in exact proportion to each other . This evil , too , is the effect of a natural reaction . As the two sexes are born and die in nearly equal numbers , every man comes into the world and leaves it in company with his female . He , therefore , who prefers celibacy to marriage , dooms a female to a single life . The ecclesiastical order robs the sex of so many husbands , and the social order deprives them of the means of subsistence ; our manufactures and machinery have swallowed up almost all the arts by which they were formerly enabled to earn a livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embroider , weave , &c.; employments which in better times so many worthy matrons followed , but are now entirely engrossed by persons bred to the business ; but we have , forsooth ! tailors , shoemakers , male hair-dressers for the ladies . We have men-milliners , dealers in linen , gauze , muslin , gum-flowers . Men are not ashamed to assume the easy and commodious occupation , leaving to the poor women the rougher and more laborious . We have female dealers in cattle , in pigs ; others who vend bricks and navigate barges ; some even labour in quarries . We meet multitudes in Paris sweating under an enormous load of linen , under heavy water-pails , blacking shoes on the quays ; others yoked , like beasts , to little carts . Thus the sexes unsex themselves ; the men dwindle into females , the /z/ women harden into men . Females , in truth , would rather turn their charms to account than their strength . But what mischief is every day produced by women of the town ! What conjugal infidelity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night begun to spread her curtain , when every street , every place of resort , swarms with them ; at every corner they lie in wait for their prey . Kept mistresses loll it away to the opera in magnificent equipages , every one ol them bent on melting down a fortune . It is thus GOD punishes the oppressors of a people by the oppressed . An attempt has lately been made to encourage virtue in our poor country girls , by festivals called rose-feasts ; when our Paris trades-people crown our rustic vestals , and condescend likewise to permit the youthful peasants to eat at the same table with themselves for that day ; for the rich , and our city dames in business , do not put themselves on a level with the female peasantry , even at the foot of the altar . But you who bestow crowns on virtue , are you not afraid of blighting the prize by your touch 1 Noble and generous effort ! They bestow a garland of roses upon indigent virtue in the country , while in the city vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the punishments of guilt appear as injudiciously adjusted as the rewards of virtue . We too frequently hear these terrible words , The sentence of condemnation ! but never , The sentence of reward . Crimes are repressed by infamous punishments . A simple brand inflicted , instead of reforming the criminal , frequently plunges him deeper in guilt , and often drives his family into vicious courses . Where can an unhappy wretch find refuge , who has been publicly whipped , branded , and drummed out 1 Necessity has made him a thief ; indignation and despair will hurry him on to murder . His relations , dishonoured in the public estimation , abandon their homes , and become vagabonds . His sisters give themselves up to prostitution . These effects of the fear which the hangman impresses on the lower orders , are considered as prejudices salutary to them , but they produce unspeakable mischief . The vulgar extend them to actions the most indifferent , and convert them into bitter aggravations of misery , not from a sense of honour , nor even from the shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The decapitation of a man for treason , /q/ or his being shot for desertion , are considered as no stigma on his family . The people , sunk below their level , despise that only which is peculiar to themselves , and show no pity in their decisions , because they are miserable . The wretchedness of the lower orders is , therefore , the principal source of our physical and moral maladies . There is another , no less fertile in mischief , I mean the education of children . This branch of political economy engaged , among the ancients , the attention of the greatest legislators ; with us education has no manner of reference to the constitution of the state . In early life are formed the inclinations and aversions which influence the whole of our existence . Our first affections are likewise the last ; they accompany us through life , reappear in old age , and then revive the sensibilities of childhood with still greater force than those of mature age . Wise Nature , in giving so much more force to early habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned to promote it our parents ; for on the affections they at that season inspire depends the affection we are one day called upon to return . But with us , as soon as the child is born , he is transferred to a mercenary nurse . The first bond Nature intended should attach him to his parents is burst asunder before it is formed . The day will come , perhaps , when he will behold the funeral procession of those who gave him birth leave his father 's door with as much indifference as they saw his cradle turned out . He may be recalled home , it is true , at the age when the graces , when innocence , when the necessity of having an object of affection , should fix him there for ever . But he is permitted to taste those sweets only to make him feel , in a little while , the bitterness of losing them . He is sent to school , and boarded far from home . There he is doomed to shed tears which no maternal hand is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendships with strangers pregnant with regret and repentance ; and there he must learn to extinguish the natural affections of brother , sister , father , and mother , the most powerful and the sweetest chains by which Nature attaches us to our country . After this first horrid outrage committed on his young heart , others equally violent are offered to his understanding . His tender memory must be loaded with ablatives , conjunc- /z/ tions , conjugations . The blossom of human life Is sacrificed to the metaphysical jargon of a dead language . What Frenchman could submit to the torture of learning his own in that manner ? And if there be those who have exercised such laborious patience , do they speak better than persons who have never endured such drudgery Who writes best , a lady of the court , or a pedantic grammarian ? To learn to speak by grammar rules , is the same thing with learning to walk by the laws of equilibrium . Practice teaches the grammar of a language , and the passions are our best instructors in the rhetoric of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus repressed by an unnatural constraint , transforming it into a state , sad , sedentary , and speculative , which has a dismal influence on the temperament , by ingrafting upon it maladies without number . Of love and ambition , the two moving principles of the human heart , the last is by far the most durable and dangerous . It dies last in the aged , and our education puts it prematurely in motion in the young . It would be infinitely better to assist them in directing their early tender affections toward an amiable object . Most men are destined to feel the power of this gentle passion , which Nature has made the firmest cement of society . If their age forbid a commerce of early love , their affections ought to be directed into the channel of friendship , and thus battalions of friends might be formed among them , prepared to devote themselves in the service of their country. * Ambition , give it what specious name you please , is the sworn enemy of all virtue , the source of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratify it in his own way . It is forbidden by Nature and Religion . But emulation , we are told , awakens talents . It would be easy to demonstrate that the most celebrated writers , in every walk of literature , never were brought up at college , from Homer , acquainted with no language but his own , down to J. J. Rousseau , who was a very indifferent Latin scholar . How many young men have made a brilliant figure in the run of the classes , who were by and by totally eclipsed in the vast sphere of literature ! Italy is crowded with colleges /q/ and academies ; but can she boast , at this day , of so much as one man eminently distinguished 1 Do we not see there , on the contrary , talents distracted , by ill-assorted societies , jealousies , cabals , intrigues , and ambition , become enfeebled and melt away 1 I think I perceive another reason of this decline ; nothing is studied in those seminaries but methods and forms of learning , or what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track of a master , forces us out of the path of Nature , the source of all talents . Observe the arts brought to the highest perfection in France , and you will find they are those for which there is no public school , no prize , no academy ; such as milliners , jewellers , hair-dressers , cooks , &c.; We have , it is true , men of high reputation in the liberal arts , and in the sciences ; but these men acquired their talents before they were admitted into academies . But admitting that talents are formed in colleges , they would not for that be less prejudicial to the nation ; for it is more important that a country should possess virtue than talents , and that men should be happy than renowned . A treacherous glare covers the vices of those who succeed in our colleges . But in the multitude who never succeed , all the vices of a negative ambition are already in a state of fermentation , and prepared to burst forth , at the command of their leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above his equals , by the title of emperor , and even above the whole human race , by that of son of the church , he is cruelly brought low by rigorous and degrading punishments. * I have seen , at college , many a pretty creature , ready to swoon with pain , receive on their little hands a dozen sharp strokes ; and by the infliction of this punishment , the skin separated from the tip of their fingers . What shall be said of those infamous punishments , which produce a disgraceful effect on the morals of both scholars and regents 1 It is impossible to enter on this subject without putting modesty to the blush . And yet they are employed by priests ! Our children , subverted by the vices of a faulty education , * Consult Montane 's Essays , book i. chap . 25 . Montagne was one of those men not educated at college . He was instructed without tasting corporal punishment , and without emulation , under the paternal roof , by the gentlest of fathers , and by preceptors whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became , by means of an education diametrically opposite to ours , one of the beet and most intelligent men of the nation . /z/ become false reasoners , knavish , hypocritical , envious , ugly , and wicked . In proportion as they increase in age , they increase also in malignity and the spirit of contradiction . Not a schoolboy knows any thing of the laws of his country , but some may have heard talk about those of the twelve tables . No one of them can tell how our own wars are conducted ; but many can entertain you with those of the Greeks and Romans . They all know single combat is prohibited ; yet many go to the fencing-schools , where the only thing taught is to fight duels . Others , destined to functions more peaceful , are put to school to learn the art of disputation . Truth , we are gravely told , is struck out of the collision of opinions . Out of disputations have arisen sophisms , paradoxes , errors of every kind . Truth never shows her face before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant if he could . The light of truth has no resemblance to the fatal coruscations of thunder , but to the brightness of the sun when heaven is without a cloud . I shall not follow our youth into the world , where he would be sufficiently unhappy , supposing him to have preserved only that fear of blame and desire of commendation under which his studies were conducted . Influenced by the opinion of another , himself possessing no steady principle , the silliest of women will rule over him with more unbounded empire than his professor . All I plead for is , that children should be delivered , at least , from that tedious apprenticeship of misery , by which they are depraved , at the happiest and most amiable period of their existence , and which has afterward so much influence on their characters . Man is born good , society renders him wicked , and our mode of education prepares the way for it . Trace the history of a villain 's life , and we shall find his infancy has been miserable . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly ; but where I saw them happy , they were beautiful and good . In Holland and Flanders , where they are brought up with the greatest gentleness , their beauty is singularly remarkable . You never hear them , as in our cities , uttering loud and bitter cries ; still less are they threatened with the rod by their mothers and nurses ; they are not gay , but contented . You observe on their countenance an air of tranquillity and satisfaction /q/ perfectly enchanting , and infinitely more interesting 1 than the boisterous mirth of our young- people , when they are no longer under the eye of their fathers or preceptors . This calmness diffused over all their actions , is the source of a happy composure during their whole life . I never saw any country where parental tenderness was so strikingly expressed ; the children repay in their old age the indulgence with which they were treated in helpless infancy . By bonds so endearing are those people so powerfully attached to their country , that we find very few of them settling among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children sprightly than good , because in an ambitious society , spirit raises man to the head of a party , but goodness makes dupes . They have epigrams composed by their children ; but wit being only the perception of the relations of society , children scarcely ever have any but what is borrowed . Wit itself is frequently , in them , the proof of a miserable existence , as may be remarked in the schoolboys of our cities , who usually are sprightlier than the children of the peasantry ; but in general they are all forward in point of feeling ; and this reflects great blame on those who degrade them , at an age when they feel more delicately than men . Affecting instances of sensibility are not unfrequent in the children of the common people . Walking through the Pre St. Gervais , about the setting in of winter , I observed a poor woman , lying along the ground , weeding a bed of sorrel ; close by her was a little girl , of six years old at most , standing motionless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman , who was indisposed , and inquired into the nature of her malady . ' Sir , ' said she , c for three months past , I have suffered severely from the rheumatism ; but my disease gives me less pain than that poor child does : she will not quit me a single moment . If I say to her , See , you are quite benumbed with cold , go and warm yourself ; she replies , Alas ! mother , if 1 leave you , your complaints will be your only companion . ' Another time , being in the park at Marly , I there found three children , two little girls , employed with singular activity in picking up the scattered sticks of dry wood , which they deposited in a basket , and a little boy , all in tatters , and extremely lean , devouring a morsel of bread . I asked the tallest what she intended to do with the wood ; she replied , /z/ ' Look , sir , at that poor boy ; he is very miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who sends him out , all day long , to pick up wood : if he carries none home , he is beaten severely ; when he happens to have got a little , and is carrying it off , the Swiss at the park gate takes it from him , and applies it to his own use . He is half dead with hunger , and we have given him our breakfast . ' Having thus spoken , she and her companion filled the little basket ; helped him up with it on his back , and ran away before their unhappy friend to the gate of the park , to see if he could pass unmolested . Foolish instructors ! Human nature , you tell us , is corrupted : yes , but you are the persons who corrupt it by contradictions , by unprofitable studies , by dangerous ambition , by shameful chastisements : and by an equitable reaction of Divine Justice , that feeble and unfortunate generation will one day give back to that which oppresses it , all the mischief which it first received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say , that my tyrants are punished , if I am still to be the victim of tyranny ? Is it possible that such compensations should be the work of GOD ? Great philosophers , who have devoted their whole life to the study of Nature , have refused to acknowledge its Author . Who hath seen GOD at any time 1 What is it that constitutes GOD But taking it for granted that an intelligent Being directs the affairs of this universe , man assuredly is abandoned to himself : no hand has traced his career : as far as he is concerned , there are , apparently , two Deities ; the one inviting him to unbounded enjoyment , and the other dooming him to endless privation ; one God of Nature , and another God of Religion . Man is left totally uncertain whether of the two he is bound to please ; and whatever be the choice which he /q/ is determined to make , how can he tell whether he is rendering himself an object of love or of hatred 1 6 His virtue itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable , both inwardly and outwardly ; it reduces him to a state of perpetual warfare with himself , and with the world , to the interests of which he is obliged to make a sacrifice of himself . If he is chaste , the world calls him impotent ; if religious , he is accounted silly ; if he discovers benignity of disposition , it is because he wants courage ; if he devotes himself for the good of his country , he is fanatic ; if simple , he is duped ; if modest , he is supplanted ; everywhere he is derided , betrayed , despised , now by the philosopher , and now by the devotee . On what foundation can he build the hope of a recompense for so many struggles and mortifications 1 On a life to come ? What assurance has he of its existence ? Where is the traveller that ever returned from thence ? * What is the soul of man ? Where was it a hundred years ago Where will it be a century hence 1 It expands with the senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in sleep , in a lethargy 1 It is the illusion of pride to imagine it immortal : Nature universally points to death , in his monuments , in his appetites , in his loves , in his friendships : man is universally reduced to the necessity of drawing a veil over this idea . In order to live less miserable , he ought to divert himself , that is , as the word literally imports , he ought to turn aside from that dismal perspective of woes which Nature is presenting to him on every side . To what hopeless labours has she not subjected his miserable life ? The beasts of the field are a thousand times happier ; clothed , lodged , fed by the hand of Nature , they give themselves up without solicitude to the indulgence of their passions , and finish their career without any presentiment of death , and without any fear of an hereafter . ' If there be a GOD who presides over the destiny of all , he must be inimical to the felicity of the human race . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , if I have not the shade of a single tree at my disposal ? Of what importance to me are the laws of harmony and of love , which govern Nature , if I behold around me only objects faithless and deceiving ; or if my fortune , my condition , my religion , impose celibacy upon me ? The general felicity diffused over /z/ the earth , serves only as a bitter aggravation of my particular wretchedness . What interest is it possible for me to take in the wisdom of an arrangement which renovates all things , if , as a consequence of that very arrangement , I feel myself sinking , and ready to be lost for ever ? One single wretch might arraign Providence , and say with Job the Arabian , chap . iii . 20 , Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ? Alas ! the appearances of happiness have been disclosed to the view of man , only to overwhelm him with despair of ever attaining it . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits direct and confound at least the affairs of the children of men . ' I shall , first , reply to the principal authorities on which some of these objections are supported . They are extracted , in part , from a celebrated poet , and a learned philosopher , namely , Lucretius and Pliny . Lucretius has clothed the philosophy of Empedocles and Epicurus in very beautiful verses . His imagery is enchanting ; but that philosophy of atoms , which adhere to each other by chance , is so completely absurd , that wherever it appears , the beauty of the poetry is impaired . To what , we may ask him , do those primary atoms , out of which you construct the elements of Nature , owe their existence 1 Who communicated to them the first movement How is it possible they should have given to the aggregation of a great number of bodies , a spirit of life , a sensibility , and a will , which they themselves possessed not ? If you believe , with Leibnitz , that those monads , or unities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of chance , and must allow to the elements of Nature the intelligence you refuse to its AUTHOR . Descartes has subjected those impalpable principles to the laws of an ingenious geometry ; and after him , the herd of philosophers , seduced by the facility of erecting all sorts of systems with the same materials , have applied to them , by turns , the laws of attraction , of fermentation , of crystallization ; but all without success . Lucretius has thought proper to pursue a method still more strange , namely , that in a work , the professed object of which is to materialize the Deity , he sets out with deifying matter . He has given way to this universal principle , that we find it impossible powerfully to interest mankind , whatever /q/ be the object , without presenting to the mind some of the attributes of Deity . On this hypothesis , therefore , in his first book De Rerum Natura , he deifies Venus ; ascribes to her the creation of the world ; addresses prayers , and bestows on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of goodness , justice , intelligence , and power , which belongs to GOD only ; in a word , the attributes are so exactly the same , that , suppressing only the word Venus , in the invocation of his poem , you may apply it almost entirely to the Divine Wisdom . He is constrained to admit , in the sequel of his poem , that this goddess , so wonderfully beneficent , is directly chargeable with the ruin of health , of fortune , and , sooner or later , with the loss of reputation : that , from the very lap of the pleasures which she bestows , there issues a something which im bitters enjoyment , torments a man , and renders him miserable . Pliny takes the directly opposite course . In the very threshold of his Natural History , he affirms there is no God , and the whole work is an elaborate demonstration of the being of GOD . His authority must be of considerable weight , as it is not that of a poet to whom opinions are a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor that of a sectary , obstinately determined to support a party , whatever violence may be done to conscience ; nor , finally , that of a flatterer , making his court to vicious princes . Pliny wrote under the virtuous Titus , and dedicated his book to him . He carries to such a height the love of truth , and contempt of the glory of the age in which he lived , as to condemn the victories of Caesar , in Rome itself , and when addressing a Roman emperor . He is replete with humanity and virtue ; and exposes the cruelty of masters to their slaves , the luxury of the great , nay , the dissolute conduct of several empresses . He sometimes pronounces the panegyric of good men ; and exalts even above the inventors of arts persons who have rendered themselves illustrious by their continency , modesty , and piety . His work is a combination of brilliancies , a real encyclopedia , containing the history of the knowledge and the errors of his time . These last are sometimes imputed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of refuting them . The physicians and apothecaries , who have extracted many of their prescriptions from him , abuse /z/ him , because he finds fault with their conjectural art and systematic spirit . He abounds , besides , in curious information , in profound views , and interesting traditions ; and what renders his performance invaluable , he uniformly expresses himself in a picturesque manner . With all this taste , judgment , and knowledge , Pliny is an atheist . Nature , from whom he has derived such various intelligence , may address him in the words of Caesar to Brutus : What , ' you too , my son ! If I may be permitted to say it , in justification of Pliny , I believe his immortal work to be falsified , where he is made to reason as an atheist . All his commentators agree that no author has suffered more from the unfaithfulness of transcribers than he has done ; that copies of his Natural History exist in which whole chapters are entirely different . I shall here observe , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfaithful language , nay worse , more than one suspicious hand . They have met with the fate of their monuments , among which their temples have been most of all degraded . Their books have also been mutilated , chiefly in passages favourable to religion , or the reverse . An instance of this we have in the transcription of Cicero 's Treatise on the Nature of the Gods , in which the objections against Providence are omitted . Montagne upbraids the first Christians with having suppressed , on account of four or five articles which contradicted their creed , a part of the works of Cornelius Tacitus , * though the emperor Tacitus , his relation , had , by his express edicts , furnished all the libraries in the world with them . ' * In our own days , every party exerts itself to run down the reputation and opinions opposed to it . Mankind is , in the hands of religion and philosophy , like the old man in the fable , between two dames of different ages . They had both a mind to trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger picked out all the white hairs , which she could not bear ; the old one , for an opposite reason , removed the black ; consequently his head was speedily reduced to complete baldness . It is impossible to adduce a more satisfactory demonstration of this ancient infidelity of the two parties , than an interpolation to be found in the writings of Flavins Josephus , who was contemporary with Pliny . He is made to say , in so * Essays , book ii . chap . xix. /q/ many words , that the Messiah was just born ; and he continues his narration , to the end of a voluminous history , without once referring to this wonderful event . How can it be believed that Josephus , who frequently indulges himself in a tedious detail of minute circumstances , should not have reverted a thousand and a thousand times to a birth so deeply interesting to his nation , considering that its very destiny was involved in that event , and that even the destruction of Jerusalem was only one of the consequences of the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverts the meaning of the prophecies which announce Him , applying them to Vespasian and Titus ; for he , as well as the other Jews , expected a Messiah triumphant . Besides , had Josephus believed in CHRIST , would he not have embraced his religion ! For a similar reason , is it credible that Pliny should commence his Natural History with denying the existence of GOD , and afterwards fill every page of it with expatiating on the wisdom , goodness , providence , - and majesty of Nature ; on the presages and premonitions , sent expressly from the gods ; and even on the miracles divinely operated through the medium of dreams Certain savage tribes have been adduced as examples of atheism , and every sequestered corner of the globe has been for this purpose explored . But obscure tribes were no more intended to serve as an example to the human race , than certain mean and obscure families among ourselves could be proposed as proper models to the nation ; especially when the object is to support by authority an opinion necessarily subversive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have read the history of voyages from which they are extracted ! The travellers acknowledge they had but a transient view of those people , and were totally unacquainted with their languages . They supposed there could be no religion among them , because they saw no temples ; as if any other temple were necessary to the belief in GOD than that of Nature ! These same travellers contradict themselves , by relating that those nations , elsewhere represented as destitute of all religion , make obeisance to the moon , by prostrating themselves to the earth , or lifting up their hands to heaven : that they pay respect to the memory of their forefathers , and place viands on their tombs . The immor- /z/ tality of the soul , admitted how you will , necessarily supposes the existence of GOD . But if the first of all truths stood in need of testimony from men , we could collect that of the whole human race , from geniuses the most exalted , down to the lawest state of ignorance . This unanimity of testimony is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing should exist on the earth as universal error . Newton , who pursued his researches into the laws of Nature so profoundly , never pronounced the name of GOD without moving his hat , and otherwise expressing the most devout respect . He took pleasure in recalling this sublime idea , and considered it as the natural bond of union among all nations . Corneille le Bruyn , the Dutch painter , relates , that happening to dine one day at his table , in company with several other foreigners , Newton , when the desert was served up , proposed a health to the men of every country who believe in GOD . This was drinking the health of the human race . A belief in GOD arises from the spectacle of Nature simply . A poor ignorant Arabian of the desert was one day asked , How he came to be assured there was a God ? ' In the same way , ' he replied , ' that I am able to tell by the print impressed on the sand whether it was a man or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as has been said , can not imagine any form , or produce a single idea , of which the model is not in Nature . He expands his reason only on the reasons Nature has supplied . GOD must , therefore , necessarily exist , were it but for this , that man has an idea of him . But if we attentively consider that every thing necessary to man exists in a most wonderful adaptation to his necessities , for the strongest of all reasons GOD likewise must exist , He who is the universal adaptation of all the societies of the human race . But I should wish to know , in what way those who doubt of his existence , on a review of the works of Nature , would desire to be assured of it 1 Do they wish he should appear under a human form , and assume the figure of an old man , as he is painted in some of our churches 1 They would say , this is a man . Were He to invest himself with some unknown and celestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Travels through Arabia , by Mons. d ' Arvieux. /q/ sight ? The complete and unveiled display of even a single one of his works on the earth would be sufficient to confound our feeble organs . For example , if the earth wheels around its axis , as is supposed , there is not a human being in existence , who , from a fixed point in the heavens , could view the rapidity of its motion without horror ; for he would behold rivers , oceans , kingdoms , whirling about under his feet with a velocity almost thrice as great as a cannon-ball . But even the swiftness of this diurnal rotation is a mere nothing : for the rapidity with which the globe describes its annual circle , and hurls us round the sun , is seventy-five times greater than that of a bullet shot from the cannon . Were it but possible for the eye to view through the skin the mechanism of our own body , the sight would overwhelm us . Durst we make a single movement if we saw our blood circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humours filtrating , and all the incomprehensible assemblage of fibres , tubes , pumps , currents , pivots , which sustain an existence at once so frail and so pre-sumptuous ? Would we wish , on the contrary , that GOD should manifest himself in a manner more adapted to his own nature , by the direct and immediate communication of his intelligence , to the exclusion of every intervenient mean ? When some striking truth or affecting sentiment impresses an audience at a theatre , some are melted into tears , others almost choked with an oppressed respiration , others quite in a transport , clapping their hands , and stamping with their feet ; the females in the boxes actually fainting away . Were these violent agitations of spirit to go on progressively but for a few minutes only , the persons subject to them might lose their reason , perhaps life . What would be the case , then , if the Source of all truth and feeling were to communicate himself to us in a mortal body ? GOD has placed us at a suitable distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so near as to be annihilated by it . He veils intelligence under the forms of matter , and He restores our confidence respecting the movements of the material world by the sentiment of his intelligence . If at any time he is pleased to communicate himself in a more intimate manner , it is not through the channel of haughty science , but through that of modest virtue . He discloses himself to the simple , and hides his face from the proud . /z/ * But , ' it is asked , ' what made GOD 1 Why should there be a God ' Am I to call in question his existence because I am incapable of comprehending his origin 1 This style of reasoning would lead us to conclude that man does not exist : for , Who made man Why should there be men Why am I in the world in the eighteenth century 1 Why did I not arrive in some of the ages which went before and , Wherefore should I not be here in those which are to come 1 The existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men only contingent . Nay , the existence of man is the only apparently superfluous existence in the order established upon earth . Many islands have been discovered without inhabitants , which presented abodes the most enchanting , from the disposition of the valleys , of the waters , of the woods , of the animals . Man alone deranges the plans of Nature : he diverts the current from the fountain ; he digs into the side of the hill ; he sets the forest on fire ; he massacres without mercy every thing that breathes ; everywhere he degrades the earth , which could do very well without him . The harmony of this globe would be partially destroyed , perhaps entirely so , were but the smallest genus of plants to be suppressed ; for its annihilation would leave a certain space of ground destitute of verdure , and thereby rob of its nourishment the species of insect which there found the support of life . The destruction of the insect again would involve that of the species of bird which in these alone finds the food proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total ruin of the vegetable and animal kingdoms might take its rise from the failure of a single moss , as we may see that of an edifice commence in a small crevice . But if the human race existed not , it would be impossible to suppose that any thing had been deranged : every brook , every plant , every animal , would always be in its place . Indolent and haughty philosopher , who presumest to demand of Nature wherefore there should be a God , why demandest thou not rather wherefore there should be men ? All his works speak of their AUTHOR . The plain which gradually escapes from my eye , and the capacious vault of heaven which encompasses me on every side , convey to me an idea of his immensity ; the fruits suspended on the bough within reach of my hand , announce his providential care ; the constant revolution of the seasons display his wisdom ; the /z/ variety of provision which his bounty makes , in every climate , for the wants of every thing that lives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meadow , the grouping of plants , the perfume and enamel of flowers , an infinite multitude of harmonies , known and unknown , are the magnificent languages which speak of Him to all men in a thousand and a thousand different dialects . Nay , the very order of Nature is superfluous : GOD is the only being whom disorder invokes , and whom human weakness announces . In order to attain the knowledge of his attributes , we need only have a feeling of our own imperfections . Man has given nothing to himself , he has received all . But I should consider it an insult to the understanding of my reader , were I to insist longer on the proofs of the existence of GOD . I shall now reply to the objections against his goodness . The laws which govern man are derived from the same plan of wisdom which has constructed the universe . Man is not a being of a nature perfectly simple . Virtue , which ought to be the great object of his pursuit on earth , is an effort which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pleasing view of GOD only . It proposes to him the Divine Wisdom as a model , and presents the most secure and unerring path to happiness . Study Nature , and you will perceive that nothing can be more adapted to the felicity of man , and that virtue carries her reward in her bosom , even in this world . Let us not complain that GOD has made an unfair distribution of his gifts , when we see the abundance in which bad men live . Whatever is on the earth most useful , beautiful , and best , is within the reach of every man . Obscurity is better than glory , and virtue than talents . The light of the sun , a little field , a wife and children , are sufficient to employ a succession of pleasures to him . Must he have luxuries too ? A flower presents him colours more lovely than the pearl dragged from the abysses of the ocean ; and a burning coal on his hearth has a brighter lustre , and is infinitely more useful , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Mogul . After all , What did GOD owe to man 1 Water from the fountain , a little fruit , wool to clothe him , as much land as he is able to cultivate with his own hands . So much for the wants of his body . As to those of the soul , it is sufficient /z/ for him to possess in infancy the love of his parents ; in maturity that of his wife ; in old age the gratitude of his children ; at all seasons the good will of his neighbours , the number of whom is restricted to four or five , according to the extent and form of his domain ; so much knowledge of the globe as he can acquire by rambling about for half a day , so as to get home to his own bed at night , or , at most , to the extremity of his domestic horizon ; such a sense of Providence as Nature bestows on all men , and which will spring up in his heart fully as well after he has made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voyage round the world . With corporeal enjoyments and mental gratifications like these he ought to be content ; whatever more he desires is above his wants , and inconsistent with the distributions of Nature . He can not acquire superfluity but by the sacrifice of some necessary ; public consideration he must purchase at the price of domestic happiness ; and a name in the world of science by renouncing his repose . Besides , these honours , attendants , riches , that submission , men so eagerly hunt after , are desired unjustly : a man can not obtain them but by plundering and enslaving his fellow - citizens : their acquisition exposes to incredible labour and anxiety , the possession is disturbed by incessant care , and privation tears the heart with regret . By pretended blessings such as these , health , reason , conscience , all , is depraved and lost . Virtuous persons , in truth , are sometimes destitute not only of the blessings of society , but of those of Nature . To this I answer , that their calamities frequently are beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually incited to engage in some illustrious career . Affliction is the path of great talents , or of great virtues , which are infinitely preferable . A resignation to the will of GOD ought in every situation to sooth the soul to peace . But if the illusions of a vain world should ruffle our spirit , let me suggest a consideration which may go far toward restoring our tranquillity . When any thing in Nature bears hard upon us , and inspires mistrust of its AUTHOR , let us suppose an order of things contrary to that which galls us , and we shall find a multitude of consequences resulting from this hypothesis that would involve much greater evils than those of which we complain . If /q/ you wish to justify the order of Nature , it is sufficient to deviate from it ; and , in order to refute all human systems , nothing more is necessary than to admit them . For example , complaints are made of death : but if men were not to die , What would become of their posterity Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the earth . Death , therefore , is a benefit . Men complain of the necessity of labouring : but unless they laboured , How could they pass their time * ? The reputedly happy of the age , who have nothing to do , are at a loss how to employ it . Labour , therefore , is a benefit . Men envy the beasts the instinct which guides them : but if , from their birth , they knew , like them , all that they ever are to know , What should they do in the world 1 They would saunter through it without interest or curiosity . Ignorance , therefore , is a benefit . The other ills of Nature are equally necessary . Pain of body and vexation of spirit are barriers erected by Nature to prevent our deviating from her laws . But for pain bodies would be broken to pieces on the slightest shock ; but for chagrin the mind would become the victim of every sickly appetite . Diseases are the efforts of temperaments to purge oft some noxious humour . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve it ; it is ever the consequence of some violation of her laws , physical and moral . The remedy is frequently obtained by leaving her to act in her own way . The regimen of aliments restores our health of body , and that of men , tranquillity of mind . Whatever opinions disturb our repose in society , they almost always vanish in solitude . Sleep itself dispels our chagrin more gently and infallibly than a book of morals . If our distresses are such as to break our rest , they may be mitigated by having recourse to GOD . Here is the central point towards which all the paths of human life converge . Prosperity , at all seasons , invites us to his presence , but adversity leaves us no choice . The evils of society are no part of the plan of Nature , but they demonstrate the existence of another order of things : for is it natural to imagine , that the BEING good and just , who has disposed every thing on earth to promote the happiness of man , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch who dared to counteract his gracious designs ? Will He do nothing in behalf of the virtuous but /z/ unfortunate man , whose constant study was to please him , when he has loaded with blessings so many miscreants who abuse them 1 After having displayed a bounty which has met with no return , will he fail in executing necessary justice /z/ ' But , ' we are told , e every thing dies with us . Here we ought to believe our own experience ; we were nothing before our birth , and we shall be nothing after death . ' I adopt the analogy ; but if I take my point of comparison from the moment I was nothing , and when I came into existence , what becomes of this argument Is not one positive proof better than all the negative proofs in the world You conclude from an unknown past to an unknown future to perpetuate the nothingness of man ; and I , for my part , deduce my consequence from the present which I know , to the future which I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I proceed on the presumption of a goodness and a justice to come , from the instances of goodness and justice which I see actually diffused over the universe . Besides , if we have in our present state the desire and presentiment only of a life to come ; and if no one ever returned thence to give - us information concerning it , the reason is , a proof more sensible would be inconsistent with the nature of our present life on the earth . Evidence on this point must involve the same inconveniences with that of the existence of GOD . Were we assured by some sensible demonstration that a world to come was prepared for us , I have the fullest conviction that all the pursuits of this world would from that instant be abandoned . The passage from the one world to the other being in every man 's power , the gulf would be quickly shot : but Nature has involved it in obscurity , and planted doubt and apprehension to guard the It would appear , we are told by some , that the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculations of men of genius , who , considering the combination of this universe , and the connexion which present scenes have with those which preceded them , must have thence concluded that they had a necessary connexion with futurity ; or else that this idea of immortality was introduced by legislators to conBole mankind under the pressure of their political injustice . But if this were the case , how could it have found its way /q/ into the desert ? , and been diffused at once , over the islands of the South Seas and Lapland , over Asia and North America , among the inhabitants of Paris and those of the New Hebrides 1 How is it possible that so many nations , separated by vast oceans , so different in manners and in language , should all believe in the immortality of the soul Whence could they have derived a belief so flatly contradicted by their daily experience They every day see their friends die , but the day never comes when any one reappears . Shall we be told that pride cherishes this fond opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induces a wretched negro in the West Indies to hang himself , in the hope of returning to his own country , where a second state of slavery awaits him 1 Other nations , such as the islanders of Otaheite , restrict the hope of this immortality to a renovation of precisely the same life they are going to leave . Ah ! the passions present to rnan far different plans of felicity ; the miseries of his existence , and the illumination of his reason , would long ago have destroyed the life that is , had not the hope of a life to come been , in the human breast , the result of a supernatural feeling . But wherefore is man the only one of the animals subjected to other evils than those of Nature 1 Wherefore should he have been abandoned to himself , disposed as he is to go astray ? He is , therefore , the victim of some malignant being . It is the province of religion to take us up where philosophy leaves us . The nature of the ills we endure unfolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because he would himself be the arbiter of his own felicity . Man is a god in exile . The reign of Saturn , the Golden Age , Pandora 's box , from which issued every evil , at the bottom of which hope only remained : a thousand similar allegories , diffused over all nations , attest the felicity and the fall of a first man . But there is no need to have recourse to foreign testimonies . We carry the most unquestionable evidence in ourselves . The beauties of Nature bear witness to the existence of GOD , and the miseries of man confirm the truths of religion . Animals are lodged , clothed , fed , by the hand of Nature , without care , and almost without labour . Man alone is overwhelmed with calamity . First , he is born naked ; /z/ and is possessed of so little instinct , that if his mother were not to rear him for several years he would perish of hunger , heat , or cold . He knows nothing but from the experience of his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave garments for him , provide his food for eight or ten years . Encomiums have been passed on certain countries for their fertility and mildness of climate , but I know of none where subsistence of the simplest kind does not cost man solicitude and labour . In India he must be sheltered from heat , from rain , and from insects . He must there cultivate rice , weed , thrash , shell , and dress it . The banana , useful as it is , must be watered and hedged round , to secure it from the wild beasts . Magazines of provisions must be provided during those seasons when the earth produces nothing . When man has thus collected around him every thing necessary to a quiet and comfortable life , ambition , jealousy , avarice , gluttony , incontinency , or langour , take possession of his heart . He perishes , the victim of his own passions . Undoubtedly to have sunk thus below the level of the beasts , man must have aspired at an equality with the DEITY . Wretched mortals ! Seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground of complaint against Nature . Despise that useless knowledge , those unreasonable prejudices , which have corrupted the earth , and which every age subverts in its turn . Love those laws which are eternal . Your destiny is not abandoned to chance , nor to mischievous demons . Recall those times , the recollection of which is still fresh among all nations . The brute creation everywhere found the means of supporting life ; man alone had neither aliment , nor clothing , nor instinct . Divine Wisdom left man to himself , in order to bring him back to GOD . She scattered her blessings over the earth , that to gather them he might explore every region of it ; that he might expand his reason by the inspection of her works , and that he might love her from a sense of benefits . She placed between herself and him harmless pleasures , rapturous discoveries , pure delights , and endless hopes , to lead him to herself through the path of knowledge and happiness . She fenced his way on both sides , by fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills of life , as boundaries destined to prevent him from losing himself . The mother thus scatters fruit along the ground to induce her children to learn to walk ; /q/ she keeps at a little distance , smiles , calls , stretches out her arms towards him ; but if he happens to fall , she flies to his assistance , wipes away his tears , and comforts him . Thus Providence relieves man , supplying* his wants in a thousand extraordinary ways . What would have become of him in the earliest ages , had he been abandoned to his own reason , still unaided by experience Where found he corn , a principal part of the food of so many nations , and which the earth , while it spontaneously produces all sorts of plants , nowhere exhibits ? Who taught him agriculture , an art so simple that the most stupid of mankind is capable of learning it , and yet so sublime , that the most intelligent of animals can never pretend to practise it 1 There is scarcely an animal but what supports its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of their reproduction , and does not employ , in quest of those that suit him , many more combinations than would have been necessary for resowing them . But on what did man himself subsist till an Isis or a Ceres revealed to him this blessing of the skies Who showed him , in the first ages of the world , the original fruits of the orchard , scattered over the forest , and the alimentary roots concealed in the bosom of the earth 1 Must he not have died of hunger before he had collected a sufficiency to support life , or perished by poison before he had learned to select , or sunk under fatigue or restlessness before he had formed round his habitation grass-plots and arbours 1 This art , the image of creation , was reserved for that being alone who bore the impression of the Divinity . If Providence had abandoned man to himself , on proceeding from the hands of the Creator , what would have become of him Could he have said to the plains : Ye unknown forests , show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disclose , in the roots buried under thy surface , my destined aliment Ye plants , on which my life depends , manifest to me your qualities , and supply the instinct which Nature has denied ? Could he have had recourse , in his distress , to the compassion of the beasts , and , ready to perish with hunger , have said to the cow : Take me into the number of thy children , and let me share , with thy offspring , the produce of one of thy superfluous teats 1 When the north wind made him shiver with cold , would the wild goat and timid sheep have run at his call to warm him with their fleeces ? Wandering , /z/ without a protector or asylum , when he heard by night the howlings of ferocious animals demanding their prey , could he have made supplication to the generous dog , and said to him : Be thou my defender , and I will make thee my slave Who could have subjected to his authority so many animals which stood in no need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in strength , unless the hand which , notwithstanding his fall , destined him still to empire , had humbled their heads to the obedience of his will ? How was it possible for him , with reason less infallible than their instinct , to raise himself up to the heavens , measure the course of the stars , cross the ocean , call down the thunder , and imitate most of the works and appearances of Nature ? We are astonished at these things now ; but I am much rather astonished that a sense of Deity should have spoken to his heart long before a comprehension of the works of Nature had perfected his understanding . View him in the state of nature , engaged in perpetual war with the elements , with beasts of prey , with his fellow-creatures , with himself ; frequently reduced to situations of subjection no other animal could possibly support ; and he is the only being who discovers , in the very depth of misery , the character of infinity , and the restlessness of immortality . He erects trophies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , celebrates his funeral obsequies , and puts reverence on the ashes of his forefathers , from whom he has received an inheritance so fatal . Agitated by the rage of love or vengeance , when he is not the victim of his fellow-men , he is their tyrant : and he alone knows that justice and goodness govern the world , and that virtue exalts man to heaven . He receives from his cradle none of the presents of Nature , no soft fleece , no plumage , no defensive armour , no tool , for a life so painful and so laborious ; and he is the only being who invites the gods to his birth , to his nuptials , and to his funeral obsequies . However far he may have been misled by extravagant opinions , as often as he is struck by unexpected bursts of joy or grief , his soul , by an involuntary movement , takes refuge in the bosom of Deity . He cries out : Ah , my GOD ! He raises to heaven suppliant hands , and eyes bathed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! the wants of man bear witness to the providence of a Supreme Being . He has made /z/ man feeble and ignorant , only that he may stay himself on his strength , and illuminate himself by his light ; and so far is it from being true , that chance or malignant spirits domineer over a world , where every thing concurred to destroy a creature so wretched , his preservation , his enjoyments , and his empire , demonstrate that , at all times , a beneficent GOD has been the friend and protector of human life . /z/ I HAVE hitherto displayed the immensity of the study of Nature , and proposed new plans to assist our idea of the order established in her various kingdoms : but , checked by my own incapacity , all I could presume to promise was a slight sketch of what exists in the vegetable order . Before I proceeded to lay down new principles on this subject , I thought myself called upon to refute those prejudices which the world and our sciences might have diffused over Nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is concerned : I give them full credit on the side of observation . Besides , I highly respect those who devote themselves to the pursuit of science . I know nothing more estimable , next to the virtuous man , than the man of real knowledge , if it be possible to separate the sciences from virtue . What sacrifices does not the cultivation of them demand ! While the herd of mankind is growing rich and renowned by agriculture , commerce , navigation , and the arts , those who cleared the way for the rest lived in indigence , unknown to , and disregarded by , their contemporaries . The man of science , like the torch , illuminates all around him , and remains himself in obscurity . I have attacked neither the learned , whom I honour , nor the sciences , my consolation through life : but had time permitted , I would have disputed every inch of ground with our methods and systems . They have thrown us into such a variety of absurd opinions , in every branch of scientific research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ mischief they produce might easily be checked , by arranging side by side all the books which contradict themselves ; and as these are almost infinite in number , the result of human knowledge , as far as they convey it , will be reduced almost to nothing . Our very methods of acquiring knowledge delude us into error . To succeed in the search of truth we ought to be exempted from the influence of passion ; and yet , from infancy , the passions are wilfully set afloat , and reason receives an improper bias . This maxim is laid down as the fundamental basis of all conduct and opinion , Make your fortune . The effect is , we prize nothing but what relates to this appetite . Even natural truths vanish , because we no longer contemplate Nature , except in machines or books . That we may believe in GOD , some person of consequence must assure us there is one . If Fenelon says it is so , we admit it , because he was preceptor to the Duke of Burgundy , an archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title my lord . We are convinced of the existence of GOD by the arguments of Fenelon , because his credit reflects some upon ourselves . I do not mean to affirm that his virtue contributed nothing to the force of his reasoning : but no farther than as it is connected with his reputation and fortune ; for were we to meet this same virtue in a water-porter , its lustre would fade in our eyes . To no purpose would such a one furnish proofs of the existence of a GOD , more unanswerable than all the speculations of philosophy , in a life labouring under contempt , exhibiting uniform probity and fortitude , and passed in perfect resignation to the will of the Supreme : these testimonies are of no consideration with us ; we estimate their importance from the celebrity they have acquired . But should a period come , when men of high reputation , in favour with powerful princes , deny the existence of GOD ; from the same effect of our education , which engaged us to believe in Him , on . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit of the others . Thus our education warps us , disposing us indifferently to preach the Gospel or the Alcoran , according as they best suit our interest . Most of the laws we have presumed to assign to Nature have been deduced from our weakness or pride . We have settled it , for instance , that the sun must be in the centre of the planets , to regulate their motion , because we place ourselves /q/ in that of our personal concerns , to keep an eye over them . But if , in the case of the celestial spheres , the centre naturally belongs to the most considerable bodies , how comes it that Saturn and Jupiter , much larger than our globe , should be at the extremity of our vortex 1 1 do not reject our planetary system , such as it is given us ; but I admit it for the reason which at first suggested it , from its being best adapted to the weakness of my body and mind . I find that the daily rotation of the earth saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects , I do not believe this system is that of Nature , nor that she has disclosed the causes of motion to men , incapable of accounting for the movement of their own fingers . I beg leave to suggest some farther probabilities in favour of the sun 's motion round the earth . ' The astronomers of Greenwich having discovered that a star of Taurus has a declination of two minutes every 24 hours ; that this star not being dim , and having no train , can not be considered as a comet , communicated their observations to the astronomers of Paris , who found them accurate . M. Messier was appointed to make a report of this to the Academy of Sciences at their next meeting . ' * If the stars are suns , here then is a sun in motion , a presumption , at least , that ours may move . The stability of the earth may be presumed , because the distance of the stars never changes with respect to us , which must perceptibly take place , if we performed every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues in diameter through the heavens ; for in a space so vast , we must draw nigher to some , and remove from others . Sixty-four millions of leagues , we are told , dwindle to a point in the heavens , compared to the distance of the stars . I doubt the truth of this . The sun , a million of times greater than the earth , presents an apparent diameter of only six inches , at the distance of 32,000,000 of leagues . If this distance reduces so immense a body to a diameter so small , doubtless double the distance would still diminish and reduce it , perhaps to the apparent magnitude of a star ; that , on being thus diminished , and our still removing 64,000,000 of leagues farther , he would entirely disappear . How comes /z/ it to pass , then , that when the earth approaches , or removes to this distance from the stars , in performing its annual circle , no one of those stars increases or diminishes in magnitude with respect to us ? I submit some farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , motions peculiar to themselves . Ancient astronomers observed , in the neck of the Whale , a star which presented much variety in its appearances ; sometimes it appeared for three months together , sometimes longer ; sometimes its apparent magnitude was greater , sometimes smaller : the time of its appearances was irregular . The same astronomers observed a new star in the heart of the Swan , which from time to time disappeared . In the year 1 603 , it was equal to a star of the first magnitude : it gradually diminished , and at length disappeared . M. Cassini perceived it in 1655 . It increased for five years successively , then began to decrease , and reappeared no more . In 1670 a new star was observed near the head of the Swan , by Father Anselm and several other astronomers . It disappeared , and became again invisible in 1672 . From that period it was seen no more till 1709 , and in 1713 it totally disappeared . These examples demonstrate , that the stars not only have motions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have assigned to heavenly bodies . I am persuaded there is among these the same variety of motion , as between that of many terrestrial bodies ; and that stars describe cycloids , spirals , and other curves , of which we have no idea . I must proceed no farther on this ground , for fear of appearing better informed respecting the affairs of heaven than those much nearer us . I only intended to expose my doubts and ignorance . If stars are suns , then there must be stars in motion , and surely ours may be in motion , as well as they are . Thus our general maxims become the sources of error ; for we charge with disorder whatever seems to recede from our pretended order . It is a maxim , that a man of genius catches every thing at a glance , and executes all by one single law ; but I consider this sublime method of observing and executing , as one of the strongest proofs of the weakness of the human mind . Man can not proceed with confidence but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he becomes perplexed , /q/ and is at a loss which he ought to pursue : that he may not deviate , he admits only one to be right ; and once engaged , right or wrong , pride stimulates him forward . The AUTHOR of Nature , on the contrary , embracing the spheres of all beings , produces them by laws various as his own inexhaustible conceptions , to accomplish one single end , their general good ; and it is well worthy of remark , that the only end He discloses to our understanding , is the same with that he proposes to our virtue . In the last age , every thing was explained on the principles of corpuscular philosophy , because it was perceived that some bodies were formed by intus-susception , or an aggregation of parts ; but being indifferently endowed , its reign was of short duration . Others having found that air pressed , set to work to demonstrate its gravity . Our books referred every thing to the gravity of the air ; they investigated its elasticity , and explained equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The universal cry was , now the veil is removed ; we have caught her in the fact . But did not the savage know , when walking against the wind , that air had both gravity and elasticity ? Did he not employ both those qualities in managing his canoe when under sail 1 I do not object to investigation , if natural effects are applied to the necessities of human life ; but they are introduced only to regulate the operations of Nature , and not our own . Others explain the system of the universe , by ascribing to it laws which have so much accuracy and precision , that Divine Providence has nothing more to do . They represent him as a geometrician , or mechanist , who amuses himself with making spheres , merely for the pleasure of spinning them round . They pay no regard to harmonies and other moral causes . Though their observations may do them honour , the results are unsatisfactory . Their reasoning on Nature resembles that of a savage , who , on observing , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public clock , and seeing , that on their pointing in a certain direction upon the hour-plate , the turrets fell a shaking , crowds issued into the streets , and many of the inhabitants were put in motion , should thence conclude , that a clock was the principle of all European occupations . This is the defect of the sciences , which , without consulting the end of the operations of Na- /z/ ture , perplex themselves in an unprofitable investigation of the means . The gods of the ancients impressed upon them some respect for the works of creation , and attached them to their country by a sentiment of religion . But our machinery destroys the harmonies of Nature and Society . The first is to us only a gloomy theatre , composed of levers , pulleys , weights , and springs ; the second merely a school for disputation . Those systems , we are told , give exercise to the mental faculties . It may be so ; but may they not mislead the understanding and deprave the heart 1 While the head is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing is the production of unintelligent powers , of attractions , of fermentations , the play of fibres , of masses , we are then subjected to their laws , as all other bodies are . Women and children deduce these consequences . What , in the mean time , becomes of virtue 1 You must submit , say these ingenious gentlemen , to the laws of Nature . So then , we must obey the power of gravity ; sit down , and walk no more . Nature speaks by a hundred thousand voices . Which of these is now sounding in our ears 1 What ! will you adopt as the rule of life , the example of fishes , quadrupeds , plants , or even of the heavenly bodies Metaphysicians , who pay no regard to the laws of physics , explain the system of the universe , by means of abstract ideas ; a proof their system is not that of Nature , is , that with their materials and method , it would be easy to subvert their order , and frame another totally different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mortal blow at the pride of human understanding ; all these efforts of the genius of man , so far from being able to construct a world , are incapable of putting a grain of sand in motion . Others consider the state we live in as that of progressive ruin and punishment . They suppose , conformably to the authority of the sacred writings , that this earth once existed with other harmonies . I readily admit what scripture says on this subject , but I object to the explanations of commentators . Such is our intellectual weakness , that we can not conceive or imagine any thing beyond what Nature actually exhibits to us . They are mistaken , when they affirm , for instance , that when the earth was in a state of perfection , the sun was constantly in the equator ; that the days and nights /q/ were perpetually equal ; that there was an eternal spring ; that the whole face of the ground was smooth , level , and so on . Were the sun constantly in the equator , I question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , the torrid zone would be burned up , as has been already demonstrated ; the icy zones would extend much farther than at present ; the temperate zones would be at least as cold toward their middle , as they are with us at the vernal equinox ; and this temperature would prevent the greatest part of fruits from coming to maturity . I know not where the perpetual spring would be ; but , if it could anywhere exist , never could autumn exist there likewise . The case would be still worse were there neither rocks nor mountains on the surface of the globe ; for not one river , nay not a brook of water , would flow over the whole earth . There would be neither shelter nor reflex , to the north , to cherish the germination of plants ; neither shade nor moisture , to the south , to preserve them from the heat . These wonderful arrangements actually exist over the whole northern regions , which become loaded with rocks as the latitude increases ; and they rise in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is covered with rocks , especially toward the line ; in Ethiopia , which Nature has overspread with vast and lofty rocks , which form deep valleys , delightfully shady and cool . Thus , in order to refute our pretended plans of perfection , it is sufficient to admit them . The botanists , another class of literati , on the contrary , never deviate from their track , and abstain from looking at any thing beyond it , however rich in facts . They have observed the sexual parts in plants , and employ themselves in collecting and arranging them conformably to the number of those parts , without inquiring any farther about them . When classed in their heads and herbals , into umbellated , rose-formed , or tubulous , with the number of their stamina ; if to this they are able to affix some Greek terms , they are possessed , they imagine , of the complete system of vegetation . Others of them go somewhat farther , and study the principles of plants ; to attain their object , they pound them in mortars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they exhibit salts , oils , earths ; and gravely tell you , these are the principles of such and such a plant . For my part , I no more believe that any one can show me the principles /z/ of a plant in a phial , than he can display those of a wolf , or a sheep , in a kettle . I respect the mysterious operations of chymistry ; but when they act on vegetables , the process destroys them . Many other errors have been adopted respecting the laws of expansion and fecundation of plants . The ancients distinguished , in many plants , males and females ; and a fecundation , by means of emanations of the seminal powder , such as in the date-bearing palm-tree . We have applied this law to the whole vegetable kingdom . It embraces a very extensive field ; but how many vegetables propagate themselves by suckers , slips , knittings , and the extremities of their branches ! Here are , then , in the same kingdom , various methods of reproduction . Nevertheless , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our books of science , we weakly imagine she has gone astray . We have only one thread , and when it snaps , we conclude the system of the universe is on the point of dissolution . The Supreme Intelligence disappears the moment that our own happens to be disturbed . No doubt the AUTHOR of Nature has established laws for the vegetable world 3 now so generally studied , but still unknown . There are laws of adaptation and utility in the generation of animals , to which we ascribe uncertainty , as soon as we perceive variety ; or when we apprehend an approximation to the vegetable kingdom by imaginary relations , suggested by the perception of effects common to both . Medicine nas deduced a multitude of errors from those apparent analogies of the vegetable and animal kingdoms . Her studies are liable to strong suspicions . She pursues the operations of the soul through the structure of a corpse , and the functions of life in the lethargy of death . If she perceives some valuable property in a vegetable , she exalts it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to human life : hence she concludes a vegetable diet will make a man live for ages . Who can enumerate the books , treatises , panegyrics , composed on the virtues of plants ! Many patients die , notwithstanding , with their stomachs full of those wonderful simples . Not that I undervalue their qualities when judiciously applied ; but I absolutely reject the reasonings which attempt to connect the duration of human life with the use of a vegetable regimen . /q/ The life of man is the result of all the moral adaptations , and depends more on sobriety , temperance , and the other virtues , than on the nature of aliments . The animals which live on plants , do they attain the age of man ? The deer and wild goats , which feed on the admirable vulnerary herbs of Switzerland , ought never to die ; but they are short-lived . The bees which suck the nectar of their flowers , likewise die , and several of their species in one year . A term is fixed for the life of every animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man alone extends to every variety of aliment . The Tartar lives on raw horse-flesh , the Dutchman on fish , other nations on roots and milk diet ; and in all countries you meet with old people . Vice alone , and mental uneasiness , shorten human life ; and the moral affections possess such an influence over man , that even disease itself owes its origin to them . The same extravagances existed in the systematic philosophy of the age of Socrates ; not that he was unacquainted with Nature , for he had studied her thoroughly ; but he relinquished the investigation of the causes , in the view of rising into admiration at the results . He collected many observations on the subject , and used them in his conversations on the Divine Providence . Nature presents nothing but harmonies and adaptations to our necessities , and we persist in vain efforts to trace her up to the causes she employs ; as if we meant to extort from her the secrets of her power . We do not know even the most common principles which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water , air , and fire , are elements , as we say ; but under what form must earth appear to be an element 1 That stratum called humus , which covers it , and serves as a basis to the vegetable kingdom , is a refuse of all sorts of substances , of marl , sand , clay , and vegetables . Is sand its elementary part Sand appears to be a secretion from the rock . Is the rock , then , an element ? It appears to be an aggregation of sand , as in freestone . Whether of the two , sand or rock , was the principle of the other 1 and took the precedency to the formation of the globe ? Supposing us possessed of this information , what have we gained ? There are rocks formed of aggregations of all sorts . Granite is composed of grains ; marbles and calcareous stones of the paste of shells and madrepores . There are banks of sand /z/ composed of the wrecks of all these stones : I have seen the sand of crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of calcareous stone , do not indicate the origin of that substance ; themselves forming the refuse that swims in the seas . Difficulties increase as you attempt to explain the formation of so many various bodies issuing out of the earth , and nourished by it . In vain you call to your assistance analogies , assimilations , homogeneities , and heterogeneities . Is it not strange , that thousands of species of resinous , oily , elastic , soft , and combustible vegetables , should differ so entirely from the rugged and stony soil which produces them ? The Siamese philosophers easily get rid of all embarrassment on the subject , for they admit , in Nature , a fifth element , which is wood . But this supplement is incapable of carrying them very far ; for it is still more astonishing , that animal substance should be formed of vegetable , than that this last should be formed of fossil . Which way does it become sensible , living , and impassioned ? They admit , I grant , the interposition of the sun 's action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cause of any moral affection , when we do not see it exercising a disposing influence even on the component parts of plants ? For example , its general effect is to dry that which is humid . How comes it to pass then , that in a peach exposed to its action , the pulp externally should be meltingly plump , and the nut within extremely hard ; whereas the contrary takes place in the fruit of the cocoa-tree , replenished with milk inwardly , and clothed externally with a shell as hard as a stone 1 Neither has the sun more influence on the mechanical construction of animals ; whose interior parts , constantly moistened with humours , blood , and marrow , are frequently the hardest , such as the teeth and bones ; and the parts most exposed to his heat are often very soft , as hair , feathers , the flesh , and the eyes . How is there so little analogy between plants , tender , ligneous , liable to putrefaction , and the earth which produces them ; and between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are formed ? To all appearance , the contrary ought to happen : the water ought to have produced soft , the earth solid plants . If things exist thus , there must be more than one good reason for it ; I think I have a glimpse of a tolerable one : /q/ that if these analogies actually took place , the two elements would soon become uninhabitable , and be overwhelmed by their vegetation . The sea would be incapable of breaking madrepores of wood , and the air of dissolving forests of stone . The same doubts might be started , respecting the nature of water . This element , we allege , is formed of small globules , which roll one over another ; that to the spherical form of its elementary particles we ought to ascribe its fluidity . But if these are globules , there must be between them intervals and vacuities causing motion . How comes it to pass , then , that water is incompressible 1 If you apply to it a strong compressing power in a tube , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though of gold ; and burst it , if iron : no effort can reduce it to a smaller size . But , ignorant of the form of its component parts , we can not even determine that of the combined whole . Does it consist in invisible vapours in the air , as the dew , or collected into mists in the clouds , or consolidated into masses in the ice , or finally , in a fluid state , as in the rivers ? Fluidity , it is said , forms one of its principal characters . Yes , because we drink it in that state , and because , under this relation , it interests us the most . We determine its principal character , as we do that of all the objects of Nature , from our own craving necessity , but this character appears foreign to it : for it owes its fluidity to the action of heat ; deprive it of this , and it changes into ice . It would be singular , should it be made to appear , after all our fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be solid , and that of earth fluid : now this must actually be the case , if water owes its fluidity only to heat , and if earth is nothing but an aggregation of sands , united by different glues , and attracted to a common centre , by the general action of gravity . The elementary qualities of air are not of more easy determination . Air , we say , is an elastic body : when shut up in the grains of gunpowder , the action of fire dilates it to such a degree , as to communicate to it the power of hurling a globe of iron to a prodigious distance . But how could it have been , with all this elasticity , compressed into the grains of a crumbling powder ? If you put even any liquid substance into a state of fermentation in a flask , a thousand times more air will be separated from it , than you could force into the vessel without breaking it . How could this air be confined in a sub- /z/ stance soft and fluid , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when loaded with vapours , we farther say , is refrangible . The farther we advance north , the more elevated does the sun appear over the horizon , above the place which he actually occupies in the heavens . The Dutch mariners , who passed the winter of 1597 in Nova-Zembla , after a night of several months , saw the sun reappear fifteen days sooner than they expected . All this is very well ; but if vapours render the air refrangible , why is there no aurora , nor twilight , nor any durable refraction of light whatever , between the tropics , not even on the sea , where so many vapours are exhaled , by the constant action of the sun , that the horizon is sometimes quite involved in mist by them 1 The light is not refracted , says another philosopher , by the vapours , but by cold ; for the refraction of the atmosphere is not so great at the end of summer as winter , at the autumnal equinox as at the vernal . I admit the truth of this observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is refraction to the north , as well as in our temperate climates , and none between the tropics : the cold , therefore , seems not to be the mechanical , but the final cause of refraction . This multiplication of light , which increases in the atmosphere , with the intenseness of the cold , is a consequence of the same law which transmits the moon into the northern signs , as the sun forsakes them , and causes her to illuminate the long nights of our pole , whae the sun is under the horizon ; for light of any sort is warm . These wonderful harmonies are not in the nature of the elements , but in the will of HIM who has established them in subordination to the necessities of a being endowed with sensibility . Fire presents phenomena still more incomprehensible . First of all , is fire matter Matter , according to philosophy , is divisible in length , breadth , and depth . Fire is divisible only in perpendicular length . Never will you divide a flame , or a ray of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is matter divisible only in two dimensions . Besides , it has no gravity , for it continually ascends ; nor levity , for it descends , and penetrates bodies ever so much below it . Fire , we are told , is contained in all bodies . But , being of a consuming nature , how does it not devour them How can it remain in water without being extinguished ? /q/ These and several other difficulties induced Newton to believe fire was not an element , but certain subtile matter put in motion . Friction , it is true , and collision , elicit fire from several bodies . But how comes it that air and water , though much agitated , never catch fire 1 Nay , how comes it that water even gets cold by motion , though its fluidity is entirely owing to its being impregnated by fire 1 Contrary to the nature of all other motions , wherefore does that of fire go on in a state of propagation , instead of meeting a check ? All bodies lose their motion by communicating it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion is communicated among them , it is divided and lost . But a spark of fire disengages from a piece of wood the igneous particles contained in it , arid the whole together increase their rapidity to such a degree , as to make one vast conflagration of a whole forest . We are not better acquainted with the negative qualities . Cold , they tell us , is produced by the absence of heat ; but if cold is merely a negative quality , how is it capable of producing positive effects ? If you put into water a bottle of iced wine , as I have seen done in Russia , you soon perceive ice of an inch thick cover the outside of the bottle . A block of ice diffuses cold all over the surrounding atmosphere . Darkness , which is a privation of light , diffuses no obscurity over surrounding light . If you open , in summer , a grotto dark and cool , the surrounding light will not be impaired by its darkness , but the heat of the adjacent air will be diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reply : it will be said , if there is no perceptible obscuration in the first case , it is owing to the rapidity of light which replaces the darkness ; but this would be increasing the difficulty , by supposing that darkness too has positive effects . On such pretended fundamental principles are most of our systems of physics reared . If we are in error or ignorance at the outset , we soon go astray on the road ; and it is incredible with what facility , having laid down our principles so slightly , we repay ourselves in consequences , vague terms , and contradictory ideas . I have seen , for example , the formation of thunder explained in celebrated physical tracts . Some say it is produced by the collision of two clouds ; as if clouds or foggy vapours could produce a collision ! Others gravely tell you it is the effect of air dilated by the sudden inflammation of the sulphur and nitre floating in it . But /z/ that it may produce those tremendous explosions , we must suppose the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mass of gunpowder is set fire to in an unconfined situation , no explosion follows . I know that the detonation of thunder has been imitated , in the experiment of fulminating powder ; but the materials employed in its composition have a sort of tenacity . They undergo , from the iron ladle which contains them , a resistance against which they sometimes act with such violence as to perforate it . But to imitate a phenomenon is not to explain it . The other effects of thunder are explained with similar levity . As the air is cooler after a thunder-storm , the nitre , we are told , diffused through the atmosphere , is the cause of it ; but was not that nitre there before the explosion , when we were almost suffocated with heat 1 Does nitre cool only when it is set on fire On this principle our batteries of cannon ought to become glaciers in the midst of a battle , for a world of nitre is then kindled into flame ; they must , however , cool the cannon with vinegar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick succession , it is impossible to apply your hand to the piece . The instantaneous flame of the nitre penetrates the metal , notwithstanding its thickness and solidity . The heat may likewise be occasioned by the interior vibration of the parts ; but the cooling of the air after a thunderstorm proceeds , in my opinion , from the surrounding stratum of frozen air , from the height of 12 to 1500 fathoms , which being divided and dilated at its base by the fire of the stormy clouds , flows hastily into our atmosphere . Its motion determines the fire of the thunder to direct itself contrary to its nature , toward the earth . It was affirmed , in the last age , that the earth was drawn out at the poles , and we are now positively told it is flattened there . I shall not at present enter into an examination of the principles of this last conclusion , and the observations on which it has been supported . The flattening of the earth at the poles has been accounted for from a centrifugal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed ; though this pretended force , which has increased the diameter of the earth at the equator , has not the power of raising even a straw into the air . The flattening of the poles , they tell us , has been ascer- STUDY IX . j 6 1 tained by the measurement of two terrestrial degrees , made at a vast expense ; the one in Peru , near the equator , and the other in Lapland , bordering- upon the polar circle. * Those experiments were made , undoubtedly , by men of great capacity and reputation . But persons of at least equal capacity and as high a name , have demonstrated , upon other principles and experiments , that the earth was lengthened at the poles . Cassini estimates at 50 leagues the length by which the axis of the earth exceeds its diameters , giving to each pole 25 leagues of elevation over the circumference of the globe . We shall agree with this illustrious astronomer , if we consider the testimony of the eye as of any weight ; for the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipses of the moon , as was observed by Tycho Brahe and Kepler , whose names are a host in themselves . But without considering any name as an authority where natural truths are concerned , we may conclude , from simple analogies , the elongation of the axis of the earth . If we consider the two hemispheres as two mountains , whose bases are at the equator , the summits at the poles , and the ocean which alternately flows from one of these summits as a great river descending from a mountain , we shall have , under this point of view , objects of comparison to determine the point of elevation from which the ocean takes its rise , by the distance of the place where its course terminates . Thus the summit of Chimborazo , the most elevated of the Andes of Peru , out of which the river of the Amazons issues , having a league and one-third nearly of elevation above the mouth of that river , is distant from it , in a straight line , about 26 degrees , or 650 leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pole must be elevated above the circumference of the earth nearly five leagues , to have a height proportioned to the course of the ocean , which extends as far as the line , 90 degrees distant , in a straight line . If we farther consider , that the course of the ocean does not terminate at the line , but when it descends in summer from our pole , extends beyond the Cape of Good-Hope , as far as the eastern extremities of Asia , where it forms the westerly monsoon , which almost encompasses the globe under the equator , we must assign to the pole , from which it /z/ departs , an elevation proportioned to its course , and of tripling , at least , that elevation , to give its waters a sufficient declivity . I put it down , then , at 15 leagues : and if to this height we add that of the ices there accumulated , the enormous pyramids of which over icy mountains have sometimes an elevation of one-third above the heights which support them , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of the 25 leagues above the circumference which Cassini assigned to it . Obelisks of ice 10 leagues high are not disproportioned to the centre of cupolas of ice 2000 leagues in diameter , which , in winter , cover our northern hemisphere ; and which have in the southern hemisphere , in February , that is , in the summer of that hemisphere , prominent borders , elevated like promontories , and 3000 leagues , at least , in circumference , according to the relation of Captain Cook , who coasted them round in 1773 and 1774 . The analogy I establish between the hemispheres of the earth , the poles , and the ocean which flows from them , and two mountains , their peaks , and the rivers which there have their sources , is in the order of the harmonies of the globe , which exhibits a great number of similar harmonies on a smaller scale in the continents , and in most islands , which are continents in miniature . Philosophy has , in all ages , affected very obscure causes to explain common effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar , who scarcely ever admire any thing but what they do not comprehend . She has taken advantage of this weakness of mankind , by infolding herself in a pomposity of words , or in the mysteries of geometry , the better to carry on the deception . For how many ages did she ring in our schools the horror of a vacuum , which she ascribed to Nature 1 How many pretended demonstrations of this have been given , which were to crown their authors with never-fading laurels , but are now gone to the land of forgetfulness /z/ She disdains to dwell on simple observations , which level to every capacity the harmonies of all the kingdoms of Nature . For example , the philosophy of our day refuses to the moon all influence over vegetables and animals . The most considerable growth of plants , however , is in the night-time ; nay , there are several vegetables which flower then only , /q/ and numerous classes of insects , birds , quadrupeds , and fishes regulate their loves , hunting-matches , and peregrinations according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrade philosophers to the experience of gardeners and fishermen ! What , condescend to think and talk like such groundlings ! If philosophy denies the influence of the moon over the minuter objects of the earth , she makes it up amply , by giving her a very extensive power over the globe itself , without being over-scrupulous about the self-contradiction . She affirms that the moon , in passing over the ocean , presses upon it , and thus occasions the flux of the tides on its shores . But how is it possible the moon should compress our atmosphere , which only extends , they say , to a score of leagues at most from us ? Or , admitting a subtile matter possessed of great elasticity , which should extend from our seas as far as the moon , how could this matter be compressed by it , unless you suppose it confined in a channel Must it not extend to the right and left , while the action of the planet could not be felt on any determinate point of the circumference of our globe ? Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas of small extent , where there are no tides 1 Their smallness ought no more to exempt them from the influence of her gravitation , than deprive them of the benefit of her light . Why are tides almost imperceptible in the Mediterranean 1 Wherefore do they undergo , in many places , intermittent movements , and retardations of two or three days Wherefore , in a word , toward the north , do they come from the north , east , or west , and not from the south , as was observed with surprise by Martens , Barents , Linschoten , and Ellis , who expected to see them come from the equator , as on the coasts of Europe The principal movements of the sea take place in our hemisphere at the same times with the principal phases of the moon ; but we ought not from thence to conclude their necessary dependence , still less explain it by laws not demonstrated . The currents and tides of the ocean proceed , as I think I have proved , from the effusion of the polar ices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , as he approaches either pole : and as the phases of the moon are /z/ themselves regulated by the course of the orb of day , this is the reason why both take place at the same time . Farther , the full moon has an effective and evaporating warmth , which must act , therefore , on the polar ices. * The Academy of Sciences formerly maintained that her light did not warm , after experiments made on her rays , and on the ball of a thermometer , with a burning mirror . This error has been completely refuted at Rome and Paris by a simple experiment . A vessel full of water was exposed to the light of the moon , and another placed in the shade : the water in the first vessel was evaporated much sooner than in that of the second . By all our industry and ingenuity , we can ascertain in Nature only results and harmonies : first principles universally escape us . The methods of our sciences have exercised a pernicious influence on our morals and religion . Men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when nothing is presented to them as first causes but mechanical means . Alas ! that is not the way toward that heaven we pretend to know so well . The greatest of mankind have looked thitherward as their last asylum . Cicero hoped after death to inhabit the stars ; and Ceesar , from that elevation , to preside over the destiny of Rome . How ! as the reward of virtue is our destination only to be confounded with the elements ! What , thy soul , O sublime Fenelon ! to be exhaled in inflammable air , and to have had on earth the sentiment of an order which did not exist even in the heavens ! How , among those stars so luminous is there nothing but material globes ; and in their motions , so constant and varied , nothing but blind attractions 1 How ! every thing around us insensible matter and no more ; and intelligence given to man only to render him miserable ! How ! and can we have been deceived by the involuntary sentiment which makes us raise our eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief ! Ah ! not thus has Nature appointed her gifts . We bewilder ourselves with vain sciences . By driving our researches up to the very principles of Nature , nay , of DEITY , we have stifled , in the heart , all feelings of both . We are like the peas- /q/ ant who was living happily in a little valley in the heart of the Alps . A brook descending " from those mountains fertilized his garden . Long he adored in tranquillity the beneficent Naiad who supplied his stream , and increased its quantity and coolness with the summer 's heat . One day he was desirous to discover the place where she concealed her inexhaustible urn . To prevent his going astray , he pursues upward the track of his rivulet . Every step discovers to him a thousand new objects ; plains , forests , rivers , kingdoms , boundless oceans . Transported with delight he proceeds in flattering hope of speedily reaching the blessed abode where the gods preside over the destiny of this world . But , after a painful scramble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He no longer sees anything around him but mists , rocks , torrents , precipices . All , all has vanished . Sweet and tranquil valley , humble roof , beneficent Naiad ! his patrimony is now reduced to a cloud , and his divinity to an enormous mass of ice . But the sublime genius and the pure spirit of Newton assuredly could not have stood still at the boundary prescribed to a vulgar mind . Had he been in the place of our Alpine peasant , he would have observed , with admiration , the constant impulsion communicated by the action of the sun , placed at an immense distance ; and instead of fruitlessly rambling after the habitation of a Naiad , at the summit of the Alps , would have prostrated himself before that GOD , whose providence embraces the concerns of a universe . In order to study Nature with understanding and to advantage , all the parts must be viewed in their harmony and connexion . The system of its harmonies I shall now proceed to unfold , is , in my opinion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first displayed by Pythagoras of Samos , the father of philosophy , and founder of that sect transmitted to us under the name of Pythagoreans . Never did a succession of men arise so enlightened as those sages were in the natural sciences , and none whose discoveries reflect higher honour on the human understanding . There existed , at that time , philosophers who maintained that water , fire , air , atoms , were the principles of things . Pythagoras opposed to this doctrine that the principles of things were the adaptations and proportions of which the harmonies were composed , and that goodness and intelligence constituted the nature of GOD . /z/ WE shall divide these laws into physical and moral , and endeavour to unfold the means of diminishing the sum of human wretchedness . I am presuming to open a path hitherto unattempted , and dare not natter myself that my progress and success keep pace with the ardour of my imagination and the anticipations of my heart . But the imperfect materials I have collected may perhaps one day assist men of greater ability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ Though conformity be a perception of our reason , I place it at the head of our physical laws , because it is the first feeling we endeavour to gratify in examining natural objects . Nay , there is a connexion so intimate between the physical character of those objects and the instinct of every being possessed of sensibility , that a colour simply is sufficient to rouse the passions of animals . A red object puts the bullock into a rage , and suggests to most fowls and fishes the idea of prey . The objects of Nature display in man a feeling of a higher order , independent of his wants ; it is that of conformity . It is by means of the multiplied conformities of Nature that man has formed his own reason ; for reason means nothing else but the relation or conformity of things that exist . Animals have a sensibility only of objects having conformities to their wants ; and they have , in this respect , a share of reason as perfect as our own . But man differs from animals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations of Nature , however foreign to his personal demands ; and this extension of reason has procured him , by way of eminence , the denomination of a rational animal . It is true , that if all the particular rationality of animals were united , the sum would probably transcend the general reason of man ; for human reason has devised most of its
