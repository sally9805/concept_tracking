txt FEW objects are of more importance to a country , than the prosperity of its institutions of learning . And to no country does this remark apply witb greater force than to our own . Here public opinion makes the law and the magistrate ; and hence whatever controls public opinion , controls every thing . It is for this reason , that our colleges and higher seminaries of learning are , we apprehend , more vitally connected with the public welfare than is ordinarily supposed . There is , probably , BO period of equal extent in the life of the scholar , or the professional man , in which so rnucb is done to store his mind with principles , form his character , and instruct him in the proper use of his mental powers , as the four years of his college course . Individual exceptions no doubt there are , but they are comparatively few . And in these few , the causes of failure to realize the legitimate results of a liberal education must , for the most part , be sougbt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the institution . The labors of the college manifestly lay broad and deep , in the youthful mind , the foundation for that professional eminence which is the fruit of riper years . The refined discriminations of criticism , the commanding eloquence of the forum and the desk , and the profound researches of philosophy , owe something , and , in truth , not a little , to the severe and perhaps irksome discipline of the recitation-room . The connexion is obviously most intimate between the successful accomplishment of a college education , and the successful discharge of those high and varied professional duties to wThch the student is shortly to he called . And hence the destiny of a great country , - a country , if judged by the increase of its population , its wealth , the extent of its resources , and the demand for every kind of professional service , without a parallel in the history of // the world , is really , in no small degree , dependent upon the condition of our higher seminaries of learning . And hence , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or is willing to admit , for cherishing them with peculiar solicitude . Any thing which can seriously affect their welfare is worthy of the most careful consideration . To watch over them with vigilance is the imperative duty of the public . The friends of reformation , ( without however setting aside the good old maxim of letting what is well alone , ) we are not disposed to be offended with those , nor entirely to discourage their efforts , who have labored with commendable diligence to reform what they have been pleased to consider the errors , and sometimes the abuses , of our colleges ; and to render them , as is pretended , more conducive to the practicat business of life . It must be confessed , however , and is much to be regretted , that such labors have not always been conducted with very enlarged views , either of the objects of academical instruction or the best means of attaining them . The truth is , the public mind , from some cause or other , has been for several years in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college education . At one moment , the current of opinion is strongly opposed to an extended study of the ancient classics ; at another , the exact sciences become the subject of relentless proscription at still another , the abstractions of metaphysics are vehemently assailed as a remnant of the scholastic jargon of the dark ages . Numberless , in turn , are the reasons for throwing all these out of the list of subjects , and for making education practical . These efforts of reform may imply a commendable zeal , but certainly not according to knowledge . They are no doubt well intended , and let this consideration be an apology for treating them with respect . But it is not in the subjects of study alone that there is need of reform . The motivcs for studying have heel ) subjected to a new analysis , and the result is that the principle af emulation , as it has been called , which , in all former times , has entered so largely into the business of study and of life , is no longer admissible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social , moral , and religious . It addresses itself to the worst passions and inflames them ; and by the desolations which it spreads around , effectually destroys all the salutary fruits of knowledge . Its complicated and alarm // ing evils have , from time to time , been held tip to the public in various discourses and periodicals devoted to the interests of education . The special object of these labors seems to be the removal of all those honors , and those distinctions in scholarship , which have been conferred as the reward of merit , to the end that students may not be tempted to study from improper motives ; and may not subject themselves and the community to the evils , which are conceived to follow such*a departure from the principles of right conduct . We have not been inattentive to the progress of this reform . At first , we viewed it as a misdirected but harmless effort to eradicate a principle of action , which is interwoven with the very texture of the human mind , and which , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years has shown , in this case , what has often been observed in others , that the attempt to accomplish what is impossible has been attended with serious evil . Sentiments unfavorable to distinctions in scholarship and to literary honors , having received the sanction of a few respectable names , have been warmly espoused by a certain portion of the students in several of our colleges . Instead of endeavouring , by a diligent application to the studies assigned them , to merit honors and distinctions , they have wasted , and worse than wasted their time , in meetings , discussions , resolves , and petitions intended to abolish them . And we fear that , in two or three instances , which have fallen under our notice , their efforts have been attended with more than merited success . And we fear , too , that in these cases , on the supposition that evils existed , the mode of redress is more to be deprecated than the evils complained of . Among the ancient Israelites , one of the tokens of their greatest degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is certainly , to say the least , not more auspicious to the interests of the public than becoming the modesty of yotith , for those , who have not yet numbered half their teens , to band together in the character of reformers and to reform too a usage which has stood the test of time , and been approved by the wise and good for more generations than they have seen years . But in this there is nothing wonderful . Reform is the spirit of the age ; and often it demolishes the rampart which time and experience have thrown up for the protection of society , merely to show the levelling power . The truth in colle es as in other communities , b // where , they are clamorous for change ; and there , too , as elsewhere , the clamor is apt to begin , not at the head , hut with some less aspiring memher of the body politic , and to proceed upwards with a vehemence somewhat proportioned to the distance between them . This we take to he the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no exceptions . Now we would neither conceal , nor underrate the grievances of any portion of the community ; nor would we maintain that there is not sometimes in colleges , as elsewhere , just ground of complaint in respect both to the principles which are adopted , and the manner of carrying them into effect . But we do maintain that , in a community where the frill benefit of enterprise and industry is offered to the acquisition of every competitor , there is a very special connexion between discontent and indolence ; between a dissatisfaction with distinctions and a consciousness of not deserving them . It is not indeed every one who professedly seeks , or wotild ostensibly be willing to accept of distinctions . Even he , whose " lowliness was young ambition 's ladder " " did thrice refuse the kingly crown ; " hut it , alas ! was urged upon him . And there have been many others equally humble in their pretensions , who , fortunately for their consistency of character , have not been so sorely pressed with honors as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vain is any attempt to disguise it , the love of approbation and the love of honorable distinction , or , perhaps , more properly speaking , the desire of those benefits which this distinction either implies or confers , , are natural to man ; and he who labors to suppress or eradicate them will not be likely very soon to be out of employment . But , however it may suit the convenience of some to join in the proscription of honors and distinctions as unnecessary* and as motives of action , unjustifiable ; and especially to urge their banishment from the halls of instruction ; others , entitled to the greatest respect , are sincerely of opinion that such incentives are wrong and dangerous , and that the best interests of education call for their discontinuance . The alleged consequences of these distinctions are the evils chiefly referred to in discussions upon " the principle of Emulation . " We propose to go somewhat more particularly into the examination of this question , with the hope of correcting some misapprehensions // on the subject , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are rightly informed , has already introduced disaffection and disorder , with their attendant evils , into more than one of our respectable colleges . The subject presents three questions for consideration . 1 . What is meant by the " principle of Emulation " ; or in other words , what is really the principle in discussion ? 2 . Is this principle justifiable as a rule of action ? 3 . Is it expedient to resort to it , as an incentive to diligence in the discipline and government of colleges ? These questions , we suppose , embrace all which is materially concerned in its issue . I. The principle of Emulation , so called , has been defined " the desire of surpassing others . " In defence of this as a principle of action , we have nothing to offer . Nor do we suppose that any one charged with the instruction of youth would be justified in urging upon his pupils the adoption of a principle , which had so little to recommend it . Nor do we believe that it is urged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be really what is meant by the principle of Emulation as applied to this subject , no one could treat it with less respect than ourselves . But this definition seems not to have been satisfactory . It has been amended thus " the desire of surpassing* others for the sake of the pleasure of surpassing them . " We are still less disposed to enter the lists in defence of Emulation understood in this sense . Nor is it the mere definition of a term that we are to discuss . We are to examine into the legitimacy of an important principle of action . And here we can not but remark , that so far as our observation goes , all those , who have come before the public with views adverse to its use , have erred in their notions of the real principle in discussion . They have first called it Emulation , and have then resorted to the jus et norma loquendi , to fix the meaning of the term . We shall take the liberty of pursuing a different course . Without further troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall endeavour to ascertain the principle by examining the actual circumstances of the case . From time immemorial , it has been the practice in almost all institutions of learning , in all countries , to confer some mark of distinction upon successful scholarship . Such a practice is as old at least as the time of Herodotus and the Olympic games // and it has obtained in every succeeding age , in which scholarship has been held in the least estimation . As it respects our own colleges , this principle has been recognised and acted upon from the beginning . The conferring of literary degrees was originally intended to certify on the part of the recipient a large and bon1*fide proficiency in liberal studies . They do still guarantee a proficiency in literature and science not unworthy of respect , and we trust of great value . But it must be confessed , that they do not now imply all that the friends of a high order of scholarship could desire . If with us , as in Germany , degrees were restricted to those who pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tried abilities , it might obviate the necessity of any other stimulus to exertion . But the practice of conferring degrees on easy terms is of too long standing to be readily changed . With us , degrees are not distinctions . For the purpose , however , of encouraging diligence and rewarding merit , a system of honors and distinctions was long ago established by all our older institutions , and has with few exceptions been adopted by the younger , intended to mark the first , second , third , and , in some instances remoter grades of scholarship . In some few instances special prizes have been established , for the reward of excellence in some particular department ; and , in most cases , Literary Societies exist , in which a selection of members , based upon scholarship , is made from each successive class . The hope and desire of these distinctions are , as is well known , with here and there an exception , powerful incentives to exertion . Now let it be particularly observed , that no teacher so far as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of being distinguished , or of attaining to a superiority , as a motive of action . Nor would we willingly think so poorly of any student capable of attaining eminence , as to suppose that he could be influenced by so narrow a view of the subject . So far as the institution is concerned , the honor or distinction is intended to be strictly a reward of merit . This is the true and only light in which it can be viewed . There is , so far as we are informed , no investigation into the motives of the student , nor would the motives , if known , at all alter the fact as to his diligence , good behaviour , or superior proficiency ; and it is in consideration of these substantial realities , not the varying motives which have been instrumental in attaining them , that the honor is awarded . So far and no further is the // institution concerned . This arrangement is left to produce its naturalyffect upon the mind of the student . In what way it will operate upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine . The presumption beforehand is that it would operate as a strong stimulant to exertion ; and from long observation , we are well assured of the fact , that it does so . If we descend to a more minute inquiry , as to the precise motive by which students are actuated in view of honors and distinctions , we think it will be found to be not the mere distinction , nor the mere attainment of an honor , but the important good which these either guarantee , or imply . That good may consist in personal advantages ; such for instance as the means of an easy and comfortable living , the acquisition of wealth and its attendant enjoyments , the pleasures of knowledge , of a cultivated intellect , and a refined taste ; - or it may consist in an increased ability to promote the welfare of others , and to advance the best interests of the human race . In the mind of the student , ( we must of course be understood to speak of the thing generally , ) the honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves . By the principle of Emulation , then , so far as this question is concerned , must be meant the desire of securing those benefits and advantages , which naturally belong to superiority in knowledge , virtue , and abilities . This , if such we may call it , is the principle in discussion . As the student looks forward into life and contemplates the prospect before him , his first object is to merit and secure , on leaving his Alma Mater , an honorable distinction among his associates . This being done , he enters upon professional studies , or upon the more immediate business of life , with the advantage of a good preparation and a favorable introduction to the public . This we believe is the true statement of the case . So far as the principles of morality are concerned , it is precisely the same as being actuated by the hope of reward . It may be said that this reward implies distinction , that what one gains another must lose , and thus one is built up by the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not alter the principle . Moreover , this distinction is only the distinction of merit , which is equally implied in all cases of reward whatever . The disadvantage which may incidentally , or even necessarily , accrue to others , is chargeable , not surely upon the successful competitor , but upon the nature of things . And it may be // that this kind of disadvantage forms an important part of the great disciplinary scheme of the present world , and is therefore a thing from which we may derive improvement , hut against which all objections are vain . The hope , then , of a reward , of a substantial benefit , not that of an empty distinction or a worthless superiority , is the incentive to diligence in the case before us . II . If these remarks are well founded , we fear that any extended discussion of the question , whether this is a justifi able principle of action , will he deemed a work of supererogation . We shall therefore he brief . But to prevent misapprehension , let it he distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine what is the best possible motive of action , nor does our argument involve any comparison of the merit of different motives . rrhe bsimple and only question is , whether the one proposed is justifiable . 1 . It is sanctioned hy revealed religion . The scripture commands us to love the Lord our God with all our hearts . This , beyond all doubt , is our first and highest duty . But is there no hope of a reward , that is , of a special good , resulting to ourselves , from keeping this command ? The same authority which revealed the command , has assured us that obedience brings along with it the highest possible happiness of which we are capable ; and what is more to the purpose , the very object of this assurance is , to urge us , hy the consideration of our highest interest , to the performance of our duty . The quotation of particular passages of scripture in illustration of this fact , is unnecessary . It appears on almost every page of revelation . 2 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present moral government . Thus for instance , competence is the reward of industry and frugality in the common affairs of life , and the attainment of this competence is the chief incentive to the practice of these virtues . Approbation is the natural consequence and reward of generosity , kindness , and henevolence ; and very few , we fancy , have attained to such an exalted pitch of virtue , such an entire devotion to abstract right and duty , as not to feel desirous of securing the approbation of the wise and good . Puhlic confidence is the reward of faithful public service , and this confidence is a natural object of desire ; and we can not hut think that , in all these cases , it was intended by the great framer of our // moral constitution , that these fixed and known consequences should operate upon us , as incentives to the performance of our duties . This principle is so palpable and so pervading , that further illustration is needless . Whoever wishes to see it developed with profound and masterly skill , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature . 3 . As a third reason we may add , that this principle is inseparahle from the present condition of human nature . The love of approbation is coeval with the dawn of intelligence . It is inherent in the constitution of the being , and can no more he removed or suppressed , than the desire of good . At mature age it is subjected to the control of reason and conscience as all other desires are ; hut it still exists , and , under this control , plays a roost important part in the changing scenes of life . Who needs he told that the hope of reward and the desire of future good , flow out with every pulsation of the youthful heart ? And who does not know , that the principles of action inherent in the youthful constitution , grow with its growth and strengthen with its strength , subject only to the modification of new conditions , and ( lirected more wisely to the purposes , of life ? No doubt we may imagine a being never conscious of the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never quickened in his powers of action by the desire of ameliorating his condition . But such is not the human being , nor one fitted for the appointed sphere of human activity . Discard this class of motives , and what would be manifestly the result ? The hum of industry would soon die away ; the plough wonld stand still in the furrow , the reaper lie down in the field , the loom and the spindle would cease their motion , the stately ship would crumble in the dock , and the restless activity of business would give place to universal lethargy . Paralysis would seize on every branch and member of the social system . Man would he unfitted for the task most clearly assigned him in the present world . From all these considerations we conclude , that the hope of reward is justifiable as a principle of action . The title to a reward is not rendered null and void by endeavouring to secure li , and the morality , which requires that it should he so , must proceed upon a principle nowhere recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared , then , to inquire in the third place , whether it is expedient to resort to this principle of action in // the discipline and government of colleges . The discussion under this branch of the subject must be somewhat extended . Several important considerations evince , in our opinion , the expediency of this course . 1 . We remark , first , that from the peculiar circumstances of the case , there is need of some strong , some controlling incentive to diligence and good behaviour . Students in our colleges are , for the most part , of an age peculiarly critical as it respects the formation of habits . Youth is proverbially giddy , thoughtless , and rash ; and no period of youth is more strongly marked by the outcropping ofthose qualities than that in which a college course is ordinarily begun . The spirits are then buoyant , the passions are predominant ; the love of novelty , of change and adventure , are the prominent characteristics of this period of life . Upon the then new and fertile soil , every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in order to check the growth of what is noxious and useless , and to cherish what is salutary and valuable . Add , moreover , that at the time of entering college , youth are just freed from the wholesome and needful restraints of parental authority . Notions of independence and self-control are but too apt to verge on the dangerous extreme . Men , aided by maturity of judgment and reason , and taught by large experience in the affairs of life , do not always turn liberty to the best account ; much less is it to be expected of boys , when first left to act for themselves , and placed in circumstances which call for prudence and discretion . The transition from the paternal roof , where the eyes of an anxious father are seldom withdrawn from the object of his warmest affections and fondest hopes ; and from the school-room , where the personal presence of the master frowns upon the idle , urges forward the loiterer , cheers the industrious , and rebukes the wayward ; to the halls of the college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-government to a considerable extent are presupposed , and where the time of the pupil must be left in a great measure to his own disposal ; - this transition we say is great , and to very many whose characters and principles of action are not previously formed , it is a transition fatal to industry , to virtue , to the fairest promises of untried youth . And hence is there need of some controlling principle of action placed in the hands of the teacher , which may operate as a safeguard in this period of danger . // 2 . We remark further , that as young men at this age need the influence of some strong incentive to diligence and good behaviour , so they are peculiarly susceptible of being influenced by the hope of reward and of honorable distinction . This arises from the very nature and circumstances of the case . Manhood looks around , before and after , with watchful care ; old age loo*ks backward and lingers upon the past ; but youth looks forward , its gaze is fixed upon the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fast reaching l ) affection , the intellect is just beginning to repose with confidence on its own energies , the imagination paints the scenes of future achievement with all the vivid coloring of reality , and the passions , ardent and impetuous , prompt to deeds of deathless fame . Under these circumstances the love of approbation , the hope of reward , the desire of honorable distinction , will be foLind among the most powerful incentives to action which can be addressed to the young . And is it not justifiable , expedient , and wise , to seize the opportunity to turn them to good account ? May we not conclude , with a good degree of confidence , that it was intended that we should avail ourselves of these natural and indestructible elements of the human mind , peculiarly prominent in youth , to shape and guide the course of that perilous age ? For ourselves we can not but think , that this peculiar fitness should vindicate the propriety of a practice , which seems to be founded in nature . 3 . A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the fact , that it serves materially to increase the influence of the teacher over his pupils . We here take it for granted that this is a desirable end , an important object ; and we take it for granted , too , that teachers in colleges are generally such persons as , from their age , discretion , virtue , and intelligence , are fitted to exert , in every respect , a salutary influence over those committed to their care . It scarce need be remarked , that the business of government is at all times responsible , often difficult ; but in no case is it more responsible , or more difficult , than in the government of colleges . Its responsibleness arises from the momentous consequences which must follow successful or unsuccessful discipline . The youth , who constitute the inmates of the college , are destined shortly to figure in the various walks of professional life . They are to stand in the high places of the community . They are to become the accredited advisers of the great mass of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual concerns . To them xviii the public look for example and precept . Their influence , often silent and unperceived and difficult to trace , will yet be widely diffused , nay , all-pervading . It will affect even the discipline and amusements of the nursery ; it will direct the order and instruction of the public schools ; it will speak to listening multitudes from the desk ; it will frame the law in the hall of legislation , and on the bench expound it and pronounce its sentence . The forms of social intercourse , the policy of trade , the maxims of morality , the supreme tribunal of republics , public opinion , will all feel its presence . Such , without exaggeration , is the character of that influence . How responsible is the business of forming the principles and moulding the character of those , who are destined to wield it ! He , who governs the college well , who , aside from the intellectual discipline actually imparted , makes it the school of wakeful industry , of sound morals , of amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon society one of the richest blessings , which fall within the competence of man to bestow . But this task is by nb means easy . He who governs the college must contend with all the difficulties which lie in the way of parental government , without the natural means of the parent to overcome them . He stands , it is true , in loco parentis , but parental authority when thus transferred loses much of its peculiar efficacy . This efficacy in fact is not transferable . By the laws of nature , it is vested inalienably in the parent . In addition to this disadvantage of the derived authority , as the youthful community increases , is the necessity increased of stricter discipline and more effective means of control . The college officer is , indeed , armed with the authority of law ; but it is not the law of the civil magistrate , nor is it expected that it will be executed in the same manner and on the same principles . Personal influence after all is his most effectual means of preserving order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pupils . It is , therefore , a matter of sound policy to tnake that influence as commanding as possible . And in order to this , we must concentrate , as far as may be , in his hands , and place at his disposal , all those incentives to action , which are most powerful with the young . // question . It is the relation which students sustain to the public as candidates for patronage . In this point of view , the propriety of college honors and distinctions , will appear , if we mistake not , in a strong light , whether we consider the rights of the student , or tho3e of the public . Can any pretend that the student is not justly entitled to the distinction , which by diligence , good behaviour , and proficiency , he has fairly earned ? Is there any thing which can more properly and justly be called his own , than his reputation as a scholar ? Is there any thing more dear , or more valuable to him ? Nay more , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be more valued ? To many a young man , destined to he the ornament and pride of his country , the literary reputation which he brings from the seat of learning stands in the place of a patrimony . It is his inheritance , secured to him not by the laws of the land , but by the common consent of mankind . Take from him this reputation , and you leave him , in every sense of the word , poor indeed . Might we not with as much justice deprive him of his legal possessions in houses and lands , as deprive him of what is no less his , the reputation on which alone he relies for an introduction to honorable and useful employment ? So far as the question of right is concerned , we confess that we can see no difference between the cases . The matter of fact is , that such a distinction actually exists ; within the limited circle of academic intercourse , it is acknowledged , and can not but be acknowledged so long as the sentiment of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . It will be said , perhaps , that this very fact completely obviates the necessity of the usage for which we are contending ; that it renders any other distinction needless and uncalled for . It is certainly true , that under all ordinary circumstances merit will sooner or later find its own level . But why should obstacles be thrown in its way ? Why should it be knowingly and voluntarily thrown in the back ground , and doomed repeatedly to struggle into notice , before it can realize the benefits to which it has long been entitled ? We most frankly affirm that we know not by what principle of morals , or what obligation of conscience , or what maxim of a just and sound policy , we are called upon to withhold a public declaration of that distinction , which already exists in fact , and which , in point of justice , is as fairly due as the wages of labor . But the community has some interest , and we think some // rights , in this matter . The services of educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . They , who by their public acts , and their liberality , have established and patronized our seminaries of learning , have certainly acquired some right to enjoy the fruit of them . And with respect to those , who have received the benefit of a liberal education , and present themselves as candidates for patronage , there is an undoubted right , on the part of the public , to inquire into their qualifications , to ask for testimonials , and to receive them . In this point of view , the awarding of a distinction , or the conferring of an honor , is no other than a testimony to the public respecting the character and qualifications of the recipient . So far as any principle worth the naming is concerned , what is the difference between a public honor and a private certificate signed by the officers of instruction ? If the honor is not justifiable , or is inexpedient , the same must be true of the certificate . It may seem a little incongruous ( possibly we may not he duly informed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions do not feel any embarrassment in asking for private letters of recommendation , nor any reluctance in accepting such as award to them their full measure of merit ; nor have they , on such occasions , manifested the slightest misgivings on account of any injustice thereby done to others equally meritorious . We do not mention this in order to censure , but only to remark the incongruity , and show how difficult it is to avoid in practice a principle , wl ) ich is founded in nature . It often becomes apparent , in the very measures which we are adopting to suppress it . If then , it is right and proper to give a private testimonial , we can not discern wherein it is wrong to axvard a public honor . And if the community is entitled to require the former as a condition of public service , they are no less entitled to the convenience and benefit of the latter in respect to the same service . Nor ought the rights of the institution itself to be entirely overlooked . It has a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reputation , and this again depends very much upon the character and scholarship of those who have received the benefits of its instruction , and who will be understood , in the community at large , to represent its merits as a seat of liberal education . Now the institution has , we think , some right to say who // shall be its representatives , and how far , and in what respects they shall represent its claim to public patronage . This it might be expected to do , we grant , by the degrees which it confers . But the difficulty on this point , has already been the subject of remark . The usage of conferring degrees upon slight examinations , is of too long standing , and too general , to be easily changed . If they were restricted to those who have really merited well as scholat 's and men , they would answer all the purposes , or nearly all the purposes , of honors and distinctions . As things are , the security of the institution must be sought in the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continuing the use of literary honors and distinctions , as incentives to diligence an ( l good behaviour , in our seminaries of learning . It is easy , however , to foresee that objections will be urged against our conclusion . We will endeavour to meet them fUirly. 1 . The most weighty objection which to our knowledge has been urged , is , that distinctions in scholarship bold up to the pupil an improper motive to exertion . This has been anticipated , and we hope satisfactorily answered , in treating the second general question proposed . 2 . The next , in point of importance , which has fallen under our notice , is , that the system necessarily leads to strife , heart-burnings , and envy , among those who ought rather to he encouraged to pursue their studies in harmony and love . As to the matter of fact , this may sometimes be so , and is certainly much to be deplored . But whence comes the necessity of it ? Is any one really obliged to be envious at the success of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , can not witness the reward of merit without heart-burnings and animosities ? We believe that a large majority of those who are candidates for distinction , wOul ( l spurn the imputation as a libel upon their characters . We have known too many instances of uninterru pted friendship and intimacy between competitors for tl ) e first honors , to believe that the evil alleged is at all a necessary one . The truth is , these are passions which disfigure the fair features of human nature . They find no peculiar nutriment in literary distinctions . It is their nature // to be awakened and inflamed by all honors , and all distinctions , which are alien to the individual in whose bosom is fixed their own dark and gloomy abode . The wealth of the merchant , the popularity of the statesman , and the office of the magistrate , are as much the subjects of envy , to some portions of the community , as the literary distinctions of the scholar . If we are to condemn and remove every thing which can become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just begun . It must proceed , till radicalism , and agrarianism , have reduced society , as far as the immutable differences in things will permit , to a dead and barren level . And even then , ( which shows the folly of the project , ) the evil would still exist ; for distinctions are inevitable , and those of nature are often as invidious as those of society . When human skill has attained such compass and perfection , as to make every tree grow to the same size , and every blossom wear the same hue , then , and not till then , may all those distinctions be removed , which rankle in the bosom of envy . We might suggest another mode of correcting the evil , which would be quite as efficacious , and much more in harmony with those just principles of moral duty , which it becomes all men to honor . We would endeavour to eradicate the venom , not depopulate the earth to prevent its mischief . 3 . Another objection deserving of some notice is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring distinctions upon some will operate to the injury of others . This , it is said , will arise in part , from the extreme difficulty , perhaps impossihility , of determinin0 the exact claims of different candidates , and in part , from the difficulty of fixing upon a system of distinctions exactly to meet them . As to the former , we readily admit the difficulty alleged . But what is the inference ? that injustice must follow a decision ? We grant that it may , not that it must . And another inference from the same fact , much more important , is , that where any injustice really exists , it must , from the very nature of the case , be so small in its amount , so trivial , that its existence can not be certainly known . It must , after the loudest complaint , really remain doubtful whether there was any just ground for it . So that practically , we can not but think that this part of the objection , to borrow // the language of the older mathematicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the difficulty of meeting the various claims , so as to award distinctions in the precise ratio of merit , it generally can not be done . But in a case which admits of degrees , shall we abandon the end altogether , because we can not attain it l ) perfectly ? The same objection in full force , lies against the enactment of penal laws , and the administration of justice throughout the world ; but weigbed against the benefits received , notwithstanding this defect , it sinks into insignificance . So we think it must , on mature reflection , in the case before us. 4 . And finally , it is said that by encouraging numbers to hope for what few can actually obtain , many must suffer a disappointment , which will operate seriously to their disadvantage in future life . To this we reply , that the honorable appointments need not be , and generally are not , very few , compared with the number of pupils . But we can not be supposed to be answerable for the usages of each particular institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular individual . But to illustrate the principle of the objection , let us select a case every way favorable to the views of the objector . One of the competitors for the first honor fails in his object , supposing the honor merely to be his object . This disappointment may occasion a temporary depression of feeling , nothing more . How is he injured by the competition ? Will he come less honorably , and less advantageously before the community , for having entered the lists , and shown that he was anxious to try his ability , and reluctant to fall back into the ranks of mere mediocrity without a trial ? Will his increased acquisitions , his habits of vigorous study , be the less valuable , because another has surpassed him ? The very failure does him infinitely more credit , than the listlessness and apathy which would have declined the contest . We can see but very small probability of any serious injury from this source . The experience of the past , we believe , lends no support to any fears which may exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to ascertain them , are the objections which have been most frequently , and most strongly urged against the system of college honors . With what justice they have been urged , and how far they have now been obviated , our readers must judge . // We might here dismiss the subject ; but it seems appropriate to refer more particularly to the antiquity and prevalence of the practice of conferring some mark of distinction upon successful scholarship . We have already remarked that it was as old as the Father of History , and the Olympic games . It is well known , that contests in poetry and eloquence were among the objects of attraction at those national festivals ; nor is it difficult to credit the assertion , that the desire of bearing off the olive-wreath , on those splendid occasions , contributed in no small degree to the unrivalled refinement and ele ance of Grecian literature ; a literature , which at this moment is , and for ages has been , studied , and admired , and imitated throughout the civilized world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the importance of literary honors , as incentives to diligence . In the English universities , to receive a degree of Bachelor of Arts , among the o* wo*xo* , means little more , than that three years have been passed in idleness , dissipation , and mischief . It is little more than a mere nominal affair , and holds out no motive to exertion . But it is far otherwise with the university honors . These ( we speak now more particularly of Cambridge ) belong , as is probably known to the most of our readers , to three classes , denominated Wranglers , Senior Optitnes , and Junior Optiines . On the final examination in the Senate-house , from fifteen to twenty are assigned to each of these classes , and numbered in the order of scholarship . The examinations for these honors embrace all the higher and more difficult branches of classical literature and the exact sciences ; and are conducted with a severity , at which , in this country , all our college fraternities would stand aghast ; the student being required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paper , to translate a passage of Shakspeare , selected at l ) leasure , into Greek Tragic Jambics , or to solve one of the most complicated and thorny problems of the Infinitesimal Calculus . But , in proportion to the severity of the task , is the importance and honor of success . The same general system obtains at Oxford , where we are assured , on respectable authority , that " the great spring which moves and invigorates the whole is emulation . " We hazard nothing in the assertion , that without this system // of honors , or something equivalent , the English universities could never have become , nor could they long remain , what they now are , the pride and boast of England . Would that the sentence of proscription against half her sons no longer stained their annals ! In the German universities , the examinations for the lowest degree conferred , that of Doctor of Philosophy , partake of the same severity and extent , as those for honors in the English . The students collected together from all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are entirely free from all university discipline . They enjoy all the freedom of citizens . There is no reproof for irregularity , no censure for neglect . Under this state of things , it may well he asked , and well deserves to he considered , by what means that untiring diligence , and that thorough scholarship , which characterize the great body of the German students , are secured ? Is it owing to any felicitous peculiarity in the genius of German youths ? Or is it owing to the inspiring example , the stirring exhortation , and personal influence of learned professors ? To neither ; hut to the simple fact that no student is admitted to a degree , or to any employment , hardly to teach the rudiments of classical learning in the lowest Gymnasia , without sustaining the most rigid examinations on all the branches of a university education . " The chief secret , " says Professor Robinson , who evidently examined the subject with touch care , " lies in the direct power of government over all places of honor and profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sine qud non preparation for every public station ; and lastly , and principally , in the fact , that no one is even then admitted into any profession , nor to hold any office whatever , without being first subjected to two , and sometimes three , severe examinations . Here is the strong hold of the government upon the students , and the main secret of the diligence and good behaviour of the latter . " Degrees there operate precisely as college honors do elsewhere . With no high incentives to diligence , in the form of literary honors and degrees , awarded not as a matter of course , but only on the most ample proof of real scholarship ; honors and degrees , which at once introduce the recipient to the favorable notice of the public , and open before him the most eligible // walks of life ; is it to be supposed , that those foreign universities could ever have achieved what they have done , with so much honor to themselves , and advantage to the world ? And is it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any such incentives , may safely rely upon the student 's sense of propriety , and his love of knowledge , for the full performance of those toilsome duties which devolve upon him ? The notion is utterly futile . It has no foundation in the ample history of man . Ease and enjoyment , not labor and self-denial , are congenial to his nature . Some strong incentive , something over and above a thirst for knowledge , and a sense of * ) propriety , is absolutely necessary to summon the latent energies of his mind to action , and insure that dili ence , and that vigorous concentration of effort , which lie at the foundation of all high attainments in literature and science . rrl ) at necessary incentive is found , as we think , and as we have endeavoured to show , in the proper distribution of college honors and distinctions . Such , in conclusion , are our views of the important subject which we have ventured to discuss . The principle of emulation , that is , the desire of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , virtue , and abilities , is founded in nature ; it is justifiable as a rule of action , being recognised and sanctioned by revealed religion , and by the whole course of God 's present moral government ; it is , for the reasons stated , highly expedient to resort to it , as an incentive to diligence in the discipline and *overnmcnt of colleges . We can not therefore , but hope , that those , who are charged with the management of our literary institutions , will be slow to abolish a practice , which , i ) ased upon the most obvious dictates of reason and common sense , has in all former times done so much to elicit the powers of the youthful mind , and advance the interests of sound learning.
