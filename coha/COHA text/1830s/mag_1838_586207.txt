txt To establish a sound system of banking and currency would probably require no greater sacrifices than will be necessary to rebuild that which has been the cause of so many calamities both public and private . But , if we may believe the newspapers , the great body of our legislators , both State and Federal , have no higher object in view than to restore the old system without improvement or alteration , and as this can not be done without a resumption of specie payments , to this subject shall our remarks in the present article be confined . Resumption of specie payments ! How many there are who seem to think that it is as easy for the banks to resume as to suspend-as easy to pay as to incur debts . Resumption of specie payments ! How few seem to be aware that this involves the dis-I covery of the insolvency of men who have long had the reputation of being very rich  --  the destruction of innumerable speculationsthe loss of millions of imaginary profits-and , what is more to be deplored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an increased difficulty of fulfilling pecuniary obligations . A general resumption of specie payments is indeed much to be desired , but it can not be effected without exertion on the part of the banks , and suffering on the part of the people . If the State Banks will not regulate themselves , no power on earth can regulate them , except the power that created them , that is to say , the State governments . A new National Bank would , in a crisis like this , increase our sufferings . Supposing our present excess of paper money to be thirty millions of dollars , and supposing a new National Bank to circulate twenty millions , the State Banks would have to contract to the extent of fifty millions instead of thirty millions . There is no mode of resuming and sustaming specie payments , but by reducing our circulating medium to a just proportion with the commodities which we have to circulate , and to a just proportion with the circulating medium of the countries with which we have the most extensive commercial connections . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , retard a return to specie payments . Some time must elapse before it could be brought into operation , and all this time a portion of capital would be lying quiescent . The demand for specie to pay the first instalments would raise the price of that article in the market , an effect synonymous with a further depreciation of the notes in circulation . These would , however , be trifling grievances compared with the additional contractions which the establishment of a National Bank would make indispensable . Some are anxious that the Government should assist the money corporations by receiving , for a time , their irredeemable paper . But this would only encourage them to increase their issues . It would be an attempt to correct the evils of a redundant currency by making it still more redundant . Stripped of all disguises , it is a proposition that the Government shall redeem the notes of the Banks , not indeed by paying gold and silver for them , but by giving land for them . It would be thought very strange if any one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants , manufacturers , mechanics , or farmers , or attempt to relieve them from their embarrassments by receiving their dishonored paper in payments for land or duties . But men have one rule for judging of individuals , and another for judging of corporations . We refuse to sell the public lands on credit to the honest and industrious settler , even though he should pay interest for the time during which payment might be deferred ; and yet there are those among us who would have us part with the public property for bank credits bearing no interest , and this after millions on millions have been lost by this course of procedure . Only unite half a dozen men in a corporation , and then they are , in the opinion of many , entitled to privileges and immunities which none would be willing to allow them in their individual capacity . But this is not the only objection to this proposal . If the Government receives irredeemable paper from some , it must receive it from all , as otherwise " duties , imposts , and excises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Receiving nothing but irredeemable paper , it could pay nothing but irredeemable paper , which would be an utter subversion of law and Constitution so far as regards the inviolability of contracts . If Government must pay the debts of the banks , let it be done openly , by borrowing money to the requisite amount , and imposing a ( lirect tax on the people to meet the interest . A funded debt of one hundred or two hundred millions of dollars would not be productive of as much evil as would be caused by Government 's paying the debts of the banks in the round-about way some have suggested . It would be a mere renewal of the causes which have led to the present derangement of currency and exchanges , and lead to fresh embarrassments in commerce and credit . // The solvent banks can resume specie payments without any aid from the General Government or the States , and so likewise may many of the insolvent . For this end they have only to take due care that their immediate means shall , from day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate payment . It is one among the many beauties of the system , that banks may sustain their credit after all their capital is gone . Fot ' them to resume specie payments , they have only to conform their practices , as rapidly as they can and as well as their circumstances will admit , to the true principles of commercial banking . For them to sustain specie payments , they have only to provide for the prompt settlement of the balances they owe to one another . The principal obstacles to a general resumption are the sums the banks owe to the General Government and the States , and the amount they have loaned , over and above the proper amount of their loanable fund , to dealers in stocks and speculators in lands . For this excess it will be necessary for them to provide capital . Mere credit operations will not here suffice . By commercial dis .. counts a current is constantly flowing out of the banks , but another current is as constantly flowing in . There can be no such counter currents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Government or to the States . Neither can there be any in aid of such banks as have made loans on accommodation paper to an amount beyond their proper capital . Let not the banks affirm that they have it not in their power to accomplish this object . Some of them can raise the necessary funds by sales of stock and real estate . Such of them as have not completed their capital may call *n additional instalments , requiring payment not in stock notes , but in bankable funds . Some of them can negotiate loans in Europe , and some in America . Others may diminish the amount of their immediate liabilities by allowing interest on deposits left with them for three months and upwards . They may all strengthen themselves by reducing the rate of their dividends . And , lastly , the creditor banks can , for a suitable compensation , grant liberal indulgences to the debtor banks . None of these propositions xviii be very acceptable to those to whom they are addressed , because they all go to diminish their immediate profits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must expect to suffer also . Any bank which is not prepared to make the necessary sacrifices for resuming and sustaining specie payments , ought at once to take measures for gradually winding up its concerns . Perhaps it would be best for them and for the nation also , if one-third of the whole number should take this resolution . The present number is greater than can possibly be sustained by the profits of fair banking . The principle by which a resumption is to be effected is contrac // tion . But it should be a contraction of currency , not of mercan* tile loans and discounts . This was the error of the banks at the time of the former resumption . They held on to their stocks , and pressed heavily on the commercial community . This was the error of the United States Bank in 1818 . All its curtailments , except at one or two branches , were of mercantile paper . rrhe debtors on stock notes were scarcely affected . Perhaps it xviii be expecting almost too much from poor human nature , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business paper at the rate their charters allow , when the market rate is considerably higher . We must not be disappointed if many a bank directory confines its regular discounts to the accommodaq tion notes of its own members and their favorites , and if these em* ploy the fund thus acquired in " shaving . " This is a necessary consequence of carrying on the banking business by means of corporations , and no man who has ever aided in establishing a banking corporation has any right to complain of the necessary conse consequences . Yet , if the banks consult their permanent , rather than than their temporary , interest , they will make almost any sacrifices rather than contract their discounts of business paper . The commerce of the country is what supports the banks , as the agriculture ' and manufactures of the country are what support its commerce. - The great evil of the system , as managed with us , is , that it sometimes makes prices artificially high , and makes them at other times artificially low . The average price of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the year 1809 , about forty-two dollars an acre . Through the speculations occasioned by the superabundance of bank issues , it was raised to eighty-five dollars in 1815-16 . By the reaction of 1819 , it fell to less than thirty dollars . In some sections of the country , the fall in the price of the produce of land was still more remarkable . In 1820-21 corn was in some parts of Kentucky and Ohio at ten cents , and wheat at twenty cents , a bushel . In May , 18 ' 21 , flour was one dollar a barrel at Pittsburg , and other articles of domestic produce low in proportion . in that year , the average price of flour throughout the country was , according to Mr. Niles , only two dollars and a half a barrel . Mr. Ricardo believed that a return to specie payments in England would cause prices to fall only five per cent . Lord Ashburton ( formerly Mr. Baring ) has recently stated that the fall was about thirty per cent . But , as prices rose again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , as well as in our own country , was not the simple effect of the resumption of specie payments , but of the monnei* in which the resumption was effected . Instances have occurred ( l in our own history , of money being very // abundant in the stock market and very scarce with the regular merchant . As the banks value their own salvation , let them guard against this in the present crisis . It is not enough for them to issue a sufficiency of currency for the exchange of commodities . They must issue it in such a way that it shall fall into the proper handsthat it may pass from the merchant to the farmer and mechanic , and then back to the merchant . If the banks pursue any other course than this , there will be a ruinous fall of prices . The ability of their debtors to pay will be diminished , if not destroyed . Agriculture will be paralyzed , manufactures laid prostrate , and commerce thrown into the utmost confusion ; and then , whatever opportunities there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making profits by fair and legitimate banking . The State banks gained nothing , in the long run , by holding on to their stocks and pressing on the merchants , at the time of the former resumption . Neither did the United States Bank , by the favors it granted to the holders of stock , and its curtailment of mercantile discounts . The dulness of business that followed in the Atlantic States , and the ruin that overspread the Western States , were but the natural consequences of this erroneous policy . Every difficulty may be surmounted if the affairs of the banks are conducted with sound judgment . The cry that they are in danger from the Government is got up for partisan effect , or to conceal their true reasons for not resuming . The Government has a deep interest in specie payments being restored ; for , till this object is effected , it must always be exposed to more or less embarrassment in its fiscal operations . As little danger have they to apprehend from the people. - When , we may ask , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except by the direct or indirect action of other banks ? There was , indeed , a run on the banks of New York previous to the late suspension , but was not this preceded by a run by the banks on one another ? The chief danger to which the banks are exposed is from themselves . It is believed that the powerful are anxious to take advantage of the present crisis , to force the weak out of existence . If bank will war against bank , we will not be answerable for the consequences . If the banks will not place confidence in one another , it can not be expected that the public will place confidence in the Banks . Very small sacrifices , on the part of these institutions , would probably be necessary to produce , not a universal , but a general resumption of specie payments . Foreign exchanges are decidedly in favor of the country . Domestic exchanges are , as indicated by the price of bank notes , in disorder ; but when were they not so ? If any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the notes of distant banks in the New York and Philadelphia markets , with the prices they have borne for a series of years , he will find that the additional discount is no more than a fair compensation to the exchange merchant for the additional risk he runs , in the general want of confidence occasioned by the want of certainty of the future policy of the moneyed institutions . A bare assurance that they were resolved to resume specie payments at no distant day , might raise their notes nearly to par . The notes of the banks in the four or five States where the currency is most depreciated , must be excepted from this remark . In the other States there has not been so great a change in the relative condition of the currency as many imagine . The derangement of domestic exchanges may , in part , be artificial . Where banks have a monopoly of exchange dealings they have an interest in prolonging the confusion , inasmuch as so long as it lasts , they can buy up their own notes at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this derangement of exchanges is not intentionally produced it may require but little effort to bring things into order . A very small excess of issues may cause a considerable depreciation of currency . The simple neglect of many banks to settle their balances promptly , is of itself sufficient to account for the low value of their paper . What amount the banks owe to the States we know not ; but the sum due to the General Government ( exclusive of what is due on time by the United States Bank ) is now reduced to between four and five millions of dollars . In some extensive districts of country not a dollar is owing on this score . Very different , in this respect , is the condition of the banks from what it was in 1817 . Then they were deeply in debt to the Government , and the Government deeply in debt to them . The Treasury Department had then on its books dishonored bank credits to the amount of between twenty and thirty millions of dollars , the attempt to transform which into convertible funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling due of an instalment of the Louisiana loan , payable on Europe , was one of the reasons that induced the United States Bank to take those measures in 1818 which spread ruin through the country . Now the United States Government owes no funded debt either at home or abroad . The amount it owes in Treasury notes is inconsiderable , and as these notes are receivable for public dues , they , to that extent , diminish the demand for specie . The General Government is not , indeed , at this moment , entirely free from embarrassment . The sums it has deposited with the States can not be immediately recalled ; some importers can not pay their duty bonds , and the " Deposite Banks ' * require time to meet their engagements . Deprived , in this way , of the use of upwards of forty millions of the public funds , the Government has , of course , // to encounter some difficulty in defraying the heavy expenses on the frontiers occasioned by the Florida war and the removal of the Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these embarrassments . The Government needs not the aid of the banks , either in the way of loans or facilities for transfer . It is not necessary for the public service that currency and exchanges should be still further deranged , as would assuredly be done by converting commercial institutions into fiscal agencies . If the bill to establish an Independent Treasury shall become a law , no bank will be embarrassed in its operations as the late Deposite Banks were by the necessary transfers of public funds ; nor , on the other hand , will any bank have an advantage over the others in the use of the public money , or the privilege of saying what notes shall , and what shall not , be received for public dues . It was the exercise of this double power by the United States Bank that caused many of the disasters that attended the former resumption of specie payments . It was this that enabled it to draw , in a short period , nearly eight hundred thousand dollars from the banks of Ohio , and enough from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie basis , thereby crushing banks , the paper of which was , when the subscriptions to the United States Bank were commenced , better than that of the banks of Philadelphia . Forced importations of specie from abroad are as much to be deprecated as forced transfers of it from State to State . The fault is not , taking the country throughout , that we have too little specie , but that we have too much paper . Forced importations of gold and silver may derange the commercial operations of the nations with which we have deelings , and thereby lower the price of our staples in foreign markets ; and , after all , we shall not be able to keep the gold and silver in the country unless we withdraw part of our paper issues . Between July , 1817 , and July , 1818 , the Bank of the United States imported about seven millions of dollars ; and , as it and the other banks went on expanding , the merchants , in this period , exported about twelve millions . Of eight hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early part of 1818 , it is said that not ten thousand remained on the first of November . The result would have been similar if the original amount had been millions instead of hundreds of thousands . The banks of Louisiana and Alabama strove to avert a suspension of specie payments by forced importations of specie in the commencement of 1837 . If , instead of so doing , they had contracted their issues of paper , they might have succeeded in their object . Some banks endeavour to increase their stock of the precious metals by giving a premium for it in their own notes . By this very act they raise the price of specie as merchandize , and depreciate their own notes as currency . If they want specie , let them // part with any thing they have , in exchange for it , rather than with their own notes . But let them reduce the amount of paper medium till it shall bear a just ratio to the things to be circulated , and they will have no occasion to resort to any unbank-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When currency bears a just proportion to commodities , bank credit is supported , not only by the specie in the vaults of those institutions , but by the whole amount of specie in the country . When bank notes are of equal value , in the market , with gold and silver , debtors to banks find it as easy to pay one portion of what they owe in coin as to pay another portion in paper . For various reasons it is very desirable that gold and silver should constitute a larger portion of our active circulating medium than they do at present . But it is far from desirable that the stock in the vaults of the banks , taking the country throughout , should be greatly increased . An excess of specie in their coffers , so long as they conduct their business on their present false principles is as much to be deplored as a deficiency . When banks find their stock of specie doubled , they seem to think that they can double their circulation . The necessary consequence of this is , an inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an excessive importation of foreign goods , followed by the reaction which overtrading brought on by over-banking is sure to occasion . What is really desirable is , that the banks shall so manage their business as to render it necessary to keep on hand a less amount of specie than has hitherto been usual . It is a dead weight to them , and , where it exceeds what is necessary to support their current credit , it is of no more use to the community than ore in the mines of Peru . Excepting that small amount of coin which is required for retail transactions , our currency in even the best of times consists of convertible paper . In our domestic trade , the connection between coin and notes is maintained by the storekeepers paying to the merchants the metallic money they receive , by the merchants depositing it in the banks , and by the latter paying it out in various ways to meet the demands of retail trade . The current that thus flows out of the banks is equalled by another current that flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still sufficient to keep specie and paper on a level in the market . The whole amount of specie disbursed in this way , by all the banks in the city of Washington , in the twelve months which preceded the grand catastrophe , is said not to have exceeded one hundred thousand dollars . By paying to the community but three hundred hard dollars in each day in the year , the banks kept on an average two millions of current credit on a par with gold and silver . When foreign exchanges are in favor of the country , the banks require but little more specie than is necessary to pay the balances due by them to one another . If they would // 1838 . Resumption of Specie Payments . be governed by the true pAnciples of commercial banking , they might greatly reduce this dead weight , for then exchanges between different parts of the country , would balance themselves . In some of the States it may not be very easy to bring the banks to act on correct principles . This is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals of the banks have been supplied , either wholly or in part , by the State Governments . Where this is done , the Directors have a great interest in making as much profit for themselves as they can out of the banks , and little interest in keeping the capital sound . Irregularities must also be expected to prevail for a time where there are banks with many branches . There , free competition , which is as desirable in banking as in other kinds of business , does not exist . Other difficulties must be expected to arise from the different kinds of business which bave in some strange way become connected with banking . In some places , the banks construct railroads , build houses , make water-works , produce gas-lights , deal in cotton , an ( l one bank even sells wine by the bottle ! Such at least is a fair inference from its returns to the legislature , wherein " profits from hotel " are set down amon0 its annual gains . Into the cotton trade , many of the banks are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is wrong . Banks have properly but one business to pursue , and that is , after having invested their capital in permanent securities , to discount business paper . Neither the cotton trade nor any other branch of merchandize can be carried on by corporations as ndvantageously to the country as it can by individuals . By monopoly operations the banks may for a time keep the most important of our articles for export at an artificially high price ; but this must lead to over-production* and a probable glut of the English market , the effect of which may be such a fall in the price of cotton as to make it for a time hardly worth cultivating . By engaging in the cotton trade the banks do , moreover , deprive the merchants of their lawful gains , and thereby deprive them of the means of paying their debts . Other difficulties arise from the manner in which the banks are distributed through the country . The real demand for banks and currency is in proportion to the density of population and the division of labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for either banks or currency . The farmers and planters own the land and cultivate it without the aid of hired hands . They have consequently neither rent nor wages to pay . Their own soil and their own toil supply them with most of their food and clothing . They get such foreign commodities as they want , and some domestic fabrics , from a neighbouring storekeeper or merchant , and pay him // when their crop is matured-not in money , but in wheat or other produce : Where this order of things prevails , there can be little demand for currency , and little use for banks . Yet , from the data that have been published , it appears that in one of the new States , the circulating medium is in proportion to the things to be circu* lated as one to three or four , while in one of the most industrious and most thickly settled of the old States , and where the division of labor has been carried to the greatest extent , the proportion is only as one to twelve or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the States , is greatly depreciated ? This state of things has been produced in a great degree by erroneous notions of the functions of banks . There is in the new States , a great demand for capital to make permanent improvements of the land , and a vain attempt has been made to supply the place of this capital by a species of credits which , unless they be promptly redeemed , perish in the using . In some quarters of the country efforts are making to relieve the existing banks by an issue of State bonds , or by establishing new banks with State bonds for their capital . This is neither just nor fair . It is mortgaging the property of the whole community for the benefit of a part . State loan offices , though not free from objection , are much less objectionable than State banks . State loan offices would lend capital instead of credit , and there would be a chance of their loans being distributed with some little show of fairness . The effects which are produced by frequent expansions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would follow from repeated changes in the weight and fineness of our standard coin if we had none but metallic money . If this truth were generally understood , it would be evident to every man , that when expansion has proceeded so far as to cause suspension , the contraction necessary to effect resumption , must diminish the circulating medium in so great an extent as to render impossible a literal fulfilment of many contracts . Compromises must then be resorted to , the creditor in some cases granting longer time to the debtor ; in others accepting land or commodities instead of money ; and in others giving a discharge in full though but part of the sum stipulated may be paid . The banks should make many such compromises with individuals , and individuals should make them with one another . It is the duty of each and every one of us to make great exertions to pay our just debts ; but it is equally our duty to forgive our debtors when they have nothing to pay . Going to law will in many instances give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise founded on correct principles ; and if debtors were only willing to place a just value on their property . a large amount of outstanding obligations might be discharged by // transfers of land and commodities . But , unfortunately , the delusions caused by an expansion , are not always dissipated by a contraction . Men estimate their possessions at what , during the height of speculation , they supposed would be the value they would ultimately attain , and are unwilling to part with them for less . Art equitable mode of paying many debts would be , by giving land or goods at the prices they bore when the debts were contracted . A great many incumbrances might be got rid of , by a simple exchange of securities , on the principles adopted in the clearing-house of the London bankers . Where A owes B , and B owes C , and C owes A , it is evident that all that is wanted to effect a satisfactory adjustment , is , a knowledge of the relationship of the parties to one another : and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . If the banks will pursue a judicious course , and private citizens take the proper means for liquidating their outstanding obligations , . and be content to put a rational estimate on their possessions , the nation may soon reach a state of prosperity surpassing any that it has hitherto enjoyed . That the resumption of specie payments will not be succeeded by such a paralysis as followed the former resumption , we have grounds for hoping , in the different manner in which this great work is being effected , and in the changed condition of our own and foreign countries . The former resumption was a forced resumption , effected through the instrumentality of a stock-jobbing bank operating on the funds of Government , and crushing other banks to save itself . Now , the preparations for resuming have been made in the natural way , the action of the General Government being negative rather than positive , and the simple force of public opinion inducing the banks to take the requisite measures for restoring specie payments . Then , the attempt was made to coerce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to Louisiana , and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi ; and to transform into convertible paper a great variety of notes which were variously depreciated fiom two to twenty per cent . below par . Now , the resumption of specie payments is begun in the natural way by the banks in the most commercial State taking the lead , and exerting all their influence to induce the other banks to imitate their example . At the time of the attempt at the former resumption , the country had not recovered from the exhaustion produced by the war . Now , it has enjoyed peace for twenty years , and its productive powers have been increased manyfold . The Bank of England , which had suspended specie payments in // unnecessary to dwell . It was , in conjunction with the mode of operation adopted by our banks , a great cause of the dulness of business that prevailed for a time in the United States . Now Englan* has gold enough and to spare : and is in a condition to be a better customer for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former era , all the commercial countries of Europe , were exhausted by the wars which grew out of the French revolution . The long continuance of peace has now increased their wealth , so as to afford us a more extensive , and more profitable trade with them , and increased their capital so much , as to enable them to grant us credits to a greater amount and for a longer time than was formerly practicable . In 1817 , the independence of South America was not achieved , and the working of the mines was suspended by the hostilities that L were then raging . The mines are now comparatively productive and we enjoy an open and considerable trade with those countries . Since that period , the export trade to China has undergone a material change , cotton goods taking , to a great extent , the place of silver . The occasional demand for Spanish dollars for the Asiatic trade was among the embarra*sments to which the banks were exposed at the former attempt to resume specie payments . The great farming interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( leeply affected by the speculations which grew out of the expansions between 1814 and 1818 , is now in a sound conditimn. 7faught wisdom by bitter experience , it abstained from speculation during the expansion of 1835-37 . Only a month before the suspension of specie payments , when mercantile notes were at a discount of two or three per cent . a mouth in Philadelphia , any amount of money wanted on landed security in the neighbouring counties of Chester and Lancaster , could be procured at five per cent . per annum . All these are reasons why the banks should make the sacrifices necessary to reestablish their credit . The condition of things is such as to open the prospect of a very extensive and very profitable trade , both foreign and domestic , and the more extensive and more profitable the trade of the country , the more lucrative must be the business of banking . We do not pretend to say that this good work can be effected without breaking some banks , and many individuals : but this must be the result , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be restored , till it is satisfactorily ascertained , what banks and what individuals are worthy of confidence . If the Banks will only separate their concerns from those of the Government , and provide ways and means for the prompt settlement of the balances they owe to one another , our paper currency will be brought into a better condition , than it has been in any previous pe* // nod of our history . If they obstinately refuse to take this course , we may , for a time , have , as we had in 1819-21 , not only a depreciated , but a deficient , currency ;  --  or have currencies of almost as many different values as we have banks . By a prompt settlement of balances , the notes of the three hundred banks of New England have been kept at par throughout the Eastern States . By adopting a similar policy , the banks of the South and West may cause their notes to be as much sought after , as the notes of the Bank of the United States were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurred at the commencement of a sound system , but this will be inconsiderable when compared with the advantages that will accrue . In no other way can the requisite amount of sound paper medium be supplied , a ruinous fall of prices be prevented , and confidence be generally restored . When the system is fairly brought into operation , it will entail little or no expense on the banks that conduct their affairs on commercial principles . Confining their credit dealings to business paper , they will find what they owe to some banks exactly balanced by what is due to them by others . Vacillation must be the order of the day , in a country where there are eight or nine hundred independent sovereignties coining money out of paper . The temptations of great immediate gains will always be luring them from the plain principles which ought to regu* late their conduct . Our currency is , moreover , liable to be affected by every commercial change of affairs in Europe . So long as capital is as relatively superabundant in England as it is at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense amount of paper in circulation , and yet not turn foreign exchanges so far against us as to deprive themselves of their metallic basis . To what extent the whole number of banks in a country may , under the most favorable circumstances , increase their issues and yet avoid suspend* ing specie payments , is a problem of political economy which has never yet been satisfactorily solved . We were in a fair way of solving it , when the Bank of England in 1836 withdrew its credit from the " American houses , " and our own Government issued the famous " Specie Circular . " Men who have no higher object in view than the gratification of their philosophical curiosity , may regret that our banks were not suffered to go on expanding till they had reached the utmost limits of expansion ; but then the revulsion that would have ensued would have been overwhelming . If Bank and State be reunited they will not probably have to wait long before their curiosity will be fully gratified ; and the revulsion that will then follow may finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , must give great sati*faction to the Democracy of the country . We should be very unwilling to deprive the Le**islature and the banks of New // York , of any praise to which they are justly entitled . But what , would have been the condition of things , if the Administration had yielded to the strenuous , and apparently preconcerted , efforts made by parties extending from Boston to New Orleans , to compel it to receive irredeemable paper ? There would then have been no fixed standard of value in the country . Neither would there have been a banner , under which the friends of sound currency and sound credit could have rallied their forces . The circulating medium of the whole Union would have been in a condition resembling that of certain portions of the South West . The members of Congress who have now but feebly expressed their wish that irredeemable paper should be received for a little season , would then have carried a resolution to this effect triumphantly through both houses . Then many evils which may now be transient would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are once suffered to guide the policy of a nation , occasions can never be wanting for bringing such motives into repeated action . fhe firmness of the Executive has preserved the country from sufferings greater than any foreign foe could inflict upon us . Though deserted on this vital question by many of its professed friends , perplexed by the factious conduct of some of its subordinates , and assailed with unrelenting virulence by its old opponents , it has spurned the measures of time-serving expediency which so many have tried to force it to adopt . A remarkable spectacle has been exhibited . The men who have , or who seem to have , the most wealth , have been doing all in their power to break up the very foundations of property ; and the Administration , in resisting their efforts , has received little support except from those whose own sinewy arms give them all the wealth they possess . Fearful has been the struggle between the industrious classes of society and the Administration on the one side , and the banks and speculators on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Executive , have , some from compulsion and some from inclination , all bowed to the mandates of the money-power . They have suspended the operations of the laws , tortured legal ingenuity to evade their force , or openly trampled them under foot . The Democratic Administration of the General Government has had fearful enemies to contend with , but it has never blenched . It has nobly vindicated the insulted majesty of Law and Constitution . It has stood firm , and it has stood almost alone , in this high post of moral dignity ; and it is already receiving its reward in the cheering prc*p'ect of the termination of bank anarchy , and of the consequent ascendency of law and order in the whole length and breadth of the land.
