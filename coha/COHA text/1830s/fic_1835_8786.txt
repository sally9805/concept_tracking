Selim The king gives audience this morn to pass sentence on a traitor . Osm . Osman What is he pray ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good family , and young ; but much too well he lov 'd the cause of Spain . Osm . Osman Is he like to die ? Sel . Selim With as much propriety you might ask , if yonder luminary is like to set . Osm . Osman O , then ' t is a settled thing . Sel . Selim Ay , Osman , you may truly say so much , for mercy and our monarch are just so near as pole unto the pole . Will you along ? Osm . Osman I 'll bear you company . Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  An antechamber in the Alhambra . Enter Solyman and Hassan . Has . Hassan The battle lost , and hope entirely dead , this hero , Orlando , despairing , gave over , clasped his hands , and prostrate upon the earth he fell . The instant he fell a woman sprang forward ; upon his body down she sank , kiss 'd him , nam 'd him , and drench 'd his pallid cheek with tears . Sol . Solyman She was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our soldiers seeing this Orlando down , elated , thought as a prisoner they were sure of him . Vastly they were deceived , however , for at the sight of this woman he reviv 'd and knew himself . Our soldiers encompass 'd him ; when all of a sudden he snatched his sword up off the ground and laid on with dead effect around him . With her on his arm , his sword in hand , with hundreds he fought , dexterously taking and avoiding each and every blow . Sol . Solyman Certainly , a right valiant man he is . Has . Hassan Now hear the sad sequel to my story . Sol . Solyman Say on . Has . Hassan My son , thinking this beauteous woman , for our good king , a fair gift would be , seiz 'd upon her to that end . He was fatally frustrated however : Orlando stabb 'd him to the heart 's core ! Even with the plucking of the dagger forth his life was gone , so deadly was the blow . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniard , and was fell 'd , senseless , to earth . Sol . Solyman Upon thy recovery , what followed ? Has . Hassan When I recover 'd I beheld our soldiers masters of the field , but with downcast looks silently parading round their conquest . On inquiry as to the cause of so much sadness , I was informed that Orlando , with some hundred of his followers , beside the girl , had made escape ! If ever a father 's heart with anguish bled , mine surely did ! I had deem 'd the Spaniard dead , and this contrarious information set me starkly mad . Sol . Solyman Mad ? Has . Hassan Yes , mad , Solyman , mad ! O , galling retrospect ! Incoherently I rav 'd ! I rooted the hair from out my head ; rended my garments off my body ; ran naked o'er the field ; was caught ; put in chains , and left to the society of dungeon dampness . Sol . Solyman Indeed ! Has . Hassan And all for a shallow christian ! Revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If at my feet his life-blood flow 'd  --  Sol . Solyman But , sir ,  --  Has . Hassan Nay , pardon , sir , the passions of my soul , For when I think on my departed son , My feelings rise and inundate it quite . Revenge ! thou burning , burning , entity ! O for Orlando 's blood to quench thy fire , And ease my soul ! Sol , Solyman Is thy revenge so rank ? Has . Hassan Know , for I tell thee , that to the injur 'd , As glutted avengment naught is as sweet . As the lover , hope buoying high his heart , To hear his mistress speak or heave a sigh , All over the wide world will follow her  --  So will the injur 'd follow up the object Of his hate , that he may catch the moment , The fittest moment and the favor 'd time , In which to drive the steel against his life ! Sol . Solyman Inexorable , if by thy words to judge , Is thy revenge ? Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as easily dislodge the sun From where he is , or lead the moon astray From out her course , or from heaven entice The stars , as me from my purpos 'd revenge To waive ! The basalisk 's envenom 'd sting Not deadlier is than is the waxing hate That I do nourish ! Ever since that , to me , Disastrous fight , the thoughts of my revenge Have been my daily bread , my nightly pillow , And my very life ! Sol . Solyman He was thine only son ? Has . Hassan Mine only son ! mine only child ! Sol . Solyman Indeed ! Has . Hassan O , sir , in him I liv 'd ; he was my breath , My blood ! and since his cruel death life were Not worth the toil of life from hence but for The one dear object in my view ; revenge ! Hopes beam on my soul ! Shade of my dear son , Walk yet a little while around this orb ; Thou shalt not long be thus , for , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Flourish of Trumpets heard without . Sol . Solyman The king gives audience . Has . Hassan I 'll go in ; I have Business with the king . Exit . Sol . Solyman Now what a fiend , And bloody-minded wretch is yon ! In an Ignoble act , and by the chance of battle , His son was slain . Fairly his son was killed , But he , like some untameable hyena , Growls out his fancied injuries , gloats on His son 's memory , and seeks a fool 's revenge ! Exit . SCENE III .  --  A room of state in the Alhambra . Abdalla seated , his train &c.,; Hassan . Abd . Abdalla Hail to this assembly ! Omnes . Omnes Allah Achbar ! Abd . Abdalla Allah Achbar ! Enter Solyman , Abd . Abdalla Hath any man aught Whereon our voice in judgement is requir 'd ? Has . Hassan I have my liege . Abd . Abdalla O , good morrow , Hassan . Sir , at our leisure we have thought upon , And have resolv 'd to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish 'd soldiers , To prosecute this war , thou canst command . Has . Hassan Thank thee I can not with my speech , O sir , But with my deeds I will . Abd . Abdalla There 's where we want Thy thanks , good Hassan . Good sir , it is our wish That these Spaniards were rooted , finally , Root and branch , from out this soil . Has . Hassan Time only , And assisted by the sword , may purge the land . Abd . Abdalla Iberia castle is their strongest hold ? Has . Hassan It is . Abd . Abdalla Orlando governs there  --  Has . Hassan Allah blast him ! Language may not express the bitter hate , That 's garner 'd in my heart 's recesses deep , That 's hoarded dearly up , against that man ! Abd . Abdalla I 've heard say he murder 'd thy son ? Has . Hassan He did : But , O , why now remind one of that same ? Abd . Abdalla Not to pain thee , sir , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Has . Hassan Would I ! And does my liege ask if I would  --  Abd . Abdalla No more . Wait on me this eve , and I will put thee In a way to get at it . Has . Hassan My liege  --  Abd . Abdalla Nay , Sir , speak not now but look to my behest . Has . Hassan I will not fail to wait on thee , my liege . Abd . Abdalla Sir , this Orlando is our greatest scourge : He 's forever plotting something to our hurt . He hath numbers of bands , a villainous , dark , Cruel , deprav 'd and desperate set , nightly , Like bloody wolves that o'er the wilderness Do scour , seeking out prey upon our ground ; Ground that by the right of conquest ours is . Has . Hassan A wily one indeed ! Abd . Abdalla Ay , cunning , but not Courageous : there 's his superiority over us . A thirst for blood and blackest prodition , Is the spur that pricks him on ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his encroachments free . Abd . Abdalla No , not even Grenada , our proper city . Why look thee now , his many machinations  --  In habits resembling these which we wear His soldiers nightly prowl around our streets : Woe to the Moor who stands alone , unarmed ; For quickly from the murderous ruffian 's Dangling sleeve , where they the stiletto hide , Some keen edged steel doth glisten in the air , Then deep within his honest heart is hid ! It is not thus , Hassan ? Has . Hassan Indeed , my liege , Thy words are but too true , Abd . Abdalla Alas , the truth ! Has . Hassan As thou sayest , without the least remorse , Thus secretly the cursed Spaniard strikes , And prostrate , and unhonored , falls the Moor ! Not them alone must we contend against ; A traitor hath appeared above the mass . Abd . Abdalla Why , ay , indeed , thou just remindest me  --  He 's now in prison , Solyman ? Sol . Solyman Ay , my liege ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Allah , ' T is a great pity that one so young and fair Should in his bud thus fling himself away . We commiserate him from our soul 's depth ; But to our feelings justice may not give One inch of ground in mediation 's way . He dies . Into thy hands we commit him , Good lieutenant ; and ere the sun goes down See execution done on him . Sol . Solyman Thy word is law . Exit . Abd . Abdalla His estates we confiscate . Hassan , do thou Remember , and fail not to come this eve . Exit . Has . Hassan The king will put me in a way to get At my revenge ! How can he ? But the end Will shew . And patience be thou now my help . Exit . SCENE IV .  --  The place of execution in the prison . Sabyro discovered . Sab . Sabyro A vertigo comes over my brain ! dreadful ! I fear I ca n't bear myself as I resolv 'd ! How dreary , dark and damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart ! O , why is it That I abide in this suspense ? Why is it ? If I am to die  --  ah ! is yon the wheel ? A chilly sweat pervadeth all my frame ! I shudder , O !  --  but not at its power To wrench the cry of pain , nor at its power To do away my breath  --  but at the shame , The contamination it may do my name ! Enter Solyman . Sol . Solyman He is musing . Sab . Sabyro Down , thoughts , down ! Sol . Solyman To die is it not so  --  Sab . Sabyro To die ! O , sir , death 's pang and pain I 'm reckless of ! O , ' t is this form of death alone I dread ! Thus , thus , to be expos 'd , and thus to die , Like to a common felon  --  O , that thought Doth fall full deep within , acts as a wheel , And as it there revolves , more agonizing To my heart it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , can be ! Sol . Solyman After the body 's death the immortal soul Begins eternal life : therefore to die  --  Sab . Sabyro To die ! Mine 's not the puny heart that fears to die ! O no , O no ! By the sword put me to death , By any means , by aught except the wheel , By aught except my doom , and I 'll be calm ! O , sir the manner of my death change thou , And as a fond bridegroom to his bridal bed , So to my final rest will I go gladly down ! But , say , what sentence has Abdalla pass 'd ? Sol . Solyman The setting sun must look upon thy death . Sab . Sabyro And must I die ? is there no help for me ? Am I to die and leave no name behind me ? O , that horrid thought ! it rusheth over All my frame , it tortures , it maddens me ! To be born , to breathe , to live , to flourish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clod In earth , to rot , and leave no memory  --  A hard fate for one of my aspiring mind . Sol . Solyman And , say , how gottest thou into this net ? Sab . Sabyro A net indeed , and I am caught in it ! Sir , humanity did ope the way ; and then The fire of youth for fame did spur me on : And now and the dear object unattained , That fire must out ! O , horrible idea ! I can not  --  can not die ! Sol . Solyman Nor shalt thou die  --  Sab . Sabyro Thou dost mock me , Solyman ? Sol . Solyman I mock thee not  --  Ay , by Allah , nephew thou shalt not die ! Sab . Sabyro What wonder 's this ? If rightly I did hear , If that my reason lives , thou called'st me Thy nephew ? Sol . Solyman And with truth I call 'd thee so , For I 'm thine uncle , sir . Sab . Sabyro Uncle , mine ? Sol . Solyman Thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O , say direct ? Sol . Solyman Dear sir haul in the bridle of thy tongue , Let wonder and desire a moment sleep , And give close ear to what I now unfold . Sab . Sabyro I shall not die ? Sol . Solyman Have I not sworn ? Sab . Sabyro Say on  --  say on  --  Impatience grows strong within me ! Sol . Solyman Then , sir , Know that Camaralzaman , thine own sire , Was my own brother . Sab . Sabyro Sayest thou ! Sol . Solyman Know , too . Thy mother , Zele , was of the Spanish race . Know , also , thou hast a sister now alive . Sab . Sabyro Nay , There thou mistakest , sir ; she was my twin , And died when we were four years old . Sol . Solyman She lives  --  Sab . Sabyro O , surely , thou art juggling with me , sir . Lives ? lives ? Sol . Solyman Ay , sir , she lives . Sab . Sabyro Pronounce her name , And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Solyman Ianthe  --  Sab . Sabyro Yes  --  Ianthe was her name , And , since she yet lives , Ianthe is her name . Embrace we now for I can doubt no more . Yes , sir , Solyman was my father 's brother , And I do believe that thou art he . Sol . Solyman Nay , but , I 'd have thee altogether sure . Dost thou not Recollect , when on his knees he often used To dandle thee , the scar thine uncle show 'd Thee on his breast ? Sab . Sabyro I do . Sol . Solyman Behold it , here . Sab . Sabyro It is the same  --  Sol . Solyman My nephew ! Sab . Sabyro My uncle ! They embrace . Sol . Solyman So , my nephew , I 've found thee just timely ; Just in the nick o'time to save thee from A most inhuman doom I have thee found . Sab . Sabyro To my gratitude there is , and shall be , No bounds . Sol . Solyman To Allah all gratitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast proved to me , My sister lives ; now satisfy me , where ? For my protection she perhaps may need . The mysterious chance that hath us kept For seventeen years apart , O , now disclose ? Perchance amid dangers she is ; if so , say , And as an arrow shot from a lusty arm , Away to her I 'll fly , and rescue her , too , Or perish in the attempt . Sol . Solyman No protection Doth she need , for in no danger is she . Sab . Sabyro O , Canst thou not then devise a way , a plan , To bring us to each other 's arms ? Sol . Solyman For what ? Sab . Sabyro That I a brother 's love may express to her . Sol . Solyman I can . Sab . Sabyro Where , where is she ? Sol . Solyman Thou wilt marvel , I ween , at what I now disclose . Sab . Sabyro Say on . Sol . Solyman Iberia castle holds her . Sab . Sabyro Allah Achbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son Orlando 's sister , she 's accounted there ; And to the adverse is she known to none Save thou and I. Sab . Sabyro O , most strange mystery ! But I will to Iberia castle straight  --  Sol . Solyman Ho , sir , where would thy indiscretion lead ? Wilt thou dash willingly on ruin 's rock ? Thy sister thou shalt see , but management Is needed too . Sab . Sabyro My imprudence I own : Do thou direct me . Sol . Solyman In this same castle lives A worthy man , a friar , Antonio by name : Come in with me : I will a letter write , Which thou shalt bear to him ; the ideas Of which shall unto him of time past by Communicate , and this entangled skein Of thine it shall untangle to thy sight . And why thy father 's brother is lieutenant To the king , time shall develope , Sabyro . Come in . I will immediately strike off This letter to the friar ; and this very night I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  come in  --  Sab . Sabyro But should  --  Sol . Solyman Fear thou not Sabyro , for my arm and counsel combined Shall be a shield for thee . So come in with me . Hesitate not , but come . Fast flies our time ; And they that waste of it commit a crime . Exeunt . SCENE V.  --  An antechamber in the Alhambra . Enter Abdalla and Hassan , meeting . Has . Hassan My liege  --  Abd . Abdalla My faithfullest of friends ! And Now , without or circumstance or prologue , I straightway will unroll to thee the why For which I did request this meeting here . Has . Hassan And of prolixity I 'm no lover , sir . Abd . Abdalla This same Orlando that thou hatest so , A sister hath . I yesterday talk 'd with one Whose eyes had dwelt on her ; and he imag 'd Her so lovely , so beauteous and so perfect , That with the mere recital I 'm in love . Her charms I must possess , her lovliness I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing stop . Thro ' whole oceans Of human blood I 'll wave to get at her . This morn I fell to planning how to come By her ; at last on this expedient hit . To the two thousand soldiers granted , Another thousand I will add ; and then , Being three thousand strong , immediately Shalt thou to Iberia castle go ; when there , Wait patiently till night 's misty curtain Falls around , then rush on with energy Against the gates , bear all abstruction down , Swing the sword , apply the torch , ideas , Of pity cast aside , and steel your hearts . And ' mid the common ruin that ye make , Accomplish thou the thing wherein thy son Did fail ; seize on her ; convey her quickly , And in safety here . Has . Hassan Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! O , it will so rankle in Orlando 's soul To know that his sister 's prostituted ! Abd . Abdalla Well , wilt thou undertake this thing ? Has . Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me joy , my liege . Abd . Abdalla I said this morn I 'd put thee in a way To get at thy revenge . Has . Hassan O thanks  --  O thanks  --  My liege , with all my heart I now espouse This cause , and will immediately about it : And do not doubt but I 'll accomplish it . Abd . Abdalla To it then , and never doubt but I will Thee recompence . Has . Hassan Farewell my liege . Abd . Abdalla Farewell . Has . Hassan And , ere this our world hath on it axis Three times turn 'd , I shall successfully return Or not at all . Abd . Abdalla Wilt thou then desperately Do away thy life ? Has . Hassan The brother must surely die , My liege , before the sister can be caught . Yes , thro ' the blood of hundreds I must wade , And o'er the brother 's lifeless body stalk , Before the sister can be had . This right arm Shall cleave Orlando down , and , as I bestride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ears ; and , as an oil to ease His parched wounds , I 'll utter forth to him His sister 's ignominious doom , thrust once Again my sword into his breast , hear his Last groan , and banquet so my dear revenge . Exit . Abd . Abdalla I not intend to prostitute this maid ; But with a gallant gale of am'rous words I 'll ply her to a matrimonial shore  --  A shore where happy summer shall aye bloom . There , lolling both on nature 's verdant lap , The violet 's odour and the warbler 's breath Commingling in the air , we 'll fondly dally ; Dally till our thoughts are wild , our souls afire , Then die the sweet death of satisfied desire . Exit . END OF ACT I. ACT II . SCENE I.  --  Iberia Castle  --  a furnished room . Enter Carlos and Miranda . Car . Carlos Now by Saint Peter , sister , you do tell me wonders .

Miranda Ever since the first day after you took leave of us for France , I have observed this strange disorder augmenting daily on her mind . She grows daily worse and worse . Car . Carlos Indeed  --  indeed  --  Mir . Miranda O , it will surely be her death . Car . Carlos What , is she crabb 'd towards you , sister ? Mir . Miranda Nay , quite the reverse . Indeed , within the last few days , she scarcely doth notice any one except my lord ; but all the day long she sits sadly silent , or incoherently she raves . Car . Carlos ' T is strange . Would I were at the bottom of it , sis . Mir . Miranda Brother , I 'm confidant my lord Orlando knows her ail . To me she 's altogether silent on that theme . Car . Carlos Have you endeavored to console her ? Mir . Miranda Two days ago I did essay mine efforts to console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I did condole the more I did alloo her grief . Car .

Come , night , Come , endless night , and shut me inly in ! O , all around me wrap thy dark mantle , And hide me , hide me , from my own sad self !

And on the prospect shines not one single Hopeful ray . Orl . Orlando Ay , there 's the bitterest point . From the one tie naught can us disunite , And naught dare us unite unto the other .

Were I to indulge thee , son , in thy desire , Think on the consequences would accrue .

Heline Is not this provoking now ! secrets proceeding and my curiosity not fleet enow to come up with them ! O , but it vexes me . Marry , I could choke that old friar with his own prayer-book , had I but the power to exercise my will . This I know ; were I to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the rank old goat . Exit . SCENE II .  --  A gallery in the castle . Enter Orlando and Carlos . Car . Carlos To me these things are marvellous , my lord . And forbid thyself her company ? Orl . Orlando Yes , Carlos , Her lov 'd presence I 've resolved to shun , and , As some poor spirit yet confin 'd to earth , I wander up and down these vasty halls , Where echo wakes her voice to every tread , Or silence to unbreathed wo responds ! Up and down I go , hope 's easy football And thought 's helpless prey ! Car . Carlos My lord  --  Orl . Orlando My friend  --  O , come near ; let me prop me on thy breast , Unbolt the floodgate of my tears , and give A flow to sorrow 's tide ! Wilt thou not help , My friend , to mitigate my grief ? O , say ! Car . Carlos I 'll all I can to ease thy loaded heart . What present feelings sway  --  Orl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the past With me ; bring up the past ; and as awake Thy retrospective thoughts , thro ' all thy soul The chords of memory will sound ; and then , Perforce , thy feelings will commix with mine . Ianthe !  --  Car . Carlos What of her ? Orl . Orlando O much ! O much ! Thou wilt scarce credit me , when now I say , My sister and I may never meet again ; For I have vow 'd to hold me hereafter Ever from her sight . Yes , good Carlos , yes , Mine honor bids me now refrain , ere yet This thing proceeds too far . Car . Carlos This is most strange . Orl . Orlando Yes , yes , all our fond intercourse is now And forever stopp 'd ! This have I resolved : I 'll have a foray out against the Moors , And amid the tumultuous strife thereof , The din , confusion , and the horrors there , Forget this lawless passion if I can ! The good friar advis 'd to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well resolved ; and I am glad of it . Orl . Orlando We 'll fight for liberty , for slaves we are . Car . Carlos No , no , my lord ; no slaves are we . Orl . Orlando Wherefore ? Car . Carlos It can not be that we are slaves , my lord . Your censure and your judgment I 'll abide , And for my self I 'll say , I have an honest And a patriotic heart , which I will drain Of every drop of blood contained therein , Of every drop , ere this our glorious cause , The great cause of justice and of liberty , Shall sink beneath a despot 's iron sway ! Orl . Orlando Sir , thy patriotism can ne'er be tax 'd ; In all that thereto appertains thou art Hand and soul . In the battle 's deaf romage There 's not thy equal , for where the affray The thickest is , ay , and where the danger Greatest is , art thou . Car . Carlos Then no slave am I ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do resist ! Whiles that against the Moors We strive and strike for liberty , no slaves Are we , my lord . Orl . Orlando Indeed thou speakest truth . Car . Carlos No slave is he who doth assert his rights And boldly standeth forth to acquire them . He , only , is a slave who feels the smart Of despotism 's scorpion lash , and , feeling , Resisteth not , but bends his paltry soul Unto a fool , and brooks an abject fate . Orl . Orlando No more  --  no more  --  Enter Claude . Cla . Claude Gentles  --  Orl . Orlando How now ? Cla . Claude I thank you ; I am well ; the rose sits in my cheek ; I have desires , and a good appetite . Orl . Orlando No ; but your business with us ? Cla .

Orlando That matter that you come to me respecting . Cla . Claude Why sir , the friar advis 'd me , secretly to signify unto your lordship that he would like your presence straightway at his cloister . Orl . Orlando What can he want ? But I will go and see . Exit . Cla . Claude As mistress Heline wisely said , secrets are going the rounds . My lord sad , and my lady fretful , the friar betwottled , and a Moor lodging in the castle . Would I could get at the bottom of all this ! But time may do much : and so until it 's time 's pleasure to make it known , I 'll e'en content myself by peeping round discretion 's corner . Exit .

Ianthe No , no  --  Orl . Orlando Then is reserv 'd For me the joyous tidings to proclaim . O love , triumphant love ! thyself invincible , Thou conquerest all . Ian .

Orlando No ; thou art not . Ian . Ianthe What magic 's this ? Orl . Orlando God 's own magic it is ! Ian . Ianthe Explain , or I shall go wild ! Orl . Orlando Too wild am I Already , love , to explain to thee . Come in  --  Come in ; the good friar shall tell thee all . O , this excess of joy ! Ian . Ianthe But this is strange  --  Orl .

Cla . Claude Ah , that was bad . Hel . Heline Mystery , mystery , mystery ! Cla . Claude Yes , there 's a mystery somewhere . Hel . Heline Would I could find it out . Cla .

Orl . Orlando Doth the sun shine ? O , yes , my love 's as true as Christ , as strong As adamant . Ian . Ianthe And by my virgin honor , love , I do believe thee , for I have ever known thee All truth . Orl . Orlando I 'll kiss thee for that ; so . Ian . Ianthe But see  --  Enter Antonio and Sabyro Ant . Antonio Each word thou utterest , Sabyro , sinks me Yet deeper in amazement than the last . Here we all are ; so now the unbroken tale Of thine , whereof by detach 'd parts we heard , Deliver us . I ask it  --  Orl . Orlando And I  --  Ian . Ianthe And I  --  Sab . Sabyro This is the sum and substance of it all . Camaralzaman , a Moor , and Zele , a fair Spanish maiden , by Catholic ceremonies Were join 'd . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much larger than herself , Is brought to bed ; of a boy and a girl , Twins , is she deliver 'd . Life unto twain She gives , but , so the will of just Heaven , Herself must die . Now sorrow deeply sinks Into the husband 's heart , acts as a bane , Corrodes , and his vital energy fordoes ; Ere a twelvemonth he lies again with her . And , my sister , these twins were thou and I ; And thus were we the unconscious killers Of our parents . Ian . Ianthe Alas ! Sab . Sabyro After their deaths Together we shot up , side and side , until Four years had gone around ; fate will 'd it so , Then , that the chance of war , amid turmoil And the strife of men , should separate us ; For thou , my sister , through some incidence , Becamest the daughter of renown 'd Pelayo . Ian . Ianthe O it is marvellous ! Orl . Orlando Ay , ' t is wonderful ! Ian . Ianthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thine was a roughsome fate , to be left , So young and helpless , to the world I. In truth I fear thy fate was hard . Sab . Sabyro As for myself , I was turn 'd adrift , a poor little bark , Upon the world 's rough sea , without or helm Or sail to guide my course ; happily for me An auspicious breeze came up , and blew me To a gentle shore . Ian . Ianthe Wilt thou not relate  --  Sab , Sabyro Truly now to tell my intermixed tale Would occupy a deal of time ; and so , sister , At some more leisure hour I will beguile Thine ear with it . I could recital make , Did I begin , of that would please , and that Would horrify ; but such display may not Now be made . Ian . Ianthe There 's yet one thing I would ask . Sab . Sabyro And if I am able I will answer thee . Ian . Ianthe Why was not the mystery of my birth Ere this proclaim 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died with him , save this uncle That I spake of , who , at this time , to keep His life fled into Africa . Ian . Ianthe Then to them only My birth was known ? Sab . Sabyro To them only . Ian . Ianthe O , then That accounts for all . Ant . Antonio Ay , yes , Pelayo 's Sudden death , and this uncles long absence Debarr 'd all chances for a disclosure . Sab . Sabyro So when civil commotion had subsided , And after sixteen tedious years of strife The present king sat on the Moorish throne , Then was our uncle from Africa recall 'd . Home he came , and just in time to rescue me From a cruel doom , and this disclosure To bring about . Ant . Antonio O , just in time , indeed ! God 's graciousness may here be plainly seen . Orl . Orlando O , just in time , for thy sister and I  --  Ant . Antonio Nay , out with the rest . Orl . Orlando No , worthy friar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Antonio Lovers they are , Young man . Come thou with me apart ; I will Of this inform thee . Exeunt . Orl . Orlando And now , my sister , For the last time I call thee so . Thou hast That claim on me no more , but a far dearer Shalt thou have ; a nearer and dearer one ! Said I not , my love , that we 'd be married ? Ian . Ianthe Nay but we are not married . Orl . Orlando But , O , so near , Heaven 's in the thoughts of it ! Ian . Ianthe I have my fears , For oft the raised cup untasted falls ! Orl . Orlando Nay , love , always hope the best . Ian . Ianthe Orlando , I speak my heart 's feelings when that I say , There is a calm pervades my inmost soul , A gentle distribution through my blood , To which I am not used : my heart 's presage To murderous and squally discord though Converts this harmony . Sudden its rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O no , my love , This new delight that riseth on thy soul , Shall not continuance so quickly slack As thou , in forward haste , didst now opine ; It shall not bate , but the extinguish 'd torch Of hope it shall relume within thy breast . Ian . Ianthe God grant it may ! Orl . Orlando O my soul yearns to thee ! O , my dear Ianthe ! thou art to me forever As the rose in spring ! dies the dainty rose , And down sinks to earth its beauteous leaves , With the first blast that howls along ; not so With thee ; thou art in beauty always fresh ! O joy ! O joy ! Ian . Ianthe What makes it ? Orl . Orlando I 'll tell thee . Thus with a privileg 'd arm to encompass Thy waist , thus with wanton fingers to play All among this soft exuberance here , Thus with eager lips to imprint the kiss Of holy love upon thy forehead high , And thus to hug thee to my heart , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ianthe That joy is mutual ! Yes , for we are now at full liberty to love ; For which all praise unto our God above ! Re-enter Antonio and Sabyro . Ant . Antonio Well , we have talk 'd this matter o'er . Sab .

Far from withholding her , I earnestly do give her thee . Here , take her . Orl . Orlando Why then , Ianthe , thou art mine . Ian . Ianthe Thine only ! Altogether thine ! Orl . Orlando O , I o'erflow with ecstacy ! This night our nuptials shall be solemniz 'd : The iron shall not have the time to cool . Ant . Antonio My voice is with thee : so let us prepare  --  Ian .

' t is welcome , Aurio ! I am a soldier ; and the trumpet 's loud call Is dulcet music to the warrior 's ears . Aur . Aurio Over the northern steeps they grope along . Orl . Orlando Ha ! and with the loud rhetoric of war We 'll welcome them ! And now , my good Aurio , Get thee unto lieutenant Carlos straight ; Desire him to buckle his implements on , And be in readiness . Quick , good Aurio , quick . Aur .

Orlando Thou knowest the danger . Ian . Ianthe And say , can I not confront the danger ? Orl . Orlando Besides it looks not well for petticoats  --  Ian . Ianthe No more ; I understand thee ; but quickly I will thy doubts and rising fears dispel . Orl . Orlando How sweet ? Ian . Ianthe But a moment and I will tell . Exit . Orl . Orlando O , friar , how I do love that peerless one ! Sabyro , thou art her brother ; but thy love Towards her , I know , can never equal mine . And when I do cease to love her , the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot , no more the moon her silvery Pathway hold , no more the studded heaven Will wink at earth ! Ant . Antonio And , by Heaven , son , That lady 's worthy all the tenderness o ' love Thou canst bestow . Orl . Orlando Yes , friat , she 's worthy more : My worthiness is poor compar 'd with hers : I am the worshipper , and she 's the god ! Sab . Sabyro In my sister 's applause each tongue is big : A hard fate for me indeed , to have been Depriv 'd so long her company . Orl . Orlando Dear sir , thou wilt Appreciate her virtues now the more . Sab . Sabyro Nay , but she 's thine alone . Orl . Orlando No difference Shall that make . When wedded to me , Sabyro , She 's then as to thee as she ever was . Ant .

Sabyro Yes , Orlando , I 'll fight along with thine , for in my veins Flows more of Spain than Africa . I 'll hence And doff these Moorish robes , and speedily The garb of Spain assume . All allegiance To the Moorish king I now cast from me ; And hereafter beneath the flag of Spain I 'll live , beneath it I 'll fight , beneath it I 'll die ! Exit . Ant . Antonio Already doth the warrior 's fire Beam from thine eyes , my son . To battle go ; The clarion 's call obey ; but I charge thee , Seek not to aggrandize thyself , but only His Approbation seek to gain . Go , youth , go ; And when thou returnest , O , may the look Of triumph , as of courage now , glance from Thine eyes ! Exit . Orl . Orlando Now comes the agony of thought  --  O , Grenada !

I would this contest were commenc 'd ! Ye elves And spirits that on vengeance tend , come from Your dark confines away , possess my heart , For I have now a lion 's nerve and blood ; And feel as I , myself , with this my right arm . Could cleanly overthrow this Moorish host ! Now for battle  --  Enter Ianthe . Ian . Ianthe And thus accoutred I 'll along . Orl . Orlando Why ah  --  In truth , my love , I scarce knew thee .

Ha , here comes Claude . Enter Claude . Cla . Claude Ah , ha , you rosy-cheek 'd  --  Hel . Heline Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were away , with all the rest , unto the field ? Cla . Claude Truly , not I. The sight of human blood delights not me ; I 've not that wolfish appetite , but would rather set mine eyes upon life that death at any time . Hel . Heline O , ho , you have the coward 's heart . Cla . Claude The more 's my credit . Hel . Heline How , pray ? Cla . Claude Cowardice is discretion ; and discretion in a fool is a rare thing . Besides I 'm a lover ; and , with these soft emotions here , the very sight of steel would freeze my heart . Hel . Heline Ah , poor heart ! poor tender thing ! you 'd better keep it always near the fire . Cla . Claude Your smiles keep life in it . Hel . Heline Then surely I will frown if thereby I may kill it . Cla . Claude I will not credit you in that . I know you 'd rather give a life than take a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Claude Truly , to be a mother is a woman 's pride . Hel . Heline But all mothers take a life before they give a life ? Cla . Claude Marry , how ? Hel . Heline ' T is very plain . Before a woman gives unto the world a child , she first must from the father take that child . Cla . Claude And will you take one from me ? Hel . Heline Truly , I 'm not so much indebted to the world that I should undergo a woman 's labour . Cla . Claude But after the pleasure always comes the pain . Hel . Heline But I 'll nor undergo that pleasure or that pain . Cla . Claude Your mind will change ere long , I think . Hel . Heline Perhaps so .

Heline Fie , fie , how can you say so , Claude . Cla . Claude Marry , I 'm never ashamed of the truth . Hel . Heline And you have a reason for that , for truth passes your lips so seldom that you have not the opportunity . Cla . Claude Come now , you are hard on me . Hel . Heline Miranda comes .

Miranda In what condition , when you departed from it , was the fight ? Gras . Grasado Why , whichever way the eye might peradventure turn , it fell upon the flying Moors . Mir . Miranda A complete rout , I judge , it was ? Gras . Grasado It was . And by the wise valor of the lord Orlando it was brought about ; he hath been wonderful to-day . Mir . Miranda And the lady Ianthe ? Gras . Grasado She grew fearless , became excited , separated from the lord , and actually led herself , into the centre of the affray , a portion of the warriors . Mir . Miranda Are you trifling ? Gras . Grasado As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A trumpet heard Enter Aurio . Mir . Miranda Aurio , Grasado hath preceeded you with the joyful tidings of the victory . Aur .

Miranda Why , sir , what mysterious words are these ? Aur . Aurio The lady Ianthe is lost . Mir . Miranda Lost ! Aur . Aurio Among the living of our host she was not to be seen ; among the dead we sought her and we found her not ; and at her fate 's uncertainty the lord Orlando hath gone almost mad : I do fear that it will be the death of him .

So ends My present hope to get Orlando 's sister . Hassan slain ! that man was the foundation , Apparently most fair and strong , on which , Of late , all my hopes were built . Osm .

Our burning tears shall fall As though the clouds were all let loose above , And , spite of the covenant unto the adverse , We will drench earth with another flood  --  Our own destroyers ! Death then will us equip With wings , and we will fly forever hence , And leave this heartless world to meet our souls In heaven ; for love like ours can never rest On lukewarm soil or breathe this icy air !

Well , there stood I : Rang 'd round the lofty hall , of splendid taste , The guests upon soft velvet cushions sat , While lulling music fann 'd the perfum 'd air , And all seem 'd like a paradise on earth . Amid this glitt'ring scene , a herald enter 'd And announced Abdalla and the fair bride : And a gorgeous procession came forward . Sir , imagine me when I beheld the bride  --  It was Ianthe !

Then put the figure Forth her arm above my head , and utter 'd  --  Unless Orlando averts Abdalla 's fell doom , To-morrow night I 'm sacrificed to shame . The veil that hid the face was thrown aside , And sweet Ianthe 's face again was there ! Car . Carlos I do believe this is a faithful dream , And that th ' reality is as the ideal .

The eyes revolts from it . Sweet , sweet Ianthe , Cover 'd half with blood , whiter e'en than snow And cold as ice ! God , but I did love her ! She 's yet beautiful  --  but , O , that soul of hers ! But fast oozes life , my blood ebbs to waste , And I 'm departing never , never to return ! O beautiful , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love ; and with a kiss Be wafted to eternal realms of bliss ! O ! O ! Dies . Osm . Osman Our terror is extinct at last . Lao . Laoma He 's dead ; And to the abodes of rest , from body 's toil , His unloosened spirit now wings its way . O , this is mournful ! Ye Moorish maidens , Gather 'd over and round that female corpse , Well may ye weep ! Yes without affectation Or the remotest connivance at show , Inwardly , ye my drown yourselves in wo ! I would now mix my social drops with yours ! Friends , to her complexion of cadav'rous hue Must ye ere long resign your water'd'bloom ; By that settled stare must the vivid flash Of your now sparking orbs be superceeded : Like her must ye be wedded into death ! And , maidens , immediately let 's bear her out , And with the establish 'd rites dispose of her ; And when the body hath three days dwelt in The earth , all deck 'd in cypress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will forth And lave her tomb with tears of bitter wo . Come maidens , come I would not longer look On this sad spectacle ; a high wrought book This seems to me , wherein my spirit reads Of life 's uncertainty and of death 's deeds ! Exeunt . THE END .
