txt civilized world , almost as steadily as the light of day ; and the time appears not to be far distant , when ignorance will lose its character of boldness , and timidly seek the obscurity , where no one will take the trouble to notice it . A new physical deluge , to be sure , might bring our affairs into a very small compass again , but we feel exceedingly comforted at no longer apprehending a deluge of intellectual darkness . We look back with horror upon those times , when hypocrisy , and cant , and mystery , and quackery , and all the ministering attributes of ignorance , were so successfully engaged in weaving a shroud for the human mind . We turn from the picture of those times with disgust , and rejoice in the present enjoyment of our own fair day of existence , when justice and reason are precious in the eyes of men , and bigotry and ignorance are only found lurking iii corners . It isto the study of the great book of nature , that we owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more clearly marked the progress of the human mind , than the extraordinary advances which have been made , and which are now in more vigorous progress than ever , in that noble study , the revelation of God to man , by his works . What a bound the human mind has made since the days of Galileo , and what respect and veneration do we owe to his memory ! Persecuted and oppressed as a heretic , because the laws of natural bodies , as he taught them , appeared , to the ignorant eyes of his contemporaries , inconsistent with the phenomena of those bodies , as described in the Record consecrated to our moral government ; he is nevertheless gratefully honored in our memories , whilst his oppressors are thought of but to be abhorred . Galileo may be said to have laid the corner-stone of natural science , upon which succeeding generations , freed from the fantastical prejudices of an age of darkness , have almost finished a temple consecrated to the harmonies of nature . We were never more forcibly struck with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when on a visit to a friend at the University of Oxford , in England , in 1827 . It was upon the occasion of Dr. Buckland 's annual geological lecture on horseback . This very novel mode of explaining the great geological features of a country being peculiar to that eminent man , we shall , we hope , amuse our readers , by giving a brief account of it . About the hour of noon , near a hundred noblemen and gen // tietnen on horseback left the city with the Professor , and fob lowing the London road at a very animating pace , halted at some gravel pits in the valley . Here Dr. Buckland , dismounting , and gaining a small eminence , addressed the asserubly of equestrians in his agreeable , colloquial manner , on the causes which had accumulated the beds of gravel and oyster shells , on which they were standing ; he then went rapidly , but very eloquently , into the consideration of great bodies of water in motion , of the abrasion and ruin of the strata , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detritus ; illustrating the subject from time to time , by pointing to the inequalities of the surrounding country , showing where the gorges had been left on the retreat of the waters , and how the contemporaneous valleys were bounded by the once continuous strata . Having touched upon every prominent feature of the country around , the Professor remounted his horse , and proceeded at a hand gallop over the plain for the Shotover hills , the cavaliers pressing around him , bridle in hand , that no observation which fell from him might be lost . At the foot of the hills he again stopped at a moist , springy place , and took occasion-in adverting to the atmospheric water received by the porous , superficial soil , being here resisted in its descent , and thrown out by a bed of clay-to explain the origin and nature of springs of a particular character . After visiting the pits of Kimmeridge clay , famous for the Deltoid oyster , this equestrian lecture was most worthily concluded by a very eloquent account of the secondary beds in the vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in them ; the whole delivered by the Reverend Professor on horseback , receiving the most profound and grateful attention from every person present . At the conclusion , he uncovered his head , and bowing to his auditors , they dispersed , leaving him with his private friends , who , after some further investigations , returned slowly to the city to finish the day at his hospitable board . it was in the course of that evening , that a venerable cleryman , of whose octogenarian life , more than sixty years had been passed in immediate connexion with the University , in answer to a remark we made , that natural science appeared to be cherished at Oxford as much as at the sister University , observed ; The character of this University has been misrepresented ; it has at all times given , and yet continues to give , great men to the // nation . Had Oxford never existed , English history would not have been what it now is , and the English character would , perhaps , have been materially different . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , is a sufficient answer to the harsh assertions which have been made , in relation to its supposed monastic habits , by men who perhaps had an interest in debasing the English character to their own conceptions of the dignity of man . To be sure , the lectures you have heard from my nephew this day , on the modern science of geology , are at so great a distance from the ancient scholastic manners of the University , that they have apparently something revolutionary in their character ; and it is true , that this science is hardly out of its cradle , and here at Oxford , has been exclusively rocked and nursed by Dr. Buckland , who seems to have been brought forward himself , at the right point of time , by nature and education . Yet Oxford kas never , at the most distant periods , been insensible to the progress of intellectual improvement , although she has been slow to convince herself that every innovation was an improvement . When Blackstone prepared to deliver his Law Lectures , he too was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways the influence of established opinions . In an introductory lecture of his , which unfortunately has not been published , he turned the tables very successfully upon his opponents by the following sally ; " In those scholastic days , when the inquisitive and original mind of Bacon was directed to the investigation of nature 's laws , the theological animus conspired against him , and he was accused of holding communion with evil spirits . Upon a particular occasion , when he intended to exhibit some curious experiments to a few select friends , the secret having got out , the whole town , and all the colleges of this University were in an uproar . Priests , and fellows , and students , were seen flying about in every direction , with their gowns streaming behind them , screaming out , " No conjuror , no conjuror . " The cry of " No conjuror " resounded from hall to hall , from cell to cell . At a later day , Galileo was condemned by men , whose names are now only remembered as parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in our own times , there are men who seek to raise the cry of " No conjuror " against me . I tell you , you will soon find out , that these good people are at least no conjurors themselves . " The contrast , to be sure , is very striking , between Friar Bacon , secretly exhibiting his curious experiments in physics to an initiated few , in his cell , and Dr. Buckland teaching on horseback , aperto campo , the noblest of all subjects , the order and design of creation . // In applying terms of such unqualified praise , to a science comparatively so little known as Geology yet is , we desire to offer , iajustification , some observations for the information of those , who have not yet turned their attention towards it . We would not detract , if we were disposed to do so , from the value of the astronomical truths which were taught by Galileo ; he gave the greatest blow to the prejudices of men , and macadamized the road of right reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate the motions of the planets and other heavenly bodies , and to'measure their revolutions around their common centre . Newton thus became tbe immortal discoverer of the law of gravity ; to the influence of which , all the known circumstances connected with celestial dynamics , have since been successfully referred . It is to astronomical science , that the human mind owes the ' consideration - of the sublimest propositions of the planetary motions ; the most profound refinements of mathematical analysis ; and the most comprehensive conclusions in regard to the government of the universe , and the power and wisdom of its Creator . But while the beautiful harmony of these movements creates an intensity of feeling in us , beyond the power of language to express ; while we are satisfied that the very irregularities and eccentricities of the system-which made even the great mind of Newton doubt its permanency-are periodically compensated , and thus know , what reason would teach us to believe , that the work of an Almighty hand can not contain within itself the principles of destruction , but that the fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great Source whence so much order first proceeded ; we nevertheless rise from our all-absorbing contemnpiations unsatisfied ; feeling the subject to be super-human , lost in the consideration of space without dimensions , of motions without beginning or end . Such is the result of the labors of the philosophical geometer ; the elevation and purification of his mind , in these lofty and aspiring pursuits , may , indeed , be thought to prepare him for a more perfect state of existence , but here , however his spirit may be cheered by views of illimitable intelligence and power , he is lost , as it were , in the extent of his subject . Without pretending to compare what is only a part , with the whole , we must nevertheless say , that Geology is to us a more attractive study than Astronomy . The phenomena are more within the reach of personal investigation , // and besides impressing us with those just views of the wisdom and power of the Supreme Being , which are reflected from all parts of nature , we perceive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses , and sublime movements of the heavenly bodies  --  the most exquisite and affecting proofs of the benevolence of the Creator towards all the animal existences , with which this planet has abounded , from periods of high geological antiquity . We see evidences at all times , of the relation in which they and their food have reciprocally stood to each other , and of the faculties with which they have been gifted , both for reproductive and conservatory purposes . Thence we infer the greatest degree of security and enjoyment , consistent with their respective importance in the scale of beings , and the favor of a Maker to his works . Neither are the great phenomena of our science without beginning or end , like motions in space . The regular succession of the beds composing the geological series , and the still more striking phenomenon of the succession of organized bodies , both animal and vegetable , increasing in the complication of their structure and contrivance , in proportion to the importance of their functions , as they rise in the scale from zoophytes to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded each other during the progress of their different revolutions in the substances of the globe . And although in the lower primitive rocks , we begin to lose sight of succession , and our further views are at this time necessarily speculative ; yet the subject does not appear to be altogether beyond the powers of the human mind , which , even now , by the light of chemistry , is boldly plunging into deeper and central phenomena , perhaps to form at some future day , not irrational conjectures of the mechanical and material causes of the origin of our planet . For these , and other reasons that occur to us-such as the facility with which we can be at all times familiar with the various and beautiful objects in the animal , vegetable , and mineral departments of nature ; and the contrast between a sedentary and active pursuit , so much in favor of the latter on the score both of health and personal enjoyment-we are not surprised at the science of Geology being found so attractive , and at the intense interest with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful minds in Europe . Nor may we omit to state as a prominent cause of its popu // larity , that using the word in the highest sense of the term , Geology comprehends the study of every thing connected with our planet . Volcanic action , to which so interesting a portion of the mineral formations is referred , and from which so many recent phenomena proceed , has become one of the highest branches of Geology . It is the proper province of geological chemistry , by the aid of which the various ages of igneous products are approximated , and to which , perhaps , the solution of the problem , at this time so unsettled , of the igneous or aqueous origin of the lower crystalline beds , and their singular occasional passage into each other , will eventually be owing . To Mineralogy and Chemistry belong also , conjointly , that important branch , which includes the examination of the metals , and their various compounds , and especially those properties of matter , upon which the science of Crystallography depend* . Zoology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often found in the beds of those ancient oceans , which appear to have covered every part of the now habitable earth . This extensive division has many important branches . Fossil Conchology belongs to it , by means of which we form reasonable estimates of the agreement or disagreement of the ancient testacea , with those which have succeeded them , and with those of our own times ; and ascertain to what extent the differences in shells of the same genera and species , may depend upon differences in climate and food , according to known laws . In this branch , we find indubitable evidence of the extensive existence of fresh water , lake and river shells , whereby we infer the existence of ancient lakes and rivers , and of course of dry land , and hills and vales , forming the then surface of the earth , and now lying imbodded in the solid rocks , at great distances from the present surface . Under similar circumstances , we find the fossil remains of gigantic marine and amphibious quadrupeds of the Saurian kind , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , and from six to ten feet high ; also of the Pterodactylus . Macronyx , a lizard , with powerful membmanaceous wings , fitted for transporting it to short distances , and by the crooked claws of which , it could , like the Draco Volans of Linnams , suspend itself to the branches of trees . These inagnificent specimens of oviparous quadrupeds , which , in conjunction with innumerable remains of other animals an ( l plants , reveal the often repeated wonders of the pristine animated sum voL. xxxtt ,  --  No. 71. 61 // faces , would have remained unnoticed and unexplained , but for the science of Geology . But great and most surprising as these animal phenomena are , they perhaps do not , in beauty and variety , exceed the botanical profusion of the Fossil Flora . It is in the Medial order , where the productive coal measures are found , that lively impressions of the stems and leaves of the plants belonging to those ancient epochs are found in great abundance ; from the examination of which , we can form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vegetable creation , but of the temperature of the climate of which they were natives . At a more advanced period , and one nearer to our own epoch , we find imhedded in the tertiary strata , remains of an order of thick-skinned animals , now entirely extinct ; and immediately under the last sedimental deposits , and often buried within them , we find the bones of dry land quadrupeds of a higher order , of the elephant , rhinoceros , hippopotamus , horse , tiger , hyarna , wolf , hear , sloth , and numerous other animals , all of which are thought to belong to extinct species , and to have existed before the present races were brought into being . We are led to the same conclusions by the osteological remains of the marine mammalia of ancient times , such as the dugong , the lamantin , and the whale . Thus comparative anatomy comes to form a great branch of Geology , and without some knowledge of it , the most attractive part of the ancient history of our planet , remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the science , interesting as they are , as isolated objects of knowledge , are limited to the structure and habits of these animals , and have no reference to a higher subject of speculation , the periods in which they existed . It is only by a comprehensive and careful view of all these branches of Geology , that we are enabled to form an estimate worthy of the dignity of this great subject . Whether we look at the sources of volcanic action , beneath the granite , the lowest of the known rocks , or whether we consider the regular succession of the beds of the whole geological series , found in every known part of the globe , each in the same constant relation to its neighbor ;  --  the gneiss of America never being found below the granite of Europe , nor the secondary rocks discovered out of their proper place in the series , in relation either to the primitive or the tertiary ; whilst the animal and vegetable organizations , however widely apart they may be geographically situated , observe the organic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of the mineral formations in which they are imbedded ; - in whatever direction we look , the subject enlarges , our views are extended to the earliest periods , and even to the probable future condition of this globe . All tends to proclaim the wisdom , power , benevolence , order and design of Creation ; not as they are exhibited by the natural phenomena of the present surface , but of those ancient surfaces , which have so often flourished under the genial heat of the sun , though now buried far beneath , and forming parts of the internal and solid structure of the earth . For the details and complete proofs of this magnificent truth , we refer our readers to the science itself , especially to the practical part of it . We do not , upon this occasion , attempt to do more than awaken their attention to it . This is a country rich in mineral and organic treasures ; the deposits are upon a mighty scale . The metals , the marbles , the coals , are becoming more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bearing upon the business of life . Immense sums would have been spared to projectors in Europe , in boring for coal alone , had they known that they were fruitlessly penetrating into depths where it had never been found . But we leave those pursuits with confidence to the interests of those whom they may concern ; preferring to offer natural science to the consideration of our readers upon higher grounds , as a source of individual happiness and national refinement . We should delight , in a country where all political distinctions are forbidden by its institutions , to encourage that sort of refined and intellectual equality , which is perhaps the surest corrective for some remote dangers incident to those institutions , and the best antidote against the degrading influence of factious politics , and unfeeling cupidity ; two avenues of human ambition , to which the public eye is perhaps too feverishly directed . When a superior education shall be more general , and philosophy and the arts assume their influence , to be the successful demagogue of a State , or the sordid possessor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Intent as the politicians and philosophers of other countries are , upon the effect which republican institutions are producing upon society on this side the Atlantic , there is another class in Europe , less numerous , though as a body not less respectable , who are deeply interested in the physical resources of this // country , more immedi*itely connected with the philosophy of nature . We mean , of course , the naturalists of Europe . The taste for natural history , and in particular , geology , has there become almost universal . We already hear of annual conventions of philosophical naturalists in Germany . In surveying our extensive country , its varied surface and climates , they feel some impatience at the tardy attention which nature is receiving at our hands . No work on the subject of American Geology has yet appeared , which deserves to be remembered , except McClure 's Sketches . This is a somewhat gloomy picture of the progress of a science among us , to which we attribute such importance ; and we should contemplate it with the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our situation did not admit of improvement . But we do not think so ; we are acquainted with many intelligent individuals , who are ardent in the occasional pursuit of natural knowledge ; we are acquainted with the valuable geological collections in some of our cities , and especially of that most respectable institution , the Lyceum of Natural History of ' the City of New York . The zeal and ability of the gentlemen , who conduct and cherish that institution , are worthy of all praise . The labors of Say ,  --  Mr. Lea 's very able papers on the splendid Fresh Water Shells of the American Rivers ,  --  the Osteological Notices of Dr. Hays , and the works of De Kay , Delafield , Cooper , Le Conte , Torrey , Bigelow , Cleaveland and others , are also highly valuable , and hold out the most encouraging prospects in regard to the future condition of natural science . The progress hereafter to be made , depends much upon the example , and the disinterested labors of the naturalists we have named . That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give some satisfactory reasons for this opinion ; but we are comforted by the belief , that it will be sure . One of the great objections to the study of natural history-as of all the other branches of learning-among us , is the want of leisure . Is there a man distinguished for his taste and knowledge of comparative anatomy ? He is probably a physician , and he has numerous patients-he has lectures to prepare and deliver . He is struggling for adequate means to support a family , or to get into a position to have one . He has no leisure to devote steadily to a pursuit which brings him no present advantage . Is there another , whose talents and acquirements fit him for high intellectual pursuits ? Perhaps he is // a lawyer . The wants of a large family are pressing upon him . He is in a constant vortex of professional engagements ; he must prepare his cases , and attend the courts ; and is to ohappy , at the close of the day , to refresh his wearied mind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to talk to such a man of Amygdaloids , Trilobites , the Pterodactylus , or the Iguanodon ; and of the all-important necessity of attending to the distinguishing characters of the teeth of the Mastodon , in order to settle the point , whether he was ambivorous or not . Such a man has no leisure to understand you , and indeed almost doubts the sanity of one , whose technicalities are so little germane with the technicalities of the law . He , again , who may be supposed to possess a little more leisure , of whom society exacts in return for the emoluments of his sacred calling , only sermons and parochial duties ; of whom it might reasonably be expected , that the great book of nature , written by the hand of God himself , should be studied , and held in some veneration , as well as the revelation of his will ; perhaps lie is held in restraint by that very prejudice of which he is the dependent minister ; fearing , lest to unlearn , should be to desecrate himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , are struggling for existence ; all their time is absorbed in other essential duties , and the few persons among us occupying a more favorable position , have difficulties of another kind to contend with ; such as want of facilities , want of fellowship , and an enlightened public opinion to discriminate , and judge of their labors . We notice , however , with pleasure , an increasing attention to the study of natural history in our principal colleges ; and we are particularly happy in rendering justice to the persevering zeal and talents of Professor Silliman . Considering the many difficulties he has had to contend with , and the vigor with which he has kept the flag of science flying for so many years , we can say , with all our hearts , that we believe he will be as gratefully remembered hereafter for his public zeal , as he is now cherished for his private worth . We also entertain a very favorable opinion of the labors of the Reverend Professor Hitchcock of Amherst College . We have never read a line from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with confidence in him , as an accurate observer , governed by a liberal and philosophic spirit . We have the more satisfaction in stating this , because natural history has hitherto received but little support from the clergy . // We proceed to notice the work before us . It is written by a professed teacher of the science of geology ; and one who , taking his own statements to be true , has , from the immense number of his pupils , an opportunity of instructing or misleading a great many thousands of individuals . We deem this to be so important a consideration , as to call for a severe examination of Mr. Eaton 's pretensions , as they are put forth in this , and his other published works . There is scarcely any person among us interested in the progress of physical science , but must have heard of Amos Eaton , and of his chemical , botanical , and , above all , of his geological notoriety . We have read his works , and continue to witness , with surprise , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomenclature , entirely at variance with nature and perspicuity . If Mr. Eaton had , in a modest , unpretending manner , brought the geological facts he had from time to time collected in the State of New York , into the general stock of practical information , he would have deserved and received unqualified praise . But presuming upon the supposed ignorance of his readers , he has preferred to set himself up for a genius . In this he has most lamentably failed , has greatly injured a cause he seems to be zealous in , and has abused the rare opportunities he has had of doing good , through the favor of the generous individual who has been his patron. * We have heard the most esteemed naturalists of this country express their opinions freely of Mr. Eaton 's attainments in natural history , and in no one instance have those opinions differed from our own . We have , nevertheless , hitherto refrained from noticing his works for many reasons . We hoped that the cause of science here would be ultimately favored by continuing to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inflictions , and apparently construing silence into consent , he now makes larger drafts upon their patience , and in his present work , writes in a tone as authoritative , as if he were placed in the geological chair by acclamation , and in a manner that alarms us . For , if , as he states , he have had already seven thousand pupils , and expects more still , ' and if those pupils , as some no doubt will , should take it into their heads to add new stories to the grotesque edifice he has commenced , the whole world will // by and by think us demented . It is time to put a stop to this charlatanism in science , which already has had its full reign amongst us . To see it increase upon our hands here , and to be laughed at abroad into the bargain , is more than we ought to endure . In his preface to this Text-Book , Mr. Eaton observes , I beg the favor of the most rigorous criti*-cism upon this hook , small as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notice , it may he well that he should remember this invitation . And first , as to our being laughed at abroad : - we are aware that the geologists of Great Britain , who have taken the lead in the science , look with intense anxiety for information from this continent . The formations here are upon so large a scale , and the accumulated effects of causes now in action , are so instructive , owing to the magnitude of the rivers , the position of the mountains , and other circumstances , that it is very probable the sedimentary geological phenomena of the surface will eventually weigh much in the decision of that great question , which is now agitating the European scientific world , viz. ; whether the effects of what has been hitherto called diluvial action , are not mainly to be attributed to fiuviatile agency . Mr. Eaton with his canal rocks , his synopsis , his geod*ferous and cornitjferous , his diluvion and analluvion , his prodromuses and his little wood-cuts , his geology without any principles to it , and his principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree astonished the Europeans . They are now , however , asking what all this means , and wish to know , whether Mr. Eaton is the avowed representative of geological information and opinions in North America . In the May number , for 1829 , of the Bulletin des Sciences . JV'aturelles et de Geologie , ' there is an article , conspicuously placed at the head of the number , upon one of Mr. Eaton 's exhibitions in the fourteenth volume of the American Journal of Science . It is written by one of the most distinguished geologists in France ; written , we are sure , with great reluctance , for we personally know the writer to be friendly to this country . For the benefit of Mr. Eaton , we give the following translations . Mr. Eaton , after having urged the necessity of a good geological nomenclature , seems to believe that we are yet without one , and as if he were a new Werner , gives us one of his own , without // synonymes ; that is to say , he gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty ? ' And again , In a word , the nomenclature of all the European and American geologists , appears unsuitable to him , and he believes that his queer names , and his little wood-cuts , colored like the deposits , are the nec plus ultra of clearness and true Geology . ' Now if his previous performances have been regarded as obnoxious to just censure , what will the European geologists say , when they see this geological text-book , which we can not forbear to pronounce one of the most extraordinary productions with which pseudo-science ever imposed upon the public ? But it shall speak for itself ; and first , let us look over the preface , where at the second line , we find the following precious period . If the earth was ( were ) washed , and the rocks left clean , Geologists would not disagree in regard to rocks . ' For ourselves , we can only say , that were the earth washed as clean as a penny , we should be very much tempted to take up our hammer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks ; for , although Mr. Eaton may not know it , it is a fundamental principle of the science , to identify rocks by their organic remains , rather than by their mineral characters , which are very fallible guides . As Mr. Eaton may choose to disregard this assertion , we would ask his attention to the following passage in the annual address of the Rev. Adam Sedgewick , President of the Geological Society of London , delivered before that distinguished body , February 19 , 1830 . Each succeeding year places in a stronger point of view the importance of organic remains , when we attempt to trace the various periods and revolutions in the history of the globe . Crystalline rocks are found associated with the strata of almost every age ; and the constant laws of combination , which have produced a certain mineral form in rocks of one era , may produce it again in another . ' He then proceeds to state , that nearly all the modifications of structure , in the rocks called primary , are to be found in the secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary formations are to be found in the tertiary deposits . Mr. Eaton may gather from this , that it is now the established opinion of the leaders of the science , that mineral // characters are subordinate to organic characters ; - that a teacher of Geology is a person , who explains the animal and vegetable structures found in mineral deposits , and the manner in which fossils are affected by the mineral substances in which they are imbedded . If Mr. Eaton can understand this , he will perceive that all his past labors have been without an object , and that no one , confessedly ignorant of organic remains , as he is , should pretend to be a teacher of Geology . We could have overlooked the very incorrect and inelegant style of this work , but for th , e high pretensions of the writer . The familiar , and often light manner in which he speaks of eminent men , is particularly offensive , and is in singular contrast with the courtesy , which writers on science show to each other at this day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mr. Eaton , is subject to an evil peculiar to itself . If its votaries disagree , the common learner has neither time nor inclination to review their data , by visiting localities referred to , and thus to correct their mistakes , and adjust their differences . ' If experienced geologists are never to agree , until the earth is washed , and until common learners , who are supposed to know very little about it , correct their mistakes , and adjust their differences ; and , above all , if these common learners have neither time nor inclination to set the matter right , there is doubtless very little chance of making further progress , and we must be content with such geology as we can get , and be even thankful to Mr. Eaton for what he may give us , until washing-day arrives . He tells us ; To stimulate men of science to the work of examination and criticism , I will state , that I intend to publish considerable in scientific journals , also a full system , upon this plan . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty one before us , will be an agreeable change . There are so many drolleries in Mr. Eaton 's Text-Book , that he seems to be apprehensive , lest we should take it to be altogether a piece of pleasantry , and therefore he warns his readers thus ; I am not in sport ; I have , during the last fifteen years , travelled over seventeen thousand miles , for the express purpose of collecting geological materials ; the results of which are comprised in this little octavo pamphlet , and exhibited in the accompanying map and wood-cuts. ' // Mr. Eaton has a habit of making confessions , which are not to his credit , and of which we do not see the motive . He says ; I may be accused of fickleness on account of the changes which appear in every successive book I publish ; I confess this is the ninth time I have published a geological nomenclature , and that I made changes in each , of more or less importance . ' Again ; The various deposits of detritus had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last nomenclature . I believe I have made a few changes in that department , which will finally obtain . ' On this head , we must venture to differ from him in opinion . We greatly doubt , whether any of his writings will obtain ; and are inclined to think , that the first regular work on American geology that appears , will utterly efface every thing that he has published . It is also probable that such a work will appear , before the considerable* which he has promised the world , shall have eflbcted a tenth change in his nomenclature . The following passage is remarkable for its novel orthography , and also for its tone in regard to one of the most learned and philosophic men of the age , to whose labors Geology has been indebted in the highest degree . We allude to Henry De la Beche . With all deference to the high character of La Bache , as an experienced teacher , I may say , that his numerous subdivisions , if adopted , will ruin the science . ' We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beche 's subdivisions are the result of a careful examination of all the geological beds , effected by the joint labors of the most enlightened geologists of Europe . The establishment of the series in this detailed manner , is the perfection of human industry and science , and is the true philosophical key to the mineral and organic structure of the earth . And here we have an experienced teacher , who does not know how to spell his native tongue , and whose geoIo*ic*l information is limited to a few rocks in the State of New York , stating that M. De la Beche will ruin the science , for no other reason , that we can imagine , but to exclude from public notice every work upon the subject , except his own . The only geological fact in this work , which is absolutely new to us , is contained in the following passage ; // He ( Werner ) closed his long life in the full splendor of his scientific glory , in the same year ( 1317 ) in which we began to make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . ' Werner was singularly happy in two things ; one , that he did not outlive his reputation ; the other , that he died before IVJr . Eaton applied his views to American earth . A few lines afterwards he says , Scarcely had that earth received his ( Werner 's ) manes , when , ' &amp;c . We would suggest to Mr. Eaton , that manes and remains , however similar in sound , do not mean the same thing . We quote the following sentences for the entertainment of the lovcrs of poetical imagery ; # Since that time Buckland , aided by the veteran Cuvier , has commanded the whole geological phalanx to leave for a while the deep abode of rocks , and to examine " the open caverns and the furrowed earth . " He has led out before us , from the Cave of Kirkdale , the Anti-diluvial Mastodon , chased and gnawed by hundreds of Hya3nas . He has shown us the torrid abodes of the River-horse and the Elephant to have been in the latitudes of Caledonia and Scythia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately a good deal at variance with the statements given in Dr. Buckland 's account of the Kirkdale Cavern . Mr. Eaton makes the mistake at page 62 , of supposing his own geod*ferous limerock ( carboniferous limestone ) to be the equivalent of the formation coral rag in which that oolitic cave is found , there being a geological interval of five thousand feet between them ; and as to the *1nti-diluvial Mastodon , chased and gnawed by hundreds of Hyenas , it will be enough to state , that Dr. Buckland never found a single bone of a Mastodon in that , or in any other cave ; and that the rational conclusion to which he arrived in respect to the gnawed bones , and in which all the naturalists of Europe have concurred by acclamation , is , that the Kirkdale Cave was an ancient den of hy*nas , into which they brought the bones of dead animals . But here we have a public teacher of geology gravely talking , from the remembrance of some extract he has read , of antediluvian Mastodons , as if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were in the habit of seeking refuge from their enemies in a cave , the entrance of which , when discovered , was less than two feet high and through a solid rock . The hypothesis of regular deposits , ' at page 16 , and the // accompanying illustrations , are hardly less singular . We have the world cut into two halves , for the purpose of exhibiting the interior . Six little fires , with chimneys to them , are nicely built round the edges of one of the hemispheres . The fires are burning very briskly , and the smoke is coming out very prettily . No. 1 is designated , The Combustibles under Rocky Mountain ; No. 2 , New England ; No. 3 , Britain ; No. 4 , Alps and Pyrenees ; No. 5 , Caucasus ; No. 6 , Himalay . ' In the centre we find the words , Interior probably undisturbed . ' This we presume is added by way of encouragement to such as are disposed to explore Capt . Symmes 's terra incognita . The *ordilleras , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , would probably have found a place and a fire , too , if intelligence of their discovery had reached Mr. Amos Eaton . Next comes a very pretty picture of North America , in a transverse segment , ' extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific . The distance from Boston to the Catskill Mountains forms about one fourth of the whole distance . Reckoning the geographical distance between the two oceans to be about two thousand five hundred miles , we perceive the Hudson River to be about one hundred and seventyeight miles above the level of the Atlantic , and nearly on a line with the tops of the Green Mountains . From the bed of the Hudson to the top of the Catskill , the ascent is rather abrupt , and appears to be about one hundred and sixty miles . Thence the country westward is rather level , until you reach a large well-built town called Red-sandstone , on the eastern skirt of the Rocky Mountains ; whence there is a descent by a regular slope to the Pacific Ocean . The country to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are to infer that all the rest is known . There is an exceedingly good fire kept up under the Rocky Mountains , and another under the Atlantic Ocean . These fires occupy about one half of the whole distance , and are evidently undermining the superincumbent formations very rapidly . If the Atlantic Ocean should break through , as the Thames did into the Tunnel , it strikes us that the packets running to Europe would be in great danger . We by no means desire to alarm the public , but we advise the proprietors to look to it , and to consult Mr. Amos Eaton before his second edition appears , when matters may be considerable ' worse . We proceed to notice another assertion at page 67 , which is announced in capitals . // I intend to demonstrate , that the detritus of New-Jersey , embracing the marl which contains those remarkable fossil relics , ( saurian ) is ante-diluvian , or the genuine tertiary formation . ' To say nothing of the incorrect manner in which this is expressed , as if ante-diluvian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not be demonstrated . Ante-diluvian in a certain sense it may be said to be , but as to the marl containing the remarkable fossil relics he speaks of belonging to the tertiary formation , no one but a person totally ignorant of this great branch of Geology , would have made so unlucky a guess . Had Mr. Eaton possessed the most superficial knowledge of the value of organic characters , and of the extent of the saurian period , he would have spared himself this mortification . He would have known , that a deposit remarkable for saurian remains , and multilocular testacea , could not be tertiary ; a geologist would have placed it with greater propriety in the green sand formation , to which we have always believed it to belong . How Mr. Vanuxem 's very sensible remarks on this subject can have escaped Mr. Eaton , is really surprising ; but there is little to be expected from one who ha* been too deeply engaged in washing the outside of our planet and making fires in the centre , to find time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , we can not omit noticing a recent paper by Mr. Eaton at page 334 , No. 2 , Vol. 17 , American Journal of Science , which begins thus . I have received letters from several eminent geologists , since you published my geological prodromus , all of which express full satisfaction on the subject of my five carboniferous formations , excepting the primitive . The generous sentiments expressed on this subject , especially by Dr. Morton , who is pleased to call it a reformation in geology , with which he seems to be generally pleased , &amp;c. &amp;c . ' Dr. Morton , we suspect , has been indulging himself in a little harmless pleasantry , and will probably be rather amused to find his generous propensities so gratefully received . We pass over the strange mistakes about Oolite and Sias , at pages 43 and 48 of the Text-Book , and refer to the heading in large capitals , at page 49 . History of the creation of organized beings , in reference to the five geological series . ' This history of the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It consists of inferences deduced from facts , which Mr. Eaton has borrowed , without comprehending them , from European geological Works . At page 51 , he says , But immediately over the carboniferous state , ( coal measures ) we find oviparous vertebral animals . I have before me the relics of a crotalus , found by Dr. Rose of Montrose , Pennsylvania . Hence we infer , that oviparous vertebral animals were created soon after the bituminous coal and deposits were made . ' The origin of this passage appears to be as follows . Observing in Bakewell , the source of all his scientific discoveries , that oviparous vertebral animals are found in the deposits succeeding to the new red sandstone formation , and ignorantly supposing that oviparous reptiles of the present surface would serve his turn as well as the marine oviparous quadrupeds of which Bakewell speaks , he carefully keeps all the saurians out of sight , and with an old piece of an orthocera in his hands , pretends that this discovery of oviparous vertebral animals succeeding to the coal formations , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the formations of his fourth series . A rattle-snake ! This exceeds the Mastodons . We will not , however , pursue this investigation farther . We regret that a sense of duty to science has compelled us to perform so ungrateful a task ; but at a period when a general inclination for the cultivation of natural history is visibly increasing , we can not shut our eyes to the evil consequences , that must result from the circulation of so much error amongst the ingenuous young men of the country . We have been actuated solely by regard for the interest of science , and should be the last persons who would take pleasure in wantonly exposing Mr. Eaton or any other individual.
