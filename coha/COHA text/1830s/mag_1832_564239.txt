txt THE number of travelers in Switzerland and Tyrol has astonishingly increased within the last few years . Roads have been built through the most beautiful , and consequently the most frequented , parts of these countries ; and traveling is now attended with scarcely any of the fatigue , which , in former times , and but a few years since , prevented many from visiting the far-famed beauties of the Schweiz . Tyrol has been but little noticed , however , in comparison with Switzerland ; and the traveler does not meet with the good roads , the luxuries , or conveniences , which so abound in its sister country . The conveyances are not common , and are inconvenient and expensive ; on this account , most of the gentlemen , who visit Tyrol , travel on foot , and I think it is by far the most agreeable mode . Those , who have visited the different Glaciers of Tyrol , have pronounced the Mutterberg ( Mother-mountain ) to be the most attractive . The ascent and descent are attended with much fatigue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ventured upon the excursion , have generally suffered either temporarily or during their lives from its effects . To our little party , which consisted of three , fatigue and danger were // nothing new or fearful ; and , instead of deterring us from our plans , rather increased the desire to carry them into effect . I shall never regret that I have visited , at the risk of my life , the majestic scenery of Mutterberg , though I fear I should not easily be tempted to climb its lofty sides again . It was a hot day in the beginning of August , that our little party , leaving the prettily situated town of Innsbruck , proceeded up the valley of the Inn towards Telfts ; from thence , passing throu , , h Mides , we arrived about six o'clock in the evening at Neustifft ,  --  another little village of this beautiful valley ,  --  at the foot of the Mutterberg Glacier . The village in itself has few if any attractions for the stranger , save as a resting place for those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Saturday night , and the chamois-hunters and the peasants were returning to their quiet homes ,  --  first to offer their prayers at the shrine of the Holy Virgin , then to engage in some amusements till the fall of night should call them to their slumbers . As the sun bade adieu to the snow-topped mountains , and the bells of the returning flocks tinkled in the valley , as they approached their sheltered homes , the white spire of the village church resounded with the vesper hell . Every thing , save the Mass , was then forgotten . All turned their footsteps toward the church ; the old and the young , the sad and the gay , the crippled and the active . We , too , approached the large Gothic edifice , and , entering the portal , took our station in one of the side aisles . All were on their knees before the crucifix , which , surrounded with lights , stood upon the altar . The dim twilight , that stole through the dusky casements , showed but indistinctly the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sincere devotion , a scene that can be known on such a spot , and there only . The only task left us to perform , was that of seeking a guide . Among the chamois-hunters , who are alone acquainted with the landmarks and passages over the Glaciers , there was a tall , handsome , well-formed man , whose tout ensemble attracted our attention . He was dressed in the Tyrolese costume , which consists of a black or green hat ,  --  most usually the latter ,  --  the crown in the shape of a sugar-bag , with a broad brim , bent downwards , and caught up on one side by a 1 ) lack silk cord , fastened to the crown . A cock 's feather , or that of some other bird , usually adorns the hat of the hunters . A short green jacket , ornamented with a great number of small silver buttons , and brown chamois-leather breeches , show the forms of these mountaineers to very great advantage . Around their waist a broad leathern belt is bound , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked in white beads . The calf of the leg is not covered with a stocking , but with a thick woollen net-*vork , which reaches from the bend of the knee down to the ankle . Thick Alpine shoes cover their hardy feet . Hans , for such was the name of our friend , was dressed in such a costume , when we saw him . A little black mustache contrasted finely with his handsome face and white teeth , and gave him , strange as it may appear to some , a look of refinement . After a while we succeeded in getting him for our guide on the morrow 's expedition ; and having arranged every thing we retired to our welcome repose . The early morning found us moving on our way up the mountain , but not under the guidance of Hans . Neither our entreaties nor the // i ) romise of money could persuade him to leave before six o'clock , the hour of Mass ,  --  and accepting the offer of our kind host to start with us at five , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtake us as soon as he could after Mass , we were , under his protection , beginning this strange excursion . After an hour 's walk our host , having assured us that we could not miss the way , took leave of our little party , wishing us success on our journey , and turned his footsteps towards his home . Instead of pursuing our way , we seated ourselves near a little log hut to gaze upon the scene . The sun was just shedding his morning rays on the quiet valley , and snow-topped mountains , and the Inn was still winding his way down the beautiful vale , as the sounds of the matin-bell stole sweetly on the silent air . It was a Sabbath morning . The shades of the trees , the notes of the birds , the Sunday bell , all combined to recall to our minds the quiet scene of Sunday tranquility so peculiar to the land of freedom and happiness ; and , with such recollections , the scenes of early childhood passed on our native shores . Hans , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had exchanged his short green jacket for a brown shag coat , which concealed the whole of his body , but otherwise his dress was not changed . On his back he bore a large knapsack , filled with provision , and in his hand a long cane , which he used as assistance in climbing . The steepness of the way increased as we ascended , and the vegetation became more thin and meagre . About ten o'clock we reached the Alp ; an interval of fertile soil , where one finds the miserable hut of the poor herdsmen , the protectors of flocks of cattle , which feed here during the summer months , and in the autumn are driven down by these men into the valleys , and sold . These shepherds live so secluded* most of the year , that they appear quite like barbarians . Their long beards and coarse dress add to their savage appearance , and one feels some little fear , . , when left alone with such uncivilized beings . We , however , were soon good friends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our scanty store of provisions . Our stay was very short , as the day was far spent , and we had many steps to take before we could reach the village of Geiers , in the valley of the Etz , a river flowing on the south side of the lVlutterberg Glacier . We crossed the little Alp through the frightened herds of cattle , and continued to ascend the mountain on the banks of the Inn , which was now nothing more than a little mountain stream . As we took leave of the view of the Alp  --  the herdsmen waved their sun-burnt arms in token of recognition . We soon came to an almost perpendicular bank , out of which the little streamlet seemed to run . As we stopped a moment to cool ourselves , and quench our thirst , a thick fog suddenly surrounded us. hans desired us to remain quiet until he should return ; lie disappeared from our view and ascended the steep declivity . In a short time we heard his Tyrolese signal , and , listening to the echoes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below came faintly on our ears . there was something cheering in this exchange of signals , which banished for a moment the feeling of solitude and loneliness that was fast stealing over us . Hans was again at our side , and leading the way . We followed his steps on our hands and knees up this steep bank . When we had safely arrived at the top , we found that voi*. ii . 60 // we had ascended above the seeming mist , which proved to be a cloud . We stopped a moment to rest ourselves . Before us lay the valley of the Inn , with its river , watering the richly cultivated gardens and fertile fields , flowing quietly on under the bright rays of a summer sun ; near us were the wooded mountain tops , bending their tall pines in the cool breeze , which fanned our heated brows . All was still . The world seemed gay and happy in its sunshine before us , and , as we gazed on it , no noise of bustle and business , no sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All was silent save the murmurings of the little brook , which rolled merrily along to the beautiful valley-of which we now took our leave . Another signal was sounded , and re-echoed , before the answer from our friends below reached us . We turned our footsteps now to*vard a scene , so different and so grand , that while we compare it with the tranquil one , on which we had been gazing , we know not which to call the most beautiful . The scene now before us displayed hills of trackless snow , dazzling the eyes with the reflection of the bright rays of the sunrocks of most wild and majestic aspect-with here and there a green spot of mountain ice . The last view which had attracted our attention opened to our sight that part of the Glacier , which we were about to pass . It was near two o'clock , P. NI . when we first placed our feet on the snow of the beautiful Mutterberg . Hurried by Hans , we proceeded on our way , which at every step grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged us to rest our wearied limbs at almost every other step . While we were thus climbing , a noise resembling thunder broke in upon the silence of the scene . We looked to the elements above , but a hot summer 's sun , and a pure blue sky , we knew , could not send forth such forebodings of storms . We turned to Hans , who stood watching intently a huge pile of rocks-we knew not what to expect ; Hans was evidently agitated ; and we were frightened by his anxious expression . Another moment , and the heavy mass on which we had been gazing broke loose , and came like a torrent , sweeping down over the very spot , where a little while before we had been resting . had it come sooner , we should have found a grave , where no kind heart would have dropped a tear , and where no monument could have been raised , save the rude , rough rocks , which would have covered our remains . We gazed a moment on the destructive torrent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar , and then turned again toward the summit of the mountain ; in silence we toiled along-each fearful of intruding on the sombre feelings of his companion . I now began seriously to think of giving up , fatigued and chilled ; the rays of the hot sun , beating on my head , nearly robbed me of all resolution and zeal . The mortification of thus discovering to my friends , however , that I could not bear up against the fatigue , roused me again and again to exertion , and at length we reached the summit of the Mutterberg Glacier . The scene was not the first object of our attention . After seating ourselves , the provisions we still had left were laid before us ; and the little keg was soon drained to the last drop . Thus refreshed , and rested , we turned to gaze upon the new regions opened to our view . On the northern sides of glaciers you seldom meet with any great // quantity of ice ; and we had consequently seen but little in our ascent . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by snowy peaks , which reared their tall spires resembling the Gothic structures of continental architecture . Nothing was displayed to the eye , but these regions of desolation and solitude , covered with wild , majestic rocks , contrasting beautifully with the pure , white snow , and here and there a light cloud , chasing through the air its changing shadow over the rocky glens and snowy desert . All was silent , save the sigh of the moaning winds , as they searched in vain the cold caverns and icy lakes for the sweet perfumes of the more social valleys . It was now four o'clock , and we had several miles to walk , before we could reach our intended place of rest . Our little stores were now exhausted , and we ourselves sufficiently refreshed and rested to undertake the descent . One parting look we cast upon the scene to mipress it upon the memory , and I trust I shall never forget it . Its grandeur , its beauty , its wildness , and its desolation and coldness , which came back so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one deeply with the remembrance of a view , of which , with mingled sorrow and joy , we took our farewell . We now began our downward journey . 1-lans led the way , rolling the loose stones before him , which had lost their firm foundation by the melting of the snow beneath them . I had , in descending , sprung upon a large rock , whose size I thought was sufficient to secure it a firm foundation , and considered myself safely situated , when Hans , springing to my side , seized me in his arms and leaped to what proved to be a more secure footing ; for the same rock , the next moment , bounded down the side of the mountain and left me to thank Hans for his kind protection an ( i rescue . Stumbling and sliding over these rough , loose rocks , we at length arrived at the borders of the large sheet of snow , which bordered on the ice . The snow was frozen on the top sufficiently to bear our bodies ; but the fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us cautious . Our canes were pointed and could easily be thrust through its hard surface . Our progress being naturally slow from this cause , Hans began to be concerned about being benighted . He bethought himself however , of a more rapid mode of proceeding , and begged us to follow his example . Seating himself on the ice , he allowed himself to slide down-moderating the rapidity of his descent by thrusting his cane into the snow . As we were thus proceeding , one of the party cried for assistance ; we turned and beheld him sliding on his back unable to stop himself . We were much aharuied , for the snow was separated from the ice by a wide crack , forming a precipice of forty or fifty feet . Toward this he was fast approaching ; but a large rock , which had rolled from the summit of the mountain , obstructed his way , and preserved his life . We succeeded at length in reaching the spot , where he lay , rather frightened , but not injured ; he soon recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were again on our way toward the landing-place between the snow and the ice . Over the ice the way was neither dangerous nor fatiguing . Here and there we stopped to gaze upon its deep precipices-some opening to the view a solid mass of ice of sixty or seventy Ibet in thickness . // Hans related an anecdote about a Tyrolese hunter who had crossed this same mountain with some goods to the Etz valley , and returning home retraced his steps in company with some of his friends . The Tyrolese carry their money in leathern girdles fastened about their waists ; and in this manner the hero of the tale wore his . In crossing the ice he fell into one of these openings , and disappeared ; his friends let down a rope , and were rejoiced to find something attached to the end . They pulled it up , but instead of their fellow traveler , they found his money-bag fastened to it . A second attempt brought the hunter out of the cold place , which had nearly been his grave . When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he replied , " I thought the rope might not be strong enough to hold my weight-my money it would certainly bear-my family is poor  --  and dependent on me  --  and if the money and the father should both be lost together , they would be destitute . " Night was fast advancing and we hurried on to the descent over the rocks . We were surrounded on all sides with snowy peaks and green ice , till we came in view of the Etz valley , which opened suddenly on our sight . This beautiful river takes its rise from the ice , over which we had passed , and floxvs in a south-eastwardly direction to the Gulf of Venice . We proceeded on the right bank of the stream in the very narrow valley toward the village of Geiers . No living being had crossed our path , or floated in the heavens above us ; and when we beheld the track of cows , we were overjoyed . With new vigor we walked on , almost overcome with fatigue and hunger . Hans once again sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon we beheld the hut of the Alp , the herdsmen and their flocks , and were seated with them at their door , drinking the rich milk , which they were kind enough to offer us . Dim twilight had now taken possession of the valleys . We had seen the last rays of the sun take leave of the white snow , glittering in its brightest rays , and beheld the star steal out from the blue ether of hei*ven ; but at that moment , fatigue and hunger had robbed us of enthusiasm , and selfish wants had stolen from us our admiration for the beauties of nature . It was already past eight o'clock , and we had two hours walk before us . We bade adieu to our kind friends , and proceeded on our way . The clear sky was soon covered with dark clouds , which hung low in the valley , and the deep thunder which issued from them echoed and re-echoed along the gloomy sides of the mountains , made more terrible from the bright flashes of lightning that dazzled our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it dashed on the rough rocks and fallen trees , that impeded its progress . We crossed it on a single plank which bent with our weight ; unable as we were to see in the darkness which surrounded us , we were obliged to lead each other . Having successfully crossed this slender bridge , we were then led by Hans in a narrow sheep-path along the side of the steep hill , at whose foot ran the rapid stream , with nothing , in case of a miss-step , to prevent our rolling headlong into it .. Chilled with the rain and worn out from the exertion of sixteen hours hard labor , we arrived at ten o'clock at the village of Geiers . But here no inn was to be found . We espied a light in one of the houses , and tapped at the door . The inmates welcomed us ; and , introducing us into a room , in which // we could scarcely stand upright , with a large iron stove , and a broken piano in the corner , ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) they said they would prepare beds for us immediately . Fatigued as I was , my sleep was disturbed by the occupants of the beds ; and after trying every method in my power , I rolled on to the floor and slept quietly on the hard boards . Thus ended an expedition , which , though dangerous and fatiguing , fully repaid us for the trouble attendmg it . I fear , however , the temptations must be very strong , that could again induce me to attempt such an adventure . S.@@183068247.txt " Chameleons who can paint in white and black ? " AN increasing taste for the study of Natural History , which it is said has been evinced in many parts of the country , and which is supposed to mark an advancing state of refinement , or , perhaps , to indicate the " march of mind , " makes it the duty of those few , who are capable of acting as drill-sergeants , to volunteer their services ; for the man ,  --  as that sublime moralist , Joseph Surface , would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have acquired by fortunate opportunities or surreptitious industry , leaving the world , with the exception of his parsimonious self , as ignorant as it was before , is unworthy to have his name handed down among the votaries of science and the benefactors of humanity . It is no idle desire to fix our name upon a species ,  --  although the usages of the scientific class might seem to ensure that liberal compliment ,  --  but a sincere desire " to give the world assurance of a " strange and troublesome animal , that gives birth to this paper . The animal , concerning which it is proposed to offer a few observations , appears to have escaped the notice of all writers upon Natural History , although it inhabits , or rather infests , almost every house , certainly every public or boarding house , in our cities . The truth is , the zoologists have found it to be , to them , a perfect nondescript . We are grieved at so serious a charge against so worthy a body ; but it is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means peculiar to the scientific , in concluding to say nothing when they knew not what to say , and to attempt no description of an animal , which seemed to defy all their skill , comes under none of their established rules , has no generic characters , and is a species by itself . Nevertheless , as even they must concede that it was created for some benevolent purpose , although the utmost ingenuity of man bath not yet been able to discover its utility , we , even we ,  --  sciolist as we are ,  --  must be allowed to volunteer our aid ; and , howbeit unskilled in zoography , we must crave a moment 's time and the loan of a few scientific phrases , while we add one more to the small number of unquestionable truths . We have called the compound of flesh and blood , concerning which we shall now proceed to discourse , a troublesome and a strange // animal . It certainly deserves the latter appellative , but the former is the more proper designation . The want of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conciseness , for which we may objurgate the naturalists ; who , either because none of them cared enough for science to become its sponsor , or because they considered that , like the Last Man , the only animal of its kind would not be troubled by false cognomens and " counterfeit presentments , " have neglected to bestow a name upon one of the most curious objects in creation . It fortunately happens , however , that their want of attention remedies itself . If it be admitted that names are things , it would seem to follow that a thing without a name is no thing ; and as nothing can not well be described , it is thus logically established that we are correct in styling it a nondescript . The want of a title , therefore , is the most distinctive name this animal could have been furnished with . From a thorough examination of an excellent specimen now before us , we can not wonder that the difficulties it presents should have deterred the most laborious scholars . It furnishes many more doubts than certainties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses some of the peculiarities and appetites , which distinguish the species with which we are more familiar . It is not a man , although it partakes of some of the attributes of the genus hominis , curiously amalgamated with those of many other animals . Thus we are satisfied that it is carniverous , but , like the domestic cat and others of that tribe , it becomes accustomed to food of a less exciting and brutal character , while in other things it possesses evident affinities with the family Insectivora . The head is something elongated and like an inverted cone , the apex falling below the mouth . The ear is oval , nearly as broad as it is long , often elegantly framed , and not covered with hair . The eyes are perfectly visible , and bright and piercing , like those of the Weasel . The nose , or as naturalists call it , the snout , is elevated , pointed , and in some degree movable , although not so much so as that of the Mole . The dental arrangement shows an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have places for the two canine , and four cutting teeth , and ten grinders . Yet this would be a very unsafe guide in attaching the animal to any class , for we have often seen spezimens with not half this number of teeth , and have been more than once puzzled at discovering that the cutting or incisor teeth were removable . The Sheep and the Goat , also , have the same number of teeth . The mouth has no muzzle , which is much to be regretted , as will appear in the sequel ; not , however , on account of the savage nature of the animal , for although expert in stopping a bone or tearing its natural food , it shows no disposition to bite any of the man species . The face , in most cases , has a meek expression , like that of Simo 's mateNo ass so meek , no ass so obstinate , " and is destitute of beard , except in a few instances , where the individuals appear to have attained a patriarchal age . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six feet . It belongs to the tribe Plantigrada ; that is to say , in walking it treads upon the whole sole of the foot , which , like that of the female Grizzly Bear , is naked , and has five toes terminating in sharp nails ; in some specimens the toem // a covered with small conical tubercies , like those on the bottom of the foot of the Opossum , which appear to give pain when compressed ; it is supposed that they are occasioned by a strange habit , but one not peculiar to this animal , of violently thrusting the foot into crevices too small for it . The whole body may be prepared and dressed in a savory manner , and made inviting to the eye and the smell , but it would be found too coarse and disagreeable for common eating . Perhaps of all other animals , it most resembles the Shrew , so learnedly treated of by Godinan and others . The anterior limbs are strikingly like those of a Shrew . The palm of the hand can be expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nails are strong , nearly straight , and externally convex . Where any mischief can be accomplished , it is found to be , like the Bat , wing-handed . Its scratch is painful , but rather defacing than dangerous . The general color is white , like that of the Ermine , or Arctic Fox , and it bears a strong analogy to the latter in this , that it is most easily taken on moonlight nights ; but it does not , , like this fox , prey upon its own species , or devour them when dead ; although in northern latitudes it has sufficient sagacity to perceive the value of the hair ; and individuals have been examined which were covered with that substance , evidently pilfered from several different bodies . It is possible that the loose teeth of which we have spoken are procured in the same manner . It were vain in us to imagine that we have been very successful in describing an animal which defied the knowledge of Cuvier and the ingenuity of Buffon . That Lewis and Clark , Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , perhaps , excusable ; as we are confident that they could never have seen a specimen among all the animals of the wilderness , through which their investigations were extended . But that Godman , who probably saw it every day of his life , should have neglected it without a word of apology , is passing strange . We may hope , however , as no other animal has so many analogies , or presents to view , at a glance , the conjoined virtues of the Cat , the Weasel , the Mole , the Sheep , the Goat , the Bear , the Bat , the Fox and the Shrew , that the subject whereof we treat is recognized by our readers ; and briefly conclude what some may think these " ambiguous givings-out , " with a remark or two concerning its habits . " All the world s a stage ; " the lot cast for this animal is ingeniously compounded from the evil parts of Caliban and Puck . It is a clear case of transmigration , but , unfortunately , presents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of which our eyes have been blessed  --  and that is our humble self-could not endure its perpetual mischievousness , were not the dispensation tempered with mercy . Perchance it was created to instruct the human family in the virtue of patience ; or , to give zest to our enjoyments ; for every thing is fitted to its place , and governed in its propensities , by the order of nature ; and it becomes all sedentary and house-keeping men to acknowledge , with heart-felt gratitude , that none of the Morse , or even of the Seal tribe , are gifted with a more voracious appetite for sunning themselves in the open air ; but as the comparison is not calculated to flatter the amphibious class , it must be admitted , in this connection , that the land monster is more active in its movements , and of cours*. has none of their dignity although it travels with more facility . // It should be mentioned as another gift of mercy , that its visitations are periodical , and its habits regular ; but this knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of its greatest activity is towards the middle of the day , the hour at which students generally ,  - -  which unfortunate class is most obnoxious to its attacks ,  --  are unwilling to be disturbed . At this time , " the front of Jove himself " although surrounded by whole hetacombs of piscatorial damsels , with a counterscarp of epithets and expletives , would present no obstacle to its aggressions . What then , can man do  --  but suffer ? What should a philosopher do  --  but smile , if he can , amidst the ruins of his labors ? What should we do ,  --  but the very overt act of chirographical duty to which a love of science now impels us ? For , at this very hour , no longer ago than yesterday , " there came This thing which Adam had been posed to name ; Noah had refused it lodging in his ark , Where all the race of reptiles might embark ; A verier monster , than on Afric 's shore The sun e'er got , or slimy Nibs bore ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at this moment singing at our door , in tones which shame the melody of the Wild Goose itself ; now it is rubbing , and thrashing , and flapping , and brushing , and cackling , with all the importance of a maiden Hen in charge of a sister 's brood ; now it knocks at our very portal ; its noise increases with its efforts ; more persevering than the Spider , it forces the entrance , in spite of a huge easy chair , wherewith we had barricaded the way ; we scold , but it endeavors to caress us ; we threaten , . and it heeds us not ; we hurl a new cork inkstand , but with no effect ; it arrives at our seat ; its sacrilegious attacks have reached our three-legged table , the very tripod on which we indite oracles , as true as those which have made Delphos immortal ; resistance is hopeless ; we relinquish the book ; we drop the pen ; it presses upon us ; its voice has changed ; it grows more various than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both divisions are put in action ; it is more loquacious than the Parrot , more active than the Dipper ; it sings , gabbles and yells , all in a breath ; we are stunned , confounded , confused ; we submit , and lo ! we are driven from our quarters without the benefits usually derived from capitulation . The conqueror is no longer a tame animal . It thinks , with certain politicians , that the spoils of the vanquished are the property of the successful . It becomes ferocious , like the Cougar ; busy and mischievous as the Monkey ; agile as the Cat ; and more curious than the Opossum . Its anterior digits are inserted in nooks and crannies that would exclude the tongue of a Mole ; drawers are ransacked ; trunks emptied ; nothing movable stands still , and even the time-hallowed dust and cobwebs , which decorate our manuscripts and ornament our shelves , are swept away before the ravenous appetite of the barbarian invader . Nothing escapes . The books that were open are closed ; those which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a week are foiled in a moment ; the very sheet on which we had commenced an " Essay on the mental gratification of inhaling an easterly wind , and the bodily advantages derived from participating in such refined enjoyments , " the very first sheet , we say , with all the // memorandums from which we should have compiled an elaborate , a useful , and , we flatter ourselves , an immortal work , are " gone in a moment ; " all my pretty chickens and their dam , At one fell swoop Criticism never played such pranks with poetry . The attack of the Quarterly , which demolished Keats , was mere " cake and ale , " to the attack of our unscrupulous foe and its effects upon our reputation . Our premises have assumed the appearance of a conquered country .

N. B. Upon further research we find that some of the French Nataralists treat of an animal which they denominate an Enfant du Diable . It requires no examination to assure us that this can be no other than the animal we have been endeavoring to describe . The name is far more appropriate and significant than any of the cognomens bestowed upon it in this country . We have also learned that bachelors and other single men , who are particularly liable to its attacks , designate it by an appellation which conveys to their ears , as Sir Peter Teazie says , " all that 's diabolical , " and call it a Chambermaid.
