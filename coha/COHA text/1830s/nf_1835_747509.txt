txt /q/ence and piety . Note . - The Editors hope to present the public , ere long , with the remaining portion of Madame de Saussure 's Progressive Education ; and should she pursue the plan intimated in the following extract , we shall lose no time in giving to our country , a translation of the views of this able and accomplished author upon Female Education . Extract of a letter from Madame Necker de Saussure to Mrs. Willard ; - dated Geneva , July 21 , 1834 . ( Translated from the French . ) " Permit me to express , Madam , how much I am delighted that my book has received the approbation of yourself and your sister , Mrs. Phelps , so far as to induce you to translate it . Your own works , which I have had the happiness to read , show to what enlightened judges mine has been submitted . In my second volume , as I have treated of a greater number of subjects than in the first , and discussed more contested points , the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accord with your ideas ; but my sentiments in general so far harmonize with yours , that I can at least depend upon your indulgence . " Since my last volume of Progressive Education was Avritten , 1 have reflected much upon the education of women , and even began a treatise upon the subject ; you may judge , therefore , how precious to me is this communication with you . Your experience is much more extensive than my own , which has been confined to private education . But the difficulty of writing on this subject alarms me ; opinions /q/ upon the destination of women diverge 60 far , and are so much under the influence of locality , that one can scarcely hope to produce a general impression , at least if the attempt be made to go beyond a mere common-place morality . It is very singular , that with sentiments essentially the same , and sustaining the common relations of wife and mother , women of different countries , and in different ranks , so little understand each other . The slightest diversity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's hearts . " We can not even treat of the defects of our sex , without seeming unjust to the women of some countries , and appearing to point out those of others ; - thus , our defects are not those of the French : if we go into Germany and England , we shall find those from which we free , but at the same time qualities in which we are deficient . With us , a woman shines by prudence and an extreme circumspection ; these entitle her to consideration , more than brilliancy of mind . Americans might find me too timid in my views of female education ; while , at home , it might be thought I had gone too far ; not that instruction , among us , is regarded with indifference , but it is desired only on condition that it produce no movement of the soul that may effect any change in real life . In France , tout pris de nous , the desire to emancipate women has become disorderly , striking at the root of all social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyons , is published a journal , edited by females , themselves , in which the principles are manifestly those of St. Simonisme . " Mr. Martin has recently published a work entitled ' Education of Mothers . ' - At first I supposed my labor performed ; but though I find some interesting pages in the book , and that he requires of mothers many fine sentiments , still ther are no definite counsels for their guidance . - Vague in religion as false in philosophy , there only remains to the reader the pleasure of having perused some very fine phrases . /z/ " With much more satisfaction I have examined two volumes of the American Annals of Education , edited by Mr. Woodbridge . In this work I have found excellent advice upon the religious education of women , upon the care of health , and the development of the faculties . " There are treasures in the soul of woman which yet remain to be explored and brought forward . This must be the work of an early , a thorough , and a judicious education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the successive publication of different volumes of a work . This course seems naturally indicated , when one of the parts forms a whole by itself , as is the case in the present work : an important subject , that of the moral education of early infancy , is here found , not exhausted , indeed , but considered as fully as it seemed to require . In a work which has for its object the progressive education of the whole life , this volume may be considered under a double aspect : it is a first part , destined to be soon succeeded by a second , which will complete what relates to infancy - and it is at the same time a separate essay ; it is the study of a period of human existence , short , indeed , it is true , but perfectly distinct from every other , and replete with facts interesting to the observer . There exists , indeed , between this period , and the portion of life which follows it , a line of demarcation not arbitrarily drawn , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the /z/ individual . The child at the age of five years possesses all the intellectual faculties bestowed upon man : some of these faculties , yet weak and little accustomed to exercise , are frequently called into action by the most frivolous motives ; and although expressed , as yet , only by insignificant actions , they are still manifested , and the child makes use of them in his own manner . Before the age of four years , on the contrary , the child is a different being ; it is destitute of reflection , one of the essential elements of human reason . Its mind , already very active , does not consider itself , and is unconscious of its own operations . Moreover , the instincts of the first age are yet with him in full vigor : Its moral and physical nature are still composed , in a great degree , of the faculties bestowed upon the first period of life for a temporary and special object - endowments which we do not discover in after life . Thus , dispositions which partake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tendency to imitation , soon cease to be . noticed , either because they are , in truth , much diminished , or because the new development of the faculties , with which we are better acquainted , attracts our whole attention . Finally , when the child begins to use language , it is only as a means of external communication ; his thoughts do not , without effort , flow in words , and he lives the same life of sensations and images , of desires and impressions , as that of animals , and hevvly-born infants . From this mode of existence , so different from ours , we infer that infancy is the only age which is clearly separated from the periods which follow it , these being connected to each other by inseparable gradations. /q/ I do not mean to be understood that the peculiarities of the infant mind do not disappear gradually . The period from five to twelve years is an interval of transition , during which the instincts of the child become feeble in proportion as the faculties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual , ' at a period when it is difficult to discover them . If , then , we neglect to study them when they alone prevail , we shall not distinguish them in a more complicated existence . One of the elements of the moral constittition of the pupil will always be unknown by us , if we have not observed the child in the first period of its existence . Other considerations , still more weighty , will be joined to these , if we can be convinced of two truths ; the one , that from the conditions imposed upon the soul at its first entrance into this world , the faculties which deeide the formation of the character are those which are first manifested in the individual ; the other , that education possesses an immense influence over the development of these faculties . This last truth is placed beyond a doubt by the schools recently established for children from the age of two to six years . In these we can judge of the happy effects that the principles by which I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , the happy resuhs which these institutions present , give the sanction of a more extended experience to the conclusions which I have deduced from facts observed in a narrow circle , - I venture to flatter myself , on the other hand , that these deductions will serve to explain , in a rational manner , the success of the method employed in these schools . /z/ This hope is not entirely unfounded , at least as respects Creneva , where infant schools are at present forming . The remembrance of M. de Saussure is yet ' so vivid in his country , it is so well known that his zeal for public instruction here was equal tqthat displayed in his labors as a physician , that his daughter has some reason to hope to be listened to , when she speaks of education . This is one motive which has led me to hasten the publication of a volume which may , at this time , prove of imporlant utility at Geneva . In an introduction containing the plan of this whole work , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its progress , I have successively been influenced . While I undertook to trace the moral history of life , in pointing out , as far as I was able , the means of improvement which are adapted to its different ages , I designed to pass rapidly over the years of infancy . Impressed with the great idea that our existence here is but the prelude to 9nother , that our passage through the present world is only an education for another , I would view this idea in its various applications . Relying upon these words of Scripture , - ' All things shall work together for good to those who love God ' my design was to show that he who will avail . himself of divine assistance , finds in every event , in the diversified interests which contribute to unfold our various moral faculties , the means of advancing towards his true destination . Without presuming too much upon the effect of my work , I have hoped to benefit myself , to find , in lofty thoughts , a support , a refuge /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings of time , and to recommence , by my remembrances , the work which my life has thus far too little promoted . At the first , my attention has been directed more to the results of life , than to that preparation for life itself , which should occupy the commencement of it ; and the education of infancy was presented to me as a subject necessary , from my plan , to be noticed , but already exhausted by the distinguished writers who have devoted their thoughts to this subject . But in examining this subject more closely , I have found much that is new , especially with regard to the first years of life . Philosophers have almost entirely disregarded very young children : instructers by profession do not often have them under their care ; and when they are with them , they too frequently regard the future pupil as mere brute matter , destined to receive its value from them . They consider him an ignorant being , not thinking that , in order to arrive at the point where he is susceptible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely different from that of man . Females , on the other hand , quick to seize upon the slightest indications , and to comprehend the least intentions of children , are often satisfied with understanding them by sympathy . Their feeling is directed immediately to practical utility ; and when a ready discernment has decided what will conduce to this , they consider it of little importance to arrive at general results . I was myself for a long time deeply occupied with education ; but I had studied my children without /z/ feeling that I was investigating the general principles of infant minds : all my observations seemed confined to the individual . The different systems of which I had acquired a knowledge not being able to satisfy me , I followed the guidance of the little experience I had gained , and what I believed to be good sense . But as this experience became more enlarged , as more leisure afforded me the opportunity to mature my reflections , I perceived the effect of general laws , in the uniformity of the phenomena presented by infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the contemplation of this age , has led me too far . But , either by the facts I have cited , or the conclusions deduced from them , I have extended the subject beyond my original intention . Without abandoning my undertaking , as it is announced in the Introduction , I have gradually changed the proportions of it . Pressed by time , and by the advancement of the age , I have felt the necessity of reducing the dimensions of the part which first occupied most of my attention ; and that which was designed to have formed two thirds of the work , will be little more than one third . The first book is devoted to the exposition of principles which are applicable to every period of education . Nothing , surely , is more important than for the instructor to be fully acquainted with his own views , to demand of himself , in the first place , his precise object , since this is the best method of attaining that object . Yet , under these two relations , how numerous are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens before us , at the simple contemplation of /q/ that undertaking , so great , and at the same time so common - ihat of educating a child ! The final destina. - tion of man , the obligations imposed upon him by the divine law , and the constitution of the present world , with the qualities which may render him capable of performing these obligations , become so many objects of deep and anxious contemplation . And when we consider what education is - that it is designed to influence the will , to impress upon the soul characters which will remain during life , we discover , not only that profound study of the human mind is indispensable to the instructor , but that he should be acquainted with the order in which the moral faculties are unfolded . It is jiot as an idle speculation , that such a study is presented : we see it to be the foundation , and even the essence of the art of education . It is unnecessary for me to say that I have merely glanced at these great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have endeavored to avoid all useless discussion ; in applying my principles to human life , I have taken some points as agreed upon , which are yet debated : but to support all my convictions by solid proofs , to resolve all difficulties , and remove all objections , would equally have surpassed the limits of my subject and of my powers . I have not affected philosophic coldness , but have expressed the feelings by which I was actuated , without exaggeratipg them , or indulging unkind expressions towards those who differ from me , and especially without allowing myself , in favor of the best objects , to allege reasons which seem trivial or doubtful . If I have ventured to touch upon lofty themes , it has been because /z/ they were inherent to my subject , and have involuntarily commanded my attention ; or they have pursued , rather than been sought by me . However the theoretical part of my work may be subject to criticism , I hopetohave presented ideas which may be fruitful , in useful applications . The second book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life - that important period , during which education is in a degree directed by vague ideas , since the child who does not yet speak can not aid the observer in discovering what passes in his mind . But the discerning instinct of mothers , often penetrates the obscurity which involves this tender infancy , and furnishes important observations upon which to found our reasonings . On the contrary , the period from the age of two to four years , the consideration of which occupies the third book , is the most instructive season for us . Then the new progress of the child , without having as yet changed his moral existence , serves to reveal it to our eyes ; we then see the peculiar nature of infancy distinctly manifested , at the very period when it is about to disappear . The results of the facts relative to the soul during this period and the preceding , are considered in a separate chapter ; and this concludes the history of infancy . Hitherto , what has been advanced is only a collection of observations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , the formation of morality in children . But , for the interest of morality itself , I have thought it my duty to invite the instructor 's attention to facts which have been the least regarded . We /q/ /z/ begin lo feel , that to secure the advancementof education , ' it is necessary to discover the physiological method ; or , in other words , to discover the laws of the moral development of the individual . But , without pretending to understand the essential nature of the soul , we may yet study the progress of the intellect from the birth of the human being . And , as a being immersed in total ignorance can attain a knowledge of the physical and moral world only by degrees , and in a determined order , we very soon discover that this order decides the development of the various faculties in the soul of the child . It is thus that the examination of facts always conducts to an explanation of their consequences . Another benefit which we shall derive from the study of the infant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate the endowments bestowed upon it by Providence ; qualities so adapted to its future destiny , that a moral constitution in any respect differing from the present , would have rendered him less susceptible of progress . . In viewing him with regard to futurity , we see that many of his apparent defects - that even his weakness and his imperfect development , are the effects of a wise dispensation . He has the perfection of an ' ignorant being , a state the most favorable to be instructed ; and he has also the perfection of a dependent being , wholly unable to help himself , and a wonderful talent for obtaining aid of others . He can excite in us emotions of goodness , of devotion , and of constant affection , which we feel for none but him : he succeeds in inspiring us with a tender and heart-felt pity , and yet amuses and pleases us . Too improvi- /z/ dent to be enslaved by his necessities , he has the grace , sometimes the pride of independence , and when he has received every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterested air. * The immediate work of God , noble in view of its future destiny , and interesting in its present form , the infant presents at the same time a charming creation , and a perfect sketch . * Who has not , at times , felt the irresistible power of infancy to awaken tenderness and gentle affections ! When the heart is sad , or seared by disappointment , it seems insensible to afiy emotions but of the most gloomy and despairing kind . Now like a beam of light glancing athwart the darkness of midnight , does an infant 's smile kindle up an involuntary cheerfulness , and provoke the sternest features to return an answering expression . The widowed mother , as she clasps her babe to her bosom , feels the apathy of grief to be succeeded by a soflened emotion , and as she raises her supplications to the Father of the fatherless , is inspired with the wish to live for her child , and the resolution to nerve herself , for his sake , to encounter the storms of life , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for those who need to be cared for . Ed /z/ Mr design is to represent the progress of life , and the feelings which animate us at every period of it : . I wish to describe the changes which time produces in us ; but this is not my only object . As the noblest aim of the study of the human heart is to soften it , I desire to seek the means of rendering our dispositions more exalted and more holy , more favorable to the tranquillity of the soul , and the display of its activity . It is the history of the soul , especially , that I propose to trace ; a history less different in various individuals than that of their external condition , but of much greater importance . The changes which our souls experience , have for us the nature of real events . Upon the state of the heart , depends not only our own happiness , but also the train of events that the desire of gratifying our inclinations may produce . The most unforeseen determinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been preceded by desire. * Thus , by indulg- /z/ ing in certain thoughts , we unconsciously yeave the web of our future destiny . The succession of our feelings , is the confused sketch of the drama which is afterwards represented in our conduct . All , then , is education in human life .. Each year of our existence is the consequence of years that precede it , and the preparation for those which follow ; each age has a task to perform for itself , and another in relation to that which succeeds it . And if , in proportion as we advance in life , the perspective of life itself seems to narrow before us - if it seems less necessary to prepare for a career always diminishing , there is a point of view the reverse of that . There is an interest which increases with years . The less the time remaining to ua to live , the more valuable does each moment become , in the view of the Christian . He who aims to win the prize of the race feels his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , differs from other ages , in many respects . There is a time of weakness , and inexperience , when the newly-created soul acquires its first notions of things , and is brought into intercourse with an particularly females . To the susceptibility of their heartB , and an unrestrained license of imagination , are to be ascribed much of the misery which many of our sex endure . Surrounded by attentive friends , watched over by parental tenderness , and enjoying all the refinements and luxuries which wealth can parchase , many a female has been left to muse in secret over a hopeless passion , which might have been checked in its beginning - or has been induced to marry a man in whom neither moral or intellectual endowments made up the want of worldly goods . In poverty and degradation , she must realize that by indulging in certain thoughts she did unconsciously weave the web of her dei* tiny , Ed. /q/ unknown world ; it then sustains no responsibility ; the care of its education is not confided to itself : but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculties , we can not assign to it any definite period . The mind is always capable of being enlarged , and the heart of being softened ; even religious feeling , the most elevated of our sentiments , has a tendency to increase , by exercise . All the springs which act upon the child , have power with the man ; outwardly , circumstances and events ; inwardly , those feelings which prompt us to love and to hate , to imitate , to hope and fear , exert a continual influence upon our souls . How then can we assign any boundaries to the extent of education ? The character and the mind are constantly receiving modifications ; this is what renders education always possible ; not only is it possible , but unavoidable : some species of it is incessantly active : to know if we can direct it , is the only doubtful question . The development of the character does not , it is true , depend entirely either upon the will of instructors in infancy , or upon that of the pupil at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that these wills have no power ? Because we have not every thing at our disposal , does it follow that we can influence nothing ? Many causes , it is true , act without our knowledge , and against our wishes ; but there are regular and beneficial influences which are at our command . It is because there is at all periods an accidental education , that it is necessary to balance the effects of it by one which has been premeditated . All the power given to man in education , depends /z/ upon the exercise of his will. * This power is , in my opinion , great ; and it is for this alone that man will always be responsible . The transient influence of instructors should establish the durable empire of conscience , and give a permanent direction to what is most variable with the child , and remains fluctuating with man - the will . If , then , there exists a source , where the will may become invigorated , whence it can derive the assistance necessary to sustain , enlighten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into apathy , it would seem that the great object of education is to render the access to this more easy to the human being in the successive periods of his life . After having described the first years of life , when * There is a vulgar opinion prevailing among some parents , that a child 's ' will must be broken , ' as the expression is ; but it should be understood that the willjresrfutioUy or firmness of purpose , all of which are nearly synonymous terms , is in fact the very stamina of the mind . It is indeed necessary that a child should very early be taught obedience , and to know that its own wishes are not always to be gratified . For this end , should he prove refractory , punishment of some kind should be resorted to , until he is made to submit to authority . Yet in doing this , a very young child may be made to under stand , by an affectionate , though decided manner , that his own good only is intended ; and thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken . It is painful to think of the manner in which some parents and teachers govern the young and tender minds committed to their fostering care . Insult and ignominy are heaped upon the defenceless being , as ungoveirnable passion or mistaken views of discipline may prompt , and either a sullen obstinacy , a morbid melancholy , or a servile abjectncss of spirit , takes the place of that ingenuous frankness , that playfulness of disposition and noble independence which are so lovely and interesting in the young and which are far from being incompatible with a character submitted to a judicious discipline . Ed. /q/ education , with some slight differences , is the same for all children , I shall revert to the peculiar character which should be given to the early education of females . Indeed , it will be their education that I shall principally consider in the whole course of the work . I can more easily speak of them , both because I know them better , and because the contemplation , of their destiny is better suited to my design . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and hence they are more subject to the influence of natural events . As they embrace no - particular profession - as they are neither merchants , soldiers , or magistrates , the natural dispositions are more apparent in them ; they are daughters , wives , and mothers , more than men are sons , fathers or husbands . Observe the young female , desirous of rendering herself lovely , - she who is on the eve of marriage - the wife , jealous of her husband 's affections - the inuther , solicitous for her children - and you will find the same sentiments in* flueucing the conduct , and acting upon the heart , from Lapland to Peru , from the slave to the princess . The difference of age are also more marked in females .. A man who has embraced a particular profession , goes on , during his whole life , through nearly the same routine , and the uniformity of his actions affects also the state of his feelings . All the interests of woman , on the contrary , change with years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easy to mark the influence of time upon her life . Another reason which leads me to address myself to females , is because they will listen to what I say . Having no public profession , they usually mark out , /z/ more or less judiciously , a sort of moral career ; each one conceives a certain ideal excellence , which she seeks to reach , and by which she directs her course . Her thoughts and opinions are little concealed . IP she is ignorant of many things , she at least does not boast of knowing every thing ; and the want of positive knowledge is more than compensated by the desire of acquiring it . The education of her children which devolves upon her , leads her to iiim at what is best for them and for herself : all advice upon this sacred subject is gratefully received ; and the observations that she is continually making , as a mother , increase her taste for mental analysis . Butj if I more particularly address myself to women , I would not be thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view renders the condition of the heart important also wiih men . As Christians , the domestic relatioub becuiue to them of great importance : increase of years gives to life a new character of gravity ; and the great idea of a future existence , causes the distinctions of wealth and rank to vanish . The tendency of this work will , I trust , be religious : it is not a book of mere amusement , since the observation of life , such as it is in reality , is presented here ; and the spirit of Christianity , it is hoped , pervades it , although its doctrine be not frequently alluded to . Not , however , that I regard the doctrine as indifferent . If the devotion of the heart is of the first importance , the religion of it is not the least essentially founded upon a belief , and the nature of this belief influences that of devotion itself , and of a multitude of other opinions . But , sincerely attached to Christianity as our illustrious /z/ /q/ reformers* have viewed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . I appeal to that feeling which ought to be common among Christians , to that boundless charity which esteems the name of tolerance towards brethren ; implying , as it does , the existence of Something wrong to be tolerated , as weak , and even injurious : I appeal to that charity , the exercise of which , though sometimes difficult , is indispensably necessary , and which consists in allowing to all the right which we claim , to think and judge for themselves . This varied work , the author has not the vanity to suppose will , in a religious point of view , prove instructive to persons eminent for their piety . These seem to me too elevated to need assistance from me . They have access to a higher source than human counsel ; and even of human counsel , of a kind better than my book can give . I address myself especially to a class unhappily much more numerous ; to those who , without being ranked among the adversaries of religion , do not comprehend the Christian language , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books which give a * The circumstance of Madame De Sausure 's belonging to the Protestant Church , renders the tone of her work more in unison with the feelings of most Christians among us than it probably would otherwise have been . It is true that the pious and amiable Fenelon wrote much that is delightful to the heart of the Christian , much that may seem to improve the female sex ; but still there is interwoven with his sentiments something of that peculiar m3sticism which belongs to the Romish church , and in his advice to young women , with a low estimate of female abilities , appears also a superstitious adherence to the contracted 4enets of his church . Ed. i It must be here recollected by the reader that the author writes in a country where infidelity , and the influence of the /z/ faithful interpretation of them . Ignorant as they are of the most important resources , the difficulty is to make them feel their need of them . We scarcely Romish Church have both tended to the disuse of the Scripture . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Word of God which prevails in many parts of those countries denominated Christian ; thick darkness , with respect to every thing spiritual , broods over the douls of millions who are within the very sound of the gospel , and superstition and scepticism seem to unite to hold the soul in bondage . Take for example one instance among thousands ; a girl of eighteen , who has recently arrived in this country , from Catholic Ireland ; quick in her conceptions , intelligent in every thing which is placed under her observation , she is wholly ignorant of all which the Bible teaches , except in those particulars where her priest has thought proper to enlighten her , in order to secure his own influence . In attempting to teach her to read , the word Noah occurred . She was asked who Noah was ; the answer was she did not know . - * Have you never heard of the flood by which God once destroyed the earth ? ' She had not - ' Did you never go to school in your own country ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to read of a good Protestant lady , who told me to come to her house ; - she had a school for the poor children of the place , and wished me to go to it . I went to the priest and on my knees , asked him to permit me to go to this school of Lady C - ; he said . No , I must not be taught by any but himself , and that it was sinful for me to learn , especially from the Protestants . ' The same girl was for some time afraid to attend family prayers , because her priest had told her that there was no religion out of her own church , and that heretics and all who had any thing ta do with them , would be eternally miserable . She also suffered much dejection because she had not access to a priest to whom she might confess ; for , according to their faith , Roman Catholics otfn only hope for forgiveness and favor from God , through the intercessions of their priests ; cf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exposed to eternal perdition . Hov blessed is that religion which teaches us that none can forgive* sins , but God only , and that his ear is ever open to the cry of the penitent ! Ed. /q/ know how to ect this ; for , so long as we are not able to give them , in the only language which they understand , a taste for divine truths , they will be like those barbarous people who never emerge from their condition , because they do not conceive themselves to be deficient . But I chiefly address myself to those whom I regard more immediately as my equals ; I speak to those who are impressed with the truth , the beauty , and primary importance of Christianity , but wish to connect it more closely with the various objects of interest , which we can not and ought not to banish from human existence . These , feel that religion is every thing , or nothing ; that if it does not become an absorbing principle , it is an empty profession ; but they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so numerous are the objects in this world , which , in the course of life , have a lawful , and even a useful place , and yet seem foreign to religion. * The education of the heart may present the means of doing this , since , considered with regard to religious perfection , there is no action or occupation indifferent ; every thing is injurious or useful , every thing retards or favors our progress . We How often does the heart of the true Christian sink , in view of the trivial concerns which demand his attention , and even duties which seem to have a deadening influence upon his piety I but such is the state in which our Heavenly Father has been pleaded to place man , for the very purpose of trying him . If every thing incited him to piety , where would be the Christian 's warfare ? But the real spirit of religion inwrought in the soul will not only carry i ; s safely through all temptations , but turn them into occasions for spiritual Improvement and growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us , instead of considering them as they are in themselves ; and , repelling every thing which removes us from God , we should seek to approach him by every pure and elevated means . Having spoken of the design of this work , I proceed to state its plan . It treats of premeditated* education ; that is to say , the education which aims to take advantage of the influence of men and things , for the perfecting of the individual . This education should continue during the whole life , and only change its agent : although this may be different , the work itself remains the same , and , from birth to death , there is always a subject to be perfected . Considered in this light , life is naturally divided into three periods . During the 6rst , which embraces the period of infancy , education is directed by minds superior to those of the individual who is to be acted upon . During the second , which includes the period of adolescence or youth , and that portion of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should more and more aid in his own education . Finally , during the third period , the individual having become the arbiter of his own destiny , is himself called to labor for his own perfection . The first of these divisions of human life , is that " &#9830; The expression * premeditated etiucaiion* seems rather foreign to our idiom , and yet when something the opposite of accidental education is meant , as is here the pase , it is difficult to substitute abetter . Ed. /q/ where a writer on the subject finds his course the most distinctly traced . In considering infancy , he can not do otherwise , than to address himself to the instructors who have undertaken the direction of it ; and accordingly education , properly speaking , or the cares of which children are the object , become the subject of which he should treat . But this subject would be too vast , either for my plan , or my abilities , should I attempt to consider it in its whole extent . Obliged to limit myself , it will chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . I shall not dilate upon methods of teaching , but in the general views upon the development of the mind which I shall have occasion to offer , shall especially consider the moral effect of the various occupaflbns and different studies which are commonly pursued. * Yet the rules which I havp. impofipH npnn mycplf in tm9 rrxntt ax/pjAzxjiJiy ttJttx tin : t ; vriiJiiJCUi:t ; irit ; iit , HTI iiives* ligation of the human heart more profound than that of which infancy has heretofore been the object . Books upon education ordinarily contain the history of the thoughts and experiments of the instructor relatively to his pupil , rather than the history of the pupil himself , and of what passes in his mind . The latter is precisely what I have endeavored to discover . After having , in some general considerations , indicated the views which the instructor ought to take on the subject of his duties , I devote my attention to the child ; - I seek to know /z/ his feelings during the entire period when an imperious necessity subjects him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the majority of the impressions attributed to caprice and unreasonableness , in infancy , have a higher origin . The conditions to which the soul is subjected upon its entrance into this world , furnish , 1 think , a sufficient explanation for many feelings which infants experience ; and I also recognize in them the effect of a dispensation eminently favorable to the development of the noblest faculties . I then attempt to describe the moral constitution of the child at different ages , and deduce the practical results which these observations clearly present . This order , the most natural of all , is not however the only one which I have observed . Certain dispositions should be cultivated before others , either because they are fu- gitivp. orhpppimfi they may fflrilitatp tbp whole work of edur.atinn . Frinciples must De estabrisnea before consequences are deduced from them . There is then a moral . and logical connexion , independent of the order of facts , but not less essential to follow . After observation and its consequences , there will generally follow the exposition of a truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the changes produced by years shall lead to corresponding changes in the consequences of this truth , I shall present it under a new aspect . Thus we shall see the same principles differently developed in the successive periods of education . This blending of observations , of theory and the application of their results to infancy , presents great difficulties in execution . Arising from it , are too frequent /q/ and strong contrasts , and too sudden transitions . Nothing is apparently so frivolous and trifling , as details concerning little children , as the whole mass of facts presented by that age ; nothing , on the contrary , is so great , so difficult , or so obscure , as the study of the faculties of the soul . Yet how can we separate these two elements of education ? Shall we attach sufficient importance to the form , often very insignificant , under which certain faculties are presented in the child , if we do not consider them in relation to their future importance ? Should we fail of seeing the future in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass ? Should we not even keep in view the point from which we set out , and that to which we would attain , infancy and manhood ? If the apparent changes of tone and of object seem , in a literary point of view , less striking than a ( Jifferent method , this must not tempt to deviate from what I consider essential to the subject , and most impoHantto consider . Perhaps with a superior tact I should have avoided these dissonances ; but to neglect to say things which I believe useful , I consider a greater wrong than to state them in an imperfect manner . When the pupil has arrived at the period of adolescence , we see him beginning to aid in the work of his own education . He comprehends and adopts the best design with regard to it ; he approves the means of promoting it , and chooses or appoints them . His parents preserve all their right over him , but by degrees they lose their power ; their authority would no longer exert a salutary infl &ence,; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confidence at first , then complete and familiar persuasion . Their moral influence requires /z/ the more careful management , as it will very soon di- : minish , and as this period often gives a direction to the whole life . It is not easy to employ judiciously , this precious and fragile remnant of a decaying power . Observation is often rendered useless , by sudden changes which are produced in the character of the pupil . We know him no longer , * and he has litde knowledge of himself . He is sincere , but every moment deceived , both with regard to himself and every thing about him . His ardent and flexible imagination always places what he believes to be , in the place of what re9lly is ; the combat of hopes with possibilities i as yet little felt by him , and he lives in an atmosphere of illusions that nothing has yet dissipated . Ignorant of the extent or limits of his faculties , of what his will can , and what it can not accomplish , he is by turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues , and the youth is assailed upon all sides by new passions or temptations , the hand which had guided him seems insensibly withdrawn , and he is often cast alone amidst * How true is this observation ! how often is the parent to whom the heart of his child had been as an open page , suddenly dismayed by finding its inscriptions concealed from his inspection , and . the being whom he had led and influenced without the appearance of opposition , bounding from his grasp , and gone , whither ho can not follow him ! That is. his affections , desires and pursuits seem changed , and an impenetrable veil now shrouds the internal processes of thought which are going on . The parent must , in season , foresee that his passive child will become the self-centred man , and so wisely improve and wield power , while in his possession , that the man shall recognize as his/rten ( / , the guardian of the child . Ed. /q/ the dangers of the world . Yet such is the ascendancy of principles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of the pure and generous feelings which may have been easily inspired at an earlier age , that not only shall the young man escape the dangers which surround him , but form anew those virtuous resolutions , the accomplishment of which will occupy his future life . The variety of interesting objects which rise to the view of youth is so great , there is such a crowd of new feelings and thoughts , new ideas and impressions , that it is extremely difficult to analyze and describe the condition of the subject of education at this period . Whatever else I may omit in this limited sketch , 1 shall at least consider the essential object , religion , and shall endeavor to show how important it is , during that short interval , which , with females , separates infancy from marriage , to give to future mothers principles of piety . The remaining part of the work will consider the successive occasions naturally presented to adults to promote their own perfection . The young man is hardly released from the yoke of parental authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of his liberty , in uniting the destiny of another to his own . Until this period , his only concern had been for himself . The object of the devotion of his parents , he had entered into their views , while he attended to his own interests , and labored to store his intellect with knowledge , and his soul with virtues . With the feeling of an artist , he had viewed his own character as a work which he was to accomplish , and considered that noble /z/ and generous qualities were to be its crowning ornament ; - but selfwBs always first in his thoughts . Ho desired that good should be done , but that this good should be effected by himself and considered particularly the part which he had performed upon every occasion . Hence that species of self-conceit which so often renders young persons disagreeable . It is impossible without a strong moral power for nature to be subdued , and the bonds of selfishness unloosed . Such a resolution is often reserved to the power of paternal love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * By means of this sentiment alone , man learns to know true affection , that entire consecration of soul which does not expect areturn equal to what it gives , which looks for no happiness like that which it would procure for the object of its attachment . At this period , I shall again direct my attention to children , not as being themselves the object of education , but as educating , so to speak , their parents , because they place them in a situation where very interest and every feeling concur to make them sensible of the necessity of morality , and of its most certain source , religion . Then terrestrial existence has received its most extensive development , when the soul has formed its greatest number of relations with other beings . An useful member of society , still a son , and already a f itfagf , man perceives the various branches of his duty * Quere , Is parental love more generous , devoted or self-sacrificing , than that which subsists between the sexes in its highest and purest form of conjugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he animates a sphere of activity proper to the nature of his faculties . Yet he soon discovers that these faculties have their limits . Illusions are dissipated by his being perpetually brought into contact with real things ; his external influence is increased , as a certain ardor diminishes ; the repetition of the scenes of the world extinguishes the vivacity of bis impressions , and his interest in life for himself , somewhat abated , passes more and more into that of his children ; and upon them his imagination fixes with new hopes and new illusions . But these children , in the course of their life , do not fully satisfy his expectation ; they may very soon stray from home , and at last become entirely separated . It is the same with a thousand objects of lively interest ; the esteem and gratitude of others , or some good which we had hoped to eiFect . Every thing decays , is withered , or fades in the distance . We perceive that affairs move on without us , and we become detached from others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the compensation for the loss of the fascinating charms and illusions of youth . In such an one , the great sense of duty survives all , and gives its possessor an enjoyment and ' activity independent of worldly thoughts and objects . - The invisible world appears , in proportion as the visible world vanishes from his sight , and his hopes rest upon the only Being dio can never deceive hinu A greater degree of elevation and of tranquillity , and a more just appreciation of objects , communicate to him a new and entirely different species of greatness . He DOW understands why he was sent into this earth , and the plan of human life is unfolded to bis understanding . /z/ He perceives that , placed upoo the earth in order that his faculties should be expanded , he is not destbed to remain connected to the objects which have served to unfold them . His new powers aspire to a new exercise . The understanding would be elevated to a higher contemplation than that of terrestrial objects , and that ardent affection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix itself upon the only perfect Being ; - thus his development is not suspended ; bis advancement , though less apparent , is more real , and less liable to interruptions . His contemplative faculties gain more than his active powers seem to have lost , and bis higher destination may already be manifested in this life . Thus , in old age a more entire disinterestedness , a more constant serenity , an undefinable something of wise , tranquil , and heavenly , seem to surround his venerable brow with the anticipated glory of immortality . Thus are exemplified those beautiful words of Scripture , ' As the outward man decays , the inner man is renewed . ' It is indeed a strong proof of our immortality that this principle of advancement always continues to exist in our soul . And as the action of this principle is necessarily arrested in advanced life only by the decay of corporeal organs , that is to say , by an obstacle which may be presented at any other age , it is clear that the state of decline towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the soul , and that it is no argument against the possibility of an eternal progress in the extent of its faculties . It is true , this progress demands the concun*ence of our own will . Those who do not penetrate beyond the tM ? " /q/ exterior of things , remain during life occupied with vain appearances , and education has not in them accomplished its design . Time not only fails to elevate , but it corrupts them . When this is the case , there will be a perfection of selfishness instead of devout and holy sentiments . Then , the heart becomes more and more withered , and the desires tnore and more debased - the personal happiness to which the egoist had attached every thing escapes from him , since he has become insensible to the noblest enjoyments , and no others continue . For him , old age is tnily desolate . To his terrified imagination death seems indeed the king of terrors , and perhaps even more appalling than annihilation : but it is painful to dwell upon such a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it affords , is to &11; into epicurianism. " - Penelon . To bring up a child , is to place it in a situation to accomplish , in the best manner possible , the destination of its life . But what is the general destination of human life ? Upon the answer to this question , evidently depends the entire direction of education . We are far from having determined this direction , when we say that education has for its end the development of the faculties* this is its work , rather than its end . Education does develop the feiculties : if it proposed to itself nothing else than to give to the pupil the means of existing here below , it would still develop them . At Senegal , as in England , certain qualities are cultivated . but what qualities do they feivor with the preference ? In what sense will be that increase which they would always give to the human faculties ? And as the least difference of proportion in the elements of which we are formed , influences the nature of our moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the destination of a person , in order to decide what he ought to do . The ancients considered happiness the end of human existence . Supreme felicity , was presented to them under forms , sometimes noble , sometimes more or less sensual ; but an idea of seeking it has always existed . Even in our own age the attempt is made to revive this kind of philosophy . Under the equivocal name of utility , some pretend even to consider the desire of happiness the foundation of morality . But the prominent and sublime feature of Christianity , is to have set before man a more elevated object than earthly felicity . What sajrs the Christian religion in its sacred language ? It tells us that , with divine assistance , man can in this life begin to revive in his soul the effaced image of the Crea ' tor ; and that if he complies with the conditions of the gospel , conditions whose performance has a constant tendency to purify his heart , the great atonement offered for his offences , ensures him eternal salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This doctrine is only perfection promised as a reward to those who seek to perfect themselves . An order of ideas so elevated belongs naturally to the source from whence it is derived . We could not ask more from a diviije revelation ; and we ought not to expect less . What is perhaps most astonishing , is , that so many persons of superior talents , virtuous characters , and noble souls as have in all ages honored hmnanity , have not considered that to assign to man happiness for the sole object of his existence upon earth , was to corrupt the moral sentiment in his heart . Indeed , all the attempts to identify felicity and virtue , have not deceived mankind . Neither the noble fiction of the Stoics , that vice alone is an evil , and that grief is not one ; nor the less elevated assertion /q/ of the ' UtiliiarianSt that our duty is always conformed to our interest , can sustain examination . However philosophers may attempt to elevate happiness and lower morality , there is always a difference , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reasoii , experience , cool reflection , the emotions of the heart , all tell us that to satisfy conscience , it is often necessary to renounce the idea of being happy ; they tell us , that if unhappiness is inevitably attached to vice , happiness is not , in this life , always the reward of virtue . It would seem , that such philosophers have taken the means for the end . The desire of happiness is one of the motives which leads us to develop our feculties , and by which we advance towards the true end of our existence . But to understand one of the causes of our actions , is not to know our final destination . A person ignorant of the use of a watch , who should attentively regard the interior of one , might comprehend its mechanism ; he might conceive where resides the moving force , and how it produces action ; but would he know that this complicated work has for its object the measure of time ? This is the secret of the inventor , and a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we pronounce upon the end of human life , while limiting ourselves to consider the mechanism of our actions . But if we view the result to which the course of life will bring us , we see that the supposed end is not accomplished - happiness is not obtained . And , moreover , this is only one of the causes of our actions . Who can deny that the love of right is also a feeling natural to man - that justice and truth seem his element ? What being is so abandoned of Heaven , as not to feel under a moral obligation , as not to know that in this world he has duties to perform ? This is truly a law of /z/ the soul , which is always admitted by the reflecting mind , which , though we may transgress ; we dare not dpny its obligation . The other law is , so to speak , only a physical propensity , like gravitation in dead matter . It is a force which acts upon our senses , upon those of our inclinations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of mtan , consists in the power of resisting this impulsion . But why should we weary ourselves to lay a foundation for morality , by proving its necessity ? Morality ! a universal basis which all suppose , upon which everything rests , without which there would exist , neither society , language , or human beings . What logic is in reasoning , what are the mathematics in the exact sciences , morality is in the system of our existence : primitive truth , co-eternal with God , the expression of his infinite perfections , it is manifested in the works of his hand . Man has received its impress ; its features disfigured , but ineffaceable , always appear in him , notwithstanding his vices , his wanderings , and his false systems . Thus , when Christianity shows him the moral law , most excellent , most holy , and most severe , and at the same time most mercifiil , it is no sooner offered to his view , than he thinks not of it as a discovery , but recognizes it as the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this height , we shall find that common sense commands us not to propose felicity for our object , since we know not what it is . The end and the road which leads to it are equally unknovna , and the very idea of happiness is wholly indefinite . The ancients were never able to agree with regard to the nature of the supreme good ; and perhaps it is not in the power of man to define it . Reason tells us what it ought to be rather than what it really is . Imagination , jnaore fi:ee in its flight , can not /q/ even figure it to itself , with any pennanence ; and when it would represent it , a sort of insipidity is attached to its creations . Experience , so instructive , teaches nothing decisive with regard to it ; for what do fects tell us ? That with every imaginable advantage , a man may yet be very much to be pitied , if he does not possess a certain thing called contentment of mind ; but that is to say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when we wish to define happiness , we are always obliged to have recourse to synonymous terms . If we express ourselves with a severity , which is not much allowed in ordinary usage , we shall perhaps find that there is something false and contradictory in the idea which we are obliged to form of happiness . That it be a situation free from trouble , we do not say ; but , since a desire not satisfied is a trouble which the imagination can magnify at its will , we are obliged to say that it is a state where all our wishes are realized . But , this state would in time become very tedious . There would then be no motive for action , and our powers would remain dormant . We have faculties which require to be exercised , and the office of imagination is to create some desire capable of calling them into action . We are formed , then , to possess desires and wishes ; this is for us the state of moral health . Our souls flow forth in wishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches . There is no happiness without activity , no activity without an end ; and whoever desires an object , desires that which he has not yet obtained . Supreme earthly felicity would then be a state in which we want something , which is absurd . * But if this word has not an absolute sense , it takes one by comparison . Our condition can be improved ; the feeling of existence can be rendered more animated and more agreeable . When does this take place ? It is when /z/ we believe ourselves to be approaching towards the accomplishment of a desired object ; it is when the moral feeling is kept alive by hope . The most desirable objects of that hope contain in themselves the germ of others ; they transport the thought beyond their possession . The learned are intent upon discovering some truth which shall throw light upon a more general truth ; the charitable man sees in the good which he at present dispenses the commencnent of a much greater good . There is always a future in the enjoyments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of having obtained them does not repay for the trouble of seeking them . Happiness , such as we can conceive as existing on earth , is not then a fixed situation ; it is a progress ; it is a state in which a mild and regular excitement is sustained in us by hope . When we advance towards the accomplishment of a well-chosen end , we enjoy in anticipation the moment of its arrival , and at last have the real enjoyment of this moment . But if there does not proceed from that some other interest , some new aliment for the activity of the soul , our situation is not much improved . The art of being happy , is then the airt of dispensing hope through our whole life . The most enviable situation is that in which we have prospectively a succession of ends , all so accessible that we can proceed with calmness and confidence , but of which the most distant are the most worthy of our desires . We then seem to lose none of our steps ; we support cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to our view under a smiling and favorable aspect . It is to be remarked , that the greater part of the occupations of life are formed after such an idea . We see in them an increasing progression , in such goods as riches esteem , glory , and power , which deserve the name of bm /q/ goods , provided they are not esteemed beyond their proper value . And when these occupations are in subordination to the most elevated of all vocations , to that which ofiers the greatest of all possible advantages of progression , the Christian vocation , they undoubtedly present the elements of happiness . But such occupations offer only precarious compiasations , and are not open to all , especiaUy to females ; and as physical nature often proceeds in an inverse progression , passing from evil to evil and from degradation to degradation , it is of infinite importance for the human imagination , which is prone to anticipation to figure to itself a succession of hopes . But if we would obtain contentment , we must not perhaps have happiness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have gathered in their journey through life all the happiness which it can afford - those , I say , have not proposed happiness as their end . They aspired to some object more precise , more definite , to which , if it had been necessary , they would have sacrificed happiness itself It is thus that they proceed on their pathway through life . Not only is the search for happiness illusory , but it retards us in the pursuit of what is valu-able In act the impossibility of forming to ourselves a clear idea of happiness , is the reason that our imagination substitutes pleasure in its stead . We represent it to ourselves as valuable , notwithstanding its fugitive nature : there are in the immense treasures of nature and of art , many things calculated to delight the senses and the heart of man ; but unfortunately , these objects are not always within our reach , and when they are , the pleasure they afford is evanescent , or themselves are perishable . Then the desires most difficult to satisfy , are the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we at last become disgusted with every thing . /z/ Besides , the pursuit of hainness renders us more setia Ue to the evils of life ; since there is a peculiar bitterness in disappointment , inversely proportioned to what we ex* pected . The habit of referring every thing to sel of coih suiting our own desires , is to nourish egoism , that unjust master who is never satisfied with the exertion we make to serve him , and who thus disturbs the whole of our exist* ence . Nothing of an earthly nature , when closely considered , can fully satisfy the soul . The way to increase the grie &; and diminish the pleasures of life , is to keep an account current of both . These considerations are , however , insufficient , and he who should limit himself to them would &il; in justice to the subject . If the search for happiness is idle and vain , it is not for that alone that we should renounce it We do not condemn it as a road which leads to evil , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ought not to be followed . The principle which holds duty in subordina* tion to utility , is bad in itself independently of the conse consequences which result from it . The will of God , or , in other words , the moral law , ought not to occupy a secondary place in our heart ; it claims unbounded empire , and although it be true that we find it our interest to submit to this law , yet we ought not to give this as the motive of our obedience . L us rely upon the disposition of the supreme director ; he has not neglected the care of our happiness . The objects necessary to our preservation and enjoyment , have been spread with profusion throughout the universe : the inclinations which lead us to these objects are deeply rooted in our very constitution . Involuntarily , we desire pleasure , and terrestrial joys : we ought to possess in the will a counterpoise to all these instincts . Otherwise , we should be incapable of resisting them . If I pursue hap- THB DESieN OF KIHTOAtlON. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when k is evidmtly ccmtrary to the spirit of the moral law , am I guihy ? It is said , I kiiow , thatfcn : the desire of haininess merely , it is ofta wise to sacrifice the presait to the future . It is , surely , a very good thing to counsel us to prudence ; but without ration to duty , prudence is a quality of 210 moral value , and is often an obstacle to good as well as to eviL Should we ever know remorse , if we had only to reproach ourselves with havipg neglected our own gratifications , or of having made too low an estimate of the value of pleasure ? Does not an unconquerable feeling tell us that our interest is the only thing which we have a right to sacrifice 9 * Those who wish to give to the system of utility , a char* acter of grandeur and elevation which it does not possess , say , that it is a question of general good , and recommend morality , because it is advantageous to society . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its observance &il; altogether in this doctrine . Once suffer the principle of utility to be , as they would have it , substituted for conscience , and how can we expect an individual to sacrifice himself for the public good ? They may say , that the in* terest of each individual is conformed to that of society : but if we do not believe it , if even , setting conscience aside , we have frequent reason not to believe it , why shall we submit ourselves to their judgment ? They may speak to us of duty ; but if they have set aside conscience , who will listen , or obey them ? No law , but the moral law . * It is certainly questionable how fiir we have a right to sacrifice ourselves . Qod has given to each of his great family the care of one being , that is , of himseland if he neglect this one , or inflict upon him unnecessary pain , or deny him reasonable gratifications , is he not unfaithful to his trust ? To have right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each individual . Ed. /z/ proceeding from God , can be imposed upon us . Howerer imperfect be our nature , an equivocal rule is always repugnant to it . Man is weak , inconsistent , and corrupt , but he has nevertheless an elevated idea of virtue , and if the divine light is little manifested in his conduct , we do see it shine forth in the loftiness of his conceptions . Is it then true , as is pretended , that the two opinions upon the end of human life , apparently so contrary , are , in reality only the same opinion , and that they both have happiness for their final end ? Is it true that those who have for their object virtue , or perfection , only prefer one kind of enjoyment to another ? It is always easy to confound things ; but it appears to me that those who reason thus , have not been ' close observers of human nature . Without dwelling upon the grand examples which history afibrds , without citing those devoted heroes who have had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than death , I would say , that the attentive examination of what passes even in our own souls will lead us to another conclusion . I do not apprehend that when a person enters upon a career of painful duties , he forms to himself clearly , one joy in the future . He submits to an obligation without appeal ; he obeys an imperious law , without thinking whether any happiness will ensue . The calm region of duty is superior to that of hopes and fears ; there are not felt those fluctuations , which are the effect of the unequal appreciation of pains and pleasures ; all is constant , absolute , and of an enduring nature : - it is not the enjoyments of virtue , which the good seek , but virtue ; it is not the consolations of religion that they desire , but God himself and in conformity to His will . This region which seems so elevated , is yet accessible to souls which are strangers to all the refinements of philosophy and learning , lyhile THB OF BDUOATXOir. 53 tluit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much less accessible ; for ; to find a charm in the idea of selMevotion , requires a kind of elevation rarely found among* men , and inconstant even in those who are susceptible of experiencing it The great and sublime notions excited by the most elevated sentiments , do not &11; to the share of all mortals ; age weakens them , misfortimes destroy them : they may be the reward , they are not the pure , and unalterable essence , of attachment to our duty . In thus world such sentiments are connected with enthiisiasm ; in heaven they will be calm and lasting . We must now return to the double nature of man . The contradictory results which are offered in the complex study of the human heart , can never be explained , if we do n ( admit that we are actuated by more than one motive . And since in the physical world all is opposition of forces , why should we expect to find in the moral world but one principle 1 There are in us two laws , as St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reason , bear witness to the same . While some instincts , necessary perhaps in the physical order , but blind , and urging us forward in pursuit of pleasure , develop our Acuities , we feel that our feculties , and even life are only designed to elevate us to a superior situation , and to restore degraded humanity to its primitive rank . To say that religion itself proposes in the fiiture , eternal liappiness for our object , would be to enter upon an order *f thoughts entirely different On this occasion , as in others , the sacred writers have employed the received expression , and the reason of this is obvious , since all the ideas which they give of future rewards , are necessarily connected in our mind , with great happiness . The'senti- * Romans vi . 23. // ment of existence , is so sweet , that immortality , joined to an exemption from the disquietudes and evils of life , must appear to us a very happy condition . But in the imperfect images which direct our hope , the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a more pure and elevated state , always does .

All this seems to be encumbering Mental Philosophy with useless and absurd distinctions . Matter is one thing ; mind , spirit , or soul is another . Respecting the latter , we know only its operations , and surely these operations do not of themselves constitute a new class of substances .

The poet who exclaims , * Mirid alone , bear witness eartljL and heaven 1 The living fountains , in itself , contains of Beauteous and Sublime , ' seems to be ftdly of opinion that there is nothing more spiritual and more elevated than the mind itself . Returning then to the Author 's expression , * the mind rises towards truth , ' or we would substitute for mind , understanding , cjmidering the three understanding , imagination and conscience as orders of the mental facilities which constitute the mind . En. // The desire fir perfection , is that which education ought assiduously to cherish . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sacred task . And as the greatest degree of happiness with a rational being can only be found in the path of his true destination , instructors will just so much better attend to the interests of happiness , as they will cause to prevail over the other desires of the pupil that of becoming perfect Education ought then to be suited to our double destination ; it ought to prepare the child for two successive existences . Behold an inunortal mind , which is here to be fitted for eternity , and a weak creature , sent into the world to suffer and to die 1 The constitution of our nature is adapted to these two conditions . The soul has faculties fitted for its abode on earth , and it possesses those which bear its views and hopes beyond it . Both ought to be developed by education . Since it is not the will of Grod to call us immediately to himself , and as he has obliged us to seek him in our journey through life , it is the duty of the instructor to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that life is a voyage , that it is only the swift progress towards eternity , is an idea which ought to be attached to every period of our existence ; it is what should always be kept in view , and what , in my opinion , is not sufficiently expressed in the various definitions usually given of education . It is supposed to consist in bringing the youth to a certain state , rather than in implanting a disposition , which shall make him , at a future day infinitely surpass that state ; and yet , as the greatest moral and intellectual development , in childhood , is nothing , compared to what we expect in mature age , it is much more essential to give it this disposition . The progress already made is of much less importance than an inclination to make further progress ; so that it is less necessary /q/ to inquire with regard to the degree of advancement which the child has already made than with regard to the disposition it manifests for the future . The nearer a pupil approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or religion , the more easily can he persuade himself that he has nothing more to acquire upon these subjects , and may relax his efforts , thus stopping at mediocrity , unless some new stimulus , is added to renew his vigor . This is why so many educations , apparently well conducted , produce insignificant results . This is the reason why so many minds disappoint our expectations . When there is no internal excitement , all very soon withers and fells to decay . Not to increase , is to decrease ; not to advance , is to go back ; thus is it with human nature . If there is within us , a principle of restoration , there is also a principle of decay . We must exert ourselves , in order that we do not descend , and this cai ; i be done only by endeavoring to rise . According to Kant , the end of education would be this : * to develop in the individual all the perfection of which he is susceptible . But as such a work can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement the entire existence , I would propose a slight change of this fine definition : to give to the pupil the will and the means of arriving at the perfection of which he will one day he susceptible .. This supposes in the instructor some idea of the perfection to which he may aspire , and , moreover , a knowledge of the causes which act upon the will . This will be the subject of the following chapters . /z/ PERFECTION . ( GeNESIs ) SYMBOLS OF THE MOST HIGH /z/ Perfection , that noble end of education , of life , is not to be found upon earth any more than happiness ; but we are much less liable to wander in its search . Even while ignorant of its nature , we can always approach nearer to it , since the road which leads there is well marked. * And , if in proportion as we advance our strength increases , i ( we soon gain a better climate , and breathe a purer air , we shall not fail on our journey , of either encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what we wish to obtain ; and what idea can we form of perfection , since we have never found it , and even our imagination can not clearly , represent it to us ? How can we do this , as , in examining each object , we judge it constantly inferior to that veiled image , which seems to us to soar above ourselves , and all things about us ? This judgment can only be the result of a comparison , for winch we seem to /z/ PBftTSCTION 8H0ULB Bl AIMID AT : 59 tvaat one of the terms . Some general considerations will perhaps aid us in the elucidation of this question . We do not inquire here with regard to that sovereign perfection which is caBed ah$olnte to show that it is susceptible of no more increase , an idea which can only be understood to apply to God . Indeed , the excellence which seems to us to constitute perfection , is of a nature to increase without limit . Whatever grandeur may be assigned to intelligence , strength , and beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in the region of infinity , that human thought loses itself , and perceives there can be nothing greater or more perfect . It is then relative perfection only which we have to consider . In this life an object is accoimted perfect when it is what it should be ; that is to say , when it Mly answers its destination . At the moment of creation , the Almighty assigned to each of his works its destination , and in this sense , all beings , which answer to . the views of God are perfect . Yet as some are endowed with properties or Acuities , of which others are destitute , there appears to us a sort of hierarchy , among created beings . We attribute to them a rank proportioned to the grandeur of the quali. ties which they display , or to the importance of their destination , and this rank seems to determine the degree of their relative perfection . Yet it is not always easy to estimate this degree ; it would be necessary for us to know the grand outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what pkii each object ought to occupy , the lijik which connects it to other objects , and the qualities which these relations demand* The contemplation of nature , doubtless reveals to us some of the designs of God . We see the heavenly bodies accomplish their revolutions in fixed periods , - the seasons succeed each other regularly , the various species of plants and animals maintained and perpetuated , - order , motion . /z/ and life , preserved throughout the universe . The whole is too regular , the dependence of the parts too intimate for the perfection of the who Je , not to answer to that of the parts . But how are our vague ideas irom the exact knowledge even of each piece of the grand mechanism . Not only are we without any ideas of what nature ought to be , but we can not distinguish exactly what it is , when presented to us in reality . Our superficial observation stops before it arrive ? at the essence of bodies ; and one of the most interesting of all subjects , the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We imagine however that we discover gradually the perfection of the works of God ; but we can not judge of them ; his works , as well as himself , surpass in every respect , our narrow views , and we can only approach the vestibule of his conceptions . But when called to appreciate the works of man , the same disproportion does not exist . There the artist and the judge are upon a level , and the one has no feculty foreign to the other . Yet even here , the uncertainty of our ideas coniiises us ; and we know not clearly enough what ought to be , to pronounce respecting what is . We understand in general what effect an artist has wished to produce , but we are ignorant whether he has taken the best means to succeed . We review his plan , we remodel it in our mind ; and only perceive the defects of our inventions , when we come to put our theory in practice . But , through the darkness which obscures our mental vision , . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first idea of the workmen , and another in the execution of the work ; such are the sources of imperfection profusely spread over human productions . If we wish to remove at least one of these sources , we must leave the region of the fine arts , and enter the humble /q/ domain of mechanical arts . There , in the representation of geometrical figures , which answer to the most precise notions of our mind , we can be sufficiently near to see perfection realized . If , for example , I demand of a workman to construct for me , in metal or ivory , a sphere , a cylinder , or a cube , as I well know what I have in view , if the execution of that object is regular , I have nothing more to desire . Nicer organs than mine , would perhaps find defects in them , but as I am formed , I do not see them , and I pronounce the work to be perfect . A decision so favorable , leaves me , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only the character of approbation , unaccompanied with admiration . But in this inferior perfection , we can seize upon the most important element in the idea of perfection . In all which fells under the province of judgment , reason ought to give its full and entire approbation . And , as there are some qualities which reason has a right to require in all objects , as she very well knows in what these qualities consist , and as the notions which she has of them , without attaining altogether to mathematical precision , are among the number of those most clear to our mind , it is essential that relatively to those at least the conformity of what is , with what ought to be , should be complete . ' Thus in material works , the adaptation of means to an end , the just proportion and intimate connexion of parts , the duration , and utility of the object are among the number of obligatory conditions . There are qualities correspondent to them in the moral domain ; so that if we give the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to our notions of order , and which are to be judged by reason , we shall say that regularity is the first and indispensable element of perfection . But this element is. not the only one ; there is another , which , wherever it can be found , is equally necessary . /z/ // Perfection , in itself , supposes a combination of all excel* lencies , and there are kinds of merit which judgment alone does not appreciate . All is not reason in man ; feeling , and imagination , have their rights . We wish to admire ; we cherish this sweet and gand emotion , and beauty is the natural subject of admiration . We desire both moral and physical beauty , and when the obligations imposed by duty are fulfilled , we then ask for these . Here , is presented an element , infinite by its nature , constantly susceptible of a greater degree of development And from this it arises , that our desires are insatiable , and that the only perfection which can satisfy them , seems always to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , or which at least has never yet been solved . We have never discovered the common characteristic of the various objects which excite our admiration . They charm and &scinate; us , they suspend for a moment the monotonous course of our existence , they transport us beyond the earth and from ourselves . The effect which they produce upon lis sometimes unites them in our thoughts ; but the link is not hi them , it is in our soul . What resemblance can we find between what are the most simple of all things , a brilliant or delicate color , and a melodious sound , and the immense complication of objects , which the magnificent aspect of nature presents to us ? And yet the rapid and fugitive impression of such a color and such a sound , as well as the more permanent effect of a landscape , obliges us to exclaim , It is beautiful ! What is this power of moving our souls possessed by terrestrial things ? What is this indefinable charm , mjrsterious blessing of our existence ? Is it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celestial splendor , an echo of the harmony above ? Is it an impulse given to the soul , destined hereafier to contemplate infinite beauty ? /q/ And this rapture mingled with a soft melancholy , is its use to remind us that we are only pilgrims on eardi- There is in this a proof of goodness which we can not misunderstand . In order to distinguish ideas often confused , we observe that regularity is not a condition necessary to beauty . It becomes such if we require perfect beauty ; but then the idea is not the most simple , and we form perfection by combining the two elements which constitute it . But if we seek to separate them , in taking for the sole character oi beauty , the power of exciting admiration , we see that the sentiment can be more easily inspired . A child is presented to our view , and we are charmed with its dazzling complexion , and the brilliancy of its eyes , while perhaps its features will not sustain examination . The finest points of view in nature present nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is represented by dity , how many actions which are not conformed to this rule excite our approbation J A mother precipitates herself into h &; waves to perish with her drowning child : such a devotion appears to us noble ; our feeelings compel us to say it , and yet if she was the only support of an aged parent , she has done wrong . An heroic courage , the generous exaltation of the most tender affections , have often produced sacrifices , which , though an austere morality would condemn , yet ip which an idea of beauty is invincibly attached . From this firuitful source , spring the arts ; and when they add their enchanting illusions to a charm already too powerful , they raise to enthusiasm the admiration which certain acts excite in us . Self-devotion is a principle common to all dazzling actions . This seems to lead me to form some idea of perfection . In point of regularity , reason is the supreme judge , and reason knows what she wishes . She seeks to find qualities of which she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself no object which combines these &#9632; iflii ' // qualities , she can in each real object deny or affirm the existence of them . This is a simple act of judgment , of which the most dull imaginations are capable . The case is not the same , with regard to the other element . We can not define precisely beauty in the physical order ; and in the moral order , we kiiow better what are the qualities deserving of our esteem , than the vivid emotion to which the name of admiration is attached . It seems , in truth , that the sacrifice of one 's self is the general character , which presents the most sublime examples . But if this enters necessarily into the idea of moral beauty , it is nevertheless insufficient to constitute it entirely , since a devotion which should be only afi effect of weakness or habit , would affect us but little : thus there always remains something unknown to discover . The pleasure attached to admiration , is not , then , owing entirely to the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can clearly explain , but is owing rather to the flight of our most elevated facuhies . The idea of beauty once enkindled in the bosom of man , the emotions are warmed , and imagination spreads her wings . Then it is no more real qualities which the mind contemplates , but lively , animated representations , clothed with colors more brilliant than those of reality . When the wonders of the arts , the master-pieces of genius , or the splendid endowments of one of our fellow-mortals excite in us lively emotions , they eflfect a development in our own soul , and the enchantment which we experience is perhaps less connected with the object of our admiration than with the charms of a new beauty which they have served to reveal to us . Thus , while they have at first surpassed our expectation , we soon discover defects in them , because they are far from equalling the ideal model formed in our mind . The nearer these terrestrial things approach perfection , the more elevated becomes the idea of perfection . The elements of /q/ which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an harmonious whole , and even the conditions which reason requires seem to add to beauty . This is equally applicable to education . In proposing to form the character of the creature called man , instructors have to execute a work which they should seek to render perfect . They must not then lose sight of the two conditions necessary to form perfection . Reason , severe in her exactions , can define what she has a right to demand . She wishes a useful member of society , of the state and of the family ; a man who attends to his own interest without injuring that of others , and who assists them as &r; as he is able ; an enlightened man , who contributes to the progress of knowledge , and civilization ; and who shows himself the advocate of religion , as well as a defender of morality . Behold the man modelled by reason . He will never be discovered in fiiult : we shall always approve his conduct , but we do not go so &r; as to admire him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no other title to our esteem than his well-regulated conduct What is there then to regret in the original of such a portrait ? What can be wanting to it ? It lacks moral beauty : that element which expands the soul , which betrays in man the immortal being . Indications apparently very slight , can serve to discover to us modes of existence very different . He within whom rules the active principle of moral beauty , will distinguish himself little in his actions , from the man Otherwise accomplished to whom this element is wanting . The first will be wise like the other , but his wisdom will have the air of inspiration ; he will observe rule , like the other , but without thinking always that he does observe it : indeed it would seem rather that a happy harmony unites his feelings to his duty : thus we shall always approve him , but a more lively sympathy will draw us nearer him /z/ and , by a singular contrast , we shall feel him more like ourselves , more our brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a look , will be sufficient to establish between him and ourselves a rapid electric communication ; * we know him before he acts ; we know that upon the first signal , he will fly to the relief of suffering humanity ; we shall find him in the day of misfortime . Whence then proceed these impressions so different ? Is there a real cause for the almost opposite feelings which these two beings excite in my mind ? Yes , there is one ; I believe the one capable of devotion , and I strongly doubt that the other is . Without the power of devotion there is no moral beauty . Nothing noble or great can exist on earth , without the powerful feeling which raises man above himself , which devotes him to an object worthy of his love , and , rendering him superior to the timid instincts of nature , seems to raise him above the limits set to humanity . When this living , expansive principle of moral beauty is wanting , man possesses but a cold merit , a precise regularityj the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afiects us little . It recalls to us the cube , * What mind above the common mass of cold and heartless beings has not felt this kindling of its best emotions , when accidental collision with a kindred mind has elicited a sudden flash of feeling 1 In the circles of fashion this is perhaps a rare phenomenon ; for we do not here refer to a transient admiration , or that of sentiment which evaporates as soon as expressed ; but we mean that union of soul which sometimes takes place between kindred minds , in whom the finest feelings of nature , instead of being blasted by a servile devotion to low and worldly objects , have been cherished by the consideration of the high hopes anddestiny of man , and a life consecrated to noble thoughts and pursuits . When such beings meet , they will at once feel and understand the tie which exists between them ; if this be true with respect to those influenced by moral virtue only , hoW much more so of the disciples of Jesus ! Ed. /z/ /q/ 6r the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us that this is not the perfection &r; man . Yet when regard for order and rule is carried so far as to give him who experiences it the power of sacrificing all to his duty , we may ask if we do not find in his devotion the principle of moral beauty , and if he does not exhibit the most elevated perfection ? Without doubt he will present a spectacle worthy to be admired ; he will realize stoicism , the sublime conception of ancient times , which has never been entirely foreign to great and generous souls : but it is upon universal sentiments that education should be founded , not upon a rare enthusiasm . The virtue and perfection which such a system supposes , are the noblest of human conceptions , but they are of an abstract nature . The most excellent qualities should be presented to us in a real object , in order to take consistence and life , and if that object is not God , it will be self . ' Here is a constant source of deception . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self which we worship , when we imagine we only honor virtue ; so that the worship which seems the most pure , often degenerates insensibly , into homage to our own merit Selfishness and pride , are almost inevitable with the being who has not consecrated his life to an object superior to himself But , what is the object worthy to become the supreme object of man ! s desires ? What is . it which can satisfy wishes so boundless ? There is but one such subject Perfection is in God only , or , rather , it is Grod himself - God considered in his moral attributes . Mortal eyes have been allowed to contemplate his sublime image . The divine majesty has appeared in the Saviour of the world , veiled under the most lovely features of humanity . And when the splendor of celestial endowments is joined to the touching character of devotion , we not only admire . /z/ but love 80 perfisct a model ; an infinite gratitude fills our heart with a desire of imitation . Such is the power of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which raises him above himself and the individual can henceforth advance towards perfection . /z/ s /z/ " Education should be displayed in the external appearance of the individual . " - J. P. Richter . Among human enterprizos , there are few which resemble that of education . The weakness of human nature presents an obstacle to the accomplishment of good , both in the instructor and in the pupil - in the workman , and in the substance wrought upon . We are there restrained upon all sides in the display of our zeal , and even in the flight of our imagination , since the point is not to create , but to direct a development , which is often slow in its progress . Ideal perfection would demand that the work once accomplished , this development should be complete ; that the noble attributes of humanity should be exhibited in the pupil in all their excellence : but this is what we dare not hope . There are limits imposed by nature upon the individual , as there are those enjoined by the social order upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual in early life 1 Faculties of different degrees of elevation , more or less susceptible of progress . Their extension and proportions are little known to us ; but what we perceive of them , does /z/ not answer to our wishes . Yet there is one method better than any other to pursue in the direction of these endowments . It is important to produce a combination so happy that these elements of unequal force shall be in equilibrium , and that the conditions imposed by religion and society may be filled . From this arises a kind of peculiar perfection for each pupil , and , when it is necessary to imagine , in anticipation . The instructor should have in view , a certain whole which he has never seen , but of which the child itself , in its most agreeable and interesting moments , gives him by degrees the idea . That harmonious agreement which is presented by all parts of the works of nature , man was doubtless designed to offer ; it seems yet to reign in early infancy , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we are far from having attained , as experience but too plainly shows . When we observe the generality of men , we feel that they are not what they might have become . Do they possess eminent qualities ? we perceive with so much the more pain certain defects which form with them a shocking contrast , and which seem scarcely to belong to the real character . The exclamation . What a pity ! often escapes in speaking of those whom we most admire ; and perhaps it may in certain cases be applied to every one . On the contrary , if we observe narrowly less gifted beings , we find them not so fer in the back ground as we at first supposed . They always possessed some talent ; a particular aptitude to fill certain situations , and where they experience a tender or generous emotion , we perceive sudden flashes , which discover to us the kind of merit or perfection , which they might have possessed . They seem to be fruits of natural endowments , which have not been brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have exhibited a more finished model /q/ But it is above all in regarding ourselves , that we are inclined to cherish these sentiments . Self-love , so often nndeceived by the realities of life , considers the excellence of our natural talents . We were made to be better , we think , but circumstances have not &vored; us , and our own efforts have been weak or inconstant . What there is true in this respect , &vors; an illusion which is dear to us , and we constantly regret some lost superiority , some brilliant display of our &culties; which we have not been able to make . These thoughts were fiuniliar to the ancients , of which the worship they rendered to their good genius is a proof They saw in that supernatural being a kind of image of their own person , a better self released from the shackles of humanity , and designed to lead them by the hand through life . This being became the object of their warm afction : they invoked it , they offered it sacrifices , and to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions , they came to consult it , it was as an appeal to what was most pure and most elevated in themselves . This fiction exhibits the genius of Paganism : wherever we meet with it , we find there the characteristics of such a system - the deification of nature , considered as especially connected with each individual . It was also a species of God which the ancients sought to form in their sage . Their religion lowered the character of divinity in order to elevatethat of man . Yet the feble of the good genii presents itself under an iirteresting form . In attributing a celestial type to the individual , it inspires a certain respect for the himian form ; it imparts a sacredness and relief to the distinctive traits of each individual . It suggests to us a sentiment which should not be a stranger to our hearts . If the same creative hand , which has so magnificently diversified Its // productions in the universe , has stamped upon each human being a peculiar character , then this character offers to us something sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the instructor should endeavor to preserve it . To discover how the greatest possible perfection may be given to the decided original bent of the mind , should be the object of his exertions . It is indeed when he reaches this point , that man exercises the most power , that his qualities are most imposing , and that he accomplishes great things , with the least effort . It is here that a happy agreement is found between his sentiment and his conduct , his words and the expression of his physiognomy and his voice . If we recal to our thoughts the most lively impressions we have received , if we revive our most agreeable and dear remembrances , they will transport us to the moment when a being whom we admire has ' seemed to reveal his entire existence to us by a word , a gesture , or a look , which could belong only to himself It is not always by his excellencies , it is perhaps even , by his eccentricities , that a distinguished man captivates our heart and delights our imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strongly marked impression of originality , found with those who have rendered themselves illustrious by their virtues , or by the difficult enterprizes which they have accomplished . It is often manifested in early infiincy , and when this is the case , it points out to education an important duty . It is the proof of a vigorous cast of character , and of a moral health .. When nature is constrained or checked , it is certain that a wrong course is pursued with the subject of education . It is , however , of importance to stop at the precise point This jfine expression of countenance is an advantage which should be preserved when it exists , and not procured by art /q/ It is the effect of certain happy endowments , which , in manifesting themselves , should he seen in harmony with truly solid qualities . Their development is always earliest , hecause this is the course of nature ; hut the progress of other qualities should advance sufficiently near , that they may support and fell in with the general character . K this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities must remain dormant , if we can not hope that the whole moral being will increase together , it is better to repress a peculiarity which would produce no salutary result . The efforts of education should then be entirely directed to the weak side . This seems to be a point upon which there is little agreement Parents are tempted to take advantage of the dominant quality ; they fear- to produce in the mind of the pupil a certain level which is frequently met with in very ordinary men . But with those this level , perhaps , has been the triumph of education ; without it they might have been as destitute of judgment , as they now are of genius . When once the great foundations are laid , and the internal equilibrimn solidly established , peculiar tastes may be indulged ; but in childhood good proportions are all-important Even genius bears its first fruits only in a wellregulated myid . Without effacing , therefore , the predominant trait of character , we should seek to make it harmonize with all the others . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fatiguing to be obliged to stimulate dull faculties , that a teacher sometimes allows himself to be entirely led by any thing promising in the materials which he has to operate upon ; and , as these are materials which are easily moulded into any form , a serious evil results . Thus , one pupil is all memory , another all imagination . This is the consequence of great mistakes in education . The same /z/ // may be said of the employment of certain principles , as self-love , or an acute sensibility . These are good auxiliaries for education , only when they are in a state of activity ; but it is precisely then that it is dangerous to excite them . To exercise constantly the preponderating force , and suflfer others to lie dormant , is to add more and more to the moral disproportion . The weakness of indispensable faculties , such for example , as reason , frequently imposes upon us the duty of checking the progress of certain other powers , and of early limiting the extent of the mental development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the soul be general , that all the faculties advance side by side , and yet each should be exercised separately , in order that their different degrees of strength may be tested . An attentive examination of the springs which act upon the young mind , is indispensable ; for when results only are considered , we are always in danger of being misled . I would remark here , that religion , which ought to be the centre , or as the common trunk of the various branches of education , can also furnish , at each era , the precise point where certain development should cease . When the growth of a particular faculty is too rapid for the general character , the pupil delighting in its exercise , is excessively pleased with any trifling success which it procures him , and infellibly prides himself in it . He knows no longer how to distinguish true excellence , and the only progress of importance , that of the soul , interests him no more . Then religious feeling chills in his heart , the sense of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his own talents , leads him to despise those of his equals . Thus , far from truly expanding , his spirit becomes contracted , and the acquisitions at the surfece , serve only to conceal the poverty at the foundation . The love of God , and of our neighbor , these two grand characteiisdca /q/ of Christianity , are only in &Uible; proofs of the success of education in all its different stages . They are themselves a beautiiiil and harmonious development of our immortal nature , and thus they have been made to form the principal trait of the divine model which the Gospel presents to the imitation of men . But when these sentiments are exhibited by the pupil , where they grow with his growth , and appear as the very soul of his conduct , then the progress of his mind in other respects should be accelerated . Education can not give too much force to the various feculties of the mind . The most powerful of these feculties will be , in its hands , the best instruments for the execution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of intentions , so the development of the understanding alone yes the hope that good intentions will be accomplished . This may be verified in all the conditions of life . Education is doubtless obliged to recognize great dififerences of situation among men : not only does necessity force it to do so , but it is also reasonable , since there is in society a degree of perfection peculiar to each rank and condition . If there is an harmony to be established in the mind of the individual , there is one to be established between this individual and its destination on earth . A happy agreement of the sentiments , opinions , and tastes , with habitual occupation , facilitates the observance of the duties and-the enjoyment of the pleasures attached to each situation . It is not then proper that the faculties be stimulated beyond the point where they find in real life a natura and regular exercise . From birth there is a scale of development suited to the various conditions of life ; but in the most humble conditions , education has always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of cultivation to the understanding . There is a primary degree of instruction which is the natural right of each being , and of which no child should be deprived . /z/ For a Christian , not to know how to read that divine law which he believes he can not violate without hazarding his salvation ; for a man liable to be brought before tribunals , to be unable to read those human laws which may condemn him to death ; for him who gives or receives promises , not to be in a situation to give them validity by writing ; for one who labors for wages , not to be capable of calculating what he has power to claim , - is to be ignorant of the conditions to which existence itself is attached , and in some cases to be deprived of the means of performing these jonditions . These several incapacities throw incertitude upon human conduct in the various relations ; they banish security ; they oblige an unfortunate being to grope in midnight darkness , darkness which is often peopled with phantoms ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of his reason , his justice and his good feelings , they often destroy the effecJt of the finest endowments of nature . Indeed the state of ignorance which is thought to be accompanied by innocence and happiness , - in the entire absence of civilization , becomes daily more melancholy and more dangerous in our European society . The idea of a situation so deplorable , the common lot of a multitude of men who possess nothing which they can call their own ; this idea , I say , is a constant appeal to the charity of the Christian , to the solicitude of the philosopher . The education of the indigent Qlass is as important to the other classes as to themselves , since education is the only certain mean of influencing morality , and of ruling by the curb of duty those upon whom it is not always easy to impose others . And let it not be supposed that a feeble glimpse of religion , such as is sometimes given to the ignorant , is sufficient . The incoherence and coniusion of ideas of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region of /q/ religion also , causing the most dreadful superstition . This is but too perfect a picture of the condition of the poor classes in certain countries . And , to answer by a . single feet the objections of those who are not in favor of establishments for the instruction of the people , I would say , that in England and Scotland , the public registers have proved that the number and importance of crimes have diminished in the exact proportion of the multiplication of schools . It would seem that governments , deeply interested as they are in the maintenance of order and prosperity in society , ought to be affected with these considerations ; but in waiting for this , the efforts of charity should not be paralyzed ; individual activity can , in its sphere , produce much good . In elevated social positions , there is a natural magistracy which enlightened men can exercise . Our age seems already to feel it ; the duty of imparting a primary degree of instruction to the indigent , seems already to be legibly inscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented for perseverance in this undertaking . Before the influence of education has yet penetrated the mass , it can , in the elevated classes , form those capable of seconding this grand motion of the public mind , the result of Christianity , and an advanced civilization. * &#9830; No where has the truth that misery and vice most frequently proceed from ignorance , been demonstrated with so much force as in the writings of Dr Chalmers , the greatest religious genius of our church , and one of the most enlightened men of his age . The seal of the Christian , joined to the science of the economist , have conducted him to the true theory of the art so little known , that of relieving indigence : he has seen that the only way to succeed in doing this is to elevate the morals . The enemy of all abrupt change , he has found , and put in practice the means of delivering his country /z/ In the superior ranks . of society , the work of education thus becomes one of imposing grandeur . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance proportioned to the influence which he can exercise . There , when no defect in the character or in the mind opposes itself , the entire accomplishment of the divine will requires the free exercise of the most elevated faculties of the soul . It is not only enjoined upon man to do good , but to do all the good possible . How will he succeed in doing this , without making every exertion in his power - without calling into action that understanding , that power of invention , that facility in acquiring new ideas , with which he has been endowed by his Creator ? Talent should not be buried - light ought not to be put under a bushel ; - these are terms of the divine law. * Indeed , whatever species of good we desire to effect , knowledge is necessary . It is necessary to enable us to combat in this world that ever-growing principle of evil , immorality ; and it is necessary to enable us to relieva all kinds of misery ; - men in the same situation , and animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their fellow-creatures in the exact proportion of their from the scourge of the poor taxes , the assistance of which only produces ingratitude , and redoubles the misery of those to whom it is imparted . Persuaded that public charities are rarely exempt from inconvenience , he regards the education of the indigent , as the most certain and useful work of beneficence . A translation of the periodical work of Dr. Chalmers , ( Christian and Civil Economy of Great Towns , ) would be very instructive for the continent . Ed. * The passages of Scripture , which some strangely suppose contradict this clear injunction , have often been misunderstood ; they regard religion itself , the homage of the spirit ; they teach a great truth ; it is , that Grod should not be sought by means of efforts or subtilties of the mind , and that the way to go to him is open to all his creatures . Ed. rrSB MEVECTION OF OUR NATURE CONSIDERED . 79 capacity . We have need of a certain expansion of mind to possess influence , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thus with those who hold the first stations in society , with those who move the two great levers in civilization , legislation and public instruction , none will dispute . Neither do these obligations cease among those in a more private condition . The chief of a work-shop or of a counting-house , a great landed proprietor , or the fether of a family , all have need of an enliyhtened reason to aid , console , and instruct their subordinates . All knowledge , all talent , extends the sphere of our power , gives us the means of acting upon a greater number of minds , and through these upon others also : thus the movement of one beneficent soul may be propagated and communicated ' to multitudes , along with the knowledge and instruction which have emanated from the same source . Nothing which is innocent should be withheld from the being whom education aspires to form . He partakes all interests with which the destiny of his equals is connected . The mechanical and mental arts , industry , agricul ure , commerce , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will seem to him but the necessary result of the development of our faculties . Society , with the different destinations of man , represents to him the soul and its various attributes ; it is , as it were , the relief of it ; and in this enlarged image of himself , the Christian also recognizes that of God . This also he . seeks to rid of the impure alloy which corrupts it , and to restore to its primitive beauty . The task of becoming perfect , which is imposed upon him , does not seem limited to himself . He exerts himself also for those by whom he is surrounded , but with wisdom ; and , availing himself of what is best in the character of our age , he thinks that those classes of society , to whom Heaven has given knowledge and leisure , are made for the instructors of the others . /z/ Such in independently of the peculiar direction which the genius of the individual must determine - such is the disposition which education should seek to communicate , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary , as I have before said , that each pupil possess the means and the will to continue to perfect himself . The means will consist in the commencement of a development during infency ; since the will being supposed , one degree of progress facilitates the highest ulterior progress at which we aim ; but the most essential point , is the formation of the will ; this remains to be considered . /z/ " Our daily avocation , is to become stronger than ourselves . " - Imitation of Christ . It is with timidity that I approach this subject ; but , without hoping coiiildeiitly to remove the great difficulty of education and of life , it is of importance that we should examine that which meets us at every step . How shall we attempt to educate human beings , without examining the spring which moves them to action ? And if we can obtain nothing from intelligent creatures without the participation of their will , the smallest portion of light upon the means of influencing it can not be without importance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to education , if we have not at least reflected upon that , which deserves , before all else , to be considered . Will , mysterious force ! powerful endowment , which seems alternately granted and withdrawn from man ! Why does it often languish inactive , and then revive again in our breasts ? How , to a state of apathy , does it cause suddenly to succeed one of activity ? How , after having been lately tossed by the waves of our contradictory , /z/ ephemeral , half-formed desires , are we as a vessel driving before the wind , and flying across the seas and through tempests to the place of destination ? The weakness and wanderings of the will seem to be attached to our nature . The effects of this evil may be restrained and moderated , but must in some degree continue to exist . On one side , the power of education in this respect is limited ; on the other , it does not make all the use of it which it might . Its duties here seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to exalt and support it , if possible , where it may reign over the desires , finding in their strength , sometimes obstacles and sometimes aids , but never a power which subjugates it . Again ; as the wiU , independently of its strength , should have a determined character and follow a regular course ; it can not display itself in acts without having to do with the inclinations of the heart ; as moreover it is certeiin that we often feel it decided by the various motives which it may govern , education ought , in the second place to give to the pupil the sentiments , tastes , and even the habits , which will exercise the most salutary influence upon the will , and which , in the moments when it is the least capable of effort , will impress a happy direction upon the conduct . Finally ; since notwithstanding the most assiduous cares , the weakness , the apathy , shall I say the momentary depravation of the will , is more or less clearly manifested in real life , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pupil the way to that high source , where the soul can become renewed and acquire new vigor . I shall speak successively of these three duties . The will , considered with regard to its strength , independently of its education , receives the appellations of firmness , energy , and constancy . It is , as it were , tho /q/ degree of life , the quantity of moral existence which each being possesses ; it is that which gives weight to his words , to his actions , to his very silence ; which renders him the object of an esteem , of a love , sometimes of a fear proportioned to the idea of a power which he possesses . What inequalities do we find in this respect among beings otherwise equal 1 Why , without having yet put them to the proof ) do they produce so different effects upon us ? Whence come those views of others which often exercise a great influence over our conduct , while no distinct thought has revealed to us our motives 1 Is it in the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? However this may be , it appears certain that it is very easy for them to diminish it : it is perhaps in this respect that we commit the most faults ; one of the most essential objects is one most neglected . Unfortunately , education almost entirely tends to weaken firmness of character : it is most frequently , to say the truth , only a system of means to weaken the will . Per- . suasive and insinuating , it hinders its formation ; severe and inflexible , it causes it to bend or break . It aims at the contraction of good habits , and the peculiar property of habit is to cause actions without the concurrence of the will . Here education is aided by the imitative instinct which produces an effect similar to that of a habit . Too often , in order to accomplish the object , deception is re . sorted to - the most pernicious of all examples , not only as respects morality , but energy . Is it tten that mankind do not know the value of energy ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us its imporWce . Whatever may have been our actions , our feeling upon this point is unanimous ; - if weak , we wish the support of energy ; if strong , we despise one who does not possess it . Perhaps we in reality , value this quality above all others . Without it , morality seems to us only a good /z/ intention , which is of little value ; we feel but little admiration of devotion , when it proceeds from weakness of character ; and if we sometimes hesitate to pay homage to brilliant talents , it is because we have too often seen them separated from firmness of character . Yet , whatever may be the importance of this quality , the reason that instructors have not favored its development is very simple ; it is because they always find it an obstacle in education . All which they desire to give to the child , - knowledge , application , wisdom , generosity , and good manners , require the continual sacrifice of th will . To diminish the energy of this fecuhy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often take it without thinking of doing so . Perhaps if we were aware of it , we should proceed in the same manner . While the wanderings of the will are always to be feared , while we are far and very far from being certain with regard to the direction of it , how can we seriously labor to give it a strength which can only increase the danger ? Education should , I think , value its resources sufficiently not to fear beforehand the development of strength of character ; and since the government of parents or instructors , as well as the usages of society , have necessarily a repressive influence ; since the progress of civilization has destroyed many sources of energy , it seems very essential to compensate for these several effects , and to give to the children , who are the men of the future , that nerve and force , of which the germ appears to have been jgranted them by the Creator . It is not , however , in ceasing to exhibit firmness themselves , that instructors will succeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they add a bad example to an influence equally bad , or rather to the want of that influence which it is their duty to exercise . It is proper , if we may so speak , that they should submit to the /q/ obligation of commanding . The dominion , to which a state of entire helplessness submits man during infancy , is as indispensable to the formation of his morality , as the preservation of his life . It is the means designed by Providence for the development of all his qualities , including , among them , energy ; and the employment of this means has for its end , and should have for its limit , the freedom of the will . Education will only render man free . It will commit to him the government of himself , as soon as he , released from the subjection to blind instincts , shall choose what is good for an immortal soul . The distinction between the strength of the desires and that of the will , althoiigh very ancient , may with propriety be here considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it holds its proper elevation , we see it an absolute sovereign , independent of the motives , incitements , and various solicitations which tend to subject and even enchain it . * The ultimate reason of the free determinations of the willj ' says a modem philosopher , * is in itself : if it were possible to discover it elsewhere , this discovery would be that of universal fatality . Indeed , to maintain that our will is irresistibly influenced by the strength of the desires which spring from the heart , is to assimilate us to dead matter ; it is to impose upon us , from birth till death , the yoke of an imperious necessity ; it is to bid defiance to the unconquerable feeling which , in attesting to man his liberty , renders him responsible for his conduct. * * The same may be said of the more noble opinion which subjects our will to the constant direction of the divine hand . That every thing depends upon God , and our liberty like the rest , who can doubt 1 But to affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings is to limit the power of the Creator . Without urging the dangerous consequences of this doctrine , I would say that its effect /z/ We have to consider here , only the free and reflecting will , since it is this alone of which education should seek to augment the power . It is of little importance that some metaphysicians consider that there is an intervention of the will in the most unthought of actions of our existence , in those which , like respiration , are performed during sleep . Another word is necessary to designate the cause of the movements of which we are conscious , that great faculty of the soul which acts with knowledge and liberty , and feels that it had power to have determined otherwise . If this power of choice , which constitutes its very existence , and without which we might regard it as annihilated , submitted to a blind impulse , it is equally annulled as if it were entirely passive , This death , or at least this/nomentary paralysis of the will , is the lamentable effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of liberty is the infallible mark of their victory . There is no free will where the passions reign : there is none in that state of intoxication when man deliberates no longer , but allows himself to be borne along by the torrent of his desires , as by some external impulse . would be contrary to the views of the pious men , who have embraced it . In declaring the absolute impotency of the will , they wish to show us the necessity of having recourse to celestial grace ; but should we always be in a state to have recourse to that , if our will was enchained 1 The act of prayer seems voluntary as well as any other ; the accomplishment of the conditions of the divine covenant ought also to be so . All the exhortations of Jesus Christ and of the apostles suppose that we possess the power of deciding for ourselves ; those even of the men whom we refute also suppose it , so true is it that in denying our liberty , we are involved in inconsistency ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which , in their application , are respectively modified in a manner unknown to us : such are free will and the influence of the Holy Spirit upon our souls . Ed. /q/ O my God , ' says Fenelon , * preserve me from that fatal slavery , which human arrogance has dared to call liberty . ' Such is the slavery to which , unfortunately , the child is subjected , who , not being directed by a steady hand , is given up to his own caprices . Such is the slavery which governs man during his whole life , when education , in neglecting to employ in season- its most efficacious resources , has thus failed in its principal aim , that of rendering him master of himself It is nevertheless true , that to attain this end , it should use its power with a wise economy . It is indeed another way to enervate the will , to leave it constantly subjected to a foreign influence . This fault is also committed ; and education , in our days , in divesting itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this second rock . A mild , and even voluntary servitude , depirives the soul of energy , as surely as one more rude . We are often deceived in this respect ; the pleasure which the child seems to experience in obeying , encourages us : he appears free , because he is happy ; and we take his zieal for energy . But when the will is not selfdetermined , when it has only been made to follow , although freely , the impulse of others , we can not calculate upon its stability . . In this state of half subjection it can appear lively , ardent , and even faithful , without knowing the influence which is exerted ; and we can not therefore draw any certain inference from it with respect to firmness of character . This is what we often see in education . To obtain the concurrence of the child is without doubt an important point . When once we have succeeded in that , the greatest obstacles seem levelled . The obedience has nothing servile ; all is performed with facility , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we advance rapidly . Yet we must not be imder a mistake here . It is not in adopting the /z/ desires of another , that we learn to decide for ourselves ; and what is called a good will is not always genuine . A child , animated hy the desire to please his parents , may be able to conquer the first difficulties of study ; he may be a model of conduct so long as he possesses the desire of their approbation , and yet remain without consistency or stability when this motive exists no longer . It is necessary for him to have learned to propose an object to himself , to choose at his own risk , the best means of attaining it . The free and ( deliberate determination , the faculty of foreseeing the difficulties connected with the course we have taken , is what gives its stamp to the mind , and firmness to the character . If , then , the pupil is in future to be master of his conduct , it is of importance to make him follow two rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to accustom him to repress his capricious desires ; the other of liberty , in order to form in him an independent will . This is a difficulty which is rarely viewed in its whole extent ; hence ( and perhaps above all in the most careful educations ) few decided characters are developed . Another still greater difficulty is , that we can not depend upon the aid of the pupil in correcting his defects which arise from want of firmness . To teach him self government it would be necessary that he should possess the spring which we wish to give him ; and it is not even easy to make him understand what he wants . From the miserable apathy of a child who never has a spontaneous volition , and who consequently is not susceptible of any progress , to fainter shades of the same defect , it is of little use to address reproaches to those who have not received the active principle of moral life . Irresolution , one of the most ordinary symptoms of the weakness of the will , espapes our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing it ; and here reasoning has /q/ little effect . Irresolute people reason , perhaps , but too much ; they view all objects under a thousand different aspects ; they foresee a thousand different results which may follow any course whatever : what they need is that energetic direction which ' makes a single motive prevail over several ; that we may hope or fear only a single thing . Shall we therefore direct the pupil to determine without reflecting , without considering what will result his decision ? Certainly not ; this is not the part ot reason ; she counsels entirely contrary to this , and thus tends , to augment the defect . It is the same with fickleness , another defect in which the will is so prompt as to have the appearance of strength , but has none in reality , since it has no permanence . What can an instructor do in this case ? It is not in his power to revive extinct tastes , and , on the other hand , it would be equally absurd to persist in a conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment which no longer exists , and which we can not regulate by any general rules . We see then that reason , which is perfectly in its place when the object is to bend obstinacy in opinion , is much less so when it is necessary to communicate stability . Its resource here consists in taking advantage of circumstances , that is , to prove that on the occasion in question , the pupil will do best to persevere . But we feel that conduct thus influenced , has no security for the future . To fevor at the same time the work of reason , and the development of the best faculties , it is necessary , then , as it appears to me , that education commence by endeavoring to strengthen the character , to prepare the solid ground in which- all good principles take root and bear fruit . The fickleness of the child renders this enterprize difficult ; and as we are never certain of being able to influence him while nothing is yet fixed in his soul , the means of communicating firmness seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the absence of rational motives , there remains a less elevated , but very efficacious resource , habit . By the habit of obedience , the pupil learns to repress his passions . In accustoming him to decide for himself in allowable cases , he acquires decision , and his will , no more passive , insensibly gains vigor . The feeling of real liberty , but limited by necessity in its exercise , is that with which Rousseau wished to inspire his Emile . So far I , agree with him ; but I regard duty as the moral necessity , and this is what Rousseau does not admit . He exempts the pupil from the observance of this law , because he does not think him in a state to judge in what duty consists . There is , however , one duty which is very well understood by the child , and which initiates him by degrees in the knowledge of all others ; it is that of obedience towards those to whom Heaven has confided his fate . His weakness , his wants , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It belongs to them to exercise their authority with mildness and decision . The problem to be solved in their government is presented in every government . The point is , to reconcile the greatest individual liberty , with the most perfect submission to laws . For the attainment of this end , it is necessary to avoid orders half given , . obligations partly imposed : such are insinuations , tacit solicitations ; such is the pretence of leaving a child master of his conduct , while we envelop him with a thousand chains . The atmosphere of doubt dissolves energy , and relaxes the nerve of intentions . When the limits of liberty and duty ar &; indefinite , a degree of uncertainty is spread over our projects , and even our actions ; we have always to regret the resolution which we have not taken ; we are always tempted to retrace our steps . To preserve the child , and afterwards the man , /q/ from such torment , it is necessary that a just authority preside at the commencement of life , in jgiving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we govem by immutable laws without constantly overseeing individuals , is the most favorable to the development of energy . How far is the most exact discipline , united to the greatest independence , reconcilable with the sweetness of the relations between the teacher and the pupil , or between the parent and child , and the habitual confidence which should exist between them ? How far , with young girls , especially , is it reconcilable with that grace , that prepossessing appearance , that regard for others , in a word , that refinement of manners , which we require in females ? It is difficult to answer . Perhaps with them a strict discipline should not be for too long a time continued , but it must not be forgotten that all others have an enfeebling efiect . Reason founded upon observation can only indicate principles , and numberless modifications afterwards find their place in the application . I will only add here , that deep affections belong only to strong minds , and that when once the feelings of the heart and conscience are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct . /z/ ** . ' Man delights ixy reasoning , which is his chef-d'oeuvre , and turns away from feeling , which is not his work ; he believes that in removing one link in the chain of mysteries he approaches to truth . ' After having contemplated the will in the state of sovereignty , which seems the most absolute , we now view it reduced to a condition less elevated : under this aspect , it will appear to us influenced , even decided , by the impulses of which it has consented to follow the direction . It is then the various desires of the human heart , its instigators and responsible ministers , which we should blame for its wanderings . Hence the task of education , difficult to perform , but more easy to define , consists in surrounding the heart with guides which will not tend to lead it astray . Education can find here a secondary source of energy for the will , in the strength of the motives employed to determine it . When these motives are important , when they merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often permanent , and the soul at length contracts habits of constancy . But if we are only concerned about /q/ actions , if we wish only to cause or prevent these individually , we advance a thousand trifling motives , without ever impressing a general direction . The pupil conducts well , but his morality remains passive ; and we have , as it were , formed a character destitute of substance . Yet with infancy , motives only have importance . At this age , the future is every thing ; actual results have little value , and the best actions are important only as indications of impulses which are to be prolonged . A man may do good or evil , independently of his intentions : his fellowcreatures suffer or enjoy the consequences of his conduct , and they do not need to investigate the motives of it ; but a child , exercising no influence abroad , all the activity which we demand of him is relative to himself ; and when we suggest to him bad , or merely equivocal motives , we do him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the motive is all with him ; the desire of learning ensures success in intellectual education , as does that of performing duty in the education of the heart . A decided resolution does not remain without effect in youth ; and the knowledge once desired , can scarcely fail of being obtained . But I already hear the reply of parents . We should prefer , they say , that our children might be moved by the pure love of virtue : hence we always commence by telling them , that duty requires of them that they do or neglect to do a certain thing ; but we do not see that this consideration has much effect upon them . If , on the contrary , we place before them some hope or fear , founded upon interests which they better comprehend , we obtain what we wish of them . We employ means which of themselves possess activity ; we always give them useful habits , in the hope that reason will hereafter add to them good motives . This language is assuredly very plausible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that we give /z/ it up too soon . The impatience to arrive at positive results is such , that we choose the shortest way of doing this , without considering whether it is at the same time the best . We do not reflect sufficiently , that to act from selfish motives is also a habit which it is not easy to eradicate . The idea of duty coldly presented , has , I acknowledge , but little influence ; but a more profound study of the means of acting upon the will , may open some new route : before pursuing a course morally bad , we should be sure that there is no other to choose . An excellent intention , and zeal to perform its duties , are not a very rare phenomenon with a child . The happy instinct of mothers , and certain particular circumstances , often favor such dispositions , the germ of which exists in all souls : the means of developing them , will soon be considered in this work ; but here , where we are chiefly occupied with principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A more exact knowledge of the true impulses of the will , seems equally necessary to education as to morality . And since , under a very general point of view , these impulses are the same with children and with men , if we would have our knowledge founded upon observation , the surest way is to study what passes in our own heart , an object of examination always present and suited to our purposes . Yet , what we experience is not easy to unfold ; the Springs of our actions are concealed from our own eyes . Our determinations are more quickly taken than their motives are discovered , and those which we assign to them are not always the true ones . Subjected to the necessity of reasoning , as soon as our mind , reflecting upon itself , would judge of our internal state , we are probably inclined to exaggerate the power of reason over us . Too great faith in its influence upon morality , is perhaps the error of an age , proud of the light which reason has diffused over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to believe that we act upon rational principles ; to establish these principles , to apply them to our particular situation , and to prove that our life is conformed to them , is the chain which we constantly seek to form . This chain is not difficult ; but it is not so with the delicate thread which binds our actions to our sentiments . The influence of our secret instincts , of tastes , antipathies , dislikes , of the good or bad desires which animate us , it is difficult to seize , often embarrassing to acknowledge ; and yet these emotions of the soul are the unknown source of the greater part of our decisions . It is easy for us to observe this with others . We see plainly that our friends are determined by that mass of impressions and sentiments which seem often to make up the character ; but no person believes himself to follow any other guide than reason . We seek , therefore , to find how the course which we have taken accords with our rule . Our pretended motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we intend our conduct shall agree , appear to us to have been the foundation : and we take for the cause of our decisions , what is only the apology . Other maxims present themselves as soon as we have occasion to change , and there are always eternal truths to support our passing resolutions . What are we to understand by the word reason 1 In the extended sense which philosophy has given to it , we employ it to express understanding , that great faculty of the soul by which we discover truth . Taken in a more limited sense , it is applied to the conduct of life , and continues to retain its first signification . Reason , also , as it is commonly considered , decides upon the relation of effects to causes , deduces consequences from principles , and pronounces relatively to the individual , upon the advantages or inexpediency of actions . Elevated above the inequalities and weaknesses common to humanity , we may consider /z/ it as the wise counsellor , who , in the government of ourselveSi endeavors to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself supported by exalted principles , it takes a very elevated character . United to religion , it may become the lofty wisdom which compre hends our irfternal interests ; confined to the moral world , it draws from the constitution of society , practical rulesfor our conduct . Indeed whatever principle we admit , and whatever feeling animates us , this governs , in the calculation of the consequences which we are to experience from them . Incapable of creating our various inclinations , it only teaches us to direct those which exist . It is then a regulator , and not an impulse . This alone shows the kind and limits of its power . When reason considers man in the abstract , it supposes him endowed with the most noble qualities , and consequently points out to him the greatest happiness to which he can aspire . From this fact arise the admirable precepts which the wisdom of all nations has collected ; but when reason addresses herself to the individual , she does not find in him all the faculties equally developed : some are languishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only appeal to those which already possess a certain degree of life , there remain to her few general rules to give . Yet the influence of reason is always salutary ; it takes the future into the account ; it forms a imion among the weak sentiments , in order to subdue the more violent ; it says to a creditor irritated by the continued delays of his debtor , - If you cause this man to be imprisoned , you will feel pity at the distress you will occasion his family , and the world will condemn your excessive severity . These considerations may be perfectly just ; but why has reason produced an effect in presenting them ? It is because it has found compassion and the fear of blame ; otherwise it would have had no influence . /q/ Suck is the part of reason . Its skill consists in balanc* mg the desires , the one class by another ; its resource is the acdon of opposing forces . Possessing of itself no powCT , and acting but by the aid of the very feelings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soul nothing to which &yors; its influence , it loses all its efficacy . When this is the case , there is no foundation in the character either for morality or true happiness . Education can not therefore attend too soon to the establishment of impulses ; it should direct the development of the various feculties which act upon that sensible part of the soul from which the desires spring , and where decisions are formed . There are impulses of various kinds , , which it is useful to distinguish . Some more particularly named instincts , watch over the preservation of our material existence ; others , not less selfish , but more nearly allied to morality , are stationed to guard that part of our happiness which depends upon the opinion of men . Such are self-love and its various modifications . Others , more elevated , as the feelings of justice , truth , and beauty , introduce the soul into the calm regions where it is purified , enlightened , and enlarged . There are others more impetuous , which seem to transport our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , and cause us to live in other souls ; such are the tender affections , which from sympathy , their weakest shade , to the complete devotion of love , cause us to experience for our fellowcreatures , emotions as vivid as those which have self for their object . Finally , there exists one impulse which combines all the others possess that is great , tender , or devoted , which elevates the soul , not only above its proper sphere , but the world itself , and gives it a foretaste of eternity . This , I need not to say , is the religious sentiment This inequality in the moral value of the impulses of the human heart prescribes to us the coarse we should /z/ pursue . It is the more essential for educatioi ; ! to cultivate the disinterested and generous feelings , as these alone require culture . The selfish desires and physical instincts grow without care ; they are even indestructible . If then you do not strengthen those which balance them , you not only cease to make any progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force which she can oppose to unreasonable desires . Do we not see that the passions are ungovernable in selfish hearts ? This is what we do not , perhaps , sufficiently consider . Thus each state of morality and of feelings corresponds with man to the idea of a certain kind of happiness ; and his reason , limited by this state , can indicate to him nothing beyond . Extol to some beings the beauties of nature , the charms of study , of friendship , of domestic life , and your voice will resound in the desert of his heart . If the effects of eloquence are transient , it is because it has only roused dormant impulses which very soon sink to their former state ; having never been called into action , they are not there connected with the permanent interests of life . Confined to a sphere , yet reason does her best ; what more could we wish ? Ask of her to regulate interests purely material , she will counsel to prudence ; she will tell you to abuse nothing , to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you one of those people whom Socrates ridicules in the Phfedore , in saying that they were temperate by intemperance . Seeking to make us avoid dangers , she will enccJurage the observance of the social laws , since we can not neglect these without exposilig ourselves ; and , without having the motive of hope to give us , she will have at least at her disposal a liberal supply of threats . Where reason does not find itself based upon lofty principles , it preaches the morality of consequences ; it leads /q/ US to view the results of our actions more than their motives , and shows that vice produces evil , instead of leading us to regard it as itself an evil . It thus enters again into the system of utility , the master-piece of its most ingenious combinations , insulScient , like itself , for its own ends , and without value in improving the heart . It undoubtedly possesses a repressive principle , but a force which can only be employed to restrain is often insufficient even for that It is necessary to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sallies of good feelings to those of bad desires ; for if the simple barrier of duty only is opposed to them , the violent passions too often overleap it . That reason is indispensable in life , that without it we could not take one step , that it is necessary to govern the inclinations , or to direct them , I readily admit . I say ibrtheT , that , in a very extended point of view , we see that it has some power over the formation of sentiments ; but it is an influence slow and indirect . In frequently repressing excess , it deprives in the bad inclinations of exercise in the same proportion , and may in time extinguish them . There is implanted within us a principle of development , a vitality , which , restrained in one direction , 18 borne in another ; and even the feeling of selfishness can not for a long time remain stationary in the himian heart The character of the same generation changes little but what one does by calculation , another does by impulse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their turn the work of reason . She then causes a prevalence of truths which have long remained dormant , and which assume a rank in society , as soon as public sentiment accords with them ; and when these truths are expressed in actions , when they influence manners , and institutions are consecrated to them , their real value appears , in the production of national intelligence and virtue , /z/ But it is the correspondent development of feelings and intelligence , which produces these happy results , and these can be but little appreciated at a distance . Ages and people must be placed in the balance , in order to perceive the weight which reason has given to them . When she has not time to act , when her action is confined within the narrow sphere of the mind of a single man , her influence must be very limited ; - in order to produce great effects upon communities , reason must have a simultaneous action upon many minds . On all sides we discover our limits : this is what I propose to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various excitements ; but they are the living forces of the soul . Let us cultivate them in our children along with the intellectual powers ; let us never leave them without nourishment in the heart , or without exercise in the life , and let us not repose upon reason alone . We believe that the greater part of the evils of this age may be attributed to that systematic personality , which leaves individuals without energy , as well as the political body without vigor . When one is attached to nothing , it is well for him to be attached to himself Selfishness is only a more severe word to express indiiflfer ence to others ; its natural effect is to neutralize all other loves . In general , the fault of education is rather negative than positive ; it is in what we neglect , rather than in what we do . During a long course of instruction where all is passive with the child , without understanding the nature of the mind , there is danger that its fair proportions will be irrecoverably altered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the feelings are neglected , excepting self-love , which is excited as a stimulant . What may we expect will be the result of such a course ? Exactly what we may observe with grown /q/ people , a great want of disinterested motives , and an everincreasing preponderance of those which are sensual or selfish : such can not &il; to be displayed sooner or later . A will , feeble for what is good , ardent and skilful for every other object , thus becomes a necessary consequence . /z/ * ' The feeling of human weakness sustained by divine assistance , constitutes the character of the true Christian . " - Cellebiee . In exposing some of the &ults; of education , I am fiir , from attributing to a want of care the various imperfections of the will . The evil is probably too deep-rooted in our nature for us entirely to remedy . It is not in the province of morality alone that the perversion inherent to this faculty manifests itself We every where meet with it , and even in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of his health , of his fortune , or of his &mily,; will never accuse himself of negligence ; or who does not sometimes think he has not acted according to the dictates of a clear-sighted prudence ? Whence does it arise that this reproach is almost always well-founded ? Why , under the most ivorable suppositions , when our judgment is correct , when our feeling speaks aloud to us , as in the case of our children and ourselves , why are we constantly subject to apathy , or to some moral evil , still more serious ? To account for it , it is necessary to allow a secret disorder , a concealed source of irregularity attached to the /q/ exercise of the will Yet we usually beliere it better to deny this truth : we exalt our power over ourselves in order to give us this power ; but the means are inefficacious , as experiice proves . All that is necessary , we say , is to %dUL Every one can accomplish what he wills ; fine maxims and just ones , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination which we - cannot rekract , but without habitual influence . It is out of our power always to will , as well as always to will that which is good , and we must not treat ' lightly a difficulty under which human nature too often sinks . What is our condition when left to ourselves ? On one side , emotions the very life of the soul , powers without which man is nothing ; but these feelings are subject to a fctal intoxication , and therefore susceptible of becoming our greatest enemies : these are our impulses . On the other side , reason , powerful when exercised without oursslves , but weak and timid when it is directed within ; because it is dependent on that very state of morality , which it is to govern : this is our regulator . Lb it then astonishing , without supposing a degree of energy , which nature and education rarely combine to develop , - is it , I say , astonishing , that the will is inconstant in its influence ? that it is inactive and insensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they oppose it ; violent , obstinate , even depraved and liable to precipitate us to ruin , when subject to some bad passion % Conscience , it is true , gives us advice conformed to the best morality , but we often stifle its voice , and refuse to listi to it : the means of rendering us attentive to it are precisely what we seek . In thus tracing the evil to its root , in viewing the extent to which it has afiected the very principle of our actions , viz. thewiU , we seem to be left without hope . But divine goodness has not left us without a resource . /z/ Among the emotions , the most powerful agents of the soul , there is one more pure ; more noble , more closely connected with morality than the others , - the religious sentiment . This , finding nothing on earth sufficient to satisfy it , seeks assistance from above . It interrogates , it implores all nature , and every where it hears a secret voice which seems to answer to its appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often ; but it is not in false paths that we are called to contemplate its progress . We shall consider it as it always may be developed by an enlightened education : and since man must possess impulses , since reason once formed will only be exercised over the passions , since she assumes her most lofty character only when she finds noble inclinations to reign in the soul , it is important to show that the religious sentiment is the only one which can give a happy impulse to the moral life . But the field here becomes so vast , that I hesitate to survey it . Religious feeling joiped to Christian feith , and finding in the word of God its rule and its director , is a source of moral virtue so abundant that I can not speak of it in detail . I shall , departing in a degree from my subject , the original impotence of the will , consider religious feeling in one of its most striking peculiarities , that is the access which it procures us to a superior power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature is considered as the basis of all morality , is in general to offer jesources which fail when they are most needed . The endowments of the soul are indeed all that we have at command . Nothing foreign to our heart can affect us ; but a principle which should belong to our intimate constitution , would impress upon the soul an influence the more salutary as it would raise it fi:om despon doicy when it had despaired of its own powers . We are told to depend entirely upon our own resources , when we /q/ /z/ are not confident that we possess any . We are pointed to reason , when we are not rational ; we are referred to virtue , when it is virtue which is feeble . As soon as a desire is felt with that ardor and intensity which gives it thee name of passion , one single idea alone occupies us . It pursues and besets us ; it plunges us into a fearful dream . All the proportions of our moral nature are changed ; all our feelings betray us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest aide . Our opinions deceive us . The excitement of passion leads us to see generosity , greatness , more ability to do good in a new extension of our existence , and the shade rfa false virtue contributes still to make us stray . How we know ourselves while a prey to such infatuation ? Where can a safe asylum be found in a heart already seduced from rectitude ? Is not some fulcrum such as Archimedes required to move the world , necessary to raise the soul from such a state ? What then is to be done when we feel indifferent to what is good ? What is to be done when we no longer experience the good resolutions of our youth , when we have even no fear of the consequences of our moral abasement ? What shall we do , if , after vain efforts , our wearied soul remains subject to a fatal passion , which nothing within us is sufficient to balance ? I say , with a deep conviction for such a situation , which is , alas I too frequent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves at the feet of the Supreme Being ; let us plunge into that immensity of consolation and succor ; let us draw from the source of life ; kt us do this , and virtue will revive in our heart . An eternal inistinct , the very bias of our soul , the desire of our excellence , of order , of grandeur : the harmony of the universe which gives us the idea of its Creator ; all tend to dissipate a fiital intoxication , and to cause a purer day to illuminate our spirit . When we give ourselves /z/ up to these influences , the calmness of celestial regions seems to diffuse itself around us : a deep and solemn impression announces to us a new state , a state at the same time humble and sublime , in which the will submits , the intentions are purified ; where we are willing to give the future to the disposal of God , and where his holy law seems to be engraven on our hearts . Prayer , the sacred refuge where our passions dare not follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is restored-prayer has over our heart a powerful influence , and he who has n'ot felt it , has not invoked God with perseverance or faith . Enslaved hy our passions , says Rousseau , we are made free by prayer . ' Never did a more just expression proceed from a mind less aware of the force of what he uttered . When we are not in a situation to resist our inordinate inclinations , we can weaken them by prayer ; this is but the same truth in other terms . The child may soon feel the habitual need of communing with God , of imploring him in his troubles , of submitting to him his desires , of examining before him his past conduct , and his future projects , of imploring of him strength to enable him to persevere in good and to renounce evil . The more he examines his intentions in the presence of the perfect Being , the more will his morality be formed ; the better will he discern his least faults , and the more will the restoring power of repentance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education can produce ; such the energetic impulse which may thwart without annihilating the alternations of the will . But how shall we prevent the recurrence of these alternations , or inequality in love to God , in obedience to his holy law 1 how shall we preserve the pupil from these ead variations which seem to be the inevitable lot of human beings ? The weakness of intentions is soon len* dered 3ensible in actions . The more delicate is ( he /q/ conscience , the more will it perceive , the more will it be ipalled with what it must upbraid itself for . The fear of having offended the Supreme Judge , joined most fre* quently to the wretched consequences of sin , may plunge the guilty soul into discouragement , and despair , may even lead him into the most deplorable wanderings , as the history of fiilse religions proves but too true : it is then essential that the means of elevating the will during the whole life , be as efficacious as that of deciding it at the commencement . Here is the triumph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our holy religion is shown in all its splendor . It is its peculiar object to alleviate our miseries , to save us from sin , the greatest of all evils . Its law , ( and how can we fail of lecognizing in this feature , its Divinity ? ) its law is at , the same time rigid and compassionate ; we always discover through its mysteries the union of justice and mercy ; and in the bloody sacrifice of the Saviour of the world , trath becomes a sublime symbol to announce to guilty man , the pardon granted through faith and repentance . Indeed , if we vie our religion in relation to its influence within us , we shall see that its morality , the most scrupulous of all before the commission of offences , is the least productive of despair , after them . In reading the writings of mere moralists , we find in them the marks of a certain cold severity . Like society , whose interests they take in hand , they grant no pardon to the guilty , and trust little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of regeneration , they believe that the best man has a necessary progression to evil ; ' they ascribe all evils to some felse direction taken in infancy , and , attributing an exaggerated importance to first impressions , they are inclined with Paley to regard man as a bundle of habits . Man is not , however , entirely made up of habits ; he possesses a principle of life , a restoring principle ; but the /z/ Christian religion alone can communicaite activity to it , because this only has in its power at all times that which puts this principle in play , Hope . This only has hope for the guilty as well as for the dying . It takes man as it finds him , innocent or criminal , young or old , honored or despised of others , and always sustains or elevates him , always possesses motives to improvement to ofler him . It is because the principle of Christianity is sufficiently powerful to form habits , and to break them off , to avail itself of the influence of time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inestimable advantage in the government of the whole , lifa I am ready to allow that the love of virtue may exist in lofty souls without any distinct idea of religion . Like talent and genius , this noble ardor is a gift from above ; there are in moral as well as in physical nature sublime works of God ; but without speaking of the hopes , the consolations , even the degree of perfection of which virtuous men who remain strangers to piety , are always deprived , so that they still lack the most noble t ) f our attributes , I would say , that it is not or object to consider these . Innate qualities are out of the question . What education seeks , at least with respect tl ) the present life , is to revive the germ of virtues which would not naturally be developed . On the other hand , there is a more extensive class of beings , who , without being acted upon by strong impulses , avoid great excesses . As temptations are not always strong , negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to obtain it ; if our tenderness , and solicitude for our children are moderate , if we reflect but little upon their fate in " " eternity ; we shall limit our ambition for them to a similar situation . A thousand different motives may combine to direct persons of good sense to a course of decent morality . The world , opinion , immediate /q/ personal interest are restraints upon them . But the desire , the constant necessity of perfection feh in the inmost soul , the firm intention of pursuing it , whatever may be the outward discouragements , such feelings , and such an intention , can not , it seems to me , be foimded upon a mere moral emotion . The progressive improvement of the heart , in my opinion , requires a religious influence . Depending upon more assiduous cares than simple morality requires , the progress of the heart shrinks from observation . He who wishes above every thing else to rectify his secret motives , will often abstain from some action which appears to be good , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce the approbation of men ; and yet if he had only to do with himself he would be liable to remissness in duty . - Should we be sure to persevere in a long and difficult enterprize , if self only was considered ? . And would pretexts be wanting when we came to be wealy of sacrifices which would have self alone for their jadge and object . Grod only is at the same time within and without ourselves : within , to witness our efforts , our motives , our least thoughts ; without , that we may adore , supplicate , and fear him ; that all lofty moral ideas , the objects of our inmeration , exist in a sensible being , who sees , encourages and pities us . God is wisdom , living , animated ; a wisdom , which feels love and inspires it . Perfection and moral beauty have in him an individual existence ; they speak ta our heart and communicate with us . The necessity of placing ourselves in harmony with the object of our devotion , which is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant improvement . We feel that the vicious impulses of our soul are the obstacle that separates us irom God , and henceforth that obstacle diminishes . We are penetrated by a salutary influence . When to the idea of the most holy God is joined that of the reconciled /z/ Grod , the Grod who pardons our offences ; then what is most lofty in contemplation , most tender in gratitude , conisumes , dissolves , so to speak , the mass of evil in our heart , and the will regenerated becomes swallowed up in the eternal source of all goodness . It is thus that religion and morality reciprocally support and serve each other ; being alternately the means id the end . If we may judge of the designs of God , it would seem that the moral development of man , or t ; he " perfecting of his free will , is the design of his Creator in placing him in this world , and that if he has not formed him perfect , it is because , wishing to have him in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect tion in view . Considering man in his character of humanity , it appears that religion , or the union of the soul with God in time and eternity , should be the great object of his pursuit , and that the exact observance of the divine law , which is at the same time the moral law , is the course by which to attain this end . When these attempts ate the effect of love to God ; then he will be constantly advancing ; but , fax from boasting of his progress , he scarcely perceives it - so inferior does he still remain toj the model before him . &#9632; The instructor is , with regard to the child , what- Providence is with regard to man ; he desires his present and friture good , that of his immortal soul ; and he studies , as fiir as he is ) le , the designs of God , in order to conform his , views to them . In attempting to exhibit the progress of thought in the mind of the instructor , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by the authority of Christianity , and upon the other by that of conscience , the instructor dares to pronounce that the object of man in this life should not be merely happiness . The law of our nature , which inclines us to enjoyment , seems to him that of our RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT UPON THE WILL . Ill Uind instincts , of the physicsd power which influences us during the slumher of the will . To give predominancy - to the law of the soul , to the law which impels moral feel  - -  jng and all the intellectual faculties . towards perfection , each one in its destined degree , is the task which the enlightened and virtuous instructor prescribes to himself in education . In examining how the idea of perfection is Ibrmed in the soul , he finds that it consists of two elements ; the one 18 regularity , which produces in us the love of order , - the other , beauty , which gives rise to admiration . In the sphere of morality , regularity is only the observance of the law of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove , presents especially the character of itevotion ; and since God is the only object of devotion , to whom we owe the performance of all our duties , we should consecrate ourselves to God , that is to say , to real , living holiness ; to that Godjwho , bearing our own nature , is offered to us in the Gospel as himself the example of devotion , and the highest degree of perfection . Yet the instructor should measure the extension of his plan upon the possibility of executing it . If he takes the best possible advantage of the unequal feculties of the individual , the result , although it may lack brilliancy , will always present harmony and originality of structure united to beauty of foundation . But to the end that order may reign in the breast of man , all partial progress should be prevented if it causes a loss of that moral and religious development , which is truly that of the soul . On the contrary when nothing in external circumstances or in character is opposed to it , education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of all the fiiculties ; secure that they will take a happy direction . Such are the views of the instructor ; but how can he succeed in the execution of any design , if he can not rely /z/ upon the aid of the pupil ? What course shall he take to form and direct the will , a feculty irregxdar in its exercise , and which seems to be subject to no law ? Without well imderstanding its nature , he observes at first that the will is generally deficient in strength . Often incapable of performing its noblest employment , that of reigning over the desires of the heart , it still sustains the yoke of a foreign influence . These two kinds of weakness seem to him to require two opposite rules . That the child may be accustomed to repress his passions , it is important to subject him to a strict discipline ; in order that he may learn to form his own decisions , it is necessary to render him in many respects independent . It does not , however , seem impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The empire of law and that of liberty , subsists peaceably together , when their respective limits are distinctly traced . But how shall he succeed in governing the will which he wishes to render energetic ? What , with regard to it , is the power of reason upon which we ordinarily found so many hopes ? In examining this question narrowly , the teacher perceives that reason can cause no other power to prevail in the heart than that of the inclinations which it finds already formed there . He sees it to be a regulator , and not an impulse ; and feels the consequent necessity of cultivating disinterested feelings with the child , which only are able to balance the impetuosity of selfish instincts . The inaction of the heart , during the continuance of an ed ucation too exclusively intellectual , seems to him accordingly at the same time to favor selfishness , and to leaye the passions without a counterpoise . This leads him to feel the importance of religion . Does he wish to give decision to the will ? the religious sentiment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and tending more than any other towards /z/ good Does he wish to repress it ? Christian morality is more pure , more strict , and still more adapted to the wants of humanity than philosophical morality , since the whole system of our duties may be understood by the mind , while we feel no desire to practise them . But what particularly distinguishes religion , what displays its divine energy , is the power which it has to regenerate the heart The pardon upon which faith dares to calculate , is the only source of hope which reanimates the soul , borne down under the weight of its transgressions ; and as a tender conscience incessantly loads itself with reproaches , the benefit of this pardon extends to every one . A way always open , an object always in view , and yet never attained ; this is what Christianity presents . Among those who embrace other doctrines , there are doubtless mol men ; but are there any but Christians who labor seriously for their own spiritual improvement ? Whatever path the teacher pursues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet . God , the first cause in the universe , the focus from whence the soul emanates ; God is the object towards whom education , which includes all the relations of man , ought to be directed . Yet , in referring things connected with our earthly relations to this centre , education would by no means leave them to be neglected . Its ultimate end is the life to come ; but its proximate object , that which it seeks immediately to attain , is the happy conduct of the present life . The order of the universe is the object of its instruction ; and it not only teaches a knowledge of the world , but admiration of it , in showing that all it contains , which is grand and pure , is of divine institution . It encourages innocent enjoyments , knowledge , the general elevation of the faculties ; and would repress such emotions as are dangerous , and unsuited to the nature of in &ncy.; /z/ Eager to discover the indications of Providence , judicious teachers respect and cherish the peculiar spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and to give it the proper direction . We would not view with a gloomy mistrust the various influences to which the pupil must be exposed in order to acquire knowledge , when we consider the present world as the school where the soul is to be formed , where it is to learn to fill hereafter a superior destiny . In the hope that * all things shall work together for good to them that love God , ' * we would not be immoderately disquieted to see commence in youth those struggles and trials , which give firmness to the character , and test the value of principles . At this period mingled sentiments of good and evil , passing emotions often excited by frivolous causes , are occasions of the development of the mind , like the vicissitudes of temperature on vegetation , which nourish the precious germs , and give motion to the sap . Then the infinite variety of things in the world , so many objects at the same time innocent and full of interest , seem designed to excite within us an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Creator to vibrate : should but one of these chords remain silent , the soul , like an untuned lyre , may be unable to unite its strains to the celestial harmony of eternity . To sanctify human life , to discover and put in action the treasures which the Divine hand has deposited in the heart of man , seems to be the part of education . /z/ * When one perfect being shall have taught another , then shall we know what are the limits of the power of education . ' - Kant . Education , says a celebrated philosopher , is an art , since nature has not in respect to it given instinct that could serve to guide us . That instinct has been refused to us in relation to this subject does not admit of a doubt . While the brute creation have always the same manner of bringing up their young , man alone is destitute of any peculiar method . How many different customs do we find existing among savage people ! Some plunge their children , as soon as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between boards ; others suspend them in their cradles to the branches of trees , and thus abandon them ; and others bind them tightly in narrow bandages . The most universal sentiment of nature , that of motherb for their ofispring , has been permitted to introduce anc sustain a multiplicity of barbarous customs , and even love itself has sanctioned them . /z/ Civilized people have reflected more , and nothing so revolting is found a mong them . They have not succeeded , however , in reducing the theory of education to any fixed principles . Towards the middle of the past century attention to this subject very rapidly increased , and the extreme importance of it began to be felt . The best minds , as well as the most eloquent writers , have become interested in it ; but the more they have reasoned , the less it would seem they have been listened to . In Germany , where under the name of Pedagogy , the learned have wished to make education a true science , teachers are all at war among themselves . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow - each method has in turn been blamed and justified . Authority , emulation , punishment , and reward - severity and indulgence , rigid rules , and the absence of rule , have each had their partizans and detractors . What shall I say then of public and private education ; of methods of teaching ; of the distribution of studies ; and of their principal object ? Almost all these are yet questions of debate . The paternal feeling has certainly always existed in the human race , and there is much reasoning about it at the present day . What is then wanting for the advancement of the art of Education ? It needs that experience should be much more consulted ; it needs those numerous and minute observations which alone can give to it a solid and reasonable fpundation . In works of the first distinction , where what is expressed makes us regret still more that which is passed in silence - Mr. Edgeworth and his daughter have already said that education was an experimental science . Nev- /z/ ertheless , they have published the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who does not know , however , that we may draw different conclusions from the same facts ? Who does not know that when one labors for science , he should exhibit the basis /q/ upon which he founds his results ? And , indeed , what is the experience of one femily , even though it he a family of such rare endowments ? It seems to me astonishing that , while the science of Astronomy has been cultivated with a perseverance so admirable , mankind have never studied infancy methodically . The most important of all problems , is perhaps that which has been least regarded with constant and rigorous attention . How many men are there who , with their telescopes , night and day , confirm the predictions of astronomers ! How many others who keep an exact risgister of the wind , of the heat , and of the rain ! How many indefatigable commentators ! And in this number there is not found one father who has thought it worth his while carefully to note the progress of his own child I Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more immediately under the inspection of the learned , how much uncertainty exists ! Some practices , evidently pernicious , have been excluded , and this is undoubtedly a first step . They know better what it is necessary to avoid - but are they sure what they ought to do ? Have they ever determined precisely the influence of the first nourishment which is given to children ? Do they know if there is any reason in the prejudice which declares the mingling of different kinds of milk to be pernicious ? Do they know even the effect of these kinds of milk , taken separately ? Aulu-Gelle has said that kids nourished by sheep , have the softest hair ; and that lambs nursed by goats , have the harshest wool : but has this fact been ascertained /z/ After such indifference , we ought not to be astonished , that more complicated questions have not been resolved by means of observation . It may be asked if it is expedient to subject children to the empire of physical habits , or if , on the contrary , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave their prolonged cries in submitting them to a. certain regimen , such as the use of a cold bath , for example ; or IS their aversion an intimationo which we should always yield ? Is it best to choose their food , or endeavor to acustom the stomach to all kinds of nourishment ? Ought we to proscribe all mechanical means to protect the head from blows , and to prevent other accidents of a similar nature ? What are the influences from which it is decidedly necessary to preserve children ; and what , on the contrary , are those , of which we should make them endure the inconveniences in order to harden them ? Innumerable doubts on the best manner of preserving health , present themselves to the mind of mothers , which succeed in distracting more easily than in deciding them ; and for want of knowing how to transmit their experience , successive generations transmit their perplexities . If we approach the moral domain , every thing becomes , more uncertain , and still more critical ; but , with discernment , what inexhaustible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little children ! what a multitude of doubts might not be resolved , or at least enlightened by careful observation ! It might be ascertained if exercises that strengthen the body , have a favorable effect upon the mind also ; if the increase of corporeal vigor corresponds in general with that of moral energy , we might learn what are the agents which develop both , or cause a mutual paralysis . That dependence on our senses , to which authors have endeavored to subject the human intelligence , would be either acknowledged or controverted with more justice ; and if the origin of ideas remained obscure , the first sign of their birth would be at least discovered . Bonnet and Condillac , in a very different spirit , but by means of the same fiction , have sought to explain the mysteries of the intellect - in animating a statue . How much inore would they really have advanced science , if they had . /q/ Studied a new-bom in &nt; ! What curious discoveries on the existence of instinct among men , on the formation of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human mind , would these young beings furnish ! It is undoubtedly necessary to beware of precipitate conclusions , and we can prove nothing from solitary examples . But as every body knows , that in multiplying observations abundantly , accidental differences become obliterated ; and that the peculiar qualities of the individual disappear beibre the attributes of the species , experience on a great scale would be one of the most efficient means of instruction . It is necessary to make our observations systematically : we should have , in the immense multitude that we know , that which would furnish most , valuable data . The results of different educations are every where found in the spirit so strongly characterized in religious sects , in that which determines the several professions , notwithstanding the late period at which men ordinarily embrace them . It is also right to suppose that if we better knew the general customs among all nations , of raising children from the earliest age , we should find in a great measure the diversity of national character explained , and that the effects justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear of small importance compared to those of education . The misfortune is , that they tell us always of the methods , and never of the good or bad success of their experiments . They tell us very eloquently what they have done , but not whether they had reason to do it ; and among all who have arrived at the age of manhood , we forever reiinain ignorant , which have been systematically educated . It is true that we judge of the education by its results : it is necessary , however , to take into the account the influence of political institutions , and those of various causes , 120 Wyllil OF PERFECTING EDUCATI#lr. , that Jtct so powerfully on the young man at Jiis entrance into life . The question in this respect becomes much more complicated , since none can entirely escape the predominant spirit of his age and country . But as the first imptilse may be strong enough to modi all the others , and to impress on them a salutary tendency , there alwa3r8 remains in the domain of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be attributed to etfrly education . Among all the varieties of opinions , and customs , good and judicious instructors generally fdnn ( enlightened and honest pupils . If adults in any considerable number fail in qualities essential to the happiness of society , and of man , we can boldly pronounce that there has hemi some secret defect in the manner in which their infancy was governed ; and on this subject there remains a vast field for observation . Th uniformity of the products of civilization , actually cause us to forget two important things - that people less enlightened than we are , differ infinitely among themselves in character - the other , that the child has an almost equal aptitude to clothe itself in the character of each of these people . I do not certainly pretend to deny that there is a di ference among the various races , even in a moral respect , Tacitus , who agrees on this point with our modern literati , believed that these diflerences were accidental , and that they almost disappeared after a few generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But supposing them to be more permanent , it is nevertheless certain that the same education will establish a thorough conformity in a thousand respects between children of all countries , who are trained together . With regard to habits and manners , each new-born child might become with equal facility a Chinese , a Laplander , or an Englishman - such is the great flexibility of our nature I Past ages are as nothing to the child . If he is not a stranger to evil , he is to the /z/ mAN8 OF PERFECTINO EDUCjalljSir. 121 progress of corruption in the world ; and he might be formed for the golden age , ( such , at least , as men have represented it , ) perhaps more easily than for the age in which we live . It would seem , then , that among this multiplicity of possible methods of education we should have only to make our choice - that in taking from each method what isbeit m it , we might gather together in the person of the child , all that the flowers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undoubtedly chimerical - but notwithstanding an attentive examination of the means employed to obtain every desirable result , would be more useful than it is believed to be . If for each and all , moral evil is inevitable , the quantity of it may be infinitely diminished . When we consider that the Quakers among their numerous population seem almost to have annihilated even a passion so natural as anger , how does it increase the idea of our power over children ! * Can we ever elevate education to the rank of science ? can we bring it to sure and certain results , by classing and arranging fiicts concerning children according to select and fixed principles ? I know not ; but the limits of uncertainty will become much circumscribed and contracted . I believe education will remain an art - that is to say - an assemblage of means , in which a certain skill , &#9830; Let each mother ask herself whether she has never by word , look or action , exhibited before her child emotions which she would be sorry to see reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its presence appeared gloomy , fretful , angry , or impatient ? Alas ! we are never so completely humiliated as when we feel that with all our efforts to render our children perfect , our very example stamps upon them the imperfections of our fallen nature ! But if those who do strive to teach virtue both by precept and example , sometimes fail , what can we expect from such as never reflect at all upon their duty to their oflring 1 Ed , /z/ // a certain adroitness , will succeed . The art will never be thoroughly taught in books - and the influence , of man with man , the talent to make themselves beloved and obeyed , and to subjugate the will , must always distinguish some from others . But even an art has fixed principles , tfnd public education might become something more certain than an art Methods are more likely to succeed , in which individual differences lose themselves in the mass ; and the play of this great machine does not depend entirely , either on the pupils over whom it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how much is yet to be done for the perfection of such an instrument by comparing experiments and proofs 1 These two kinds of education call for two different studies - that of children considered separately , and that of children collected in sufficient numbers to exert a strong influence upon each other - and that by an effect similar to that of fermentation - - the elements of their moral nature combining in each of them in a new and peculiar form . The study of children , considered separately , should begin with birth . It is clear that mothers alone can give themselves to this with success . Their relation , and the peculiar gifts which distinguish them , alike fit them to observe infants . It is necessary that a woman should have a pliant spirit to follow these changeable beings in their perpetual variations - every thing with them is so fugitive and vague , that a sort of vertigo would soon seize upon the observer who should endeavor to portray all their varying features . This study does not consist in a simple examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can clothe itself with a foreign nature , be himself and another at the same time , he can never be.come acquainted with these young beings . It is still more necessary to love them , in order to comprehend /q/ them , and they may be known much more readily through the avenues of the heart , than of the understanding " . But when we do nothing else but follow the current of their feelings , and , if I may so speak , live in them ; all the impreGffiions that we have in a measure received , are too easily efiacedL We become , from sympathy , light as they , and the task which we had prescribed to ourselves , is soon lost in forgetfulness . To succeed in fulfilling it , I earnestly exhort young mothers to keep an exact journal of the development of their children . When they have not more extended views , they will always find one great advantage in this employment . It will give collectedness to their ides , and fixedness to their projects . It will accustom them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a very distinguished work , the * Annals of Education by M. Guizot , ' there are fragments which exhibit a true example of the art of penetrating into the nature of children , and of assigning to their conduct its true cause . These fragments , which bear the title of the journal , offer to view the result of much valuable observation. * As to talent , it is much more than I demand ; but with respect to its nature , it is not exactly what I have in view . I would have an accurate journal , where the gradual progress is noted down , as well as all the vicissitudes of physical and moral health , and where we might find , by regular dates , the advancement of a child in all its faculties . The words * Most of these observations have been laid down anew in * Letters on Domestic Education , ' which obtained the prize awarded by the Academy . This work , to which Madame Guizot has put her name , manifests in the highest degree that penetration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble elevation of moral sentiment , which characterize the productions of the same author , and render her premature death an event so deplorable . Ed. /z/ ideas , perceptions , feelings - all that is acquired or developed , should be noted in this journal - we should then discover the first trace either of virtues or defects , and could thus be able to judge of their origin . In order to represent children , it would be necegsary to relate their history. * The history of little events - of the joys and sorrows of their age would animate the journal , and the mother would soon find a great delight in writing it . The most simple foresight would make her feel that she is laying up for the future , the recollections of a delightful era . It would be so sweet to arrest the fugitive images of infancy , to prolong indefinitely the happiness of contemplating its traits , and to be sure of having restored Jto us at any time these cherished beings , whom we lose , alas ! as children - although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . But of how much more general and immediate importance would a similar labor be , if it were executed by the principals of the gfeat establishments for education . They only see children in mass ; as mothers only see them in detail . What principles of ever active improvement might not be gathered from a thorough examination of the effects of the various methods they employ I In institutions of education , the action of such a principle is very necessary , in order to contend against the spirit of indolence , which incessantly incHnes children and even their masters to elude all difficulties , and to content themselves with appearances in order to keep pupils on a level with the rapid progress of himian knowledge , which demands a proportional advancement in all the branches of instruction . And when comparative proofs shall have * The Journal of a Mother in the Appendix , is an attempt at such a history . Ed. /q/ jnade us decidedly reject the employment of certain means , it is to be presumed that others will present themselves to the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although institutions of education are very numerous in Europe , they have been drawn so much upon the same model , that there is but little in which to compare them , excepting as it respects the ability of the professors , and this can lead to no general improvement . But when establishments shall become multiplied , that are founded on principles entirely new , such as thos of Messrs . Pestalozzi and Fellenberg , that of Father Girard in Switzerland , and Hazlewood school in England , then the great questions with regard to education will begin to be understood . We shall see , for example , if the influence of emulation , the moral effect of which is so justly distrusted by every scrupulous spirit , is absolutely indispensable to the greatest development of the mind : we shall know if we can not prevail over it by the happy effects of example , carefully separating them , at the same time , from the evil effects of rivalry : and perhaps we may learn that , before all other motives , we may place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the method of mutual instruction in these new institutions , what ideas do we not receive of all that may yet be discovered , and perfected respecting education ! And in relation to the formation of character , which is so much more important , what light is furnished by the new infant schools ! When we see these establishments where more than a hundred children , from two to six years of age , contracting together habits of order , and receiving the first elements of instruction , - and throughout their plays and lessons , having neither tears , or cries , , or quarrel si but constantly exhibiting the image of happiness , - we are astonished at the greatness of the results to be obtained /z/ - f. /z/ by the use of the simplest methods , and ask how it is possible that so many ages could have passed away , before we thought of them . We are aware that it will always be difficult to establish an exact comparison between different systems of education . To succeed in doing this , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to the task should submit their own attempts to a regular examination , of which they should publish the results ; but more over , it will be necessary to follow the pupils after the completion of their education , and to judge of it at last , by what they are in life . These researches are so delicate , and must necessarily be multiplied so much in order to render them conclusive , that we hardly dare flatter ourselves a sufficient number of observers will be found to undertake them . But what can escape the spirit of investigation which distinguishes our age ? an age , which alone has witnessed the union of two rare endowments ; the knowledge , at once theoretical and practical , of that experimental philosophy which , since the days of Bacon , has given to the sciences such astonishing progress ; and the will , ardent and steady to apply the discoveries which result from them , to the good of society . It is now understood that great works must be performed by united efforts , or division of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not complete , is perfected by other men , and other times . And in this day , when so many magnificent ettterprizes are excuted for the sake of religion and humanity , why may we not hope , that some respectable association will be formed , that will undertake to resolve by fects the great problems of education ? * What examination * Such an association has been formed in our country by me sex , who are engaged in teaching , or preparing works to assist /q/ more important , could ever be the object of human meditation ! Is it not in the dominion of education that the greatest influence is exerted by one mind over other minds ? by the present time , over the future ? There is one favorable circumstance that I can not forbear to notice here . In all great cities there are numerous asylums for children , which offer subjects entirely new , and at the same time independent of parental authority . I speak of unfortunate foundlings . With them , there would be no previous impressions to apprehend , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves had sown . Moreover , we could do nothing but good to these poor beings , in trying upon them all innocent methods . Even if one occupied himself with the earliest age , and the poorer classes exclusively , the application of the different systems to considerable numbers of children , might throw important light upon the subject . Among the obstacles which oppose themselves to the progress of education , there is one scruple worthy of notice . People fear they shall hazard something in attempting new experiments , and they believe at every time they do it they ought to adhere to that , which is presumed to be the best . But the question is , not that which is presumed to be , but that which is the best . We hazard something also in our opinions . There are undoubtedly dangerous experiments that should never be permitted ; but when all shall be banished that ought to inspire distrust , the best will be at once for all to seek the truth . To invoke the experience of future times is to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is every way , I hardly dare to quote it here . But although the business of education ; their example might , with great propriety , and utility , be followed by the other sex , who to say the least , are not less extensively engaged in similar efforts . Ed. /z/ I may not expose &cts,; I shall at least have the merit of raising doubts . I shall single out uncertainties ; I shall note difficulties . The best book in the present state of our knowledge would be , perhaps , a course of rational questions , to which the united labors of ilightened minds which have devoted themselves to educatiim will furnish an answer fifiy years hence . /z/ " Man has received from nature nothing but materials ; but the simplicity of his origin is lost in the majesty of his history j the poverty of his elements in the magnificence of his works . " RlVAROL . Although birth and death are constantly occurring in the course of nature , these events cease not to astonish us . They always confound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a region of mysterious things . Birth and Death , speak to us of two unknown worlds , which they seem to bring near to ours . Nevertheless , the part which we take in these events is very different ; - we associate ourselves with the dying ; we suffer , we tremble with him whose destiny we must one day ourselves experience - while with the state of the infant we sympathize far less . Its aspect can soften us , but we can not put ourselves in its place . The relation that we bear to infancy , belongs to a remote time , of which we have no recollection , and which has ceased to interest us . That which has nothing to do with our fears and hopes , will always remain indifferent to us . All nations also have busied themselves with the state of the soul after death , and have thought very little of /z/ what it was before birth . Even in the theory of metempsychosis , the imagination has interested itself but little in this respect ; for it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form which it has figured to itself in the future . It is true Herder tells us , that according to the ancient people of the East , the souls of those who were not yet born inhabited an obscure and tranquil region in the centre of the earth . There they presented no distinct form . There they waited for light - the moment when God should call them , and the hour of their birth should be announced . It is , he adds , the ancient night , into which Job would have rendered back his life . These opinions seem to have remained buried in the East ; at least the Grecian mythology does not support it. * . It seems , however , that the brilliant imagination which has clothed in agreeable forms so many philosophical ideas on human destiny , might also have embellished that . And at the same time that ancient poetry represented to us , souls arriving in crowds on the shores of Acheron , like leaves driven by the winds of Autumn , it might also have painted the hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which even in the most barbarous countries are always confided to maternal love . But if , according to the opinion of the church , the soul is really a new creature , what ideas must we not conceive of that eternally originating force , which is incessantly producing beings from nothing ! And whilst the Epicureans of all ages are pleased to consider the Divinity as the idle spectator of the effects of a first creation , what * Anchises shows , it is true , to Eneas ( JEneid , vii . v. 750 , ) the soul that must inhabit the bodies of his descendants ; but as these souls had always lived on the earth , we can discover in it nothing but the remembrance of a metempsychosis , regulated by the taste of the poet . Ed. /q/ /z/ immense action , on the contrary , must not be exerted by the inexhaustible focus , from whence life throughout the universe constantly emanates . It has been already remarked that sorrow introduces man into the world , and accompanies him when he departs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its entrance . The air , like a rapid torrent , forces its way into the lungs of the child , and irritates them ; - the light dazzles his delicate eyes through the transparent veils which cover them ; and although it is supposed he does not hear , it is difficult to believe that his own cries do not reach him . Thus the mysterious moment that plunges the soul into the vortex of life , brings ' to it suffering , dizziness , and vertigo : but very soon a sort of stupor , and sometimes a peaceable sleep , divest it of impressions which it can not yet support . Much time ordinarily passes before the soul begins to notice . All the movements of the child are half convulsive , and correspond to its internal Sensations : there is but one of its actions which seem to have any design , and that is , to turn the mouth as if to seek its nourishment , and afterwards to suck that which is offered it : no other proof of instinct can be observed at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its eyes follow the light ; it hears also , for sudden noises make it start ; but it still exists a solitary being , and enters not into relation with the world in which it lives . Perhaps it refers all that passes outwardly to the internal sensations which it has experienced only in the maternal bosom . It would be then in certain respects like one who dreams , because it would have a train of impressions that could not be outwardly manifest . But there would be this difference , that in dreaming we attribute to exterior objects what really passes within ourselves , while the infant refers to internal sensations the effect produced on him by exterior obj.ects . /z/ We can not , however , doubt that it is instinct which guides it . It is most probable that the in &nt; at its birth is subjected to this great law , which forces the soul to take cognizance of a world of matter exterior to itself ; only he distinguishes nothing clearly ; all his perceptions are detached , and do not connect themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not presented in distinct images : his sight can not appreciate distance , and perhaps like the one born blind , operated upon by Chesselden , he feels as if objects were in contact with his eyes . It is possible that without an unperceived intervention of the judgment and the will , we might be in this respect similar to the infant . That it is so , might be suspected from two facts that I venture to cite , although they are , and the first particularly , somewhat difiicult to verify : one is , that when we awake suddenly , there is an invisible moment in which we seem to see objects retiring from us , which proves that , upon the first impressions , we had supposed them near ; the other is , that , in a state of extreme weakness , the sick often complain that all they see is too near them ; it seems to them that images advance on them , that the walls of the apartment touch them ; apparently because they have not strength to overcome the sensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brute , in the first moments of life ! How fer above the child in intelligence is the little chicken , just hatched from the shell which we see run , scratch up the earth , distinguish , and pick out the grains of wheat that are mingled with the sand ! How far above the child , is the young chamois , if it is true , as they say of it in the Alps , that the mother ready to be delivered , and pursued by the hunters , stops , brings forth her young , licks it once , and departs again immediately , flying with him across the snow and the precipices. /q/ t Yet even after the first months are passed , I am not inclined to believe the child as destitute of instinct as is ordinarily imagined ; and I see in him many movements that sensation and experience certainly do not explain ; such are the signs that announce to us the first dawning of his aflfections . Thus at the age of six weeks , the newbom child is yet a stranger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has a distinct idea . He knows not that the objects he sees , are the same as those he touches ; and whatever impression these objects cuse in him , he knows neither how to reach , or to avoid them . Nevertheless , even at this point , so remote from development , the human countenance interests him ; when nothing in the material world fixes his glance , sympathy already acts in him ; a cheerful air , a caressing manner , win a smile from his lips ; soft emotions evidently animate the little creature ; and we , who know the meaning of the expresiion , are transported to find it in him . But who has told the infant that such an expression of the features indicates aJSection ? How can he , to whom his own physiognomy is unknown , imitate that of another , if a correspondent aj fection has not impressed the same character upon his features ? There is nothing here which belongs to the senses . The person near his cradle is not alwajrs his nurse ; perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to disagreeable operations . It matters not ! she has smiled upon him ; he has felt that he was beloved , and he loves . It seems as if the new soul recognized another , and said to it , I know thee ! * Does not this phenomenon evidently belong to instinct ? Ls it not an effect produced by the same inexplicable presentiment , which makes the terrified chicken fly at the appearance of a black point scarcely visible , high in the air ? The chicken , who has never seen the hawk , /z/ anticipates cruelty and murder ; the child , who has yet discerned nothing , foresees goodness and love . . We are struck with the slowness of the first progress , in our species , because we compare it incessantly with that of the brutes ; but if we refuse all instinct to the child , the promptitude of his development , must appear truly astonishing . When we think that the young man bom blind , of whom I have spoken , aided by four senses , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed by men who could teach him how to use his new sense ; when we think , I say , that this blind man was six months before he knew how to manage himself , with respect to external objects , and that after this time he often committed great errors , can we deny that the child must receive peculiar assistance when he begins to exert his fticulties ? He is proportionably more advanced than the blind man ; and though even ignorant that he has an apprenticeship to serve , he is better fitted to lead in the foreground the apprenticeship of the five senses . As we know that it is by means of the touch , that we rectify the errors of sight , it would not be necessary to tell the blind man that he must recognize with the hand , all the forms which he perceives : with the infant such a practice would be attended with danger , and could not even take place until he had begun to make use of his hands , which he does not do until he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eight or nine , that is to say , after a much shorter experience than that of the blind man , he no longer deceives himself with respect to objects placed near him . And what various knowledge has he not acquired in the same time , before the means of enriching himself with , that of others , by language , was in his possession ? How does he astonish us still more by the &icility; with which he renders himself master of this acquirement ? Any /q/ common man whose vocabulary is not much more extended than that of a child of three years old who is well developed , would , if he was transported into a new country , employ the same three years in making himself master of a foreign language , and yet what immense advantages would he not possess in a thousand respects over this child ? He is already familiar with the names of common things ; he knows the use of language , and he knows its general structure . He endeavors , in short , ( o instruct himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If then the progress of children , on all points of their apprenticeship , equals that of a man directed towards one point only , is it not clear that there exists in their favor special dispensations ; that is We talk too much of experience : it plays a part in certain respects , but it does not do every thing ; its influence , which is of a nature to be continually enlarging , is distinguished in early infancy by its uncertainty and slbvniess : thus , in whatever belongs to its domain , children are forever repeating the same experiments ; they have been shown five hundred times that to make an object stand erect , it is necessary to place it on its base , and they invariably lay it on the side : for three years together they spill liquids out of the vessel that contains them , before they understand that it is necessary to hold the vessel horizontally : it is because the association of ideas is very slight in them , except when their feeling is excited . In every thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time lost . Is it asked what we shall gain for human nature , by givingi it a share of the instinct of animals ? There is every thing to gain for our dignity , I reply , if it brings one proof , more against materialism . These questions have assumed importance , since many have endeavored /z/ to explain , by sensations purely physical , all the phenomena of living beings . But what do they do with instinct in this system ? From whence come , among animals , those fears and hopes which seem as a prophetic inspiration ? How , without model , do they execute those wonderful constructions , of which some species only know the secret ? Will they tell me these are inexplicable facts ? but that IS precisely what I myself say - and in confessing the impotency of material causes , I am obliged to recognize an order of things more elevated . What matters it , that I admit the same for inferior creatures ? If through the intelligence of a feeble bird , I catch a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that in every species is admirable in itself , and above the faculties that have been allotted to it , appears to me the effect of a sublime instinct ; a direct ray from the light above . It is that which has given to the bird the idea of a nest ; to the new-bom infant , that of the affection he inspires ; to man , that of perfection , of immortality , of infinity , of all that is too grand or too excellent for him to have met with on the earth : these are the involuntary and sacred feelings which are not only in him , but which constitute him , and without which he can not comprehend himseF . How singular is the destiny of human opinions ! Sceptics first wished to make the animal a machine ; and when , afterwards , deceived by the similitude , they expected to reduce man to the same state , it is found that the example of the animal itself has destroyed the vain sophisms on which they wished to support themselves . The more we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to acknowledge in them innate tendencies ; * the more we shall be convinced that there are laws /z/ imposed in their minds , laws which the mind imposes in its turn on that which originates in feeling ; and the more we shall discover that external objects but'give an impulse or furnish aliment to the soul . More than five months passes away before the child ha an idea of taking up any thing with his hands ; their design is for a long time unknown to him , and the extreme slowness with which he discovers it , proves that this discovery is with hjm. the tardy work of experience . He looks at things , and interests himself in persons long before this time ; and thus appears to have received more immediately the use of sight . Moreover , I can not suppose with Berkley and other authors , that because the rays of light cross each other in the pupil of the eye , the infant begins by seeing objects reversed , and that he learns to correct them only by habit . Images , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on ours ; but when he is - capable of comprehending that they represent real existences , he has already judged rationally of the position of all things . The sensations which preceded this moment , will always , to us , remain enveloped in an impenetrable cloud . It is easy to observe the gropings of experience in the manner by which the infant learns to employ the sense of touch ; that which he would seem likely to exert , before the others , is slow to obey the orders of the will . He must in some degree receive the first notion of it from the sense of sight , by which afterwards he brings it to perfection . And this is the way it is accomplished . mind to receive ideas through the medium of the senses , and not the existence oiinnate ideas ; - the latter opinion , since the expositions of Locke , has found few supporters , and must throw us back to the absurd doctrines of the realists ' . Ed. /z/ i // ft As soon as the infant sees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles at every thing that strikes his eyes . The pleasure of looking at what is brilliant , agitates him . He flutters , gesticulates , and it often happens that his hand encounters the thing that attracts his attention . Then he experiences an unexpected sensation ; he is astonished that an obstacle stops his movements : at last , when a return of the same causes has incessantly led to the same effects , he foresees what will be the result of his gestures . He then holds out his little hand with some design , but as he is not yet aWe to appreciate distances ; to touch the object , or not to touch it , is a game of chance with him . By dint of repeating game , he becomes a little more expert ; but it is not until after he is seVen or eight months old , that he can at once lay his hand upon the thing desired . The hand which ' lays hold of objects , and , in doing it , measures distances , is certainly a very efficacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he lives . Contrary to the opinion of some authors , I believe , however , that before he can thus make use of it , he has already conceived the idea that the same body can be seen and touched at the same time ; and the bosom that has nourished him has given him this idea . What makes me think so is , that we see him advance his mouth towards the objects that he wishes to touch , about three or four weeks before he does his hand ; the habit also that he soon acquires of putting every thing that he takes hold of , in his mouth , will prove that the lips and the gums are with him the organ of touch , which is oftenest excited , and the most sensitive . When the sensations of the infant are no longer unconnected ; when sight and touch concur to give him an i3ea of the same object , he knows how to refer the most of his impressions to their proper causes , and the threshbold of Tils FIRST MONTHS . 139 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him under ite real form , and from that time his intellect makes rapid progress but he has already commenced his first attempts at language , which it will be very curious to observe . At about the age of six weel 's , when the smile and the tears appear , ' we remark in the new-born infant a little murmur , which is very sweet . It is an expression of satisfaction , of comfort , which he utters when at ease . By degrees these sounds become more accented : they then present the genuine exercises of the voice ; a warbling with which the child amuses himself , perhaps a confused imitation of the noise that wc make in speaking to him . Rousseau has happily mentioned certain dialogues , in which the words of the nurse , and the inarticulate responses of the child , present nearly the same modulations : he on addresses this warbling to inanimate objects , which he does not distinguish from others ; for he may deceive himself in seeing life where it is not , but he never can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button of polished metal , sometimes a glass shining in the sunbeams , to which he speaks ; he seems to tell them that they are pretty ; that they give him pleasure : he seems to manifest love for them : sometimes he utters little joyous and piercing cries , as if to attract their attention ; however , there is in this no real language , at least if we understand by . this term , a means voluntarily employed to exert an influence : the child asks for nothing , he calls to nothing , he expects no effect from his music . The true language of the infant is his cries : he utters them at first without design , obeying a law of his nature , which niakes him pour out his grief In this manner . But when this grief has been often soothed , and its noisy expression has become allied with the idea of succor , in the mind of the child , he cries for the purpose of calling it J - he has then entered the true province of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the object of his desires , also commence with him involuntarily , and afterwards become imperative from habit . The first words of the child are quite another thing . In pronouncing them , it pleases him to exercise a peculiar faculty - the power of attaching a sign to an object , and he exerts it without being moved either by want or passion . Does he see a dog pass in the street ? he imme* diately speaks its name as well as he knows how - but he speaks it without any other motive than that of amuse* ment : he is not actuated either by fear or hope . If he was afraid of the dog , he would weep ; if he desired to have it near him , he would lean his body towards it , uttering impatient cries ; but it is in a state of perfect tranquillity only that he names it ; if he experiences the least emotion , he abandons words afe a new and superfluous acquisition , and returns to his real language of cries and gesticulation . Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only at a much later period that he makes it very useful . It would certainly be very presumptuous to determine on the origin of language in the human species , from the first attempts of the faculty of speech among infants ; however , as it has been often said that language was born of necessity , and that it was but cries brought to perfection , I am very glad to testify , that , at least , it is not thus with the child . I add , that he does not invent words himself ; and that he does but repeat , and that badly , those which he has heard pronounced ; he does not even call an animal by his cry , at least unless the example has been given him to do so . Thus language , in its rudest state , is the fruit of imitation or of teaching , and does not appear to be prompted by nature . When the child is almost a year old , he lisps his first words , and tremblingly adventures his first steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses less than all creatures living , of the same age , the means of watching over his own safety ; and yet he already displays the two great prerogatives that elevate him much above the animal creation . The faculty , of which I have just been speaking , that of designating objects by established signs , has been often noticed ; but there is another , although less remarked upon , which developes itself much sooner . I speak of that disposition so general in infancy , which induces the child to interest himself in a multitude of objects , entirely foreign to his instinct of preservation . At six months , he no longer lives concentred in himself ; already the young existence manifests itself externally ; already the mind begins to form those extended relations which must one day subject the material world to its dominion . The most intelligejit animals have a circle of interests which is very limited ; that which does not relate to their safety or subsistence , is as nothing to them : they love , but they do not admire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , is amused with every thing : he has . pleasures which we might call disinterested , there is so little in their nature which is sensual : the useful is nothing to him , and the beautiful already exists ; such as he imagines it , he tells of it , and his eyes sparkle with admiration ; his little voice breaks forth in hymns of praises , before he can discern what will be useful , or what will hurt him . There are , I believe , in the history of animals but two fects which bear any analogy to this , and even in these cases the resemblance is deceptive : one is , that of the kit* ten , that appears to be diverted by stirring a suspended ribbon , or by rolling a paper-ball upon the floor ; but as bodies in motion are all that attract his attention , there is every reason to believe that they respond to his instinct of hunting , and that he sees in them either mice , or the /z/ signs of their presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightingale , for example , approaches brilliant objects , and descends from his bough to look at them ; the lark is in the same way attracted by the lustre of glasses ; but these are the effects of inquietude , of fascination , perhaps of the hope of food : we see not in them the expression of pure pleasure , like that which children manifest ; they only feel real delight at the sight of beautiful objects ; they only become attached to them , recognize them when they see them again , and conceive for them a sort of passion . The pleasures of hearing are also vivid in young children : noise is in general agreeable to them , and , above all , music . We may remark on this subject that the pleasures of hearing belong not as exclusively to our species , as those of sight , - since birds , like ourselves , are sensible to harmony . This fact with respect to them , may perhaps indicate another , and it may not be impossible that the first musical impressions might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know the effect which the first songs that they hear has upon these ; creditable experience has taught us that the warbling of a bird , presents an exact repetition of the sounds he has listened to while very young ; and that if we take from the nest the little one that is just fledged , and shut it up with a bird of a different species , it will adopt the song of its new companion . It may be then that by frequently presenting to the ear of the young infant , clear and agreeable modulations , we might hus be spared a part of the care which we often so laboriously take to perfect its organs at an after age : it is at least certain that in families where music is habitually cultivated , new pupils are formed with great facility . We may also conjecture that the great difference between the musical dispositions of neighboring countries , as , for /q/ example , the inhabitants on the opposite banks of the Rhine , are but the result of first impressions . The song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy , would be also the means of developing the germ of a charming talent - a talent that is cultivated too much as an art , without sufficiently appreciating its moral influence , which was known and employed by the ancients much better than by us . The intellectual education of infancy can consist only in a preparation for the future exercise of reason . The secret with respect to this , consists in fixing in the mind of the child , by the interest which we ought to have the art of exciting , perceptions otherwise too fugitive ; it is essential that a collection of facts becomes imprinted upon his memory , which may at some future day furnish points of comparison for his judgment . But to collect these &cts,; it is necessary that he give his attention to them . Defect of attention in the pupil , and the confusion of mind that results from it , is the obstacle that a teacher oflenest meets with : this obstacle would be less liable to present itself , if the first impressions of the child had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some object , care should be taken not to divert him from it : every thing which can excite his interest , or become a subject of observation , serves to develop his faculties . We must not , however , seek to redouble the intensity of sensations purely material . We deaden or stupify'the mind of the infant by stunning his feeble organs . To toss him violently , to tickle him , to strike forcibly before him on a table , to rap against a window , is to use rude and mechanical means which suspend his cries only by paralysing his faculties : * it is necessary , on the contrary , as /z/ much as we can , to mingle intelligence and feeling in the diversions we procure for him . To caress before his eyes a dog or a cat , would be to develop that sympathy which the youngest children so easily feel for animals . To show him a beautiful object , and make him examine it in detail , would be to strengthen his attention , and also to excite in him admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make him observe and recognize imitated figures , would be to awaken imagination in him ; - there is , in short , a thousand means of calling forth his budding faculties . When once the mind has been brought into play by some impression , it associates itself with it ; it unravels it ; it gives clearness and precision to it while so occupied ; and it is thus that the mind forms and exercises itself To vary without excess the sensations of the child , and to call into action the moral powers as much as possible ; such is the education of the mind in in &ncy.; There is also one for the heart , which it is as much more important to cultivate , as the dispositions that favor it are more fugitive . /z/ " To love , is the beginning of morality . " - Dupont de Nemours . To cultivate happy dispositions ; to give to them that fixedness and permanence , which entitles them to the name of qualities ; to raise these to the rank of virtues , by imprinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the formation of character , is the gradual progress of a good education . In early infancy , we can employ ourselves only about the dispositions of the child . Some of these may be cultivated , at an era , when it is yet impossible to combat any . At all ages also , the best means of overcoming , or at least of enfeebling bad inclinations , is to give continual exercise to others. * * Overcome evil by good , ' is the admira- * Would that this truth might be impressed upon the minds of all mothers ; and then instead of correcting their children , only to awaken in them bad passions , we should see them more frequentlydiverting their attention from what is wrong , by gently presenting some new object . A mother was one day correcting her little daughter of two years old - the child with her tiny hands returned the blows in her mother 's face . * Emily , ' said the lady , ' can you be so naughty as to strike your mamma T * Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resentful look . This was the result of a /z/ ble precept of the gospel , and comprises the whole secret of education . In order sufficiently to feel the importance of the rst year , it is necessary to think of the power of education , and the limits of this power : the effects of our cares are limited , because we are only able to apply them to unequal faculties , that are not all susceptible of the same development . The germs of all the human dispositions have been given to the infant by nature , but these germs have not all the same vigor . The feeble languish or decay when circumstances are opposed to them : the strong resist the influence of circumstances the most unfavorable , and if culture is given to them they push out immense shoots . In every individual the development of each faculty has an assigned limit which it can not pass ; it is the province of education to enable him to attain unto this limit , or to prevent him from arriving at it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we may influence him ; but that alone would give us very great power , if we knew the proper time to use it . I know not if the first impressions are the strongest ; the extreme inconstancy of children would lead me to doubt it ; but the first moments are the only ones when we can be almost sure of placing in advance the developments which we wish to cultivate ; it is then that we have the greatest chance of obtaining an influence over the measure of the various inclinations ; that is to say , over the character . feeling which is natural to all living creatures . The cat or dog , when treated kindly , return , in their way , the gentle emotions ; if beaten , they scratch or bite , or growl their resentment . And can we expect that the little beings , who are men and women in miniature , can , by a process of reasoning , bring their passions into subjection , to submit even to legitimate authority , when exercised in a way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( very important to settle beforehand our ideas on tite dispositions that we desire to cultivate : if we surrendtflit entirely to nature , we leave all which she has sown wfth her hands to grow at random . Here is the inconvftdence of that negative education , which we so much love to boast of When we have determined that nothing " shall be done , either to promote , or retard , or , as Rousseau says , * que rien ne soit fait ' ( that nothing shall be done , ) habits will be formed before we think of it ; we shall discover unexpected shoots which will quickly supplant those we hoped to obtain ; we shall be obliged to submit so much the more promptly to the necessity we had been anxious to avoid , that of correction and restraint ; we shall enter upon the prohibitory regimen , a resource sad and uncertain . It is delightful to be employed only with the education that upholds and encourages propensities ; that which represses and restrains them , always comes too soon for the motjier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flatterers of human nature , whom I will not at this time stop to refute . I will not examine if all the natural inclinations are of themselves lawful , if those that we call selfish or malevolent , are of indispensable utility for the defence or the preservation of the individual . As fer as they are necessary they are indestructible , and being fetal to morality , and consequently to happiness , whenever they pass this point , they are the enemies that education ought naturally to combat . In the social state , they always present themselves in excess , and are of such force that it is necessary to restrain and control them . Happily , from the tenderest infancy we may cultivate dispositions which either oppose or develop dangerous inclinations . Certain habits which have a salutary influence on the moral tendencies , may be given to the infant even before his character distinctly manifests itself A eakn and tranquil state of mind will quench the restless /z/ activity of his desires ; benevolence will direct his attention from himself ) and make him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of ; we may call them natural , since it is only necessary to banish whatever disturbs them ; and they are at the same time the first in date , and the most important to cultivate . A state of inward calm is produced by means of the outward , and for this reason , among a thousand , it is always very necessary to keep little children from weeping . This is something that scarcely needs recommending to mothers , but perhaps they do not sufficiently study the means of succeeding in it ; and they attribute to chanqe , many of the cries that are not without a real causa Our influence over the dispositions of children is so early , that we confound the effects of it with those of their constitution . According to Condillac , habits differ from natural inclinations , because they have a beginning ; but the distinction is not easy to establish , since we have never succeeded in detecting the beginning of habits : they are liable to form themselves with singular promptitude j and physical cares regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two events having followed each other in immediate succession three or four times ; the first will immediately give birth in the child to the expectation of that which ought to follow , and a multitude of pleasures and pains result to him from it , of which we are the authors . I have said that the lessons of experience make slow progress ii infancy , because it is long before the child can draw a conclusion from the facts which he knows , sufficiently general to enable him to decide in new cases . This is an act of the judgment above hh understanding ; but he retains a simple remembrance of the association of impressions which succeed each other . These become promptly and involuntarily connected in the brain , There is , then , from the earliest age , more that THE FIRST YEAR . l49 results from education than is thought for , and the part which nature plays is difficult to determine . The surest way for a vigilant mother is always to suppose that tears have a cause : if she carefully seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , than she imagines . Little children , whatever people say , are not capricious ; a hope disappointed , a suffering felt or foreseen , is almost always the reason of their cries . One means of preventing them will be to have as much regularity as possible , in the daily routine of life ; for , jduring infancy the utility of habit can not be contested . When the same impressions succeed each other in the same order , the most painful will be thereby softened , and the expectation of those which are agreeable will never be deceived . Little children are extremely sensitive to mistakes on this subject , which become to them a source of bitter tears . Their passions , too strongly excited , also have vent by weeping ; and it is better to keep them from violent emotions , even though agreeable ones . Consequently , it will be salutary to avoid making them a witness to the preparations for their meals. * Desire , sharpened by the sight of the object that can appease it , becomes in them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied , does not calm them , and hope is at that time rather a pain than a pleasure . With these , and other similar cares , we shall be able to maintain in children an habitual calm of the soul , which * We can not agree with the author in this ; we have seen a child often months , watch its nurse as she poured milk into a basin , put bread into it , and then wait with patience till it was warmed at the fire : - at first , it could scarcely be pacified , when the operations began , through its eagerness ; Jut at length it comprehended that a certain process was to be gone through , at the end of which its desiics for food were to be gratified : - this was a lessen for patience . Ed. /z/ // is of immense benefit , and yet easily lost , the most tial perhaps to their moral constitution , yet frail and fine* tuating . The nerves once violently shaken , are a long time in being restored ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one a class of faculties , and the most elevated , perhaps , which grow and ripen only in the tutelary shade of repose : this has relation to our finest intellectual endowments , as well as to our virtues . There is nothing admirable , nothing great in moral nature , of which serenity does not favor the development . Serenity ! charming word , which is applicable only to heaven and the soul , and seems to establish relations between them ; a state of existence where harmony reigns , where the heart is at peace with itself and the universe ! In this perfect ' equilibrium , an intelligent mind easily exerts its empire ; our various impulses become regulated , and harmonize with the eternal government . Why is this disposition so rare at the present day ? Why is it necessary to seek , in the remembrances of antiquity , this Je ne sais quoi , ( I know not what ) of pure , of elevated , of tranquil , which calms and exalts the soul ? Whence comes it that we meet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the less complicated social relations , docs man imbibe more easily the soft tint of that nature which surrounds him , and can he not find harmony even in the plenitude of his development ? However it may be , if we do not disturb it , this happy disposition will always be found in infancy . It shines with a pure lustre in the eyes of the child ; it reposes Opon his expanding forehead . One , in whom reigns this sweet serenity , seems glad to live ; - to breathe , to see , to move his little arms , is already a happiness for him . He welcomes all nature with gratitude ; it seems as if the young spirit took wing , and flew to meet her benefits . T-.et us not touch him ; bt us leave the child to delight /q/ lum8e.f With her ; let us fear to check the sweet harmony that 18 formed within him . As long as his look , full of intelligence , proves that his mind is occupied , let us never interrupt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mental activity ; it is more real and salutary , than that which comes from us . I Relieve that we often agitate chlidren too much : it is not best to leave them to become weary , I grant : ennui is a lethargy of the soul ; but that which incessantly leads to such a malady , is the excess of the diversions that we believe it necessary to give to young infants . One extreme gives birth to its opposite , and calm situations are the only ones that become indefinitely perpetual . The more serenity a child has had , the more he will desire it ; this disposition may be permanent , but it is not so with gaiety . Even with the children who love her much , joy is a passing inhabitant of this world ; she touches it with a light foot . It is necessary to receive her always kindly , sometimes gently to call her ; but when she is once are rived , we ought not to animate her too much . Immoderately excited , she brings tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres , which vibrate soon after in an opposite extreme . Consequently it is better to occupy little children with things , than with persons . It is not , as I have said , that &#9830; Thus we see when a child is carried much in the arms , it cries when the exercise ceases ; and many mothers are so careless of the fhtnre , as to indulge their infants in a habit of no advantage to themselves , and of great trouble to those who take care of them . A well-managed child after being carried abroad either to ride or walk , will often cry on being brought within doors , but having never gained any thing by its cries , it soon stops and turns its attention to something within its own grasp . But the wise mother soon discovers that too much excitement , by means of new objects , tends to disturb her child 's serenity . Ed. /z/ the distinction can be manifest to their eyes , but at least things are among the tranquil objects which do not excite them . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their judgment ripens by involuntary observations . With persons , on the contrary , their lives partake of sympathy and antipathy . The action which living beings exert over each other , puts all their passions in play , and even this action is so much the more animated , inasmuch as with children there is no communication of thought , and every thing passes in the dominion of feeling . Every one of their impressions producing an effect and obtaining a response , all their desires are expressed as soon as conceived ; hence tears and anger ' are of necessity perpetually changing situations . The impossibility of fixing upon any amusement , upon any train of ideas ; a fatiguing inquietude ; that impatience , that mental disturbance so injurious to all ; a state of irritation , injurious to the health also , are the results of the action too long continued which we exert over these little beings , and that we permit them to exert over us . An infant of six months , half lying in his cradle and playing with his little hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same at nine or ten months , when seated on a " thick carpet , he amuses himself with dispersing various objects , that he endeavors afterwards to catch again . While he is thus playing , you can return to your occupations ; a look , some token of intelligence from time to time , is sufficient to tell him that he is protected , and his security is perfect . Never deceive such a feeling . Go to him , if he appears to suffer , or if his mental action begins to languish , he can no longer amuse himself with what surrounds him . Then , however , do not hasten , and endeavor to give a short exercise to his patience : try to make him attach a meaning to this simple word , -. - wait . If this word has always expressed a sacred promise , he /q/ will learn from it gradually an important signification : the child will comprehend that you are decided to succor him , hut that you have a vocation yourself , that he ought to receive and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractable for it . A skilful Garmin physician , M. Friedlander , was astonished on arriving in France , to see to what extent they endeavored to excite the vivacity of little children. * * It appears to me , ' says he , ' that mothers play too much with their children in the first era of life , and that they too early excite their vivacity . In Germany , we often hear mothers recommending it to their children to keep still ; What reflections are not suggested by this simple observation ! Who can determine the influence of this difference of conduct ! Who shall say if the remarkable preponderance of the active faculties among one nation , and of the contemplative among the other , may not be assigned to this same cause , which is reproduced under various forms during the course of education . Do we know what we are doing , when we accelerate the progress of the faculties in one of the great divisions of moral being , and thus comparatively retard them in the other . Can we judge ta what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how far necessary to counterbalance others ' It is undoubtedly difficult to give exercise at pleasure to the faculties which , as their name indicates , are purely passive or contemplative , but always require time and tranquillity for their development . I know there are times of indisposition and suflfering , when we are obliged to divert children , and thereby keep them in motion . But because there is something opposed &#9830; Atmals of Education hy M , Guizot , Vol. i. p. 49 , /z/ to the execution of the best plans , we ought not therefore to lose sight of them . Mothers can acquire the talent of breaking habits gaily , and taking advantage of happy moments to recommence anew . Every thing is of consequence in education , and nothing is irreparable ; this is a truth we can not know too much . From serenity will naturally spring benevolence , another precious disposition which can not be too highly valued . In the healthiest state of the child , when the feeling of existence is at once calm and animated , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to his species ; the bond of humanity binds his soul to theirs . We are made for attachments ; it pleases us to commence together ; the wonderful gift of language , . sufficiently proves it . Love is the best thing in this life , it will also be our portion and reward in eternity . - It is therefore to follow an indication of Providence as well as to fulfil a sacred duty , when we open the heart of the child to the sweet affections which must enrich his two existences . And if a feeling too intense is often in this life a source of pain ; if it already costs the child many tears when he dwells exclusively on a single object , - benevolence , that temperate disposition , by expanding in him more and more , will moderate its excess. * * This feeling of benevolence , or general good will , is better cultivated by letting a child become the alternate care of different individuals , than where a mother or a nurse devote themselves almost wholly to it ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reftises to be caressed even by the other members of the family , becomes exacting and tyrannical towards the being over whom he finds he possesses such vast power . Although he may for this individual show much affection , it is a selfish one ; he loves her because she is necessary to him . When the child is accustomed to the offices and attentions of several , he becomes familiar with them , sometimes sees them engaged in other occupations than serving him , /q/ We do not expatiate sufficiently on the happiness attached to benevolence ; attention has been given to the sweetness of being the object of it , more than to that of experiencing the feeling . Nevertheless , he who is deeply imbued with its spirit is happy above all others , and the expression of contentment has already found a home in his features . If we analyze the various agreeable expressions of the human face , perhaps we shall find that they all participate of the expansive nature of benevolence , that all possess this charm which dilates the heart ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual to cultivate this happy disposition , if he can not be impelled to it from nobler motives . In this respect , much of education which has been careful in appearance , has been very imperfect . What a difference is there in regard to benevolence in different families ! for it is always by families that we find individuals grouped together under this relation also . There tLTe those where a mere stranger receives a cordial welcome ; where a glow of kindness shines on every countenance at his appearance : there are others where more refined manners scarcely conceal a cold repulse . Benevolence is however a rural disposition , which often becomes lost in the crowded city . Why do we cultivate so little , that which would remove so many obstacles , that which would so infallibly gain the heart , which would so easily supply the place of the hundred thousand rules of etiquette , and would prepare children for the exercise of that Christian charity , which is the true spirit of our duty towards man ? and learns to know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he loves are always to be devoted to him . This is a lesson that mothers , as wives , should understand themgelves , as well as teach to their children . Ed. /z/ The fact is , we do not think of cultivating it . When by chance , it exists , it is because we have permitted it to do so ; not because we have called it into being . We love better to prescribe than inspire ; we supjjfy the place of feeling by precept , and our frigid mode of education is reduced to the art of restraining . This art is however insufficient of Our prohibitions are always too numerous to be observed , and too few to apply to every fault . We would not assuredly desire our children to be subject to excesses of paslsion or violence , but the number of blameable acts being infinite , we can not foresee them all in order to interdict them . It is necessary then to address ourselves to impulses , if is only through the heart , that we produce a salutary effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone that we can call into action . But as the propensity to imitation , the natural result of sympathy , can actuate either to good or bad , it is as essential to bring children under the influence of feelings of benevolence as to preserve them from those of hatred and malignity . In relation to this last , if to none else , some mothers have been well informed . All who have reflected dn education , have felt the extreme importance of avouBi every act of impatience or of anger - every harsh accent , or stern look that might strike the senses of little children . * A nurse ' says M. Edgeworth , * influences the disposition of the whole life . Children possess an inconceivable facility to receive inclinations , and partake impressions of which they are yet incapable of appreciating the cause . Countenances speak to them , when as yet they de not comprehend words . ' Here is an indication for mothen and this sympathy is a power that is given to them over beings destitute of reason . By surrounding children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may soon communicate to their afiectionate feelings . /z/ No one knows how much we may gain towards g0iitleness of obaracter by using means like these ; they are such as are employed by the Cluakers , and we ought to take example ftom them in this respect . A very attentive mother , who observed such precautions , told me that during the first year of her daughter 's life , a child of extreme vivacity , no trace of anger could be perceived in her . It is a rule of English education , always to ispeak very low to little children . , Although the means of cultivating happy dispositions are well known , and I have in part pointed them out myself , I will , nerertheless , retrace them here . The first , which regards tranquillity , and this tranquillity mingled with joy called serenity , consists in causing peace to reign around the child , and if possible to surround it with agreeable and tranquil objects ; the second , to place about him those persons only , in whom such dispositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I say actually , for aftectation is here perfectly useless . Nothing equals the coldness of children towards hypocritical demonstrations , if not in sympathy with theirnatural inclinations . The last means , in fine , when such disposition as henevoleace or friendship is of a nature to manifest itself by acts , is to fix it in the spirit of the child , by obtaining from him some material proof of his sentiments . This last means , which is very powerful , ought to be employed with discretion , for otherwise it will produce an un &vorable; effect . Do we wish , for example , to famil ianze the little child with a new-comer , at whose near appreach he has been frightened ? it is necessary at first , " that the stranger retire a little . When he is at some distance , if he assume a gracious air , and solicit a smile , we shall see the little countenance brighten insensibly , but something of fear still remains upon it . The nurse gently advancing him forward , we shall in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , whom he had at first feared ; but if she attempted to seize the little hand and put it prematurely in an unknown hand , the child would utter cries of fear , and would not see the stranger for a long time without repugnance . Thus , in cutting short a budding disposition , she would have implanted hatred , m the place of love . Similar examples are incessantly renewed in education , and in regarding them with attention we shall see how often they are presented to us in life . The study of the hearts of these young infents , is more instructive for ours than we &ncy.; We find in them all our involuntary sensations , all our first impressions . Imagination is in its nature eternally young , and the child always lives in the man , although every man does not exist in the child . ' t /z/ OBSERVATIONS ON THE eOMMENCEMENT OF . THE /z/ r /z/ ** The sensations accompany man at his entrance into the world , and encompass him on every side ; imagination , memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people the desert where feeling reigned alone . " - Riyarol . Several months usually pass away before the child mho has begxm to speak , has made great progress in language . He learns , from time to time , a new word ; but as Fong as these words remain scattered in his brain , and he is imable to connect them together , the acquisitions that he makes of this kind , appear quite independent of his moral development , and have not much influence with regard to it . Nevertheless , this development is progressing , it advsmces even rapidly . If we could measure the steps of intelligence , the first woul appear the most wonderful . The young feculties seem to ' pass as if by magic over an immense distance ; that which separates the purely sensitive life of the child , ' from the intellectual life of the man : at the age of which I speak , this step is not yet taken , but is about to be . Desires , affections , pains , pleasures , every thing is ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles us in many points , but he does not think in words , and it is in this respect , above all , that he differs from us . It is with difficulty we can conceive such a manner of existence : language is to us so familiar , that it forms a part of ourselves , and we know not what we should be without its assistance . Man is , to use the expression of the Hebrews , a speaking soul : the succession of ideas is but slightly interrupted within him . Children and animals are not so ; the same things present themselves to their minds , and not the terms which are the signs of them . For them to think , is to see again ; it is to experience the sensations which the real object would have excited . Every thing passes in their heads in pictures , or rather in animated scenes , where life is partially reproduced . As the various impressions , and even the emotions , are the great means of development in infency , the child has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply them without ceasing ; every thing which promises a renewal of them gives him pleasure . He has a passion for walking - he runs towards the door with vivacity , and the mere sight of his hat transports him . If we are to take him out in a carriage , he flutters with such impatience , that we can hardly hold him . The commotion in , and about him , is his joy . It is not only present objects which act upon the in &nt; ; their ideal representation also often possesses the same power ; if he is seized with an . ardent desire for something , every other feeling is for the moment suspended : we endeavor to divert him ; but he sees not , he hears not , and his mind is wholly fixed upon the image of the object which can satisfy his wishes . Even when not under the influence of any passion , the scenes which he has witnessed may be renewed in his imagination , and agitate him . A child who has been much amused during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening ; his eyes shine with a bright lustre ; a deep red tinges his cheeks ; his faculties , unquestionably too violently exercised , are so occupied , that silence and darkness can not make him feel any weariness . This existence , in all things external , as well as in all present or remembered impressions , is prolonged beyond the period when the child begins to talk . Numerous traces af it remain in youth , and we may find it at every age in men of imagination . In these , the succession of distinct thoughts is less active than that of pictured scenes , and the feelings which accompany them. * We are affected in a similar mannner during our dreams . There all is action , emotion , imagery : we are rather enthusiasts than reasoners , and I doubt whether the most philosophic heads occupy themselves much in their sleep with seeking after truth . These results of the quickness of sensation in a young soul can easily be conceived ; but why is it that we are not more astonished at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moral world ? Causes altogether immaterial , - causes , the action of which suppose a development much more advanced than his own , * The insane , in whom imagination becomes more vivid as the light of reason fades , often experience this renewal of past impressions so strongly as to believe that the scenes of other days or of years long past are existing before them ; and we sometimes hear them addressing , and as it were , holding conversations with friends who have long been dead - they weep or laugh , according to the nature of the images before them ; - one female who labored under a malady of this nature for years , seemed to live almost wholly in the past . On one occasion she laughed inmioderately , and was then heard to say , * Oh grandmother , how queer you look in that litle red cloak . ' Her grandmother had been dead thirty years . Ed. /z/ produce upon him inexplicable effects . Our impressions , our feelings are transmitted to the child , by means of indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he derives intelligence of them . Therefore it has not surprised those who for want of reflection think it natural that children should be like us ; and therefore it has hardly been observed by those whose occupation it is to search into causes . To have recourse to instinct , is undoubtedly to abandon the elucidation of such mysteries ; but it is however to instinct alone that we can have recourse . It was necessary that there should be a supernatural means , as it were , to hold communication with the child before he could follow the long route of associating signs with ideas ; may also recognize in him a faculty almost of divination , that sympathetic comprehension which keeps him in the current of our feelings . The same faculty which manifested itself in the child of six weeks , has become greatly developed in one of a year old . At this age , a child who is active , and consequently improved , reads impressions on the features . You see reflected in him all the gradations of your temper ; he doe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partakes them , and in remaining a stranger to the causes he associates himself with all the effects . It is not precisely that he is sorrowful because you have pain , or is joyful because you have pleasure ; for he does not conceive of his existence apart from yours . He lives in you , and feels with you , without power to do otherwise . He is a mirror where your moral state is represented with an astonishing fidelity . At a still later period in an infant of nine months old , I witnessed a fact that I will relate here as an examjde . The child was playing gaily upon his mother 's knees , when a woman entered the chamber whose countenance Avas expressive of calm but deep sadness . This person /q/ whom he knew , without having any particular affection for her , from that time fixed his attention . By degrees his countenance became discomposed , his playthings fell from his hands , and at last he threw himself weeping upon his mother 's bosom . It was not fear , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suffered , and relieved himself by tears . likewise , at the age of fifteen or sixteen months , a child who is present at a grave lecture , and sees a thoughtful expression on every face , is soon possessed with a certain reverence , and if you do not prolong the time suflficiently to weary him , the same effect will be produced on all similar occasions : this explains how a religious feeling , which is apparently too elevated to be experienced by in &ncy,; may germinate early in young souls . An impression which is at first without object , but which bears some analogy to the solemn emotion a sincere worship can inspire , is communicated by sympathy to the child . He feels that he is in a holy region , the idea that it possesses something sacred is gradually admitted into his heart , and when afterwards we speak to him of God as the invisible object of our adoration , the idea of a hidden power no longer surprises him ; he believes , that he has felt the imposing effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are modifications which are as fugitive as shadows ; but the oflener they are repeated , the easier it will be to reproduce them , and in a short time we shall see certain inclinations arise from them which will be easy to cultivate . The progress of the human heart is the same thing ; impressions light at first , but often reiterated become more and more decided ; they soon bring into the soul a disposition which always facilitates the renewal of them , and thus prepares the way for those sentiments which infiueflbe our life . /z/ A multitude of emotions , of passions , of divers impres** sion9 which in a certain sense may be regarded as natural , ' are communicated to the child by our agency ; the germs of them existed in him undoubtedly , for it is necessary to the rapid growth of any impulse that there should be already in the soul ft disposition to receive it ; but this disposition may remain inert and dormant , and we ought always to distinguish the inclinations which inMlibly manifest themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely retard . Thus vehement complaint , impatience , resistance accompanied by cries and violent gesticulations , are inevitable among children ; but the desire of vengeance is not always so ; they do not all wish to make others suffer , because they do . And if in struggling they strike to the right and to the left , it is without any intention of wounding , when they have never seen in another the expression of such a design : this , at least , I am induced to believe is the case with regard to some children ; but it will be necessary to confirm this opinion by more precise observations . The unreasonable fears which children often experience , are owing for the most part to the contagion of example : this has been remarked by Rousseau - a dangerous guide sometimes , but often an excellent observer : he also advises us to accustom children from the earliest age to the sight of ugly and repulsive animals . They have then but little idea of danger , and are liable to be subject to antipathies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of surprise at the ap.pearance of some striking object . They turn away , for example , at the approach of a person clothed in black , but they would voluntarily grow familiar with this one , sooner than with any other , if they lived in a family whose members all wore mourning . In Africa , the little negroes /z/ are afraid of the whites , and it is the idea of a white devil that terrifies them. * The pleasure of exerting influence is already very . great in children of this age . If they feel sympathy , they exact it also ; and it chagrins them when it is refused ; likewise raillery , which is an insulting manner of refusing it , shocks and piortifies them . All disagreement between them and us , is painful to them , and they incessantly solicit returning concord . If they have once made us smile by some pretty way , they will repeat it to satiety , and think it hard if we smile no longer : when we do not yieljd immediately to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the privation : often indeed a sentiment of wounded pride impels them to disdain a tardy offer ; they reject with scorn the object that they would have obtained from our friendship , and then their pouting lips , averted looks , and frowning brows manifest the affront they have received . * It would be profitable in infancy , to accustom children to obscurity , which they are not yet afraid of : we ought only to be careful to run to them at the slightest call : it is important at the same time that the impression produced by night be not so novel as to be very strong , and that they attach to it no idea of suffering , or of loneliness , otherwise they would have met no sooner with some frightful object than the image of it would be presented to them in darkness . A child of two years old , on being asked the cause of his repugnance to remaining in a gloomy place , replied , ' I do not love chimneysweepers : ' if he had been accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this phantom . Nevertheless , in regard to this we can not speak confidently : it may be that the complete absence of sensation during the night naturally produces on the soul a painfil influence , and may be to it a state of bereavement approaching to desolation and afiright . But this is not observable in infancy . At that era , when we ought never to leave children alone , the example of gaiety makes them easily endure th privation of light . Ep.J /z/ It is to carry too hi the desire of harden* ing little children to pain , when we refuse them the tribute of a just pity in their sufferings . It would undoubtedly be inexpedient to agitate their nerves by caresses , when we see them disposed to support with cheeffulujafis little misfortunes ; but when they really feel sickness or pain , we ought to pity them ; otherwise , we shall harden their hearts , and soon they will lightly treat the sufferings of others . When we have testified to them that we participate their sufferings , it will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propensity to imitation . After having felt with us , the child wishes to act as we do : this is very natural . He believes himself able to execute whatever he sees us do , and his attempts , at once graceful and awkward , are a source of great amusement to us j we make them an object of pleasantry , so that similar enterprizes which were in him the effect of a serious desire we cause to become perverted . Natural endeavors at im- * It is very easy to teach children to bear slight hurts with tude ; not indeed by neglecting them on such occasions , but by diverting their attention from their own feelings ; we may even teach them to laugh at slight accidents ; a child of eleven months old , in its first attempts to walk had many falls , and when it met with one which caused it to weep for a moment , it would soon stop and change its wailing into a tone of laughter . Had it been pitied and mourned over , the hurt would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention and devotedness , that they usually make the most of an accident , when they see is the means of securing them . It may be the best way to treat grown people who are disposed to make their own ailments a subject of discourse , not unfeelingly to repulse them , but gradually to turn their thoughts to other subjects . In this way hmnan beings might be of great service to each other ; but alas , they are in many cases disposed rather to trifle with , or take advantage of each others weaknesses , than to assist in conquering them ! Ed. /q/ kaAaa are soon premeditated , almost aflected , while he continues them for our diversion . A lady receives a letter , and reads alond some parts of it to those who are about her , without dreaming that she il heard by her child . He very ioon seizes the first paperthat he can find , holds it up before his fiice , and pronounc ' et at hazard all the words which he remembers , connecting them by a noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scene begin to laugh , the child does not cease his reading . A glance , cast secretly upon his mother , betrays in him a comic mixture of the gravity which he wishes to preserve as actor , and the gaiety which he partakes . Animated by success , he increases his attempts more and more , and at last he is nothing but a little buffoon , who wishes to make merriment . It did not however begin in pleasantry , and he intended to give himself to a serious occupation . Thus our mahners alter the simplicity of children , in associating the idea of the effect which they produce on us , with their first impressions ; but what quickness of observation may we not suppose from one such scene , and a thousand others of the same kind which I could relate. * Where has the child acquired this knowledge of our nature , this skill in buffoonery , and this taste for admiration , which has inflated his young heart ? The intelligence of sympathy with which he is endowed , is Unquestionably very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of words . But if one had not preceded the other , all the words which express the feelings , the affections , in short the moral ideas , would long remain without any meaning to the child . &#9830; All the facts which I have cited as examples have been actually witnessed . Ed. /z/ It may be that the interior of the child , moulds itself by the exterior of others . He sees an action which he copies , accompanied by a certain expression of physiognomy that he copies also ; and soon , at a future period , it becomes manifest within him . He becomes grave from imitation of the serious , tender from that of persons of sensibility ; and once imbued with these sentiments , his soul is more and more modified by them . This phenomion appears singular , but it is not without analogy in human life . We see men endowed with the talent of mimicry , who with the expression of countenance of those they imitate , assume their manners and turn of mind ; and who often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality than themselves , have ideas come to them that they would otherwise never have originated. - Dress has its influence likewise , because it invests those who wear it , with a countenance correspondent to its appropriate character . The power of the military costume is well known , and it has been proved in the English schools that one of the best means of giving habits of order , of sobriety , and a kind of dignity to unfortimate wad depraved children , was to clothe them decently . The effect of the outer upon the inner man exists at every , period of life , and like most of the effects of instinct , it is most marked in children ; but our purely moral affections exert over them an influence still more direct . It is more powerful , more rapid , more electrical , if we may so speak ; and it exists between the child and us , in secret and mysterious communications from soul to soul . Whatever it may be , sympathy and imitation dispose of every thing in these young creatures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , of their actiotis . Those poor children who are bom blind do not walk , because they have not seen others walk . It is necessary first to raise them , then to make them stand erect , and /q/ then to advance their feet one after the other . Take away sympathy and imitation , and what will remain to the child Faculties and inclinations , undoubtedly . Faculties put him in a situation to imitate us , and inclinations determine his choice between objects of imitation . Children do not copy every thing they see done ; they follow only the examples which correspond to their inclinations . This source of diversity , joined to the difference of circumstances , is sufficient to explain the variety of characters we find among them , notwithstanding we always see them choose only among such as are offered to their observation . Self-love , as we have seen it , derives its source from two feelings , the pleasure that children experience in having succeeded in some enterprize , and their desire to see us participate in this pleasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to raise themselves before a chair , they cry , they gesticulate until we have remarked them ; triumphant joy is paintea in their eyes , and our applause renders them tender and caressing . It is thus that these divers elements , the necessity of agreeable and varied sensations , such as acting , imitating , influencing , exciting , and feeling sjonpathy , bring forth in young children all the attributes of human nature . We may seethe whole retinue by the time they are a year old , and if we had more penetration we should discover the traces of them much earlier . The power of imagination is already great at this age , but I delay speaking of it , until the period when the child , being in possession of language , we shall have a surer method of appreciating its influence . /z/ " Nothing penetrates so sweetly and so deeply into the soul , as the influence of example . " - Locke . The reign of sympathy in young children is the cause of the power that we exert over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were not at all influenced by reason , we could only govern them by force , if Heaven had not opened to us the way to their heart Instinct , which obliges them to live in harmony with us , is the means designed by Providence to make them adopt our sentiments insensibly , and to mould their will by ours . As such an instinct endures but a little while ; from the time that it is no longer indispensable , it begins to be withdrawn by the hand which seemed to have lent it as a supplement to intelligence . Soon the entire scene is changed . When once we undertake to govern the child by reason , that is to say by showing him that there is a necessity imposed upon him by the nature of things , that of thinking as we do , diminishes . He applies himself to judge by our words , more than our dispositions ; he lives for himself , and not for us . We should undoubtedly endeavor to make him abandon this selfishness at some future day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is three or four years old , he has no happiness but with you . Hid necessities , his pleasures , the security which he wishes to enjoy , put him in your power . Other children amuse him an instant , and soon trouble him ; the little passions called into action interfere , and the impossibility of being understood by them , brings him back to you . But when once the young intelligence has taken wing , when the easy use of language permits them to propose a common design , and to agree together , your child will escape from you continually . To run , to jump , to climb , to exercise his powers with the companions of his sports , will be his true enjoyments ; they are independent of you , and if you have not secured his affections in season , he may return to you from necessity , but BOt from the effect of a voluntary choica I say more , at six years the tastes , the character are almost formed ; at least there already exists an imprelBsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , headstrong , irritable , he will rei ! nain so until the era when a new development will have had time to operate . If he do not possess certain decided inclinations ; if flowers , birds , and rural objects do not speak to his imagination , it ill not be easy to make him acquire a love of nature ; and a taste for the fine arts , which are but images of nature , he will remain a stranger to ; if in short , social affections , religious feeling , and a certain respect for ideas of order and duty , are not manifest in his soul , - I do not assuredly pretend to say that all is lost , - but I say that the child was unhappily gifted , or that the parents have already reason to reproach themselves seriously . It seems as if we endeavored to shut our eyes upon the importance of the first years : it is a period we speak of with levity . Because a young child can not comprehend pur conversation , because he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being of so little /z/ consequence , that his physical nature alone is to be regarded . As his life passes in play , we look upon him as a plaything himself . Every thing in him seems insignificant , because every thing is as yet undecided ; but if this indecision were annihilated , we should longer possess power over him . " yhen you have permitted the fevorable season of sympathy to pass away without gathering its happy fruits , such as the desire to please , to oblige , to assist the sujSering , * a willingness to deprive self of pleasure in order to bestow it upon others ; you soon reach an unwelcome period , when the child will comprehend your exhoitationft , in a certain degree , without receiving any sensible impression from them . Your reasonings will then be listened to , comprehended , perhaps approved , but they will in reality produce little effect on him , because you would call upon principles that would not have acquired sufficient activity in his soul . The child will perceive , with indi ference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they truly follow the one from the other ; but it is their conne tion that he will admit , and not the ideas themselves . H would be in the condition of one who hearring you , add a coliunn of figures aloud , would judge that you proceeded ; regularly , and who if you said three and three make would correct you ; but without its following from that these numbers were representations of real value to him . &#9830; A child may have a desire to please , and to oblige , and to retieve distress ; but in order to render these feelings active , there must be in , the character a capacity of sell-denial , without which , the . best dispositions are but as the blighted flowers of spring , which produce nq fruit . Self-denial can not be too early taught the child ; aid yet we commend its fine feelings , its compassionate sympathy , without reflecting , that they cost nothing , and are indeed worth nothing , ezc as they impel to action and lead one to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus that a child of six or seven years old often listens to your moral discourses . He can not contest their principles , often indeed he appears to admit them with pleasure ; if he has great fecility of speech , perhaps he will forthwith deduct some interesting consequence , but do not depend too much on the results of his conviction . When the heart is not already well disposed , such an exercise of the mind has but little influence upon the conduct . The development of this fundamental perception might encourage us much , and it would be actually premature but I will however make this remark ; since the child was rendered capable of experiencing affections before he could form any combination of ideas , must it not be that the Creator commenced by preparing the elements which were to compose his future morality ? If we lose the opportunity of communicating good feelings to the child , by neglecting to avail ourselves of the aid of sympathy , transient as it is , we reverse an admirable order . Then , when the season for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no proper lever to act with . Our principles of morality become empty forms , to which the heart responds nothing . If the importance , of the sentiments which we inspire in very young children , were not proved , still it would be necessary to suppose it ; it would be at first the surest way ; and afterwards , would be the means from which we should have the most to hope for the future . All imaginable resources have been employed for other ages . Reason has done what she could , and instruction likewise ; punishments , rewards , the extreme excitement of self-love , all the common artillery of education has been brought into play , and often with very little advantage . The only thing that has not been attempted , at least with regularity , is to give a sort of positive education to infancy ; not only to remove /z/ from the ohild the example of evil , but to draw him with an imperceptible movement towards that which is good , and make him enter life in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been methodically followed , yet how many times it has been by inspiration How many happy characters , how many amiable qualities are owing to this sympathy of infiincy , which mothers know so well how to call forth , of which they alvrajrs make so sweet , and sometimes so judicious a use ! But what greater service could be rendered to early education , than to extend and regulate , if possible , that which tenderness and good sense have ofteii dictated to mothers 1 The means of influencing young children is well known to them ; it is also truly pointed out by Providence , since it first consists in loving them . It is the mother , , or rather it is her love , which excites sweet emotions in die new-born soul : her looks , her caresses awaken affections which only require to be brought forth . Without these testimonies of attachment , such affections would perhaps never be formed . An unfortunate child deprived of maternal caresses , might not , until very late , adinit a ray of love into his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all the better kind posses by children , would lie dormant until an exterior impulse called it into being . But of what consequence would it be at what time this took place ? Would they less surely be animated by good inclinations ? What is more in &Uible; than the love of mothers ? In that nothing is accidental , nothing depends upon circumstances , or even upon the qualities of the child . It is not only for the preservation of his frail existence that he has been confided to the strongest of all instincts , but also because he possesses a moral life ; his body and his young spirit have been placed under the same safeguard , the most certain and most powerful here below : /q/ The heart of the child then , as we have seen , is active before the intellect : the spark of feeling is the first to kindle , as also the least liable to be extinguished . * The law of love which produces love , ' says the illustrious Chalmers , * will be continued in eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the innocent creature yet in the cradle manifests it , and we find it still existing in the most hardened criminal . If an unhappy wretch , who appears dead to all morality , sees himself the object of a sincere good will , a dawning of emotion is excited in hbt withered heart , and he seems animated by a new principle . ' It is so truly love which produces love in the child , that he possesses an extraordinary tact for discovering it . His preferences , which appear unaccountable , are founded on an inconceivable divination in regard to this point . Ugliness and the infirmities of age do not repulse him , the most essential services affect him but little ; it is love that he wants , love without beauty , without external grace , without even a title to gratitude : but when he finds its expression , the acts of kindness which prove it redouble his attachment . On the other hand , his aversion for cold and severe countenances is insurmountable . It is the more necessary to avoid exciting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but evil . Persons whom the child does not love , exert over him only an unhappy influence : he imitates their bad examples , and not their good . Fear , impatience , anger , are transmitted from such , and hatred even facilitates the communication of them . But in order to possess the gentle affections , it is necessary to love : tenderness is the warmth which is essential for the development of goodly firuits . It is the first nourishment , and like milk to the young life , which can grow and strengthen only by means of such an aliment. /z/ It is not enough , then , that children be benevolent , - they must love : benevolence opens the heart , but love alone warms and fills it . It is more nearly allied to greatness of soul than sympathy : the latter may exist , and sometimes exerts too great an empire among feeble minds ; but a certain moral vigor can alone render us capable of attachment . Therefore I would not advise to turn aside the first affections of children without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crisis we ought to spare them , if we can . If they have naturally great sensibility , there is some danger in putting it to such a proof : we have seen poor children who were separated from those they loved most , imbibe a deep melancholy , and die ; if on the contrary their affections are cold and fickle , they will become more so from change : they will not be fixed on any thing , and the child will soon manifest selfishness , a vice very odious in itself , and which corrupts the first principles of education . The jealousy of mothers induces them sometimes to remove inferior rivals , who seem to be usurping their place in the hearts of the children ; but in so doing , they do not understand their own interest . The affections may be transplanted more easily than augmented . The sentiment already formed may change its object , but the difficulty is , that it might require more power to turn away the child from being occupied solely with himself When once he prefers himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the love of self is the most feithful of all attachments . At the age of five or six years , children almost always adhere from choice to their mother , dueen of the mansion , the distributor of great favors , the only one in a situation to appreciate and reward merit ; for be her talents and agreeable acquirements ever so small , she procures pleasures and employs a power , the effect of which on /q/ young imaginations nothing can counterbalance . She ought then to be tranquil about the future , and not forcibly break old ties , that from their very nature will become weakened . It would be better however if the heart first declared itself for the mother . Infidelity , which brings him back to her , has nothing interesting in itself , and sometimes it is very tardy in its operations . It results also from an illconcealed rivalry ; from vanity in the child , who sees his afifections contented for ; and sometimes frogi a shade of li3rpocrisy . ' You pretend to prefer me , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are ill do you desire that your attendant should take care of you rather than me ? * * Because , ' replied the child , * when I am sick , I forget that I ought to love you best . ' Moreover , we can acquire a knowledge of infancy , only so far as we know how to inspire it with attachment . In vain do we cherish our children , when we feel that they do iioi us ; we want that confidence , that selfnbandonment which makes us accessible to them ; our air of inspection , of supervision , repels them ; they are strained in our presence , and the great influence of sym- ! pathy is exerted by others , rather than ourselves . But what advice can be given relative to this period of life , which ought not to be accompanied by restrictions , and what prudence is not necessary in the management of so much weakness ! If sympathy is too frequently called into action , it renders children inconstant , susceptible in the extreme to all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their hearts ; it often agitates them ; it moves them to a degree of which we little thought ; and considering the uncertainty of human things , it may , as I have said , expose them to much sorrow . Violent and impassioned caresses are also bad . lifiss Edgeworth advises mothers to prohibit them , an ( J /z/ ph3r8ician8 condemn them for other reasons . They are also a source of future injustice , since at first they are lavished merely as a boon , and are afterwards refused to the real merit of the child . They may be also attended by disastrous consequences , as they produce a thirst for love , which , not being allayed in the second stage of in &ncy,; mingles sometimes with the impressions of another age , and may augment its danger . Let your caresses then be to encourage and to fortify , if I may so speak ; let them possess gaiety without extravagance , and above all banish from them a langu ish ing effeminacy . In proportion as you make them tokens of approbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet exchange of sentiments is the only means also of developing the intelligence of the child . Every other language , except that of kindness , stupifies him , and lessens him in his own eyes . Thus , I think it very wrong to make frequent use of a harsh and threatening accent , to turn little children from certain luiscluoToas acts : you make them suspend the action , I admit , but it is because you disturb their feelings . You interrupt the train of their ideas . They do nothing but weep , and when they are appeased , they have forgotten the thing that occupied them ; but they do not imagine that you have forbidden it , and they recommence it on the first occasion . When they give a meaning to our words , it is from sym* pathy : the accent and the countenance explain it , and hence the extreme inequality in their fecility of comprehending us . If , then , you cut short this disposition by violence , they will understand you no longer . It is true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of a certain act , they may at length abstain from it ; it is thus animals are trained . But if you adopt this kind of education with the child , he will soon receive from it another , Witness of your anger , he will at once take /q/ example from you , and the injurious words with which you load him , will before long be applied to yourself . The instinct of imitation is stronger in children than fear ; and , imless we suppose an excess of severity , happily become very rare , we are models to them , more than objects of fear . - We find in animals , precisely the reverse . The fear of each other acts upon the different species , while the love of imitation is confined to those of the same species . If you maltreat a dog , and he menaces you , he does it but to defend himself , and not to imitate you . We do not see , monkeys excepted , any living creature out of our species , mimic our actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother , and particularly human creatures . Never be angry , then , either with your child , or in his presence . Until three or four years old , the most virtuous indignation will be but anger in his eyes . You would take his cause in hand , but soon the motive would escape him , and the effect which struck his senses , would alone act upon his sensitive imagination . When we think of the immense advantage which men of self-possession have over others in the world , we ought to seek to procure this superiority for children . In subjection , as he is by this condition , the young being nevertheless feels mentally free , and he possesses a feeling of independence : at his age he understands nothing of servility , of entreaty , of condescension , or even of the effect of fear . The child of eighteen months acts as he pleases ; his weakness , and our power he does not think of His solicitations , which are never humble , become orders but too easily . When he seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he delights to please you . If your threats succeed in frightening him for a moment , recovered from bis astonishment , he is /z/ not the more docile for them ; and your anger , by bewildering his mind , increases his disposition to irritability. * Thus if we knew how to distinguish the results of our conduct , we should see them increase with time , and always find them more extensive than we imagined . The various stimulants to the moral development which I have spoken of , sympathy , love , instinct of imitation , expectation of pleasures and pains , are so many threads which may be woven by ourselves . The nature of the in &nt; is manifested by his avidity to receive sensations , by the power which he soon manifests of employing them , of transforming in a thousand ways the materials that we , sooner or later , furnish to his mind . We influence chil- * We sometimes see parents correcting very young children to make them cease crying . Thefollowing fact , it is feared , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gentleman was playing with his child of a year old , who , as he thought mireasonably , began to cry . He ordered silence ; the child did not obey j the father then began to whip it , but this terrified the child , and increased its cries . The mother interceded but in vain . The father thought the child would be ruined unless it was made to yield , and renewed his chastisement with increased severity . The child shrieked with still more violence - the mother in tears turned from the sight of what she knew to be injudicious , and felt to be cruel ; but she knew her husband thought himself in the right , and would be inflexible to her entreaties ; yet she often returned , as a momentary quiet made her hope the scene was at an end ; but the child was quiet only from exhaustion , and renewed its cries as soon as it regained strength . At length it sunk into sleep , mcapable of further effirt , and was delivered into the arms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking into its back , and thus the cause of its first cries was ascertained . Both parents now watched in intense agony over the sufferer , who in its disturbed sleep gave strong indications of a tendency to convulsions ; every nerve seemed agitated , and convulsive sobs at intervals showed that even in sleep , the mind was torn by terriffing fears . The father wisely resolved never again to correct a young child to make it quiet . Ed. /q/ dreD unintentionally by the effect of the most necessary cares ; the question is not , whether we modify the soul of the child , - but whether we do it understandingly . To leave nature to act , in the most reasonable sense of this expression , is to give the feculties an opportunity to te-establish their equilibrium , when this has been destroyed by misfortune . Then the free choice of the child ordinarily inclines him to fix upon the state which is most salutary to him ; it exercises the faculties that have remained inactive , and gives repose to those which we have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is generally a prudent measure in education to make alternate use of opposite situations . When calm and activity , silence and noise , solitude and society succeed each other at regular intervals , all is not disturbance and confusion in the new-born infant ; each influence acting in its turn , produces the good that is appropriate to it , and we succeed in distinguishing its effect ; from this we infer , that the little child should sometimes be left to himself , and be permitted to manifest his own inclinations . Therefore mechanical means of safety , such as secure him against accidents , have at least the advantage of procuring some independence to the child . But on the contrary , those which , like leading-strings , oblige us to follow them constantly ; which either subje-ct him to our caprices , or us to cares ; those , I say , combine a bad moral eflt with physical inconvenience . But whatever hope we may found upon a tendency to equilibrium in infancy , it would be very imprudent to depend upon the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the formation of bad inclinations , it would never be sufficient to destroy them , when once contracted . On the contrary , there is in every inclination a preservative instinct , which incessantly nourishes and strengthens it . So that if the inclination is danger-/z/ 182 nmvwmcE of stxpatht. out , what we call its nature , or the probable comae ci its derelopmeiit in iai from bemg fitrorable to fatare morality . It is thereto true that the first propensity of the character desenres oar most serious attention , and that a talent for observation , * is an inestimable gift to a mother . * This talent must be coltiyated by the mother who wishes either the ph3rBical or moral weW-being of her child . She must obterce the daily condition of its bowels , the effect which food of different kinds has upon its stomach , or the effect of medicines , ( if sach are necessary ) - she must observe what are the most favorable hours for its sleep , and what degree of exercise and exposure it will bear - es pecially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a calming effect upon its spirits , and what is the best method of man aging its disposition : in short , much of a mother 's duty is conb prised in this one word , observation . Indeed , action is connectei with it ; but few mothers fail in this - most of them do enough fc their children ; but the difficulty is , their actions are too seldom tht result of observation . Some nveihod is better than none , even though it be a bad one . There is always hope that a person who seeks to do right , will get into the right way : while of those who make no effort , we can have no hope .

The end of the second year is remarkable among children for the rapid progress that they usually make in speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or ill ; - but we may observe a great difference in this respect ; the unequal distribution of nature 's gifts are already manifest . The art of speaking , requires the concurrence of many faculties , moral and physical ; and if any one of these remains undeveloped , it becomes an obstacle in the way of improvement . Indeed , to appreciate sounds , an ear is necessary , and to articulate them with flexibility in the organs of the throat , understanding . Mind is necessary to comprehend words , and memory to retain them . When such gifts are found united in an eminent degree , which is very rarely the case , the child will speak very well at two years old . But how has the child , who is so inferior to animals of the same age in many respects , come in possession of /z/ this excellent gift of speech ? By what means has he obtained it 1 This I could have wished to elucidate by minute observations , whereas I can only give a feeble outline . The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least have recommended it to the attention of mothers . Nothing can be more interesting , than to see the understanding gradually emerge from the cloud that enveloped it , soaring aloft each time that it discovers a new expression , and making its first acquirements the means of obtaining those of greater consequence . The child , a stranger in the world of things which he yet scarcely knows , soon feels the necessity of entering the world of words , which correspond to them , and which will soon furnish avenues to thought . At that time he commences a more intellectual existence , where images of things , and the tumultuous desires which they excite , always reign , but which he soon becomes able to tranquillize . Aided by the intelligence of some mothers , I have collected the following facts : - Words , separated by the young mind , from the sentence to which they properly belong , occupy a place by themselves , in hiis memory . Of this number are , first , nouns , or the signs attached to persons or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntarily repeat the most striking syllable of these , that which has given the idea of forming double syllables , of the first words we teach them . These are nothing but the articulations which constituted the natural warbling of the child , before he began to speak . Thus , at the age of seven or eight months , he constantly pronounces the syllables pa , ma , da , but without attaching any meaning to them . When he comes to associate them afterwards with the idea of certain objects , and thus to make a language of them , it ts because we have given him the example , but perhaps with ' out being conscious of its effect . /q/ B undoubtedly appears simple enough , that the child learns to name material objects : when we have often shown them to him , at the same time giving utterance to certain sounds , the thing afterwards awakens the idea of the word , and the word that of the thing . But it is more difficult to conceive how he attaches a sign to that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are always expressed or supposed by verbs , have no permanent type in nature ; they do not come within the scope of the child 's senses when he names them , and he says * go , ' at a time when one did not go . It must be that he has the idea expressed by the verb , that this idea is at once clear and flexible , and applies itself successively to every circumstance of the action . Now , how has he conceived a notion which seems to be an abstraction of the most subtle kind ? It appears that it has been given to him by gestures ; actions are the natural subjects of pantomime , which we also call the language of action . We gesticulate a great deal with children , without thinking of it ; they are also great gesticulators themselves . If then a particular word has always accompanied a particular movement , the two ideas become connected in their brain . It is true there are several words which are verbs to us , but not always so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the idea of water , or milk : to walk ' is either the open air , or the door . But when they begin to expect that we shall act in consequence of these words , the action acquires more and more consistency in their minds , and they at length truly attach a sign to it . It is worthy of remark that even animals comprehend verbs , whenever they express an action . We ordinarily make use of these words to dogs and horses , when we wish them to obey us , and then we naturally employ them in the imperative . The child as well as the negro , makes use at first of the infinitive alone . As he forms no idea /z/ of time , and as be does not comprehend pronouns until a late period , he is reduced to this mode of speech . Two words , which the child learns very readily , the particles * yes , ' and * no , ' are also intepretations of gestures . They designate the corporeal act of repulsing or receiving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * and wont . * * No , * above all , is frequently employed by the child ; it expresses in one word his repugnance ; but when the thing offered to him is agreeable , he seizes it with such eager vivacity , that the word becomes useless . Some of the adjectives are next introduced into his brain , and they are those which express sensations very strikingly . * Pretty , ' is soon of this number , so great is his desire to testify his admiration . He at first makes use of various words without connecting them together ; but we can easily see that they are assembled in his mind . Thus a chilwho sees his father and mother near the fire , immediately says *Papa , Mama , warm , ' leaving out the intermediate words . At this early period of development , children are continually giving utterance to indifferent observations without any other motive than the pleasure of expressing them . In reflecting on this subject , we perceive that these three kinds of words , nouns , verbs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly the material , and , as it were , the body of conversation . They express the great concern of the soul as it regards this world , that of distinguishing external objects by nouns , that of defining its own impressions by adjectives , and lastly of announcing its determinations by verbs . This is to know , to feel , and to will . It is the whole man . These words then are of great importance to the child ; but how happens it that he finally employs others to which it seems difficult that he should attach a meaning ? How does he comprehend prepositions , conjunctions , adverbs , /q/ those terms without number , which , as it were , are instruments with which we vary , separate , connect , or modifyin a thousand ways , the component parts of conversation ? What use has he for ' with ' as for * although ' very - of which perhaps not one grown person in ten knows how to define . He employs them very properly as soon as he has acquired them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some observations induce me to believe , that he does not separate them from the sentence of which they form a parf . This sentence appears to him to be one great word , the meaning of which he divines by the power of his wonderful sympathy ; a word which he repeats distinctly if he has a correct ear and a flexible throat ; if otherwise , he maims , or abridges it , but never decomposes it . And when he afterwards finds the same terms in different sentences , he does not immediately remember them . These words are to him , what syllables are to us , when we constantly meet them in conversation , without attaching any sense to them . Nothing perhaps but reading can give us a knowledge of the true formation of words . Therefore , we see unlettered people , who write without having read much , connect terms together in the most singular manner , and unite , or divide them , at hazard . Let us suppose that we say to the child , holding out our hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden with me ? ' he will repeat - ' Yes , yes , come to the garden with me ; ' the gesture , and the word * garden , * having been sufficient to make him understand . If , on the contrary , we said to him , making a repulsive sign - ' I will go into the garden without you ! ' he will repeat for a long time in a mournful voice , * Not without you , not without you . ' Hence we see , that although understanding correctly the entire sentence , he does not give a meaning to every word . /z/ t88 THE MEANS BT WHICH CHILDREN What gives most perplexity to the head of the poor child , are pronouns . ' Me , ' and * I , ' especially remain a long time behind a cloud . As these words are alone applicable to him who pronounces them , we do not employ them when we speak to the child of himself ; without ever being the object of them , he sees them changing their object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into use . When he wishes to designate his own person , he considers himself , if I may use the expression , out of the body , and speaks of himself as another , using his own name . Give to Albert , lead Albert , ' * these are the expressions he employs . I have heard a child who was always spoken to in the second person , always use the second person in mentioning himself The introduction of * I ' would be curious to observe . On the other hand , such vestiges of the animal language as we have preserved in our idioms , the cries which we have adopted into the human language under the name of interjections , the child seizes upon and applies with wonderful quickness . The ' oh ! ' of unpleasant surprise ; is never confounded by him with the * ah ! ' of pleasure , nor &#9830; In a letter from a friend now before me , she thus speaks of the attempts of her little son , two years old , in the use of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , ' Baby go weed gargy ; ' by night he is very tired with his day 's work , and says , ' Ma ' get chair , take baby , rock , shing. ' - * Thus I find , ' continues our observing correspondent , ' that nouns and verbs pronounced after his own fashion , constitute his vocabulary , with the exception of an occasional adjective , such as pretty puss , good Ma ! ' Many children in their first attempts to speak , call themselves ' baby , ' speaking of themselves , as the author remarks , in the third person ; - one little girl , whose mother used caressingly to call her darling took the word , and modulating it to suit her own imperfect articulation , appropriated the cognomen of doggy much to the wonder and amusement of strangers , who would as vainly have sought for the origin , as we of many of the terms in our language . Eo. /z/ with the reverential * oh ! ' of prayer . Much time wouldpass away before we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by intuition , the song of his mother . A question arose among several metaphysicians at the close of the last century . They asked how it was possible that the child learns the use of generic names . That he attaches a sign to a definite object , could be conceived , but how comes he to apply it to a whole class of beings ? How is it that he gives the name of dog , to all the species , however little resemblance they may bear to the first he has heard thus called 1 Does he form general ideas ? * Does he know that the names of species , are applied to all individuals combining certain qualities , and does he abstractly consider these qualities , separating them from the subject that possesses them 1 This would be a great effort for a young mind . Nevertheless , such , by profound thinkers , is believed * The lady whose remarks upon her child 's language , we have quoted in another note , says , - ' My little boy was much delighted a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of which we pronounced as we showed him the object . In his imperfect way , he imitated the word ; and when , the next day , he was carried into the poultry yard , where were many chickens , he at once called out tickee tickee , having gone through with the mental process pf generalizing , as well as he could have done under the tuition of Locke , or any other philosopher . Indeed , after all that is said about this wonderful process , it seems to me the simplest thing in the world . The child saw otw chicken , and learned its name ; when he saw other animals like it , his mind instantly perceived the resemr blaTice , and he called them chickens . And yet a process which is so evidently suggested by nature in this simple intelligible manner , is , as I am informed by those better versed in speculative philosophy tlmn myself , made an occasion for great disputation. * We think our friend 's practical philosophy worth volxunes of speculation . /z/ to be the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children , they have , in my opinion , attributed more of reason and less of intuition to them , than they possess . The following is the opinion of Locke on this subject , as it is cited with approbation by Condillac. * The ideas , ' says he , * that children form of the persons with whom they associate , are resemblances of the persons themselves , and are only particular ideas . The ideas which they form of their nurse and their mother , are distinctly traced in their minds ; and , as so many faithful portraits , represent only these individuals . The names that they give to them designate these individuals . Thus , the names of " nurse " and " mama , " which children make use oft refer only to these persons . When , afterwards , time and a greater knowledge of the world , has led them to ob* serve that there are many other beings , who by certain common relations of face and other qualities , resemble their father , mother , and divers individuals whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they find all these beings equally participate , and they give to it , as others do , the name of man . Thus they come in possession of a generic name , and a general idea , . In which they form nothing new , but separating only from the co/nplex idea of Peter , James , Mary , and Elizabeth , that which was peculiar to each one of them , they retain only what is common to all . ' I do not deny , assuredly , that this reasoning isvery logical , and I have nothing even to object to the early steps of it : the child begins by giving a name to a particular object , I acknowledge ; but the manner by which he passes from that to the general idea , appears to me , not to have been indicated to Locke by observation . To proceed by separation , by retrenchment , that is ' to say by abstraction , seems to me little conformed to the mind of the child . /z/ /q/ When he begins to express himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and singularity of his associations , that he is nearer being a poet , than an analyst . The example chosen by Locke , is moreover one of the least fitted to enlighten the subject , since it is precisely in the case cited that a child would have the most trouble to generalize his ideas . The individuals he lives with , occupy so large a place in his mind ; he sees them so distinctly separated from others , that he can not consent to range them under the same denomination . A child of two years old , jwould be astonished , he would laugh in derision , if any body should tell him that his father is * a man . ' What would he do , then , if we pretended , with Locke , that his mother is one also 7 A man , is to him an xmknown person - a passer-by of the lower class . He perceives undoubtedly that these unknown persons have certain relations between them ; but the particular idea of which Locke speaks , is too strong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this age , however , and even still earlier , children are in the frequent use of general terms ; but the more vague the idea of the object first named to them , the easier it becomes to extend it to other objects . Thus the dogs and- horses , which they see at a distance , and therefore indistinctly , easily form to them a species . So also when they take in , at a single glance , several similar objects , the particular idea of one among them not being so clearly traced in their mind , they easily transfer it to others like it , or only slightly different . Thus I have seen a chibj who gave the name of apricots to all fruits - plums , cher* lies , gooseberries , grapes , &c; ; - another who called by the same name two little girls dressed alike . In the first instance there is a simple awakening of ideas - it is sensation rather than judgment . In the other there is a striking point of resemblance . We might suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees an object already known ; but it is more correct to say that he thinks nothing - he does not decide whether the object is different , or the same ; but the act of recognition is produced. * This moYement , prompt , unreflecting , almost mechanical , which combines the identity of the image we preserve , with that of the object which we see , is here the effect of a simple analogy ; and is rather accidental , than the operation of the mind . But when this operation coitunences ; when the examination is truly going on , diflerences are appreciated , and each one of the various objects , calls for its own sign . The first naturalists , it is well known , proceeded in the same way . They at first formed confiised masses drawn from vaguely conceived relations , or what we call a &mily; likeness . Thus they classed together under the names of monkeys , and parrots , animals that have since been distributed into different groups . In proportion as we have more minutely observed , divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confound , with the true act of generalization , the effect which the poverty of language naturally produces among uncivilized people . When there are but few words in an idiom , no word remains limited to its original meaning , and the name of a known object is given * When this was written , I W2is not acquainted with the work of M. Maine Biran , entitled ' Influence de V habUvde sur lafaeulU de penser . The author , who analyzes with great sagacity , many pejrcological phenomena , expresses in scientific language , the same ideas which I have advanced . According to him , a striking qaaliQr in an object , may become a d ' habitude which mechanically draws together the apparition of certain qualities , or associated impressions . It is , say he in a note , on this first eff*ect of the signes d habUvde that is founded the prompt and natural c ( mveisi0ii of individual names into general and appellative terms . EdJ /q/ all , slightly resembling it , which present themselves . Thus , an inhabitant of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being arrived at Macao , and seeing there , for the first time , a horse , - immediately pronounced the name of dog , an animal he was already acquainted with . If the confused perceptions of the child , or the ignorance of the savage led us to consider them as more inclined to generalize ideas , than adults , or men of cultivated minds , we should thereby contradict the whole history of the human mind . Who does not know that the imagination is quick , and the mind but little capable of abstraction in the in &ncy; of individuals , and of savage nations 1 This applies also to what has been said by another metaphysician , Thomas Reid , ( Essay on the Intellectual Powers of Man , page 110 , chapter V. ) * If it is asked at what age men begin to form general conceptions , I reply ; As soon as a child can say , understandingly , that he has two brothers or two sisters . From the moment that he employs the plural , he must necessarily have general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or admits the use of the plural . ' Undoubtedly an individual , singly considered , can not admit the use of the plural ; but when the child sees two objects at once , the impression he receives is not the same , as when he perceives but one . To see two eyes in a fece , or many soldiers in a battalion is not to possess general ideas ; it is a recognition of the likeness of the objects which we take in at a single glance . Now , as the effect produced on the child by this compounded perception is new to him , he has read of a new way of designating it , and he then makes use of the plural . These are the * idies concretiSj of Charles Bonnet , those which represent collective names - flock , city , people , names which always /z/ // That the named of species , that terms which express the plural , are at length used by the child in the acquirement of true general ideas is perfe ; tly correct . Language gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn an object , and the attention which is reqiiifed for its expression , ascends by the same process to abstraction , properly so called . The difference between children and ourselves , in this respect , seems to me to proceed from the great difference between our moral existence and theirs . Their life is constituted of images , impressions , and desires ; words occupy but a very small place - the child makes use of them , but without reflecting on them . He sees things always in the same light , and consequently he possesses only particular ideas of them . Children have a wonderful faculty of association . Things link together , and reciprocally attract each other in their brain - one image awakens another , and language follows in their train . When this language passes from one object to another , it is by the influence of a relation less appreciated than'felt , and the child perceives distinctly neither analogy , or di ference between them . With those who reflect , it is otherwise : general terms , such as that of species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect , as in a bundle , the remembrance of a multitude of individual names , and become a means by which the mind can easily manage a great mass of ideas . These terms become also a power- qwq /q/ fU aid , to knowledge , an aid which has opened to man the wayto the sciences , and has subjected to him the physical and moral world . But the more consequence we give to words in the exercise of thought , the more imagination retires , and its visions fade . The brilliant period of our existence is that when imagination and feeling , equally ardent and abounding , reciprocally act upon each other in harmonious beauty . When it is no longer thus , when the pictures of imagination are effaced , and the feelings which they excited grow cold ; then words reign alone , vain images of extinguished thoughts , deceitful representations which soon cease to produce even illusion . Such would be the infallible act of age , if we did not preserve in the soul a focus of life and warmth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral , contribute to facilitate the child in the apprenticeship of language . This fact places in the strongest light the beautiful experiments upon the deaf and dumb , published by M. Itard , an excellent observer , as well as a skilful physician. * After having given the detail of his experiments , this ingenuous man draws the following conclusion - * Thus , says he , we have an undeniable proof of that superiority of vocal imitation , which the child in infency has over the adolescent - a superiority founded on two differences well ascertained and established by my own experience - from which it results , 1st , that the child imitates of his own accord , while it is necessary to excite the adolescent to imitation : 2d , that the child in order to speak , has only to hear ; while , to perform the same function , the adolescent has need to listen and to look . ' We see afterwards , ( page 502 , ) that M. Itard experienced some difficulty when he wished to have sounds emitted * Trait6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2. p. 281. // and prolonged by the deaf and dumb , who had already , ( thanks to him , ) the ear tolerably formed , but who knew not how to govern their lungs and throat . It is necessary to read these curious details in the book itself , in order to comprehend what would be the art of speaking , if it was necessary to study it methodically without having had nature for our master in infancy . But with what pleasure , what astonishing rapidity , does the child advance in this study when once he has taken the first steps ! Every day he makes use of new terms , he attempts longer phrases . The amusement that he finds in speaking is inexhaustible . When he sees a thing that interests him , he repeats twenty times that he has seen it , with a satisfaction of which we can have no idea . He relates to himself what pleases him , - the power of thus prolonging the impression enchants him , and pride mingled with joy , beams in his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor hard , perhaps reddens , till he has given utterance to the word . At first it costs him but little trouble , but by degrees it becomes more difficult ; the accentuated syllable which , in the beginning , had alone excited his attention , is successively accompanied by all the others . He cor rects himself , and does not find that amusement in mangling words , * of which children become but too sensible afterwards : the satisfaction of speaking like grown people is sufficient . &#9830; On this point , we can not but make a passing remark . The lisping and broken ardciilation of infancy is pleasant to us , and we are too apt to let children see that it is so ; nay , we often speak to them ourselves in broken and inaccurate language ; - but when we reflect upon the importance of their early acquiring their vernacular tongue in its purity , we shall surely be careful how we confirm them in habits , which it will be difficult , if not impossible , wholly to change in more mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited by pleasure , than by want , that he makes much longer speeches when happy than when grieved . He becomes eloquent when animated by gaiety or hope , but when afifected by the contrary , he does nothing but murmur ; and his talents vanish , with his enjoyment It seems , then , that this may be a particular dispensation of Providence , in order that the child might learn to speak ; therefore , the gifts which he has received , transient as they are remarkable , have already lost their first virtue when his mind is more developed . Children of five or six years learn but few words . We see when they begin to read , that they do not comprehend a multitude of terms which are frequently used before them in conversation . We could tell at once that they have acquired their little treasure of words ; they repose themselves , and seek no longer . They know how to give names to the portion of the universe which interests them , and what exists beyond they do not care for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions which would interfere either with their joyor their peace . They are content - why should they ask more ? Their happiness is as secure as if in the bosom of an enchanted island ; and the waves of the external world rage unperceived around them . Facility of expression , which is very unequal in children , is not generally proportioned to the measure of their intelligence . An agreeable and rapid elocution frequently proves nothing but the talent of retaining set phrases ; whilst a manner of speaking more laborious and less regular , denotes mental exertion and care to make expression correspond with thought. * In the last case there is not &#9830; Teachers are often deceived in the capacities of their pupils by this difference ; and should therefore be very careful how they decide that has talents because he is flippant , and another is dull , because he finds it difficult to speak with flinency . Ed. /z/ less to hope for the future ; - not but the memory of words is in itself a valuable feculty ; but because it often exempts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this particular exercise of the mind . In the same way that a single sign may be used by children to designate several objects , a single object is often represented in their minds by different signs . Thus they learn divers languages with extreme fecility . Sounds are connected in their memory like images ; and a word leading in its train all the words by which it has been accompanied , dialects are not jumbled together in their little discourses . Above all , there is no risk of confusion , when the same person always addresses the child in the same language . The idea of this person then connecting itself in his memory with that of a certain manner of speaking , he employs this manner in reply . This is unquestionably an easy means of facilitating to the child an important acquisition ; but I do not believe that there results from it any great of intelligence ; at least it would not be at all comparable to that which may be obtained from the regular study of a language . It is doubtful whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the mind . Thus we do not see that the inhabitants of frontier countries , who always know two languages at once , have more ingenious minds than other men . And among the people of the north , where children learn from the cradle to express themselves in several dialectic , transcendent geniuses do not seem to be more abimdant than elsewhere , although there is generally a facility oi comprehension which is very remarkable . We should find there fects , which it would be very interesting to observe in relation to this subject . The union of thought and language is so intimate , that the effects of their first association would not be indifferent . The influence of a polyglot education would consequently be useful to study . /q/ Bat the habit of speaking the mother tongue correctly , will always be the most essential for children . A faulty which although not considered serious , is nevertheless difficult to repair in education , is that of neglecting to employ , in relation to this , the gifts so peculiar to infancy . The ancients had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care that they bestowed upon enunciation from the cradle actually appears trifling and pedantic . But , in countries above all where pronunciation is vicious , and the expressions often so , the like care would be a happy corrective to the evil effect of example . The point in question is not only what is agreeable , but that which possesses the most powerful means of influencing the imagination it can not be considered frivolous to know . Language is the expression of the soul , and what empire over the happiness and morality of others , do we not exert by means of it /z/ " Children forget injunctions and rules of conduct ; it is necesary , therefore , to make them perform indispensable duties , until they form habits independent of Memory . " - Locke . It is necessary to take advantage of the character of infancy , while it is in its purity . In a short time every thing is adulterated , every thing is changed ; we can no longer distinguish what is natural , from what is acquired ; the voluntary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame at their singularities : they conceal or repress the impressions which they have no hope of seeing participated ; and they look in our faces in order to discover what they ought to feel . The principal traits of infancy , however , are not so soon effaced as we think , and the traces of them remain unperceived . One may live a long time with a little savage who is in a degree outwardly civilized ; but in order to know him well , it is necessary to observe him before he has made any advances in civilization . /q/ This study is less easy than it appears to be : before the child knows how to speak , every thing seems confused in his existence . His sense of perception , that by which he connects and compares ideas , differs from ours in the highest degree ; but whatever may be its nature , we know it not ; and it presents in the child , as well as in animab , a problem at once interesting , and impossible to resolve . When afterwards we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlighten us himself , that which distinguishes him from us is no longer so striking ; and the child , in appearance at least , already too much resembles man . There is then a short interval more instructive than all others to the observer , - that , in which genuine in &ncy; exists , and unveils itself ; it is the age between two and four years . At that time the child is not yet upon his guard , and his natural instincts , still in their original vigor , seem to be even powerfully developed ; actions the most numerous and diversified serve to interpret them . Our social state is as yet but little comprehended by the child , and he might inhabit another world as well as ours . To see how he insensibly adopts our ideas ; how his will , violent and impatient , gradually submits to the yoke of example and of reason ; how his young faculties , joined to the dawning light of conscience , contribute , each one following its natural course , to lay in him the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal to us an admirable dispensation of Providence , a design that we have only to conceive of in order to respect it . Following the order of time , we shall first consider the period when the soul has as yet no control over itself ; when the will , although apparently active , is truly passive ; since , yielding to the strongest inclination , it renders obedience only to a blind impulse . In this state we govern children through the mediimi of their habits , the natural efts- of our care and regularity . This means , which /z/ is gentle , although a little mechanical , ought unquestionably not to be alone employed ; but how shall we avoid making use of it ? Habits are the necessary result of education , for we can not prevent them from becoming formed , except by an unequal and capricious conduct - the example of which would be infallibly imitated . A remark , which may seem a little paradoxical , is , that the younger the child , the more his habits appertain to his moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet act by his own power , he can only be accustomed to anticipate . He waits for a certain succession of events , and his habits partake only of fears and hopes : it is , consequently , over the desires , the tastes , and the temper that their influence is exerted ; and we do not see the little beings performing a routine of actions void of thought , so as to give the idea of mechanism . It is but a little later , when activity displays itself , and the pleasure attached to certain actions begins to operate , that the soul can in any degree remain uninfluenced by the movements which had at first governed it . Habits , then , have not , in earliest infancy , the inconvenience which appears most inevitably attached to them , that of benumbing the faculties ; and the extreme pliability of children remains with them long enough to enable us to mould them to circumstances . There is , then , in the education of infancy , judiciously conducted , an advantage , secondary it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child to fulfil his duties , without thinking of that multitude of actions which merit not to be thought of , and which , however , have their utility . In giving him habits of care to perform certain obligations , in some degree essential , - such as those imposed by our physical nature , and the tacit agreement of society , is in effect to relieve the soul from this care for the future . The more we take advantage of the instinct of imitation in relation to this , the more we /q/ shall spare ourselves the chagrin of having to prescribe as duties , things which are not so , and which , notwithstanding , are almost indispensable . This is to render to the pupil an invaluable service . What embarrassment 1 what awkwardness ! what loss of time and thought , are soared even . among men , by doubts with regard to the propriety of the smallest acts ! This same faculty of association which facilitates to the child the acquirement of language , gives birth to habits . When the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in an almost settled order , awakening in him the image of certain objects , which have become necessary to his enjoyment . No image is solitary in his mind - the frame-work , the appendages are not separated from the-principal subject , but make part of the idea that he forms of it . I have seen a child of nine months old weep bitterly , and refuse his breakfast , because the cup and saucer and the spoon were not in their accustomed position . By taking advantage of this disposition in little children , we might easily give them the love of order . The desire of . seeing every thing ranged in its place , become natural to them , if we but manifest it in the slightest degree ourselves . When we think of the bitter regrets which the absence of orderly habits brings in its train , we ought the more assiduously to endeavor to instil them into children . A vague idea of duty is associated with them - and duty is itself perhaps but moral order of the highest kind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a derangement , a disorder . The natural disgust which is associated with it adds the repugnance of the senses to that of the mind . Modesty is also of the same family , and there is nothing easier than to inspire in children that instinctive modesty , which , when stripped of design , is but the more innocent // This last object , too much neglected in early infeincy , is , notwithstanding , very important . At the risk of appearing absurd , I will say that it is especially so for young boys . Custom alone so severely imposes the , law of deeonmi upon young girls , that , unless from singular neglect , their manners in early life are not exposed to any danger . But it is not the same with regard to men ; schools are a peril to them , and the manner in which the child is affected by bad examples , depends entirely upon his first impressions . Mothers ought , therefore , to be attentive , they ought to inspect the nurse , and not permit her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure with indecency . The care of his own person shoidd be confided to him as early as possible , and he should attend to its requirements in solitude . From that lime he often acquires a modesty apprehensive and almost severe ; but how can we fear the excess of a quality , which is so nearly allied to dignity of soul ? There are sentiments of morality apparently of the . most elevated kind , which proceed from a simple association of ideas , and consequently from habit : such is respect for the property of another . The child lives much through the medium of his eyes ; the objects which he constantly sees about the person that he loves , make part of herself in his memory ; the clothes , the little appendages which she uses , are of great consequence in his estimation ; he thinks of her accompanied by her attributes , as we see the heathen gods ; and when he observes that she alone makes use of these objects , he is persuaded that they become a part of her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like a &iithful; dog , and prevents others from approaching them . I have seen a little girl of eighteen months old , who would weep if any one touched the basket of her nurse , in walking . One day , when the same child saw a woman whom she did not know , carry a dress /q/ of Imt mother 's from the house , she uttered loud cries - a scene whicJi was repeated on the morrow . Since then she has manifested inquietude at the sight of strangers , and when they depart with empty hajids , she conducts them wilh an affected politeness , that hut ill conceals her /z/ This sentiment which is easily increased hy exercise , may give a precocious integrity to very young children . They possess it naturally , and can transfer it from one person to another ; being different in this respect from dogs , who have a regard for their master alone , and then only when they have been trained . Children of eighteen months at the English school in Spitalfields , do not touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds of their companions . It is true that the masters set them a good example in this respect , and that they never fail in restoring to the pupils their little playthings after they have been sometimes deprived of them . This precaution is very necessary , not only on account of the powerful influence of the imitative instinct , but because it may be possible to communicate the precious quality of complaisance . It is only when the child is perfectly secure from the fear of losing his own property , that it gives him pleasure to make others enjoy it . He is sometimes led by it to consider the right of lending , or of giving , as the happiest privilege attached to possession ; and the spirit of preservation may be even connected in his mind with'that of generosity . The sentiment of general benevolence , which we should endeavor to maintain , conducts so naturally to habits of politeness , that we may almost lay aside the task of forming them . It is only essential to strengthen them , before timidity , the consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest itself Nevertheless , if the course of a truly religious education was thoroughly /z/ followed , the child would pass insensibly from sjnnipathy to charity , to the love of others ; and savage pride or irritable vanity would not arise in him . It is thus , that those qualities which are the happy fruits of first habits , become confounded with natural qualities , and that a similar charm is attached to them . We possess them modestly , without supposing that we could do otherwise than possess them ; and he who would trace them back to their origin , might see with gratitude one of the greatest and most incontestible benefits that he could owe to education . /z/ ' * The duty of obedience , is the only one comprehended by little children . " - Elizabeth Hamilton . Of all the habits of childhood , the most necessary to ibrm is that of obedience , since by means of it , we can make or break , at will , all others . I here regard docility as the result of habit ; although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consider it as a moral obligation . But at the tender age of which I speak , the practice of obedience gradually awakens the idea of duty ; whilst the idea of duty can not as yet impose obedience . In consulting observation , we see that there exists in children an innate instinct of independence ; it is also from dispositions equally natural that their will submits to ours , at least when we conduct ourselves with consistency and firmness . They oilen adopt our desires through sympathy ; besides , they have often proved that it is useless to resist us , and they at length feel that they belong to us , and rejoice that they do . A little girl of a year old , no sooner has a doll , than she regards it as her child , judging that this tie of the heart renders her possession more complete . So children soon comprehend that they are our /z/ property ; they see our love and solicitude , and this proves to them that they are of all things most precious to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it follows that little children find naturally enough , that we forbid them from certain acts . As it is often done for their preservation , and sometimes for that of the material objects which belong to us , there is nothing in the prohibitions which astonish them , although they are constantly forgetting them . But it is not the same with orders ; they have more difficulty in comprehending them , and are less docile in conforming to them ; and notwithstanding they are often more agreeable , the commandment requires an action whilst the prohibition interdicts one . Then if the action is of a nature to please them , it is sufficient merely to indicate it . To enjoin imperatively upon a little child to execute an order repugnant to him , would be uselessly to compromise our authority , which as yet is scarcely established . Such a distinction would not be on the whole admissible , since the principal design for which authority is confided to us , the safety of the child , demands that we have the power of commanding , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the difference of his submission in the two cases , there is a discernment sufficiently refined for the legitimate rights of a free being . The child is weak , he is helpless ; we can deprive him of every thing , even dispose of his person , because he has not the means of resisting ; but his soul is independent . We can not make him act in defiance of himself , and he is astonished at the attempt . There is a degree of nobleness in this sentiment , a germ of dignity which ought not to be suppressed with violence . To reconcile in the mind of the child respect for firmness of character , with the necessity of obtaining obedience from him , is perhaps one of the difficulties of education , but not an insurmountable one . /q/ Indeed , if the docility of in &ncy; is composed of elements the purest and Qiost natural , there is nothing degrading to the soul in such a disposition . Sympathy is a principle exempt from haseness : to abstain from a useless effort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reason : to believe that he belongs to his parents , is the efiect of a tender confidence in the child , which will at some future day be the source of filial demotion , a sublime and touching principle , the only one among the human virtues that can merit the name of piety . A reciprocal possession , if I may so speak , is the distinctive character of that intimate relation of father and son , a relation unique in the world for its sanctity , for the depth and disinterestedness of the sentiments which belong to it . Thus , a long time before the period when the child can be responsible for his motives , we may , without bringing fear into action , or touching any other spring than that of sympathy and the most simple foresight , we may , I say , give him the habit of docility . From that time notwithstanding the vicissitudes and the tumults which our imperfect wisdom can not , or does not know how always to prevent , we are generally in possession of power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is astonishing that any distinction has been made in this respect between the interests of children and our own , since these interests must be the same in all cases . Excessive severity constitutes the torment of fathers and children in every family where it exists , as much as the exercise of a sweet and gentle authority sheds peace and happiness aroimd it . Docility , it is said by some , has but a temporary merit : it is not in itself a virtue , because the child is not destined to yield forever , nor to yield to all the world . This last point is assuredly indisputable ; but after all , the child ought always to be obedient to something , and /z/ never make his caprice his only law . Man in infancy obeys his parents ; then , the idea of duty that they have instilled into him ; and after that , the simple idea of duty , which has acquired an independent growth within him . The object of obedience alone changes , the virtue remains . But even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but the necessary condition on which to receive the benefits of education , still it would be necessary that this condition be fulfilled . Without the full enjoyment of authority , the - parents would not be able to acquit themselves of their noble task . Tell them to use power with moderation , with justice ; but if you should go to them and deprive them of its possession , their responsibility would be annulled. * That there existed in life an imperious obligation , a duty august and sacred , without a legitimate means for performing it , would be in itself contradictory . Now there is nothing which can be more seriously imposed on us , both by divine and human laws , than the care of bringing up our children . All benefits of which we can form * It is not left for the parent to choose between the exercise of his power over his child , and its abdication . Kings , may lay aside their sceptres , but the authority of the parent is a divine rights a delegation from on high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove . Teachers as well as parents , must , when occasion calls , assert their authority . They must govern , or be themselves despised and trampled upon by those , who are penetrating enough to see that a shadow of power , without energy , is contemptible . No one ever gained the affections of the young , by thus shrinking to fulfil all the obligations which the care and education of others imposes . But it is seldom that a firm , decided , energetic government does not obtain more than respect from those who are the subjects of it ; if combined with affection and gentleness of manners , it will always secure love in hearts capable of affection . Ed. /q/ any idea , safety , health , instruction , a good conscience , the love of others , we ought as much as possible to give to the enjoyment of our children . We are answerable for these cherished beings before God and the world ; and would authority , the only simple means of fulfilling our obligations , be refused to us ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble , naked , without reason , and without knowledge , but lay a snare for us ? She would have endowed us with all kinds of superiority in order to reduce us to the employment of artifice ! Virtue , knowledge would suffice no longer ! It would be necessary to have the subtlety of a diplomatist , and the talent of a comedian , to invent , prepare , and enact scenes in order to accomplish our best projects ; to obtain the smallest concessions from infancy ! Ah ! if it were necessary to renounce truth paternity would be purchased at too dear a price ! I am yet speaking merely of the first rudiments of obedience ; but when I develope this great subject , we shall see how those methods of persuasion , by which we often attempt to obtain an influence over the will in education , are false , weak , and absurd . We shall see how seldom children are duped by them ; and that the conflict which takes place between them and us , together with the dissimulation and reciprocal indecision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy which we had designed to . establish by our management . The troubles arising from a harsh and despotic education , are great ; but the fiiult of enervating the will , can not be laid to its charge . An old sergeant , who has all his life been obedient to his captain , fails not in firmness with his soldiers ; these , restored to their homes , have habits rather too imperious ; and in the energetic ages , the power of parents over children was unlimited . lUie strength of the will , like most of our qualities , is propagated by example , and it possesses the same indecision , the same artifice , the same love of procrastination . /z/ But what decides the question is , that if parents abandon their rights in theory , they resume them when necessary in practice ; and that such an opinion , if adopted , would bring with it but contradictions and inconsistencies . Never will they renounce the exercise of their authority ; in this relation they can not renounce it ; love is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . They will not abjure human nature . When have we seen men abstain from the exercise of power , when they are not restrained either by fear , or respect to mankind , or by conscience ? And let us not believe that a frigid system of education , can ever penetrate into the recesses of the heart . Rousseau has in vain alarmed you on the lawfulness of your empire ; as soon as your child shall expose himself , I do not say to a real danger , but to a slight inconvenience , imagining , perhaps , when he shall only importune you to a certain point , you will take him in your arms , you will carry him . Your scruples , your resolutions , your principles , drawn from Emilie will be forgotten , and nature will triumph . I shall do wrong then , you will say . Yes , undoubtedly ; but the real wrong is , to have adopted principles which your holiest duties as well as your most rational sentiments oblige you to violate . That a child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paternal will is something sacred , that a child whom we have treated as an equal , in reasoning with him , in persuading him , sees something odious in the brutal abuse of force , is certainly not astonishing . The employment of reason supposes , in the being to whom it is addressed , a right not to be convinced ; that of solicitation , a right not to attempt the thing which they engage to do : there is then treachery in your conduct , and rebellion ; frequently the loud cries of the child , will show that he feels it to be so . You must expect that whenever in future you recommence a course of reasoning , he will anticipate /q/ the result , and will listen to you but just so far as it is necessary to put you in the wrong , by refuting you . Hence proceeds an insupportable Relationship , - that of a &ther; and child , each timid and hypocritical in his manner ; each aiming to obtain his desire , without coming to the point ; distrustful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupture . This last result is in j &ct; that which is most pleasing - to the child . In order to punish you , he obliges you to use violence , and compels you to be a tyrant , for the want of knowing how to be a &ther.; Chicanery , selfishness , caprice , obstinacy , although destitute of real firmness , are , alas ! the too ordinary fruits of this imperfect subordination . Too rigorous heretofore , domestic discipline , is now , perhaps , too much weakened . if its principle is changed , if it is no longer that of submission to power , it ought to be that of submission to duty . It should be governed by a spirit more pure , more moral - that respect for the paternal will , which expresses to the child the will of God . There is , in the education of infancy , a principal idea which ought to predominate over all others , and serve as a rallying point to them . This idea is that of protection . Let the mother , ( since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her especially that I address myself , ) let the mother invest herself strongly with this principle , and the whole system of her conduct will be regulated by it . She will see the happiest proportions established between severity , and indulgence - between love and firmness . Without love , protection is not vigilant ; it will not extend over the happiness , over all the interests of the young existence : without firmness and the degree of severity which necessarily accompanies it , it is no longer protection . That which yields , can not serve as a support ; and the child wants to be supported . Not only has he need of it , but he desires it ; his most constant tenderness is /z/ purchased only at this price . If you are to him in effect like another child , if you partake his passions , his continual changes , if you participate all his emotions , increasing them whether it be by contradiction , or by an excess of complaisance - he will be able to use you as a plaything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep , he will mutiny , and a season of disorder and ill-humor will be connected with your idea . You have not been the protector of your child , you have not preserved him from that perpetual fluctuation of the will , which is the malady of feeble beings who are the sport of a feeble imagination ; you have neither secured his peace , his wisdom , or his happiness - why should he believe you to be his mother ? In truth the laws we shall impose will lead to contradictions , and will associate the idea of evil , with certain actions in themselves innocent . But at the age of which I speak , he does not yet act from the knowledge of good and evil . The question is not , to enlighten the conscience but to accustom the child to listen to its voice such as it is . He has a morality derived from sympathy , the only one he can have . Good , with him , is to satisfy those he loves ; evil , to be blamed by them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he has done nothing , he believes himself culpable , if he sees in the eyes of his mother the expression of discontent ; and if he has caused real sorrow , if in a moment of impatience he has struck her , his repentance amounts almost to despair . On a similar occasion I have seen a little child , who , without being threatened or even rebuked , renounced all his plays , and , his heart bursting with gtief , went to conceal himself in an obscure corner , with his face turned against the wall . Inconstant and variable as this sentiment is , it is , nevertheless , the first dawning of conscience . The desire of agreeing with his mother , will become in the child the love of duty , the wish to harmonize with Grod , with that /q/ which can best represent him to us upon earth . This sentiment may be indeed exhausted by making too frequent and injudicious calls upon it , in the same way that the body is enfeebled by want of aliment , exercise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments belonging to this world All wither in inaction , as they wear oat by an imprudent and premature excitement . A child , in whom the germ of conscience which exists in him has not been cultivated , does not possess moral life . To abstain , as Rousseau would have us , from imposing any duty upon the child , before he had a knowledge of die various social relations upon which his duties were fomided , would be to dissolve the most intimate and sacred of these relations . At the age when the young man knows exactly how to define the origin of family relations , and their influence upon the organization of society , he can almost do without his parents , and is no longer united to them by the tie of necessity . It would besides be to deviate from the natural path , which Rousseau intends to follow so closely . Nature brings the affections into play , a long time before reason ; she does not proceed in methodical order : in her we can take hold of no beginning , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she always seems but to develope . In the child every thing is in the germ , nothing is yet expanded ; the important point is to teach him to act for himself To suppose in him principles , sentiments , and sometimes even knowledge which he has not acquired , is often the best way of communicating all these in education . In coming to the application , I shall here indicate the best means of obtaining early obedience . In the beginning , while the habits , yet passive , consist in the expectation of our actions , the important point for us , is uniformity of conduct . We ought to guard the child from surprises which shock him , and rudely break the course of his /z/ impressions . When the preparations for our designs permit him to discover them , our intention , if always accomplished , will gradually become a law to him . In the same manner that he has ceased to oppose our projects , he will afterwards renounce the execution of his own , if he can with certainty foresee our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which establish our authority , for our words produce no effect on little children , but when they announce our conduct . ' ' My dear , I am going to take away this knife from you , * gradually becomes * Lay down the knifei and one is equivalent to the other . We ought not to prohibit what we can not prevent , but we ought always to prevent what we have begun to prohibit To order active obedience , is , as I have said , dangerous to authority ; and even with regard to prohibitions it is useless to hope that the child will at first believe them permanent ; he will see only the expression of your will for the moment . In vain have you wished to fetter him for the future ; he does not comprehend your claims . * You must never climb upon the chairs , ' is to him , * I wish you not to climb upon this chair now. * He will also disobey you a long time , Mrithout real rebellion , in your presence , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your displeasure . But when he shall have often associated the idea of your disapprobation , with that of a certain act , he will at length abstain from performing it . And if he passes from your hands only into those of a person , who prevents the same things , by the same means as yourself , by degrees he will feel himself under the dominion of a law , which will control him even in thought . It is above all necessary , when you would obtain submission , to beware of playfulness . This supposes equality , and as soon as we laugh , we may resign our authority . Sport often with your child - manifest to him the tenderest love - but , when once obedience is demanded , smile taAllttd 6F CHtLDRBK. 217 lio longer ; caress no longer , do not even solicit . You exercise a sacred right - and the feeling of this right is weakened in the soul of your child , ais well as in yours , whenever you employ such various resources . Children will attempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to disarm ybur resistance . Enticement , importunity , buffoonery , all arein turn employed hy them . We often see them venturing a succession of contradictions , so graduated that we can not find a moment to stop them . These attempts are owing to our feeble , and undecided manner of commanding . We have spoken lightly , and have been lightly listened to . Before pronouncing any command , it is necessary that a greater seriousness , something more imposing in the countenance , should announce to the child that the mother speaks , and that the companion of his sports has disappeared . An expression of decision and calmness is then important . It instead of elevating the voice , we suddenly depress it , we seem to address that which is most closly connected with the child , his conscience . The following is a penal code for children of two years old , the observance of which might save severer measures . Disobedience caused by forgetfulness . Opposition to the continuance of the act , renewing the prohibition of it amicably . Disobedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inform the child that if he repeats it , you will deprive him of the means of disobeying . Disobedience entirely voluntary . Put the threat in execution , by making , silently , such material arrangements as shall render disobedience impossible . In this last case , the child ordinarily assumes ill-humor : he seeks to punish you ; he caresses with affectation some other person ; in short , he endeavors in every way to disoblige you . If he does not exceed the prescribed limits , you will take no notice of his intention ; but if he is decided /z/ Upon Tobellioa ; ii vexed that you persist in not observkkg his Ugfht faults , he is determined to commit greater ones ; since all the actions of the child are reprehensible , you determine to put an end to them at once . Without saying a word , you take the little culprit by the hand , and with seriousness and firmness seat him in a chair , or , if you think proper , confine him in some other place . It is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cries , with a secret triumph that he has at last succeeded in moving you . Render this triumph as small as possible , by preserving " a perfect calm . This , by the way , shows the danger of aner ; which if indulged , would give at once a bad example , and an unhallowed pleasure to the child . Return quietly to your occupations , and be assured that tears will soon cease , or change their nature : in a short time , there will be a faint appeal to your commiseration , and the least regard to it will determine the esprit to throw himself in your arms . There will then be a moment of overflowing tears , and a reconciliation tender and cordial . The child will say that- he is sorry ; a word more easily obtained , and more sincerely pronounced , than a sad demand for pardon . You want the expression of tender regret , that of a real return to good temper ; you seek not the humiliation of your child. * * We agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very young children positive duties ; and yet this may sometimes be necessary . Difficult cases of government occasionally arise from this necessity . Mrs. L. was teaching her little daughter , between two and three years old , to count upon her fingers ; the child went on very well to ten ; here she stopped ; the mother said ' ten , ' and added ' you must remember the next time ; - it is the little finger , and when you call the one before it nine , you will then think of ten . ' The process of counting Was recommenced , but having said nine , the child laughed and aflfected ignorance - the mother began to look serious , and said ' ten , ' which the child repeated several /q/ We here see how words and actions may be successively employed to great advantage ; when they are not times successively after her . But , so often as the counting was renewed , the child stopped at ten , waiting for her mother to tell her . At first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IfSDgth ponvinced that she was obstinate , she besan to treat her with severity . Telling her in the first place that she should punish her if she refused to call the ten when she came to it , and at length seating her in disgrace at a distance from herself . After a long coarse of discipline , varied in different ways , the little girl , who had maintained'perfect self-command , said , * I will be good , I will count ten . . She then began , and when she came to this number , as if making a violent effort to conquer herself , she said * ten , ' and burst into a violent fit of weeping . Her mother soothed her , and told her how much better it was to be obedient than to be wilful , and how she had been pained to be obliged to punish her . She then required that she should repeat the counting many times , in order to confirm her obedience . Soon after , the child 's aunt , Mrs. W. , entered the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many she could count * , the child began , but when she had said nine , her fiice reddened , and her countenance expressed the same determinationas she had before shown ; * What is the nexf . Mama ? ' said she . Her aunt who understood the case , said . Come with me , and took the child into her apartment , considering very properly that the last offence was towards hersell . Several hours of probation did the little creature suffer before she would again yield . Yet she was calm , very polite , and obedient in most olher things . Her aunt once told her to go into a comer of the room - * The child ' ( that was her way of calling herself , in imitation of her grandmother who always spoke of her in this manner , ) ' will go , ' says she , * if aunt W. will go and hold the candle . ' After a series of experiments in order to influence the will , it at length gave way to necessity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore her to her mother ; who was not again disappointed in a return of obstinacy on this point . But the same child , when learning to read would sometimes stop at a particular letter or word which her mother knew very well she understood . On these occasions she had only to say , ' E. have you forgotten to count ten V and the hesitation was at once overcome . Would not the character of this child have been essentially different had she obtained a victory over her mother at that time 1 Ed. /z/ used at the same moment , it is easier topreserve calmness , and we may produce more of an impression . Scolding and vociferation frighten children , more than they correct them ; and cause more tears than true repentance , It should be remembered that punishments ( and severe reprimands are the same thing , ) are designed only to ameliorate the dispositions of the heart ; every other motive would make us reprehensible ; every other result would declare us ignorant and unskilful . In education , the duty of protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving innocence , which is a condition necessary to happiness , and is of more value . ( 22i ) /z/ " Activity is the truest pleasure of life , or , to speak more properly , life itself . " - Will . Schlegel . If we doubted the innumerable benefits which the goodness of God has shed on our existence , it would be only necessary to look at little children . The simplest events cause them joy imspeakable . Even the necessary movements of life - the acts of seeing , of walking , and of speaking , are all sources of pleasure to them . The transports of these poor little beings , teach us to know the worth , the intrinsic and primitive value of the thousand benefits which our abundance causes us to overlook . We do not speak correctly when we say that habit has rendered these enjoyments nugatory . We na longer experience their novelty ; but they still shed a certain charm upon our days . In them lies the secret of our attachment to life ; and when called to part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we are insensible to the happiness they give , becatise accustomed to it . After the age of two years , a remarkable development is ordinarily affected in children : there is more decision in their desires , more motive in their will : every thing in their maimer of existence is less vague , and more sig- /z/ nificant ; and their movements more rational , and more graceful , have a more definite object . They form designs independent of ours ; and their less passive existence , becomes more manifest in their conduct , as weU as in their little conversations . These two different expressions of it will be successively the subject of our examination . The pleasure of exerting their powers , is inexhaustible in children : it is sufficient for them to have the idea of an action in order to try it , and all that they see performed , they attempt to do . Thus they become interested in the exterior of every thing ; they imitate our movements , and our various operations , without troubling themselves about causes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their father traces black lines upon a paper ; these are very natural amusements , in which they take their part whenever they can . A pleasure is sufficient in itself - it does not need an object to induce them to pursue it . But we feel the necessity of one as we progress in life , inasmuch as the enjoyment attached to . the simple action becomes weakened . Observe a flock of children of different ages . One just beginning to walk , draws with pride a little empty carriage , the noise of the wheels behind him is sufficient for happiness ; another , a little larger , takes possession of the carriage , and must needs place a doll in it ; one still greater , thitiks the doll must play a part ; at last , if the carriage falls into the hands of a child five or six years old , he will fill it with sand , grass , or straw ; he wishes to perform field-labors , which have already some shadow of reality . The pure and simple desire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and afterwards that of real or supposed activity - these are the gradations of the moral necessities of childhood . To furnish continual food for the activity of children , without employing stimulants which are too forcible , is perhaps the epitome of education . It is the only means /z/ of advancing intelligence - but at present , wisdom , or the formation of character occupies us exclusively . For this object the exercise of the moral faculties is necessary : external movements , sensations , where the soul is passive , do not long suffice for children ; they may even experience fatigue from them : the diversions of this kind that we give them are often too prolonged , whilst mental activity finds its own limit , and stops before it becomes immoderate . We ought above all , then , to endeavor to bring this activity into exercise . Ill tempei , moral disorganization , and frowardness in children , are almost always caused by weariness : the secret of rendering them good , is to occupy their minds . In poor families , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are perhaps more rational and more forward , than in any others ; they also enjoy peculiar advantages . They become interested in all they see ; they understand and take a part in it . All the occupations of the household are in their sight , and they often participate in them . To wash , to spread out the linen , to pull and cook the vegetables ; this succession of varied labors which they witness , which they even aid in executing , gives exercise to the mind , and inspires them with the desire of being useful , at the same time that it amuses them . Occupied , without occupying others , their life is n/q/
