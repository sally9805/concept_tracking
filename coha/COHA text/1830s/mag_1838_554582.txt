txt THE lovers of Latin are under obligations to Mr. Dillaway for his very neat and commodious editions of Cicero . Many will be tempted to read these pretty volumes , who might not feel courage enough to undertake the task of perusing a less convenient edition ; and many will purchase these interesting treatises , as they appear separately and at a moderate price , who would have been repelled by the labor and expense of going through the " Opera Omnia . " The form much resembles that of the Regent 's edition , being very neat , and printed with remarkable correctness . The notes purport to be prepared for the use of youth , and are well suited to this purpose , though we are much mistaken if they be not found of benefit to many who can scarcely be included in this category . They are entirely unencumbered with philological learning , and probably add nothing to the knowledge actually possessed by learned scholars ; but they accomplish very satisfactorily the object for which they were written , namely , to aid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping hand , through the first obstacles which beset him , or to save the reader , be he who he may , the trouble of searching , in the midst of a mass of ostentatious learning , for the simple explanation with Which he would be satisfied . We trust that Mr. Dillaway will continue his labors in this branch , feeling sure , that if he goes on as he has begun , he will render good service to the cause of the classics in our country . // But it is our intention at this time to do more than merely speak of an edition of these works ; we wish to take the opportunity to treat at large of the life and writings of that great man , whose n nine graces the beginning of our essay . The poor fisherman , in the Arabian tale , did but raise the lid of the casket he ha d drawn up from the sea , when the tall form of the Genie rose up majestically to his view , the dim and misty outline assuming every moment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , with its stern reality of muscle and sinew. , stood towering before him . So it is with us when we think of Cicero . At the sound of his name , and the mention of his works , the gigantic character of the man appears before us , the magnificent traits becoming one by one apparent , till the whole vast intellect seems to be present to our sight ; and the memory of his good deeds , of his life , devoted to the service of his country , of his sufferings in the cause of liberty , and his tragical death , comes over us with an interest and power from which we can not escape . The memory of their virtues is the noblest legacy which the great and good of any age can bequeath to posterity ; it is a never-dying principle which is destined to act throughout all time . Its power is not entirely comprehended at first ; it is more deeply felt , and better understood , and is more efficient for good , in proportion as men advance in knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars which have been glittering since the dawn of creation , yet have never been seen or distinguished in the firmament , so it is probable that virtues have been displayed by the good of past ages , that have never yet been appreciated or perceived . Such a character as Socrates could not be comprehended or valued in any degree by a barbarous nation . Achilles was undoubtedly the hero , par excellence , of the Iliad , for those rude nations to whom the blind bard recited his immort.al cantos , and who looked upon courage and strength as the only attributes worthy a man . A more polished age would be awake to the lovelier character of Hector , whose beautiful traits were probably little noticed in the days of Homer . And thus it must ever be while civilization is on the advance . The historian describes faithfully actions and characters , but successive generations speculate upon them with very different feelings ; and , as time rolls on , new virtues and new powers become apparent , and set their watch over man in the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone before us are shining in immortal glory . It is a becoming task then , for every changing state of society to review the past ; and to discover as far as possible those treasures of character , which have hffore been unnoticed . And in looking back to the great men of antiquity , we know of no one to whom we feel more strong ; ly attracted , or who seems to be more closely connected with the present , than Cicero . His works are more various , as well as extensive , than those of any other ancient writer , and we feel that we know him through these . We are brought nearer to him than to any one of the ancients . It seems , as if we had actually listened to his voice in the Senate-house or the Forum , or conversed with him and his friends in his beautiful Tusculan gardens , and gathered from his own lips his deep and pure philosophy . - And more than this ; we are sensible of the power of his mind , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ; we perceive his capacity for comprehending all the improvements of society , and we feel that if he were brought to life at present , he would be as one of us . We figure to ourselves the delight with which he would view and understand the advances made since his time ; the intuitive readiness with which he would accommodate himself to the laws of society ; the perfect gentleman he would appear , though suddenly placed in a scene so new , so trying , so full of wonders . We shall first speak of Cicero as an Orator . His name is identified with eloquence . His great pursuit ; the object to which his life was devoted ; the passion of his youth ; the last and mightiest effort of his old age , was eloquence . And in speaking of his intellectual qualities , we can have no hesitation in placing this art foremost among the objects to which they were devoted . The idea of a perfect Orator existed in his mind almost from childhood , and was never lost from his view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing constantly before him ; never perhaps fully reached , but attracting him by its brightness , and alluring him ever onward . The early selection of this leading object to which his best faculties were to he devoted , and his steady pursuit of it through life , may seem rather remarkable in a state where military eminence so far eclipsed all other distinctions , and was the surest , if not the only step , to office and dignity . // But Cicero wa* a remarkable instance of a man who understood himself . He knew his own character thoroughly ; he understood wherein his greatest power consisted , and he used every means to . cultivate those faculties which he was aware could alone ew3ure his success . He very early in life formed the conception of that perfect character , which he says an orator ought to be ; a man who has cultivated every power to the highest degree ; to whom the arts , the ornaments of life , nature itself pays tribute ; whose mind is enriched by the knowledge of all sciences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , and who gathers into himself the results of genius of every period , country , and form . Upon this model Cicero formed his character . He was aware that his powers were equal to the task . He knew that he could comprehend *dl that man had known ; that his powers of acquiring and his industry were unsurpassed ; and still more , he felt , that knowledge in his mind would not he a dead and useless weight , but that he had power to mould and transform , to hring forth new and fairer forms , and to hequeath to all futurity high and worthy thoughts . From his earliest years , therefore , he devoted himself to literary pursuits . He made himself familiar , not only with the rhetorician 's art , but also with the whole science of Roman jurisprudence ; two branches which had always been considered as forming distinct professions . After gaining all the knowledge to be found in Rome , he travelled into Greece ; he there perfected himself in the language of that country , and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was surrounded by the most distinguished philosophers and orators , with whom he daily conversed and reasoned , and from whom he probably obtained much of that knowledge of ancient philosophy , which he displays in his writings . His mind was stored with all human knowledge ; the beautiful poetry of Greece was familiar to him ; he had walked in the groves of Academus , and the genius of the place had penetrated his soul ; he had listened to the various creeds of the schools , and had boldly formed his own opinions , without suffering the shackles of other minds ; and he returned to make all his acquirements contribute to one object , the profession of eloquence . Of all the manifestations of human power , Cicero regarded that of the orator as the greatest , and as approaching nearest to the divine nature . To this , he made all knowledge and all talent // subservient ; to this , poetry , philosophy , and history were but the ministering attendants . We gather from his own writings his exalted opinion of the eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he , " of the orator such as Antony never saw , nor any other man ; whom we can perchance describe as he ought to be , though perhaps we can neither imitate him , nor show any example of suich a man , ( for Antoay used to say that these qualities were hardly granted to a God. ) " - Orator , c. 5 . " The orator must possess the knowledge of many sciences , without which a mere flow of words is vain and ridiculous ; his style of speaking must be formed not only by a choice of words , but by a skilful arrangement and construction of sentences ; he must be deeply versed in every emotion which nature has given to man ; for all skill and power in speaking , consists in soothing or exciting the minds of the audience . In addition to this , he must possess a ready wit and pleasantry , an amount of erudition such as is becoming to a freeman , and a quicknes ; s of repartee united with refined elegance and urbanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with a store of examples ; nor must he neglect the science of laws and jurisprudence. - And what shall I say of action ? which depends upon the motions of the body , the gestures , the countenance , the tones and changes of the voice . The great importance of action may be discovered from the actor 's frivolous art , and the stage ; for who is ignorant how few can resist the effect even of the moderate skill exhibited there ? What shall I say of the memory , that treasury of all learning , without whose aid in preserving the knowledge we have acquired , or the thoughts we have originated , all the most valuable qualities of an orator would be lost ? Let us no longer wonder , then , that eloquence is so rare , since it consists of so many accomplishments , each of which would seem to be the work of a life in acquiring . " - Dc Oratore , lib. 1 , c. 5 . Such was Cicero 's notion of the Perfect Orator , and such he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regarding eloquence as the concentration of human genius , the fullest developement of all the powers , and the manifestation of the highest qualities of our nature . There is certainly no display of mortal power so imposing , as that of the great orator at the moment of putting forth his energies when the highest mental faculties are called into action in concert with those physical powers which are so noble that the // Greeks held them divine ; when the thoughts that breathe and the words that burn are enforced by the graceful and impressive gesture , the form that seems to tower up and dilate , the beaming eye , the voice , with its thousand tones , embodying thought in the most resistless forms ; and the enraptured crowds are ready to cry out , " It is the voice of a god and not of a man . " The union of the physical with the mental must always be more dazzling , more overwhelming in its effects , than mere intellectual effort can ever be . hence , probably , the glory that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mighty host , governing all by the force of his single intellect , and with majestic presence of mind , amid the scene of carnage and horror , assailed by the dreadful sounds of battle , the deafening shouts , the continued roar , the shrieks of agony , the trumpet 's blast , calmly directing the storm , or perhaps himself heading the charge , and rushing foremost in the onset , and inspiring thousands with a heroism they never felt before , - this is a display of energy and power , that must command admiration even from those who turn with loathing and horror from the scene . This union of physical with intellectual power , however , is more remarkable and magnificent in the orator than in the soldier ; for here , the intellect predominates . It is mind manifesting itself in the brightest form of matter , and simply using it to give a more b*itense and perceptible expression to thought . In the warrior , the physical seems to prevail ; it is aided by the intellectual , but it makes mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to muscles and sinews , to animal courage and strength , than to intellectual power . The orator occasions , in a degree , the same effect , but in a far more noble manner . " Before whom , " says Cicero , " do men tremble ? on whom do they gaze stupefied ? at whose words do they shout ? whom do they regard as a God among men ? " * To some it may seem strange that one , whose ambition was so great as Cicero 's , should have been content to rest his fame on a distinction so transient as that gained by the orator . True eloquence , as Cicero understood the word , uttered , not written , was to be terminated with the life of the orator . * De Oratore , lib. 3 , c. 14. // When that voice which invoked the people to their duties , as with a trumpet call , at whose sound the guilty quailed and fled , which made one tyrant tremble on his judgment-seat , and goaded another to very madness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , and the graceful right hand had lost its cunning ; where was that eloquence to which a life of industry and careful labor had been devoted ? For a few years the memory of it lingered among his countrymen , who thought with hitter feelings of that name they dared not utter , and that glory which Rome was never again to witness ; but one by one all who had listened to him passed away , and the oratory of Cicero was a forgotten thing , or survived only in vague tradition . Why then , it may be asked , should a man of his genius devote his life to building up a monument , which at his death would melt away and disappear like some gorgeous cloud-pile which the wind scatters ? But , . we ask , is eloquence so transient ? Though the voice of the orator or the tragedian be hushed in death , do his glory and power pass away entirely ? Though we may no longer hear his voice , or be moved by his eloquence ; though these may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not lost upon the earth . Has the memory of those mighty orators who have lived before , perished altogether ? is it not handed down from those who listened to the strains , to their children , and their children 's children , from generation to generation , till the fame thereof has filled the whole earth ? The writer , indeed , addresses us , centuries after his death , in the self-same words that he spoke to his contemporaries , while the accents of the orator are forgotten . But the memory of the results he brought to pass , the power he exerted , the good he did , can never die ; it endures with life-giving and eternal power ; it exists in the hearts of thousands , a beautiful ideal , which the lips may fail perhaps to body forth , but which the mind conceives and beholds in its full glory . It lives on , a standard and model which urges thousands forward to a perfection they could never have reached without it . In this sense , there is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orator . He who founds a city , or discovers a continent , leaves an imperishable fame ; but the monument of an orator 's glory is not less real , firm , and lasting ; it is renewed with every successive age ; it lives again in the accents of every eloquent man whom it has stimulated to // be what he is . In this view of it , the fame of an orator is well worth possessing , because it is not an empty sound , but an active principle , that endures and exerts a noble influence through countless ages . An instance in illustration of our remarks occurs in the celebrated speech of Sheridan before the House of Commons , preceding the impeachment of Warren Hastings . The records of this speech have not been preserved , and there are few living who were blessed with the sound of that voice . It is only known , that at the close of the oration , Sir William Dolben moved an adjournment of the debate , on the ground , tL ) at , " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , it was impossible for him to give a determinate opinion . " Yet what volumes does this speak ! The imagination paints that august body whom the orator was addressing ; at first we see their usual indifference ; we notice them whispering and moving about , or lounging on their benches ; as the orator proceeds , their attention is gradually fixed ; they sit erect that they may listen more carefully ; the whispering and hustle cease ; the speaker himself loses his usual appearance of indifference and apathy ; the stern countenances relax , and tears are seen trickling down many a furrowed cheek . The stillness is now profound , broken only by the occasional sob , or the irrepressible cry of admiration , or perhaps at intervals the orator is interrupted , not by the usual tributes of applause , hut by cries of rapture , shouts that know not parliamentary forms , and which are uttered by those who would have repressed them , but could not . As he closes , and the sounds of his magnificent eloquence die upon the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Silence Was took ere she was ware , and wished she might Deny her nature , and be never more , Still to be so displaced . " Then follows that noble and generous tribute to his power , and the members withdraw in silence and meditation , astonished and overwhelmed by the gorgeous eloquence they had listened to . What the words were , and what the manner was , that so wrought upon this refined and fastidious body , can only be conjectured ; the imagination dwells upon it with longing , yet almost in despair ; but many a youthful orator has become eloquent from the image of perfection which this slight record has created in his mind . // But Cicero was impelled to the cultivation of eloquence by other motives besides those of ambition . He loved it as an art ; he felt that his capacities were peculiarly adapted to it ; and , smitten with the beauty of the ideal that existed in his mind , he was urged by an irresistible desire to give it expression . He labored for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . He bound himself for life to the pursuit , and no change of circumstance , no danger , no distress could induce him to abandon it . Was his voice drowned by the clamors of a fiery mob , had the Forum become the scene of riot and bloodshed , did the iron hand of the Dictator crush the growing flower of Roman oratory , still this great master , in his retirement , continued to cherish and preserve his beloved art ; he employed his leisure in drawing from his own experience those varied and minute rules for the guidance of others , which abound in his rhetorical writings and , looking ever forward with a patriot 's enthusiasm to the emancipation of his country , he kept alive the spark of eloquence at his own sacred hearth , and within the sanctuary of his home , consoling himself with the reflection , that although he might not live to see the results of his care , he was still bequeathing to posterity an inheritance that would not pass away . In his touching and beautiful language he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Hortensius , being left , as it were , the guardian of Orphan Eloquence , I keep her at my home , under careful protection . I repel those unknown and persevering suitors , and preserve her in chastity as a ripened Virgin , protecting her , as far as possible , from the eager pursuit of her lovers . And though I mourn that I have entered upon life , as upon a road , somewhat too late , and have fallen upon this night of the republic ere my journey was finished , I am nevertheless sustained by the consolation which you suggest in your delightful letters , when you bid me be of good cheer , because my good deeds shall speak of me when I am silent . And I shall live , though I be dead . "  --  De Claris Oratoribus , c. 96 . With Cicero eloquence was an art ; and in saying this we mean to convey the highest praise . The birth-place of art is in the soul ; it does not depend upon rules ; it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all theories and sciences ; it is a perfect idea , an image of beauty dwelling in the mind , in distinct and radiant traits , which we // seek to clothe in some form that may be comprehended by the senses . The sculptor embodies in marhie , the painter on canvass , the orator in words and action . Sculpture , as an art , existed in the fulness of perfection , when that form of faultless beauty beamed upon the soul of Phidias , which he afterwards portrayed in the ivory . The rules of the art are subsequent , and are derived from the various expressions of the preconceived ideal . The same is the case with poetry . " Assuredly , " says one of our own writers , " epic poetry was invented then , and not before , when the gorgeous vision of the Iliad , not in its full detail of circumstance , but in the dim conception of its leading scenes and holder features , hurst into the soul of Homer . " So it was with Cicero , in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had gone before him ; hut the ideal existed in his mind above all rules , and he embodied it in a more perfect form than had ever before heen witnessed . When we say , therefore , that with him eloquence was an art , we mean , that it was something not acquired hy rules , but preexisting in his mind ; aided , hut not formed , by industry ; giving birth to yhetoric , not receiving existence from it . To hut few individuals has this beautiful conception been granted . It was given undoubtedly to Cicero ; it was felt by Sheridan , when , after his first speech in the House of Commons , he made that characteristic exclamation , " It is in me , however , and by God it shall come out . " But like that glorious city of Paradise in the eastern fable , it is revealed only to a few favored mortals , who are permitted , once in a century , to gaze on its splendors , while the search for it is hopeless to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it appears in his orations , we must view it as an art , and we must apply to it the same principles of criticism that we would to the fine arts . We must judge of the harmony and symmetry of the parts , the resemblance to nature , the finish of the work , the peculiar traits which give it individuality , the effect of the whole . In looking for the characteristics of Cicero 's eloquence , we shall perhaps , at first , be at a loss to discover any leading and peculiarly prominent feature . We never hear of the thunders , or the blasting power , or the honeyed accents , or of any single distinguishing mark , as in the oratory of Nestor , // Ulysses , Demosthenes , Isocrates . Not that he is deficient in any of these qualities , but they are so blended as to form a perfect whole ; which we suppose to he the highest reach of art . The drawing of his pictures is not pointed out as peculiarly fine , because the coloring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous by the want of symmetry in the members ; all is well-proportioned and harmonious . Yet nothing can be marked with a stronger individuality than his style . It belongs peculiarly to himself . There is a felicity in his expressions , a distitictness and power given to words , a beauty in the flow of his sentences , which seem almost magical . Language , with him , becomes a new thing ; it is perfectly transparent and radiant with thought . It seems , when we are reading his works , as if intellect itself had become visible before us , or at least had assumed the most etherial form in which it is possible to give expression to thought . The words seem rather to be created at the moment , and to be instinct and co-existent with the idea , than to be used only as a vehicle of communication already formed , and fitted equally to convey the thoughts of other minds . Compared with Livy , for instance , his style seems like the natural flower , in which the hues appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the rich embroidery , whose threads and tissue might have been employed to represent any other form as well . Nothing is more remarkable , in reading Cicero 's orations , than the immense advantage which he immediately takes , in whatever question he is to discuss . We feel sure , almost at the first sentence he utters , that his argument will prevail . Like the accomplished swordsman , at the first attitude he assumes , at the first glance of his weapon , the first parry or thrust , we feel that victory is in his hands . So with Cicero ; he immediately takes a position which he is not to abandon , and which ensures success . And this is done , not by any unfairness of argument , or by assuming that to which he has no right , but by a noble power of intellect , which enables him to comprehend , as by intuition , the whole bearing of the question , to penetrate its depths , and measure every side at a glance ; and not only to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea is to rest , but to anticipate and render powerless the attacks of his adversary . A remarkable instance of this is to be found in the first of // his Orations against Verres . He was called to the difficult task of arraigning before a corrupt , and entirely venal court , a wealthy and powerful man , who , by an exaggeration of the crimes usually practised in the provinces , had outraged even the shameful tyranny of Roman pr*tors , and had compelled guilt itself to cry out against him . The chief hope of Verres was in bribing the judges ; and his immense wealth was accordingly lavished upon them , in firm reliance on their accommodating infamy . To meet and counteract this venality of the judges was the great object of the first oration . He hegins in the following bold and masterly style . " The occasion which was most to be desired , and which has the greatest influence in allaying the odium into which your order , 0 judges ! has fallen , and the infamy of the courts , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human counsel ; and at the most favorable moment for the republic . An opinion , pernicious to the republic and dangerous to yourselves , has long been entertained , not only at Rome , but in foreign nations , that no rich man can be condemned in our courts , as they now exist , however guilty he may he . And now , at a moment so critical to your order , while there are men prepared , by harangues and by proposing laws , to inflame the odium of the senate , Caius Verres is brought to trial ; a man whose life and deeds convict him in the minds of all ; but who , as he himself hopes and boasts , is already acquitted through his vast wealth . To the great satisfaction of the Roman people , I have appeared in this cause , not to increase the odium attached to your order , but to remove the infamy which notoriously clings to it . " - Orat. 1 . in Ver. , c . I. The whole oration is a wonderful piece of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Rome is roused against the criminal ; that he is regarded as a public enemy , and that all who appear as his friends must be ranked with him . He constantly refers to the opinion , prevalent throughout Rome and the provinces , that no rich man can be convicted on trial ; and he cites as a proof the declaration of Verres , that be should be content , if he could turn to his own profit , only one third of his three years ' plunder of Sicily ; that the remainder was to be employed in procuring patrons and bribing the judges ; and he here repeats what had greatly moved the people before , that he expected the provinces would soon be sending ambassadors to beg for a repeal of the law against extortion ; for , in that case , the printors would // only seize upon as much as they wanted for their own use ; while , at present , they are obliged to take not only enough to enrich themselves , but to defray the enormous expense of the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the judges , is a noble strain of eloquence . " You , 0 Glabrio , by your wisdom , influence , and care can take such measures that this disgrace shall not befall you . Take up the cause of the courts ; take up the cause of strict justice , integrity , good faith , religion ; take up the cause of the senate , that this order , by the result of the present trial , may recommend itself to the praise and gratitude of the Roman people . Think who you are , in what place you are , what you owe to the Roman people , what is due to your ancestors . Preserve continually in mind the Acilian law , proposed by your father , through the aid of which the people gained incorruptible courts and inflexible judges , in trials for the crime of extortion . Mighty examples are around you , which will not suffer you to forget the glory of your family ; which by day and by night rem ad you of yonr brave father ; your wise grandparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy and determination of your father , Glabrio , in resisting the most unprincipled men ; if you possess the sagacity of your grandfather , Sca*vola , in foreseeing the treachery which threatens to ruin your fame ; if you have the firmness of your father-in-law , Scaurus , so that no man can move you from your fixed and settled opinion , then will the Roman people discover , that in the sight of an upright and honest pra*tor , and a chosen body of judges , immense wealth will do more to throw suspicion on the accused , than to secure his safety . " - Orat. 1 . in Ver. , c. 17 . We might go on , almost without limit , discoursing on the varied beauty and power displayed in the Orations . No attribute or accomplishment of a perfect orator is wanting in them ; every note in the broad scale is sounded with a master 's touch . The depth of pathos , passages of heartrending emotion , light and playful satire , blasting sarcasm , the deep tone of indignation , gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thunder , and the furious storm of invective which crush and overwhelm the criminal ; all are found in these wonderful remains of art . We proceed to the consideration of Cicero 's character as a patriot and a statesman . Much as he loved eloquence and all glorious as he deemed it , his oratory would have // been poor and worthless to him , had he not regarded an orator and patriot as one and the same thing . He held that this perfect man was to devote his whole powers , expanded into their fulness in the study of eloquence , to the service of his country ; and in this belief he educated himself . He was truly a patriot , ready to live for his country , or to die for her , whenever the time should come . In this ardent patriotism , Cicero proved that he belonged to the highest order of minds ; for all history shows that this exists most strongly in the most gifted individuals . True patriotism is so expansive in its nature , so wide in its views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic , and powerfill , that it is beyond the comprehension of cold hearts and narrow minds . It is the attribute of a great and godlike nature . It gathers the wealth of past experience , penetrates the future , connects causes and effects , is exhaustless in invention , fertile in eu*pedients , firm in the midst of danger , undaunted in adversity ; ever hoping , ever sustaining and cheering the faint-hearted ; in the midst of defeat displaying its most glorious powers , and deriving success from apparent disaster ; surviving hope itself , and yielding only when the storm has swept over the last retreat of freedom , and all is lost . Such was the patriotism of Cicero . His heart burned with the same ardent love of his country that fired the breast of Dante , of Machiavel , of Angelo , and Milton . He regarded his beloved republic with more than . filial affection and duty ; and to her service he solemnly dedicated his talents , his energies , and his life . And it is in this connexion that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in this connexion that the stern realities of his life , his struggles , and his sufferings present themselves . We can not wish that Cicero had lived at an earlier period , hecause his genius was not fitted for a less civilized state of society . Had his lot been cast in the sterner days of Roman republicanism , before conquered Greece had begun to subdue and humanize her gigantic foe , and while courage and military eminence alone secured dignity and power ; it is extremely probable that Cicero , with all his powers of mind , would have been comparatively insignificant . He was too late for a patriot ; but not for an orator , a scholar , and a philosopher . Eloquence had only begun to flourish in his earlier days , and we find him occasionally apologizing for his love of literature and philoso // phy , as if they were pursuits of doubtful respectability even in his time . He lived too late to save his country , but it was the time best fitted perhaps to develope his talents . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful warrior ; a century later , that free voice would have been frozen up by the chill blast of despotism . He lived to be hailed the father of his country , and to bequeath an unfading glory to posterity ; but it was the melancholy glory of dying for a country he could not save . Viewed , then , in relation to the fortunes of Rome , the life of Cicero assumes the interest arid affecting character of a deep tragedy . His lot was cast in times of trouble , corruption , violence , and ruin . His earliest recollections were of proscriptions , fligbt , and bloodshed ; he had witnessed the struggles of Marius and Sylla , and had seen each of those tyrants in turn victorious , and coming , like the destroying angel , to devastate Rome . He found the courts of justice selling their verdicts ; the mob , headed by any worthless demagogue , ruling the Forum ; the Senate feeble and irresolute ; men in power plunging the state into civil war for their own aggrandizement ; the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they might be trampled upon the next , selling their birthright for shows and combats , and submitting tamely to any master who should place himself over them . Such was the country which Cicero loved and longed to save . He gloried in the bright days of Rome 's great conquests ; and with a fond pride he convinced himself that his ideal republic had been exemplified and realized in the ancient times of his country . To restore her former glories , was the great object of his efforts through life , steadily pursued , though at times almost in despair . His whole life was an ineffectual struggle , for the seeds of corruption had been sown broad and deep , and it was too late to root them out . How profound was his sorrow , we may discover from numerous passages in his writings , where he bursts out into exclamations of bitter wailing over the general ruin , with a power and intensity that approach the loftiest efforts of tragedy . It seems to us , that the dramatist could scarcely find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fortunes of Cicero . His deep and tender affections ; his calm and majestic philosophy ; his stern integrity and love of virtue , shining more brightly in the midst of the general corruption // his longing for the freedom of his country constantly disappointed , and his fond hopes ever blasted ; the insults which his lofty mind was compelled to brook ; his struggles , his tremendous energies , his despair , his flight and death , are marked with a continuance and rapidity of action , and an intensity of interest , which give them the highest dramatic effect . The dream of his life was to restore his country to the condition of virtue and freedom , which he supposed to have formerly existed . He vainly imagined that it was in the power of one man , or a few men , to save a state already decaying at the core . He did not comprehend that a nation , which is in need of the efforts of *t few individuals , or of one gifted and virtuous man , to rescue it from degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chained by a despot . He seems almost wilfully to have blinded his eyes to the actual state of things ; and to have been constantly sustained by a fond hope , which cool judgment must have convinced him could never he realized . We do not regret that this was so . We admire and reverence the ardent love of his country , which made him cling to her cause to the very last ; the unwearied perseverance which almost triumphed over despair 1tself ; the constancy with which he returned to his public duties at every interval of despotism ; and we are aware that the infatuation into which his intense patriotism led him , was the secret of his greater efforts , and added a deeper interest to his history and a brighter halo to his glory . The same self-deception appears in his estimate of the ancient condition of the Roman republic . The second hook of his famous treatise " De Republich " contains a hasty sketch of the history of Rome , from the foundation of the city down to the fall of the Decemvirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the philosophy of history , hut inspired throughout by his patriotic devotion . He takes the bare outline , indistinct and uncertain as it is , and gives it the coloring of his own bright imagination . His deep reverence for the institutions of his ancestors blinds him to their defects , and throws a false though beautiful hue over all . Yet when he discusses abstractly the nature of the various forms of government , no one can fail to be struck with the penetration and sagacity which he displays . The first hook , " De Republich , " is devoted chiefly to the consideration of the three great forms of government , // their advantages and defects ; and it is from this portion of his writings , more than any other , that we gather his real , unprejudiced , and settled views of the nature of political constitutions . To some , perhaps , it will seem surprising , that Cicero was far from being a republican , in a present acceptation of the term . There was nothing in him of that vague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular infallibility , which is so ridiculous and so disgusting in the radicals of England and France at the present day . He never so much as says fine things about liberty , and the death of tyrants , and the people 's rights ; he never declaims in this school-boy style , learned from the imaginative historian of the Gracchi , the Brutuses , and Cassiuses , and repeated with school-boy patriotism , by the blundering , self-named patriots of the present day . Even by the word republic , he does not mean a democracy , but he uses it throughout the treatise as simply signifying an organized state ; and as for the purest form of a popular government , he seems to regard it as the worst of all . Cicero understood human nature too well , and had experienced too much in his own day , to indulge in any Utopian visions of perfect equality in condition , wealth , and power . There are passages in his Republic , descriptive of the horrors of popular license , which seem almost prophetic . In tracing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of governing , he remarks ; " For as from the overweening power of princes comes their own destruction , so liberty itself sinks a people that is too free , into slavery ; and thus this excessive liberty gives birth to tyranfly , and brings on the most unjust and dreadful slavery . For from the midst of this unsubdued , or rather ferocious people , some one is chosen to be a leader against their distressed and banished princes , who is bold and unscrupulous , and ready to persecute those who deserve well of their country ; yielding himself , and making others yield , to the passions of the populace . If good citizens can put down such men , the state recovers ; but otherwise , it sinks under tyranny . And thus the supreme power is like a ball hurried from one hand to another ; from kings to tyrants , from these to the nobles , or the people , and thence to the hands of factions or tyrants again ; nor is there any permanent form of government . " - Dc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government , and pointing out their various advantages and defects , he declares himself // in favor of a mixed form , composed from the other three ; and he seems to lay great stress upon this opinion , as he distinctly expresses it several times . He says " I therefore am of opinion , that a fourth form of government is best , compounded and mixed of those three which I before described . " Again ; " 1 approve no one of the three in itself apart , but I prefer to these a form of government composed of all the three others . " And still again , he says " Of all the three forms of government first named , a monarchy is , in my opinion , far the best ; but better than a monarchy itself will be that form which is equally composed and balanced by the other three . " - " I wish that in the state , there should be one preeminent and royal principle ; that a second portion of the government should be allotted to the nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will of the multitude . Such a constitution has a degree of equality , without which , freedom can not exist ; and stability , which the other kinds do not possess ; a king being soon converted into a master , an aristocracy into a faction , and a popular government into anarchy . All which can not happen in a mixed form , unless the rulers are fallen into the worst faults ; for there is no reason for change , when every one is firmly established in his own grade . " - Dc Repub. , lib. 1 . Such are the conclusions , in which he rests in this famous treatise ; conclusions , of course , having reference to the condition of communities less enlightened , and accordingly less capable of unparticipated self-government , than the theory of our institutions supposes ours to he . M. Villemain , the learned editor of the Paris edition of this work , remarks , in comparing Cicero 's Republic with that of Plato ; " In the arrangement of the work , in the choice and disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato ; his object , and even the manner of attaining it , were very different ; the one attempting to conceive an ideal republic ; the other , to describe a republic actually in existence ; the one seeking perfection in extravagant hypotheses ; the other believing he had found it in the ancient constitution of Rome . " This distinction does not seem to us to do justice to Cicero . So far as concerns the state of Rome , indeed , his republic is // not less ideal than Plato 's ; he invests the constitution of his country with merits and beauties which never belonged to it , and which existed in his mind alone . On this point he differs from Plato only by calling his ideal republic Rome , and placing it on the banks of the Tiber ; giving it a local habitation and a name . But the real difference between the two is far greater and more important . The republic of Plato is visionary , Utopian , impossible ; that of Cicero is practical , and resulting from the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public affairs . The work " De Republic*O ' consisted originally of six books . During the period of ignorance which succeeded the downfall of the Roman empire , it was lost ; all but a few passages , quoted by grammarians , or by the early Christian writers , and that beautiful fragment from the sixth book , containing the " Dream of Scipio , " which was cited entire with a grotesque commentary by Macrobius , in the early part of the fifth century . The work is scarcely referred to after that period . We can only conjecture that the Greeks of Byzantium knew something of it , from a passage of Photius , one of their writers in the eighth century ; who says , he has been reading a political work , in six books , in the form of a dialogue , between two persons named Menas and Thomas , in which the writer expresses an opinion , that a form of government composed of the three others is best . M. Villemain supposes , that this work referred to by Photius , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatise of Cicero , in which the writer , ignorant of Roman history , judged best to substitute the name of the referendary Thomas , in the place of that of Scipio Africanus , as the chief speaker . The discovery of the lost work was reserved to our time . Signor Angelo Mai , the librarian of the Ambrosian collection , at Milan , had distinguished himself by the discovery of several remains of ancient writers . Being aware of the habit , common to authors of the middle ages , of writing their essays over the manuscripts of more ancient writers , in consequence of the scarcity of parchment , he directed his attention to this mode of recovering the lost treasures of antiquity . Thus , in 1814 , he found portions of three of Cicero 's orations , beneath the lines of Sedulius , a Latin poet of the Middle Ages . Some time afterwards , an immense manuscript , containing the voluminous Acts of the Council of Chalcedon , revealed to // him the traces of an earlier writing , which , upon investigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentary ; long passages from Symmachus , the celebrated orator of the fourth century ; epistles in Latin and Greek , of Fronto ; and some of the letters of Marcus Aurelius , in Latin . And in 1817 , he found portions of a very ancient commentary on Virgil , beneath a manuscript of the homilies of St. Gregory . Mai was soon afterwards appointed librarian of the Vatican ; and about the year 1820 , he had the good fortune to discover what we now possess of the work " De Republic* , " over which had been written , in the sixth century , the Commentary of St. Augustine , on the Psalms . The " Republic , " however , as we now possess it , is far from complete . Of the third book , more than half is lost of the fourth and fifth books , not a dozen pages remain ; of the sixth , we have no more than the " Dream of Scipio " ; the first and second hooks , with the exception of a few pages , remain entire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of Cilicia . So much of it has been lost , that it seems difficult , if not impossible , to judge of the character of the work as a whole . The most we can do is to gather , from the fragments , the subjects which were discussed in the books succeeding the second , and infer , from our general knowledge of the views and principles of Cicero , in what manner he has treated them . An analysis of the third book is found in the work of St. Augustine , " De Civitate Dei , " from which it appears , that the dialogue is commenced by Philus , who defends the position that a state can not be governed without the aid of injustice . The reply is put into the mouth of Ltelius , who pronounces a beautiful eulogy upon justice , which comes gracefully from a young and ardent mind . Scipio then resumes the discourse , and proceeds to show how a republic ceases to be so , - that is , to be a commonwealth , the affair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether a monarchy , oligarchy , or democracy , is perverted in the persons of the rulers . In the fourth and fifth books , he appears to have spoken of the education of the young , the preservation of morals in a state , and the spirit in which the laws should be framed . So very small a portion , however , of these works is preserved* that we can only conjecture some of the subjects of discussion ; and these are no more than indicated by the short fragments of the chapters . // The " Dream of Scipio , " which is all that remains of the sixth book , is a sublime exhortation to the love and practice of duty and patriotism , addressed by the elder Africanus to his descendant ; with the promise of eternal life and happiness to those who , by virtue and devotion to the service of their country , shall merit a habitation among the stars . The picture is drawn with a graphic power , which places the scene vividly before us ; we seem ourselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , and to behold the unwonted grandeur and glory of the stars . Our eyes are looking upon those , vast spheres which the Divinity encompasses , and we listen to the glorious harmony of their movement ; we see our own planet , far , far beneath , dwindling into a mere point in the distance ; the majestic form of the old hero is before us ; we hear his soul-stirring words , as he tells us of the vanity of human distinctions , the glory of a second life , compared with which , our present existence is but death ; of the pathway which leads up to heaven ; and as the vision fades from our view , the inspired words of the Sage are still sounding in our ears , " Know then that thou art a God . " Such is all that remains of ' the famed " Republic " of Cicero . Yet , mutilated and unsatisfactory as it is , it has a deep interest for us , as connected with the history of the author . We regard it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his last will and testament , which , in a few years , he was solemnly to seal with his blood . Soon after its publication , the war commenced between Ctesar and Pompey , which resulted in the final overthrow of the Roman constitution . There are periods in the history of every nation , when one act in the great drama they are living seems to be concluded , and another to begin . Such was the moment when C*sar invaded Italy . From this time the march of Roman history has the unity and continued action of the last act of a tragedy . The Dictator was murdered , only to be succeeded by a meaner and more detestable tyrant , who , in his turn , was defeated to give place to an emperor , that name so inseparably associated with the ruin of antiquity . Then followed ages of crime , infamy , and despair , till the last torch whiGh had glimmered over the ruins of Roman greatness went out , and left the world in the darkness of midnight . These were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his " Republic " is to be regarded as the last appeal to his countrymen // for the rescue of the state . A stormy sea of ruin and anarchy was before him ; the rising tide was dashing its furious waves at his feet , on the last retreat of liberty , and beneath it were the wrecks of ancient virtue and greatness ; and the setting sun of freedom , as it sank beneath the waves , shed its dying glory upon the stern and mournful countenance of the Last of the Romans . We come now to the examination of Cicero 's philosophical writings , which have for us , and for all ages , a deep and lasting interest . We are not sure that we would not rather give up all his other compositions than these . Not that we consider them remarkable for originality . Cicero 's philosophy differs little or none from that of Plato ; he does not appear to have made discoveries beyond those of the Grecian sage , or to have penetrated much deeper into the destinies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which one of the greatest men of antiquity rested , when aided by the best philosophy that the world afforded . Cicero , the last great moralist , the last philosopher , before the Christian era , and living at no very distant time from it , may be regarded as the great judge of all the ancient systems . The sages of antiquity , Socrates , Plato , Xenophon , Aristotle , Pythagoras , Epicurus , Zeno , the founders of all the different systems , pass in review before him , and each pleads the cause of his own theory . We hear the seducing voice of the advocate of pleasure , as he comes , with the flower-wreath round his brows , from his voluptuous retreats , to set forth in melodious accents the captivating lessons of his philosophy . He passes on , and the stern form of the Stoic next presents itself . He announces , in words of solemn import , his belief that virtue is the only good ; that pleasure is not to be sought , nor pain avoided ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we listen to his pleading , that he would make the earth a hell , in his words of ill omen and despair . To him succeeds the great disciple of Socrates . Thought is engraved on his lofty brow , and benevolence and affei*tion beam from his mild and spiritual countenance . He sets forth , with soul-stirring eloquence , his sublime philosophy , his belief in immortality , his love of virtue , his vast comprehension of the Deity ; and we perceive , as he speaks , that he is touching chords in the heart of his judge , which vibrate in harmony with his own ; that // he is appealing to a kindred intellect , and that his purified and etherial musings are comprehended and appreciated . Cicero , as the judge of the philosophy of antiquity , sums up the arguments , and gives his verdict . He is aided by all the learning of the past , by years of study and communion with the master spirits of Greece , and , still more , by his own capacious and sublime intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the various systems before him . With a mind capable of soaring to the highest flight of unaided reason , intuitively comprehending , and even looking down upon , the theories of all preceding philosophers , and of choosing from among them all that was elevated , true , and enduring , lie is to be regarded as the representative of the best philosophy of antiquity , and as standing upon the uttermost height which the mind , unaided by supernatural power , can reach . In this view , Cicero is undoubtedly to be held up as the individual , who , of all the Pagan world , approaches nearest in his belief and doctrines to Christianity ; and his philosophical writings have an interest for us , separate from himself , inasmuch as they are to be taken as an example of what the unaided powers of man actually are ; the extreme limit which reason alone can attain ; the uttermost reach of philosophy which rests only upon its own strength . And it is worthy of note , that modern philosophy in its speculations upon these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes not a step beyond the systems of ancient Greece . These writings have another hold upon our sympathies and interests , as revealing to us the workings of a great mind , which was pondering upon the most solemn and momentous of all questions , its own life and destinies . Never , before the days of Christianity , was there a man , whose life would more naturally lead him to meditnie on these subjects . Placed in the midst of turmoil , confusion , and bloodshed ; mourning over the many friends who had fallen before the invaders of Rome ; disappointed in his most cherished hopes ; driven from the Forum , in poverty and exile ; in his old age left friendless and alone ; it was natural for such a mind to turn for consolation to the precepts and admonitions of philosophy , and still more , to the support and comfort which his own speculations , the yearnings he felt , the hopes he formed , the belief in which he rested , might afford . Accordingly there is a reality and practicalness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculations of no other ancient writer . We know that he resorted to it as a refuge from the cares and sorrows of life ; that he found consolation in adversity ; and that , as far as nature could be made to yield to false or imperfect views , his life was an illustration of his maxims , and gave a sanction to the opinions he advocated . Standing alone in the midst of desolation , with the graves of his friends around him , and the ruins of his country beneath his feet , with no light to cheer him but the stars that glimmered coldly and feebly in ther night of paganism , his great spirit is still borne up and sustained by its own innate energies ; he hears a voice that whispers of immortality , and a happiness beyond the reach of mortal cares and woes . He penetrates the mystery of life , and discovers that its toils and troubles are to end in eternal joy . Lie recognises in Nature the universal mind which is God ; and he discovers in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bow of promise is traced before him in the firmament , and the glorious harmony of revolving worlds bursts upon his ravished ear . To all , then , to whom the study of man is interesting , who would fathom the depths of the soul , who would comprehend its native , unaided energies , these writings will never cease to preserve their value . As models of beautiful composition , they are unrivalled in the works of all antiquity ; and they are inspired by a spirit of eloquence , fervor , and majestic philosophy , which may read many a solemn and impressive lesson , even to the favored disciple of a better Teacher . Before proceeding to examine the philosophy and religion of Cicero , we wish to portray a few of the most remarkable features of the prevailing Grecian systems , to which his attention was directed , and which may be supposed to have exerted an influence in forming his views . It will not be necessary , in doing this , to enter into a minute examination of the various theories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are to be found in all the ancient systems , a few prevailing and hnportant principles , which it is our object to trace ; and in which they have a general resemblance . The great object of all ancient philosophy , was happiness and the means by which all the various systems sought to attain this end , was by alleviating , or conquering the sufferings which await our mortal career . In these general points , they // greatly resemble each other . The Epicurean sought happiness by the power of enduring and despising pain , not less than the Stoic . The Platonist blended the philosophy of both ; with the Epicurean , he agreed that all pleasure is not to be contemned ; with the Stoic , he allowed that virtue is the greatest good . The first great point of resemblance between these different systems , the first pervading principle which we discover in all , is , that they use their efforts to reconcile great inconsistencies . The fact that man alone , of all created things , is made susceptible of sorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who denied the immortality of the soul , it was a mystery wholly impenetrable . To the Platonist , Jt afforded an argument in favor of a future existence ; but this belief , though it gave him consolation , still did not explain the wonder . " Why , " he still asked , " is man horn to sorrow ? " In truth , the life of man appeared to the pagan world , only a cruel mockery . Endowed with capacities to suffer , and visited with bitter afflictions , his very existence was tragedy . Fate , stern , relentless fate hung over him , and beset his pathway . His soul was filled with longings , that were never to be gratified , and rent with passions , that could never be laid to sleep . He was surrounded by objects of happiness and enjoyment , which did but contrast with his own misery . All nature seemed to rejoice , while he alone was wretched . The sounds that met his ear on every side , the gay carol of the birds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and the rivulets , the roar of the torrent , and the joyous gamboling of the floods , all served but to warn him , that he alone was laden with sorrow . Encompassed with the emblems of eternity , he felt with unutterable anguish , that he , the lord of all , was mortal . On every side , he was reminded of his own frail and comparatively transient existence ; the rocks and the everlasting hills , the rivers , that flowed on for countless ages , the ceaseless rolling of the illimitable and fathomless ocean , the unwearied motion of the heavens , the never-dying lustre of the sun and stars , seemed only to deride his span of existence . Why then was man created only to suffer and to die ? To triumph over the sorrows and afflictions of this mortal career , to make life a season of enjoyment , to concentrate in the present state of being , that happiness , which , by man 's // very nature , belongs only to a future life , was the gveat end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it attempted to achieve . In reasoning upon the present existence , as man 's ultimate destiny , and in regarding it otherwise than as a preparation for immortality , the ancient systems undertook to reconcile inconsistencies , which **ould never be overcome . To accomplish the great end of making life endurable , and , if possible , happy , it was necessary to crush , root Qut , and destroy many of the qualities innate in the soul . And here we find another great feature pervading all the ancient systems . To bear sorrow , they endeavoured not to checr the mind by the assurance that its strength and purity were to be attained and increased through trials , but by conquering those propensities which render it susceptible of suffering . The loss of friends was a bitter evil , and the philosophy of Greece , therefore , bade us bury the memory of their loVe with them in the grave . The dread of death is an instinctive sentiment ; and the Epicurean would persuade us to conquer it , by the belief that total insensibility succeeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover , or dared not confess , that the idea of annihilation is utterly abhorrent to the soul . In short , to enable man to find the happiness for which he was destined by nature , this philosophy sought to narrow and confine the spirit to a mortal career alone ; and to trample upon every emotion , passion , susceptibility , which belonged to a more than finite existence . The throbbings of a love too vast for earth , the affections which revealed a better nature , the tenderness and trust which the world would rebuke and disappoint , the power to sympathize and share in the sorrows of others , the delicacy of soul , which , in the hour of trial , must be sustained by more than human strength , all these were to be conquered , quelled , laid to rest for ever . The different systems agreed in another important point ; they refused to acknowledge the gods which were worshipped by the mass of the people . Here , undoubtedly , they accomplished some good . They put an end to superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those degrading rites which even the tasteful mythology of Greece ordained ; and in this respect , they no doubt gave freedom to the mind , and enabled it to rise above the uninstructed and uninitiated herd . But in doing away the religious systems that prevailed , they struck a // death-ble w at one of the noblest instincts of the soul , its power auid propensity to worship and adore . The Epicurean and the Stoic taught the doctrine that either there were no gods , cr none to whom worship was due ; and the disciples of Plato , though taught to look up to the Universal Mind as an ob*ect of imittition , do not seem to have comprehended the feeling of devotion or gratitude towards the Supreme Power . And herein the ancient philosophy seems to us to have done the deepest wrong to our nature ; for if there is one instinct more fully developed , more universally apparent , more deeply rooted than all others , it is the impulse to prayer and adoration . The most benighted and barbarous ignorance can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promote it . Such were some of the leading features which pervaded all the philosophy of Greece . That the doctrines of Plato went far beyond all others in their approach to the truth , and their fitness to meet the wants of the mind , there can be no doubt . He distinctly expresses his belief in the immortality of the soul , making this , indeed , the leading feature of his philosophy . His idea of the Deity was pure , rational , and exalted ; and his views of life , in many respects , extremely just . In matters of doctrine , Cicero did not advance beyond Plato . Yet we should be unwilling to call him a mere disciple of the Grecian sage , for we can not help feeling , that , had Socrates and Plato never lived , he would have arrived at nearly the same conclusions . His belief in immortality , which he declares in so many noble passages in all his works , his vast comprehension of God , his unconquerable love of duty and virtue , seem the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of another man 's principles . Much regret has been expressed , that instead of discussing the systems of other philosophers , he did not direct his efforts to the establishmnent of a philosophy of his own . But we can not feel this regret . On the contrary , we rejoice that he has added his testimony in favor of those doctrines , which seem to us the nearest approach that unaided man can make to Christianity . With unerring and elevated perception , he gathers from the philosophy of Greece all that it contained of truth and beauty , and power to assuage grief , or to cheer the spirit in its efforts . But , at the same time , there was a strength of sentiment , which utterly refused to yield to the blighting and crushing // influences that the ancient systems exerted . He could not , with the Stoic , trample upon those finer principles of the soul , which are nearest akin to a divine nature . He could not , with the Epicurean , yield himself up to a life of selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which whispered to him , that he could find no happiness where duty and honor were not the leading motives . He could not , with Plato , hold that reason alone was divine ; because he felt within him those affections and yearnings , and that depth and intensity of sentiment , which were above reason , and which more loudly vindicated their immortality . He embraced the speculative doctrines of Plato , as far as his keen instinct discovered truth in them ; bu*his spirit was ever soaring beyond the walls that encompasseZf ' it , and seeking for something that was more consoling , more responsive to its wants , than he could find in the lore of all antiquity . And herein we discover one of the great causes of that sadness which marks almost his whole history . Happy indeed would it have been , if he could have rooted out and destroyed that extreme delicacy and sensitiveness , which form so distinguishing a trait in his character . His frantic grief , and his unmanly lamentations , during his exile , would then have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of his daughter would not have refused comfort . But he had not acquired this self-command . He possessed all the tenderness of feeling , all the sympathy and strong affection which are kept alive in the heart of the true Christian ; but he wanted that support and consolation which the Christian receives from his religion . The letter addressed to him by his friend Sulpicius , on the death of his daughter , is one of the most celebrated and admirable specimens of ancient practical philosophy that has come down to us . One passage , which has been particularly admired , we cite entire . " On my return out of Asia , as I was sailing from *iEgina towards Megara , I amused myself with contemplating the circumjacent countries . Behind me lay iEgina , before me Megara ; on my right I saw the Pira*us , and on my left , Corinth . These cities , once so flourishing and magnificent , now presented nothing to my view , but a sad spectacle of desolation . Alas ! I said to myself , shall such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his species falls , either by the hand of violence , or by the common course of nature ; whilst in this nar* // row compass , so many great and glorious cities , formed for a much longer duration , thus lie extended in ruins ? Remember then , oh my heart ! the general lot to which man is born , and let that thought suppress thy unreasonable murmurs ! Believe me , I found my mind greatly comforted and refreshed by these reflections . Let me advise you , in the same manner , to represent to yourself , what numbers of our illustrious countrymen have lately been cut off at once ; how much the strength of the Roman republic is impaired , and what dreadful devastation has gone forth throughout all its provinces ! and can you , with the impression of these greater calamities upon your mind , be so immoderately afflicted for the loss of a single individual , a poor , little , tender woman ? who , if she had not died at this time , must , in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which she was born . " Yet we feel , at once , that all this was insufficient to give him consolation . So far as it was a manifestation of the sympathy and affectionate interest of his friend , it soothed and comforted him . But he was not to be cheered or calmed by reasoning of which his own keen instinct perceived the fallacy . To compare the existence of such a being as the beloved child he had lost , with that of a city or a state , seems almost an insult to the heart-broken parent . He felt that he was mourning over a sadder ruin than all the remains of antiquity ; that the being he had lost was more precious , and more grand , than the created universe ; that in this feeble woman there had breathed a soul , which made her of more consequence than the whole world beside , and that his loss could never be repaired . He mourned over her without comfort ; the feelings of the man and the father triumphed over the reason of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief from the intolerable burden which had been laid upon him . Of the religious views entertained by Cicero , it is well known that they had little or no sympathy with the prevailing theology of his time . He had no belief whatever in the existence of the deities of classical mythology ; though , as he regarded the superstition of the times as useful in upholding the state , he constantly encouraged the people , in his public capacity , to worship the gods with profound reverence . He utterly derides the whole business of signs , omens , and prophecies in his work , Dc Divinatione , and yet we find him // a successful candidate for a place in the college of Augurs . Yet he was , undoubtedly , deeply impressed with that feeling of awe and reverence for all that is higher and holier in nature , which we denominate religion . As a philosopher he offered no worship to the gods ; and yet no one can read the passages in his orations , where he refers to the goodness and tower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without feeling that such sentiments could only proceed from one who was penetrated with the feeling of religion . Of his deep reverence for the soul , and the sentiments of religion , with which he was penetrated , we may judge from this fine passage , in the work " Dc Legibus . " " For whoever knows himself will feel that he possesses something of a divine nature , and will regard the mind within him as a sacred image enshrined there , He will always act and think in a manner worthy of so great a gift of the gods ; and having tried himself and examined his whole nature , he will comprehend how well provided he has come into life , and how many means he possesses for grasping wisdom and making it his own ; since , from the beginning , he has conceived the germs of all knowledge shadowed forth , as it were , in his mind . Enlightened by these , with wisdom for his guide , he can see that he will be a good man , and for that reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the knowledge of virtue , has renounced obedience to the body and the influence of the passions , has ' conquered pleasure as some disgraceful infection , has soared above all fear of pain and death , united itself with other spirits , in whom it recognises a common nature , cultivated the worship of the gods , and pure religion , and increased its power of perception in choosing good and rejecting the contrary , ( whiTh virtue is to be called foresight or wisdom , ) what can be mentioned*or conceived of , more happy than such a soul ? And when a man has looked upon the heavens , earth , and sea ; has searched into the nature of all things ; has seen whence they are generated , whither they return , and in what manner they are to perish , what in them is mortal and destructible , and what is divine and eternal ; when he has almost comprehended the nature of the Ruler and Director of all , and recognised himself as confined by no walls to one spot , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in this universal magnificence , in the sight and knowledge of nature , how will he know himself ( the precept of the Pythian Apollo ) ; how contemptible , how despicable , how utterly insignificant will those things appear which are generally regarded as the greatest goods ! " . - De Legibus , lib. 1 , cap . 22 , 23. // We have thus examined the character of Cicero ; hastily and imperfectly , we are well aware , but with the hope only of exciting others to the study of his works , and the comprehension of one of the most remarkable minds of antiquity . The question here occurs , to what class of great men he belonged . There are some who have peculiarly the power to act immediately upon society , and to make their efforts felt throughout the world , at once and for ever : men who actually carry forward the age in which they live ; who advance the whole civilized world by one tremendous exertion of intellectual might , taking a step which can never be retraced . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who act with no less power upon their age , who occasion an equal advance , and confer benefits not less palpable and important ; yet perhaps by the exertion of less dazzling powers of mind . Of this class are the authors of the greater inventions and discoveries ; as Faustus , Columbus , Watt , Hervey . Their greatness is due * ) artly to fortunate combinations of circumstances , though much more to their own patience , perseverance , industry , and courage . We should , however , decidedly place these lower in the scale of greatness than the former , as their efforts are less purely intellectual , although resulting in consequences equally important . The greatness of such men is to he measurQd by the amount of good which they confer upon mankind , the labor they undergo , the dangers they incur , the power , moral , as well as intellectual , which they exert . Their fame is perhaps more enviable than any ; for the good they confer upon their race is more obvious , more universally felt , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be ranked with these . Though a distinguished patriot and statesman , hailed as the father of his country , and a martyr to liberty , he did not advance the age in which he lived . He could not even save the state from ruin . He made no brilliant discoveries ; he did not much improve that philosophy which he loved so dearly ; and yet we have no hesitation in ranking him among the greatest men . There are men whose very existence is a blessing to their race ; whose acted history is a good , not less positive , substantial , and important , than the discovery of a continent or a science , secured to every nation and every age , the heritage of mankind for life and for eternity ; who have been the // manifestation of the grandeur of unobscured nature ; who have literally lived to the glory of God , by showing in themselves the perfection of his highest work ; the pioneers in the intellectual and moral advance of the human race ; they who have explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the extreme verge of mortal power , and have set up their monumental pillars and trophies on the outermost limit of human virtue and reason . There are men who seem peculiarly created in the image of the Almighty ; whose universal minds , penetrated and filled with the glory of an all-pervading nature , are responsive to every call of its thousand tones , and seem to mirror forth the creation in harmonious and unbroken reflection ; whose comprehensive intellects dwell not in the present alone , hut penetrate alike the past and the future , hind all together in one glorious and perfect whole , and seem to gather into themselves at once the splendor and ma3esty of a universe of time , space , and power . At the head of these , and without a rival , stands Shakspeare ; and in this class we would rank Cicero . The ideal of such a being existed in his mind as the perfect orator , and after this bright image , which no sorrow , nor tumult , nor defeat could obscure , he fashioned his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he aspired , is only saying that he was human ; to rank him in this high order , is the best tribute that we can offer to his fame . What we most admire in Cicero , is the freshness and nobleness of his soul . No system had power to cast its trammels upon his spirit ; no disappointment nor sorrow , no desertion of friends , no triumph of enemies , could check the warm current of his affections . He lived in the midst of a corrupt and degenerate society , hurrying on to slavery and ruin ; yet he was untouched by the vices that surrounded him ; and so clear were his notions of duty , so elevated and glorious his conception of the true and intrinsic right , that it seems almost as if he had beheld the fair form of virtue itself in unobscured glory , and had become enamoured of her for ever . His whole life was influenced and directed by a strong sense of duty ; and his treatise " Dc Officiis , " the finest moral essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he had bestowed upon this vast subject , and the sublime views with which he looked upon the position that every rational , thinking man occupies . // He was undoubtedly wanting in magnanimity . lie sunk under grief , and indulged in effeminate sorrow at some of the misfortunes which befell him ; and there may be some justice in the charge brou1 , ht against him , of submitting too tamely to a tyrant , and even condescending to flatter him . We do not attempt to deny the truth of these charges ; and still , in admitting it , we only grant that the character of Cicero did not reach perfection . Yet it is worthy of notice , that this very weakness arose from the uncommon sensitiveness and delicacy of his feelings , and the intensity of his affections , which discovered , even in the character of the Dictator , much that commanded admiration and love . And who shall say how much of his wonderful perception and tact , his refined wit , his almost holy musings and aspirations , his benevolence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the provinces , were owing to this same delicacy of character , which made him , at times , play the woman ? It was the great misfortune of his life , that his emotions , his affections , the utter abandonment with which his spirit yielded itself up to its boundless love , overcame the power of his intellectual nature . The love of a wife or a dau*hter was dearer to him , than the possession of a mind which ranged the universe over ; and that spirit , which had power almost to comprehend the Deity , which soared beyond the bounds of time and space , penetrated the mystery of death , and heheld the splendor of immortality , this mighty intellect was bowed down to the earth , and veiled its glories in inconsolable mourning over the loss of one dear object . These were weaknesses which he never conquered . Yet they are but trifling blemishes , compared with his virtues and his greatness ; mere spots on that intellectual sun , which shone with benignant lustre over the whole race . They render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they perhaps diminish at the same time the interest and sympathy we feel in his sufferings . But these were more than atoned for by the heroism and glory of his latest acts . During the last year of his life , he seems in truth to have borne the whole weight of the republic on his shoulders . At the news that Antony had left the capital , to place himself at the head of his legions in the north of Italy , Cicero repairs to Rome , and immediately assumes that // commanding position , to which his experience and his high character entitle him . He strengthens the wavering and spiritless senate , boldly opposes and triumphs over the partisans of Antony , and compels the senate to declare him a public enemy , by the thunders of his philippics . Lie directs the movements of the consuls ; confirms the weak faith of the provincial commanders , or , at least for a time , prevents their siding with the enemy ; provides for all emergencies meets every want ; and exercises over the Roman empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power more brilliant than that of Ca*sar , in the plenitude of his dominion . The consuls are slain in the midst of success , and the armies of Rome are left under the command of the ambitious and unprincipled Octavius . Lepidus declares against the state , and joins his forces to the shattered troops of Antony . Still , Cicero does not despair . He keeps his post at Rome ; calls upon Brutus and Cassius in the most urgent manner to return from the provinces with their troops , to Italy ; and still believes that his country may be saved . But all to no purpose ; the die was cast ; the decree had gone forth ; and Rome was to sink in slavery . The fatal coalition of Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus soon took place , and the state was left to their mercy . Cicero now felt that his end was drawing near . His name had been placed on the proscription list , by his implacable foe , and he knew that he was doomed to die . He scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to seek safety in flight , declaring frequently that he wished to die in his country . After a short voyage along the coast , he landed at his Formian villa , and lying down9 slept profoundly , for some hours , notwithstanding the noise of numerous ravens , who flapped their wings against his windows , and seemed to warn him of approaching danger . His slaves were so much impressed with the omen , that they awoke him , and carried him in a litter toward the sea-shore . But the bloodhounds of Antony were in pursuit , and not far from him . When they appeared in sight , Cicero commanded his slaves to set down the litter , and make no resistance , and thus calmly yielded to his fate . We must conclude ; for we fear we have already been held too long by the magic spell of antiquity . The love of the past is l ) e1*haps a weakness ; yet we can scarcely feel ashamed of sharing in what is common , by nature , to our whole // race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a pleasure in the mystery of by-gone times . There is a majesty in the very stones and walls , that hear on their weatherworn surface the record of ages . A halo of glory gathers round them , and invests them with a wondrous beauty ; and we love to linger among them , recalling their ancient splendors and conjuring up in imagination the days of their youth , their strength , their towering glory ; the forms that crowded them , and the scenes they witnessed . But the past offers us richer treasures than these , in the gorgeous monuments of intellect which it contains ; the noble ideas , the exquisite imagery , the strength and intensity of passion , the whole mighty array of mind . And these , too , may be useless and obsolete , like the castles and towers that were piled for other ages and different states of society . The mind has reared its Pagan temples , of faultless proportion , and enshrined within them its inspired statues ; and these have crumbled away , and lie neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet we love to wander amidst these majestic ruins of thought , sure of finding here and there , amidst the fallen shafts and walls , some exquisite capital , or some statue whose beauty will live for ever . There is , we fear , too great a disposition in the present age , to cut ourselves off from the past . The tranquillity and majestic repose of antiquity have not sufficient interest for the busy , excited , and tumultuous spirits of the day , and contrast too strongly with the absorbing questions which crowd upon us from every side . And yet we can not neglect the past , without abandoning our richest heritage . All that we possess , or know of it , all that for us is tangible and real in it , is connected inseparably with human nature . The past , as we know it , is made by man ; and if we would understand our own nature , we must read it in the teachings of by-gone times , not less than in the forms which the present offers . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden , everlasting chain , " which binds the ages together . It pervades all time ; links the past and future together ; and extends into eternity . And they who neglect the past would sever this immortal bond , which the hand of God has framed . We have felt this in musing on the history of Cicero ; and we have labored to set forth his character as a peculiar manifestation of the capacities and tendencies of a pure , unaided // nature . We mourn over his sorrows ; we feel the bitterness of his fate ; we are ready to weep with him over the loss of his dearest friends , and the blight of his fondest hopes ; and we deeply lament that the consolations of Christianity could not he offered to his noble spirit . But we still thank God for this bright example of the dignity , power , and glory of our nature ; for the virtues which sprang from no teaching ; for the far-reaching views , and the sublime aspirations , for the brightness which one noble mind , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night of paganism.
