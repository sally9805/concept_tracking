txt The people of the United State*are at last favored with the result of the labors of the far-famed Committee of Investigation . After two months consumed in spreading a partizan version through the land , we are l ) ermitted to behold the proofs on which they depend to establish the bold charges so widely , and , we may say , so recklessly , ( lisseminatetl . Their bulky document is at length forthcoming . " Verbosa et grandis ellistola venit , E Capreis .

We do not characterize it unjustly . No man , devoid of the heated feelings of a partizan , can look on the proceedings or productions of this Committee without mingle ( l feelings of contempt and pity . We speak thus of this document , after a perusal as careful as its tedious pages would permit . We were anxious to arrive at the truth-. to know whether , in spite of the unfair conduct of this Committee , its disclosures might not bring proofs of miscondtsct. against public functionaries . We were prepated to pass the severest judgment against any officer of the people who might be found censurable or corrupt , notwithstanding the partiality of the inquest by which the charges were preferred . There are few who shall commence a similar perusal , that will be found willing to persevere through the same unprofitable task .

The proceeding , from the be4inning to the end , has been marked by a spirit of partizanship-not by a love of truth . The object of the investigation has been to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking the Administration-not to inquire really and honestly into the adequacy of the existing laws that regulate the Treasury ; into the mode by which frauds upon it have been successfully perpetrated ; into the delinquencies of those who are really guilty : but to gather evidence in secret ; to concoct partial statements ; to draw unjust but plausible inferences , by which they may heap censure and odium on the Treasury Department . The object has been evidently , from first to last , to criminate public officers for political purposes-not to guard or protect the Treasury . What citizen rises from the perusal of this big book with additional knowledge as to the extent of defalcations , or the means of preventing them ? What lights have been thrown upon the subject to guide the future legislation ef Congress ? The citizen or the legislator finds nothing of this ; he has , instead , a train of voluminous sophistry , the sole object of which is to abuse the individual officers of the Treasury Department , and to manufacture materials to be used in electioneering for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident object , the undisguised object of this proceeding from first to last-has been political crimination , not the search for truth . Let us look back on the commencement of these proceedings . rVolvards the close of the second session of the late Congress , certain correspondence was called for in regard to the receivers of public moneys ; but how was it called for ? Why , one-half the correspondence was demanded , while the rest was carefully excluded . The letters written by the Secretary of the Treasury are required ; but no call is made for the answers he received . Every instance in which he finds occasion to complain of these officers as wanting in punctuality or correctness is thus brought before Congress ; but the reply that might give an explanation or defence is excluded by the terms of the resolution . The document thus garbled , thus partial , presenting but one side , and that , the side most injurious to the officer , is circulated through the country under the supposed sanction of its being a public record , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to misunderstand the object of a proceeding like this ? Is it possible to doubt the manner in which a scheme thus commenced would // be carried through ? " Ex pede Herculem "  --  the contemplated scheme of monstrous injustice is thus disclosed , in the unfairness by which its incipient movements are distinguished . The succeeding session of Congress was scarcely commenced , when the next steps were taken in the same partial , unjust , and factious spirit . No preliminary inquiry was made into the truth of facts-no defence , if needed , is allowed-no explanation was asked for ; but days and days were consumed in long speeches , filled with the most abusive language against public officers , and especially the Secretary of the Treasury . He was charged in advance with offences for which , if they were true , it was the duty of , those who charged him to present articles of impeachment . He demanded that proceeding through his friends , but it was uniformly refused . Not merely was such a trial refused , but the very demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To have specified official delinquency , and to venture to sustain it before the American people , and in the face of day , by unperverted evidence and fi*cts , was a task the accusers were not hardy enough to assume . To have substituted an open and honest development of truth , for vagueness of factious declamation and appeals to the passions and interest of party , would have checked the progress of the contemplated scheme . No one can read the speeches that were made on this subject , during the first month of the late session of Congress , without pronouncing them to be unparalleled in the history of American legislation . In language they are coarse , in spirit they are uncandid and unfair , to a degree of which no previous example can be adduced . What could be the object of this ? What sufficient motive for it is to be found ? None can be assigned except that of prejudging the accused , of perverting the truth , of assuming in advance what was deemed expedient and useful for the purposes of party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impartial and legitimate examination . We challenge the pro .. duction of a parallel case , in the most heated days of political rivalry and excitement , of an instance where a high constitutional officer has been declared guilty in advance of impeachable acts , in speeches on the floor of Congress , without notice or an opportunity of defence , without a previous offer of inquiry , and in language so personal , and offensive . The conduct of the Senate towards President Jackson in 1834 , odious and revolting as it was , did not venture to assume or pervert the facts on which it relied-these at least were stated , notwithstanding the rank injustice of the judgment pretended to be deduced from them . What then , we repeat , was the object of the course pursued last winter , with a spirit , and in a manner so vindictive and unjust ? Was it not crimination for party purposes , instead of development of truth for the benefit of the country ? // 471 If any doubt of ' this remained , the subsequent proceedings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expressly recommended it in his message the friends of the Secretary of the Treasury had avowed his readiness to meet an impeachment if his accusers would present it ; the Chairman of the Coinmittee of Ways and Means , a leading member of the administration party in the House , had moved for a select committee to investigate these defalcations ; an examination could have been promptly made , which would have developed before Congress and the nation the causes of the defalcations , not only of Swartwout , but of the various officers having charge of the public revenue-which would have shown equally the delinquencies of the officers , and the defects of the laws , and brought the whole subject before the legislature of the Union , in a manner to produce just censure and punishment of the real offender , and judicious amendments of existing statutes . Why was not this permitted to be done ? Simply because no such object was sought to be attained . How would this have furthered the schemes of those who had been deluging the country with onesided documents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had they to do with the exposition of truth , or the suggestion of amendments in the laws ? " Quid inihi cum caballo , " as Master Erasmus Holliday says . What was an investigation to them , if it was not made the means of casting odium on political foes , or screening the delinquencies of political friends ? From the proposal made by Mr. Cambreleng of a Committee of Investigation , it a*as too late to shrink after what had been said . All that remained was so to frame it as to promote the scheme that had been thus far most recklessly , if not successfully , persisted in . The rules of the House , sanctioned by the usage of nearly fifty years , directed that such a committee should be appointed by the Speaker . That officer had himself not only been chosen by a majority of the House , but he had already presided over it during three previous sessions . In addition to this , he had received its thanks , by a deliberate vote , for the faithful discharge of the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper selection of committees was far from the least in importance or responsibility . He had evinced in this delicate trust a marked attention to the claims of the minority-of the party to which he was politically opposed . He had given them , on many of the standing committees , a decided majority . In those where established usage , and the necessity of confidential intercourse with the Executive Department , made it matter of evident convenience and propriety , as well as of just deference towards the opinions of a majority of the House , that a majority of the committee should be of the same general political sentiments , he had yet carefully placed on such committees leading members of the opposition , and individuals whom they would // in all probability have themselves selected for such a position . The previous course , therefore , not less than his ow-n pritle of consistency , his sense of duty and honor , and the high anti conspicuous nature of the trust , gave evidence that from the hands of the Speaker a just , impartial , and competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so selected as to embrace the talents of the House best *itetl to such an inquiry , and one on which the most able anti honorable members of the opposition would have been united with those of the Democratic party . But this would not have answered the political ends it was desirable to attain . A wanton attack was made on the character and conduct of the Speaker-as if it would have been practicable for him , had he desired it , in direct contradiction of all his previous course , so to constitute a committee as to thwart that investigation for which every member expressed an anxious desire . He was charged with gross impartiality and injustice , in deliance at once of the most conclusive evidence , and the recorded testimony of the House itself . To remove every pretext of further debate anti delay , the Democratic members yielded to the demand , that the committee should be chosen by the House . his was still insufficient . As if everything was to be opposed that precluded the hidden arrangements of faction , or gave to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwished-for truth , the stand was deliberately taken , that the Committee should be selected by secret ballot . The responsible choice of the Speaker , and the open vote of the members , exposed to the scrutiny and judgment of their constituents , were equally dreaded . By the secret ballot , the power was attained , not merely of selecting from their own ranks the individuals best suited to their purposes-not merely of putting into the Committee such a majority of their own partizans as they chosebut also of excluding , from the small number they left of those friendly to the administration , all but such as were previously fixed by concert among themselves . Three members only , out of the nine , were chosen from those who were of the same political sentiments with the officers of the Government , whom it was intended to attack . In vain was it demanded , equally as a matter of justice as of right , that the *vishcs of their political friends might be consulted in the selection of these three . The claim , so unquestionably fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution of the Committee , the partizan object of the whole proceeding-the total disregard of any desire to attain , an ( l to exhibit to the public , , the truth without perversion or disguise-was developed as unequivocally as in every previous step of this unprecedented transaction . The conduct of the Committee , from the commencement to the close , was in accordanec with the manner and motives of its crea // tion . It was soon made evident that the object of its investigation was not an inquiry about defaulters ; but an extended range of inquisitorial research , secretly conducted , and implicating both officers of the Government and private citizens . The Democratic members in vain raised their voice at the outset against such a course of proceeding . In vain did they represent that the Committee , though a select , was not a secret one ; tha , t the House , when it constituted it , never intended its proceedings 4to be kept secret ; that justice required prompt and early notice to be given to all persons accused ; that the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused being confronted with the accuser ; and that secret inquiries were unknown to the Constitution , and alien to the practice and feelings of the American people . Their resolutions expressing these sentiments , and asserting that all persons , whether officers of the Government or private citizens , who in the course of the investigation might be implicated or charged with official misconduct , should have immediate and prompt notice of the charge , so that , if innocent , they might repel it ; and that , whatever might be its nature , it was reasonable and just that the same should be publicly brought forward and publicly answered ; were promptly laid upon the table , and witnesses or persons were permitted to be present or excluded , according to the objects , views , or caprice of the ruling majority . Perceiving from this that an investigation into the designated defalcati*ns was not in reality the object , but that a field of discovery was to be opened and entered upon , a last attempt was made to recal the majority to the object of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought for fairness and justice in the proceedings . A resolution that " the Committee would proceed with all possible despatch to investigate the case of Swartwout , and , when that was complete and ended , take up the case of Price , and give that a thorough investigation , " was laid upon the table ; the misconduct of these principal defaulters , and the extent and manner of their depredations , were left without the least light being thrown upon them , in addition to that already obtained by the officers of the Government ; and a roviug inquiry for political purposes was instituted and persisted in for several weeks , varying in its extensive range from the leading Federal and Conservative politicians of New York to the committees of Tammany Hall , and mainly intended to drag into the net whatever could be so perverted as to criminate the present collector of New York , the Secretary and subordinate officers of the Treasury Department* or any other person who.se political sentiments happened to differ from those of the majority of the Committee . As if impatient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , and while the investigation relative to Swartwout was still unclosed , Mr. Hoyt , the present collector , // was peremptorily called on for numerous papers and documents in relation to his own official conduct , the correctness of which was totaliy unim peached . In his reply , lie ventured to ask the Committee whether he was himself regarded as a defaulter , and embraced in the resolution that prescribed their duties ? This simple inquiry , this plain right of every citizen , was treated as an evasion by the majority of the Committee-as a*esire to withhold the evidences of his official conduct . To ask such a question was characterized as a sensitiveness incompatible with conscious integrity ; and a response to it was promptly and peremptorily refused . Mr. Hoyt complied with the resolution and furnished the papers ; but he demanded ol the Committee , as a matter of right , that , having gone thus far , they *vou1d at least do him the justice of entering into a thorough investigation of his official conduct before they left New York . This reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his desire to vindicate himself was spurned as an indignity towards his self-constituted judges , their wish to arraign him was proportionably augmented-they listened with complacency to the assertions secretly made against him by an officer of the customs , whom he had himself found it necessary to dismiss . The Democratic members of the Committee , considering the plainest principles of justice violated by allo ' *ving the character and reputation of an important officer of the Government to be attacked , as it were , in the dark , without his knowledge , or having the means to know the charges made against him , moved a resolution that he should be furnished , by the clerk , with copies of all the interrogatories and ans*vers of David S. Lyon , the witness referred to , as far as he had made answers to them , relating to the conduct of Mr. Hoyt . This , however , seeming to be too great ait indulgence towards one who had ventured to ask of the nature of the charges against him , was speedily amended , by the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned as a witness , and that before he was examined , the interrogatories submitted to Lyon , and his answers thereto , might be read to him , if desired , or he be allowed to read them himself ; and that he might have liberty to attend the Committee during the examination of any witness called upon to testify concerning his official conduct . " Well do the Democratic members characterize this proceeding in their report ! Justly do they " call the attention of the House and the country to this amendment  --  to this boon given to Mr. Hoyt , in his position of collector , surrounded as he was by open and secret enemies , in the shape of officers discharged by him , under an imperious sense of ( luty to the public and himself , from their places in the custom-house ; and of foreign importing merchants , who fancied they had been injured by him in the discharge of his duty as collector . " Most properly do they " beg the House and the country to look // at it in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to an American citizen , who had his reputation , dearer to an honorable man than life itself , at stake ; and to say , if these things can pass us like summer clouds , and not attract our special wonder . ' " " Mr. hoyt , " they observe , " was summoned to appear forthw ith , not as an ordinary witness , but in the double character of a witness and party accused . For rapid4 of movement and quickness of execution , it was more like a warrant than a subp*na . It was no sooner served than Mr. Hoyt was in the Committee room . Lyon 's testimony , as far as it had gone , was read to him , and he was instantly placed in the crucible of one of the members of the Committee , who examined him for many consecutive hours . We know not how others felt at the scene passing aroun ( l them ; but for ourselves , it was a subject of deep humiliation , and has left an impression on the memory not easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to Mr. Hoyt , were worthy of those that preceded them . Frequent intimations had been thrown out that the time had nearly arrived for the return of the Cornmittee to Washington . These intimations were , as the Democratic members of the Committee well knew , warnings not to be neglected . The evidence against Mr. Hoyt was in manuscript , though not printed ; it would , as a matter of course , appear on the journal . All that he had to oppose to it was his own testimony , and that of o*re or two other witnesses . Justice demanded that he shouhl have a full and fair opportunity to introduce rebutting evidence . Propriety ani the peculiarity of his position requred that this opportunity rhoull be afforded him in the city of *ew York . An attempt was , therefore , made to obtain the passage of a resolution that the Committee would not adjourn their sittings from New York , at least , until Mr. hoyt had time to prepare his defence . He sent , himself , a written communication m*Lking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the communication of the accused collector was neither read nor received . On the same day a peremptory order of adjournment was passed , and the determination was carried into effect while one of the Democratic members of the Committee was in the act of cross-examining Lyon , the discharged deputy , who had been attacking the collector ; and while another of the same members was in the act of submitting a proposition for summoning the witnesses whose examination Mr. Hoyt requested , in order to rebut the insinuations made upon him by that individual . In vain did these members protest that the examination of the matter specially confided to them  --  the defalcations of S*vartwout and Price-remained incomplete , and that few facts of any importance on those subjects had been elicited which were not previously known . In vain did they urge that it was due to the fair administration of justice to allow Mr. Hoyt a full opportunity to rebut the charges made against // him ; that several witnesses were under examination , the testimony of whom was not yet closed ; that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , whose testimony was not before the Committee , either in manuscript or in print , ( a portion of the manuscript being in the hands of the printer , ) they had not the means of ascertaining its effect or nature , and were unable to determine how mucI*further the examination ought to proceed , or what other witnesses ought to be examined . In vain did they insist that fixing the time for adjourning to Washington , before the testimony was ended , was calculated to deprive the accused of the right ( which every man has when charged ) of showing that those charges were unfounded , and of protecting his character from aspersion ; that it would prevent the individuals of the Committee from examining and cross-examining such witnesses as they believed ought to be examined ; would set a precedent entirely new and arbitrary in the administration of justice , dangerous to the rights and privileges of persons who might be charged with misconduct ; would be deciding a question , the propriety of which the Committee could not possibly know ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public mind , all confidence in the results at which the Committee might arrive . In vain did they present these declarations in the shape of resolutions . They were summarily voted down . The objects desired to be attained at New York were complete . The materials to be worked up into partizan crimination were deemed sufficient . The rest was to them but " lcather and prunella . " The scene was to be shifted to Washington , in order that other persons than Mr. Hoyt might be introduced , in a similar manner , and for similar ends . What course should now have been pursued , if the examinations so far had furnished the Committee , in their opinion , with evidence on which to charge , with official delinquency , the Secretary and other officers of the Treasury Department into whose acts they were about to scrutinize ? What would have been the conduct of persons really desirous to investigate , not to criminate ? It would have been to point out to these public officers the supposed errors or the alleged crimes ; to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was such a course pursued ? Not so ; but the exact reverse . The whole progress of examination at Washington will be found , when the journal and interrogatories are examined , to be a counterpart to that practised at New York . The points of censure and charge were carefully suppressed from the witness . He was kept in ignorance of what had been said by other officers of the Department . Questions were framed to draw particular answers which might meet particular ends . The examination was carried just so far as to elicit the facts that it was intended to use for future and sinister purposes , but no farther ; and // when , at last , the evidence is spread before the public , it is made apparent that there is not a single officer thus censured , who could not have refuted or explained the charges that are made up , by this unjust and partial mode , had those charges been fairly made known to him , and the opportunity allowed him for defence . It seems , however , to be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced seeks to ascert'ftin and to protect himself against these censures . What is the very first question propounded to the Secretary , when he is summoned before this new inquisition ! " Have you seen , read , or heard read or described , or been informed of , any portion of the evidence taken before this Committee ? " Why was not the Secretary of the Treasury to see , to read , to hear , or to be informed of evidence that might tend to inculpate himself ; was an attempt making to injure that officer upon testimony kept wholly from his knowledge ? Evidence was collected for the purpose of charging the late First Comptroller of the Treasury with highly culpable official neglect ; not one word of this appears to have been made known to the person accused ; no explanation whatever is sought from him ; he is not even allowed the privilege accorded to Mr. Hoyt , of being " summoned as a witness . " The present First Comptroller of the Treasury was subjected to a long examination , yet not a particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , previously obtained and then actually in print , appears throughout the whole course of his examination to have been submitted to him . Fragrnents of statements collected at New York , and referring to the official conduct of the late Solicitor of the Treasury , several years ago , were to be used in order to chargc upon the neglect of that officer , now absent in a foreign country , the frauds of Price ; yet , although clerks then in his office , acquainted with the transactions thus intended to be used , and capable of exhibiting them in their true aspect , were within the immediate call of the Committee , not one of them was summoned before it , not one word of defence was allowed on behalf of the absent . The present Solicitor of the Treasury , who is made to participate in the negligence of his predecessor , though summoned before the Committee , is asked no single question that can lead him to suspect the charges that are to be presented against him ; is not permitted to see , nor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which partial selections are to be culled , to his detriment ; and is left to discover , for the first time , that he is accused of official neglect , when the charge is scattered from one end of the country to the other . Are these proceedings an " investigation ? " Did Congress mean that the plenary powers they conferred on this Committee were to be wielded with an unfairness that has no parallel in aur political history ? If they had even designed that , instead of examining into the defalca // tions of public officers , they should pursue a system of partizan crimination , could they have believed that the pursuit would have been conducted with such injustice to the individuals accused , and that a deliberate endeavour would be made to assail the character and conduct of functionaries , whose honor , integrity , and fidelity were unimpeached , by obtaining evidence behind their backs and without their knowle*e ? Although the business of the Committee appears , by their journal , to have been substantially finished by the 19th of February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to the houseand not until the 27th that it was actually made . The closing days of the session , when the pressure of necessary business absolutely excluded an examination ; when the quantity of documents to be printe ( 1 rendered it impossible that the charges could be known or answered on the floor of Congrcss ; were selected as affording additional means of diffusing the attacks with which it was replete , and protecting them at the same time from exposure or reply . As if , however , nothing should be wanting to complete the unfair character of these proceedings , from first to last , the evidence , obtained as it was  --  the report made up as it was-even these were not permit . ted to speak for themselves . In anticipation of their appearance , an abstract of the " conclusions ' * of the Conimittee was prepared and scattered in newspapers , over the country . Suppressing or withholding the testimony , which it was pretended would sustain these conclusions , they were put forth by themselves to circulate through the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , when seen , could hot fail to prove an antidote ( much as the reverse had been designed ) to the subtle assertions that were promulgated as its true result . A month after the abstract for the newspapers came the report itself , containing the culled portions of the evidence , with the version appended to them ; and not until time is given to spread twenty thousand copies of this through the land , are we at last favored with the testimony itself , or allowed the means of examining into the truth of charges that have been thus boldly made and universally dissemnated . The report , in its whole construction , character , and drift , is a fit sequel to this extraordinary series of proceedings . In vain do we seek to gather from it a connected view of the defalcations-a clear statement of their amount-an exposition of the manner in which they were perpetrated  --  a suggestion of the modes by which similar frauds are to be prevented . It is wretched in style , though evidently aiming at rhetorical display . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided and subdivided as if it was the perfection of logical precision . Yet , with all this , the evident object is constantly persisted in . A vague impression is // imparted to the reader that the causes of the frauds upon the public revenue have been the improper conduct of the Secretary and subordinate officers of the Treasury ; isolated passages are culled from the testimony , or voluminous masses of official correspondence ; and " conclusions " are hoidly deduced from these which are at variance with the result that a full and candid exposition would have led to . Coupled w*h this system of crimination is the effort made , through successive pages and attempted to be drawn by skilfully prepared interrogatories from witness after witness , to invalidate the investigations and to deny the truth of the statements made by the Treasury Department and submitted to Congress . These reports , they say , are not to be relied on as auxiliaries in finding out either the law or the facts ; and they assert them to be especially defective in the view they give of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was important to their object to invalidate , if possible , the prompt and clear exposition of this mighty fraud which had been laid before Congress by the President . Hence this s*veeping declaration ; hence the effort to controvert the statement of the time when the defalcation was commenced , and of the manner of its concealment through successive accounts . The report to Congress had developed a systematic fraud , perpetrated , without intermission , from 1830 . An attempt is now deliberately made , and elaborately argued , to prove that the defalcations of Swartwout did not commence till 1837 . The report stated that this fraud was successfully concealed by the manner in which his accounts were made up . They are now declared to have been so furnishe*1 as to afford no just ground of reproach ; and the statement of the Treasury officers , as to their error and deception , are pronounced to be unfounded and unsustained . These positions are boldly assumed . The defaulter is nearly converted into an innocent man , and one is almost led to expect that the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as the perpetrators of his offences . What can be thought of an official document that ventures to present to the public , for purposes of partizan crimination , assertions so totally at variance with the evidence on which they profess to rely ? The Secretary of the Treasury had said , in his report to Congress , tha , t the " first misuse of the public money by Mr. Swartwout , as collector , appears to have commenced in 1830 . A series of defalcations , in various items of his accounts , seems to have followed and continued through each successive year , increasing constantly in amount , till near the close of his official term . " Of this statement the report says- " the Committee do not concur in this view of the matter , nor do they find the facts to warrant the impress of any such early date upon Mr. Swartwout 's defaications ; " and it concludes by saying that " the defalcation // of Mr. Swartwout , by means of fraud and false returns , commenced in 1837 , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement of Swartwout 's cashier and agent , in these words " As far as my memory serves me , in regard to the difficulties of Mr. Swartwout , I should say that they began not long after his appointment as collector , and that , from that period he has con- ' tinned to draw sums from tim ' * to time ; that my assistant ( Mr. Phillips ) and myself have held frequent conversations with hirrr respecting the sums of money which he had received , and that we often , when he applied to us , urged him to endeavour to obtain money elsewhere , if he possibly could , and not to draw any more from the bank ; that , about four years since , when we again spoke to him on the subject of the amounts we supposed he had received , he requested us to have an interview with him at his house ; that we met him , agreeably to appointment , and that he then assured us , as he had done frequently before , that he did not doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result im such a way as to enable him to pay all up . " Nor was this all ; they had before them a statement of Mr. Phillips , the assistant cashier , in these words : " Mr. Swartwout came into office , as collector of the port of New York , on the 1st of May , 1829 ; and as far as my memory serves , but afew months had elapsed before he commenced drawing money for his private uses , which he continued for a period of nearly nine years , without any great intermission. ** Nor was this all ; they had an actual list of more than forty checks , for sums varying from $1,000 to $12,000 , drawn by Mr. Swartwont , on the public deposit , for his own use , previous to the year 1837 ; and they knew that books containing the evidence of other similar checks had been lost or mislaid . Which , then , is erroneous , the statement of the Secretary of the Treasury , or the " conclu .. sion " of the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a defaulter during seven long years , when he was deliberately drawing out the public money , and appropriating it to his private use ; an attempt is made to prove that his accounts were , during the same period , faithfully rendered to the Treasury . " All moneys , " say the Committee , " received by Mr. Swartwout as collector , prior to 1837 , are regularly accounted for by him , in his quarterly returns to the Treasury Department . " " We do not feel justified , " they add , " in acceding to the correctness of the view presented by the Executive and Treasury officers , that Mr. S*vartwont became a defaulter at any time prior to 1837 , on either of the items of account above enumerated-amounting , in all , to two hundred and twenty-one thousand nine hundred an ( l seven dollars and thirty six cents . On the contrary , he accounted for them properly to the Treasury , but was permi*tcd to retain them until his last // quarter of service ; and then , and not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then did he become a defaulter for them , and not before . There has not been discovered any evidence whatever , that , in regard to this portion of his present indebtedness , Mr. Swartwout 's accounts , either at the custom-house or as returned to the Treasury , bear any impress* of fraud or deception ; for what was omitted to be charged on one 6 ' ! those accounts was fully charged on another of them . " And was not this evidence of fraud or deception-to charge to one account , that which belonged to another ? It is assumed that Mr. Swartwout was no defaulter-that his accounts were not fraudulent or deceptive-because they presented the aggregate sum with which he was chargeable ; and that the Executive and Treasury officers have done him injustice in so representing the accounts , which for seven years he continued to transmit to the Treasury . That is to say , the habit of Mr. Swartwout to represent himself as having large sums of cash on hand , when they had been used by himself , was no fraud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet protested duties when these moneys had been spent for his private purposes was no fraud  --  to keep his account at bank in accordance with his weekly return to the Treasury Department , by including in the former the receipt of two or three days more than in the latter , was no fraud . Yet in regard to those things , the testimony is clear and uncontradicted , and if these be not evidence of fraudulent accounts - aye , of skilful fraud-it is impossible to conceive what evidence could have been required . Such is the whole drift and tenor of this report  --  a crimination of political opponents , not a candid exposition of the truth . Such is the whole course of proceedings adopted by this Committee , from first to last . Trace them from the beginning to the end  --  the partial call for correspondence ; the violent accusations and denunciations in advance ; the formation of their body by secret ballot ; the exclusion even of such a minority as the friends of the accused would have desired ; the secret delation of discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused ; the course of examination so adopted , as to prevent any explanation or refutation of charges intended to be made ; the concealment from public officers of the grounds on which they were to be attacked ; the introduction of the report at a period of the session too late to permit any refutation or reply ; the circulation through the newspapers of a partial abstract of what was asserted to be l ) roved ; the withholding of the evidence until long after the report was spread through the country ; the whole drift and effort of the report itself to diminish the guilt of the defaulter , and to criminate the Executive and Treasury officers-trace all this , we say , and what true light has the country received from this investigation ; what have Congress // gained from the work of agents who have so misused the trust confided to them ; what return have the public received for the large amount of public money squandered on partizan printers and ott the Committee themselves ; what reliance can be placed on their attempted exculpations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale criminations of the officers of the Treasury ; what candid or honorable man woul4*permit himself to believe , on assertions so ma ( le , and evidence s6 brought forward , the reiterated charges of official misconduct , thrown around with an indiscriminating hand upon every public functionary whom it was deemed matter of policy to attack or injure ? Nor is it only for what they have done , and the manner in which they have done it , that the proceedings of this Committee of Investigation should and will receive general and just animadversion . What has been omitted , is not less remarkable than what has been performed . The words of the resolution by which they were constituted , declared it should be " their duty to inquire into all such facts connected with said defalcations as might be deemed material to develop their true character , " and in order that they should discharge that duty , " the said Committee had the power to send for persons and papers " conferred upon them . They were invested with that plenary authority which Congress could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the limitations imposed on the Executive or Treasury officers . They were bound , when they accepted their trust , to omit no investigations which should t develop the true character " of these frauds . The officers of the Treasury Department had pursued their examinations as far as the law authorized them to go ; they had examined the books , vouchers , and accounts of Swartwout and Price ; they had obtained such testimony as they could from individuals connected with the revenue at New York ; they had ascertained the exact amount of public money which each of them had abstracted ; they had discovered the times and manner of its being taken ; they had traced the several funds where the deficits occurred ; the state of the accounts , whether as kept at the Custom-house or examined at the Treasury , had been explicitly and fully presented . Yet with all this , the President , aware of the limited powers of the Treasury Department , in pressing such an investigation , had recommended a further inquiry under the extensive powers of Congress . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury officers had done , still thought that there were other " developments material to the true character of defalcations , " and that these , their Committee , vested with such ample authority , could ) and ought to make . Have they done so ? What single material fact tending to develop the true character of these defalcations is now known to the public , that was not before known ? Is the // amount of the defalcation changed , or its source , or the mode in which it was perpetrated ? In no instance has this been done . What new facts , at all material to develop the character of these defalcations , is brought to light , in this great volume of seven hun . dred and sixty-eight pages ? Perhaps the important evidence derived from the thirty-five questions pronounced to Mr. John Becker , " the collector of funds for T*nmany Hall , " or the vast disclosures of Mr. Are nt S. Depesster and Mr. Abraham B. Vanderpoel , in regard to the expenses incurred at the elections in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character sought by Congress . Such , we venture to say , is the opinion neither of Congress nor of the country . The Committee were bound to have removed the veil of mystery that hangs over the transactions of Swartwout and Price , and which they alone could remove . The Treasury officers had shown that Custom-house bonds to the amount of six hundred and forty-six thousand dollars had been surrendered by Swartwout , and the money not paid into the Treasury ; they had shown that six hundred and eleven thousand dollars of these had been so surrendered in one quarter of the year 1837 ; they had given a list of the persons by whom nearly six hundred thousand dollars of these bonds must have been paid , if paid at all . Beyond this the Treasury officers had no power to go . They had no right or authority to examine these persons , or to make further inquiry in regard to those payments , extraordinary and mysterious as the whole matter was . Such power the Committee of Investigation had . The transaction was one above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defalcation . " Yet was it totally and absolutely disregarded ; and the whole of it , after the Committee had passed fourteen days in New York , where the persons perfectly able to disclose every thing relating to it residedwas left in the same obscurity as on the day when the Committee were appointed . Was it not " material to the development of this defalcation " to ascertain in what manner this amount of more than half a million of dollars , apparently collected in three months , had been disposed of ? Yet none of the persons or papers are sent for that could disclose this . Was it not matcrial-yes , peculiarly and indispensably material  --  to know in what manner the whole of S*vartwout 's appropriations of public money had been applied ; what property he had ; where the Government were to look for indemnity or repayment ? Yet no ray of light is thrown upon this branch of the subject . The necessarily imperfect inquiries of the Solicitor and Comptroller of the Treasury-made without any " power to send for persons or papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information we yet have as to the property of Swartwout , or the chance of recovering any portion of the debt . There // is no possible doubt that Congress meant the Committee to examine into the subject ; such a body could alone do it ; yet has it been totally and absolutely neglected . The officers of the Treasury are left to find out these matters as they may ; and we presume they will hereafter be censured , if they fail to discover or pursue all the various investments or speculations that Swartwout may have made . In regard to the defalcation of*riee-still more mysterious in its character  --  a degree of negligence equally extraordinary is exhibited . Although it is stated in the report of the minority of the Committee , that they were " under the conviction , from the general complexion of the testimony during the whole of the investigation , that Price acted a very important part in these frauds and peculations , " yet was any examination into the nature , extent , or character of this connection totally neglected  --  and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Committee . Even the clerks in Mr. Price 's office do not appear to have been called before them ; the sums of money he has been charged with having collected are not verified by the testimony of the persons stated to have paid them ; what property he possessed that may be made available they never sought to know ; and the whole light they throw on the defalcations of Price , is that derived from the examinations and report made by the present District Attorney and Collector , to the Solicitor of the Treasury , and under his instructions . Do we err , then , in saying that what this Committee have omitted , displays even a greater neglect of the trust they assumed and the duty imposed on them , than that which they actually did ? While engaged in scrambling after evidence to criminate the officers of the Treasury , and in so interpreting and mystifying matters previously known as to make them subserve a political end , they have disregarded the will and intention of Congress , and they have left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . In assigning the causes of the defalcations oC Swartwout and Price , it could not be expected-after the course the Committee had pursued , and the evidence which they had either taken or omitted to take-that any others would be found than such as might tend to criminate the officers of the Government or their own political opponents . The defects of existing laws ; the skilful means adopted to evade detection ; the falsification of accounts ; the want of checks and securities recommended to Congress for adoption , over and over again-all these , and every similar cause , are of course discarded by the Committee , and those only are admitted or recognized by them which are supposed to justify the censures they were predetermined to make . " Culpable negligence** is charged upon the present First Auditor of the Treasury , because the register of bonds in his office had been permitted to fall in arrear , though the testimony // before the Committee clearly shows that whatever negligence there was , occurred years before he came into office , and that the time necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible , even if a clerk had occupied his whole time upon that subject , to have discovered by those means , at an earlier period than was done , the defalcation in the bond account of 1837 . " Culpable negligence " is also chaiged on the First Comptroller of the Treasury , an officer who had been but a few months appointed , because , in revising the accounts of the Auditor , he did not adopt a system which was not either required by the plain construction of the law designating his duties , or ever adopted , so far as appears , from the commencement of the Government ; but which the Committee assume to be sufficient for detecting the fraudulent accounts of Swartwout . Page after page is devoted to an elaborate argument to prove that the weekly returns , made to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of ascertaining the situation of the revenue for financial purposes , should have been used for the detection of defaulters ; and the " conclusion " drawn is , that the negligence of the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so long undiscovered . So in regard to the defalcations of Price . Although it is well known that the laws regulating District Attorneys are so loose as to make every check upon them next to impossible ; although the testimony before the Committee expressly stated that the principal means by which Price proceeded in his frauds , was receiving money in a manner contrary to the directions of the Solicitor of the Treasury ; and although the evidence showed that he had made rapid collections from suits which the law placed under his control , and then suddenly fled from the United States ; yet the causes of his defalcation are pronounced to be " continued neglect at the office of the Solicitor of the Treasury . " Nay , more , it must have been known to the Committee , that the District Attorney was among those officers , receiving large amounts of public money , from whom no bonds were required , and no examination of whose accounts was legally provided for ; that this was a defect in the law , expressly pointed out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President , in his very first annual message , with a view to legislative amendment ; and that , had this been accorded , the delinquency of Price would not have occurred-or , if occurring , would have been attended with no loss . Such is the extreme injustice , the partizan character by which this report is distinguished from first to last . Instead of a document resulting from the investigations of this Committee , in which are disclosed the defects of existing laws , the manner in which the public treasure has been abstracted , and the changes suggested by experience to counteract the ingenuity of fraud , we have a volumi // nous electioneering pamphlet . The defects in our financial system , which the testimony establishes in instance after instance , are suppressed or explained away , because , if admitted , they might sustain the propriety of charges that have been suggested by those in Congress to whose political sentiments the Committee were opposed ; or because they might relieve the Executive and pul ) lic officers from the abuse that has been heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborately specified . That there are many people in the United States who xviii wade through this enormous and ill-digested mass , we do not believe ; but if there were , we would willingly submit to them , after such examination when candidly made , the whole issue be*. tween the Democratic and Wliig parties in regard to the safe-keeping of the public money . Every page of this document goes to show that the defalcations of S*vartwout and Price could not have been perpetrated ; or if perpetrated , could not have been concealed-had that separation in the collection and keeping of the revenue ; that absolute limitation of disbursements to such as are warranted by previous appropriation ; that periodical scrutiny into the accounts of all revenue officers ; and that subjection of defaulters to the punishment of felons-all of which have been so repeatedly urged by the Democratic members , and so uniformly thwarted by the Whigs-been permitted to pass into the laws , and form a portion of the existing regulations of the public Treasury.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
