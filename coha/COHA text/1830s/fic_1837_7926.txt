Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : COMMUNION WITH NATURE . from Communion with nature ( 1837 )  --  ' All seasons shall be sweet to thee  --  Whether the summer clothe the genial earth With greenness , or the red-breast sit and sing Betwixt the tufts of snow , on the bare branch Of mossy apple-tree . ' Coleridge . Farewell sweet , bowery summer  --  fare thee well  --  Fast fades thy lingering smile on hill and dell , Thy latest flowers are trembling in the blast , And all the glories of thy reign o'ercast . Sweet sang the wild-bird on the waving bough , Where cold November winds are wailing now . The chirp of insects on the sunny lea , And the wild murmur of the wandering bee , Are silent all  --  closed is their vesper lay , Borne by the breeze of Autumn far away . No more o'er bourne and brake I wander far , Till warned of evening by her ' folding star . ' No more I linger by the fountain 's play While the long hours glide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream Where arching boughs shut out the sultry beam , Making at noontide hours a dewy gloom O'er the moist marge where weeds and wild flowers bloom ; Nor when the level sunbeams pour a flood Of arrowy radiance through the twilight wood , Mark , through the parted boughs , their quivering play , Flecking the forest gloom with golden ray . No longer doth the wild Clematis wear A zone of stars amid her floating hair , Footnote : 1Kb But decked in mournful plumes her tresses fall Rude and neglected o'er the ruined wall . Yet still the withered heath I love to rove , The bare , brown meadow and the leafless grove  --  Still love to climb the mountain 's rocky side Where nodding asters wave in purple pride  --  Or on the grey cliff lie , while far below The rushing waters sweep in endless flow , While through tall pines the loud winds pour a dirge Hoarse as the roar of Ocean 's stormy surge . Still through dim tangled paths I love to stray Where sere and rustling leaves obstruct the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That strangely blooms when all is dark and drear , The wild witch-hazel , fraught with mystic power To ban or bless as sorcery rules the hour . Oft mid the dewy damps of twilight grave , I pause where Dian woos the sleeping wave , Deep in the fountain 's heart serene and cold Glassing her glorious image  --  as of old  --  When first she shone upon Endymion 's rest And his dark dreams with heavenly beauty blest . Aye , for the heart that seeks its joys aright , Each page of nature proffers new delight . To such most welcome e'en thy stern career ' O Winter , ruler of the inverted year . ' When through thy long dark nights , cold sleet and rain Patter and plash against the frosty pane , Warm curtained from the storm I love to lie , Wakeful and listening to the lullaby Of fitful winds , that as they rise and fall , Send hollow murmurs through the echoing hall . Oft by the blazing hearth at eventide I love to mark the changing shadows glide In flickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey dew my senses thrall . Then , while in dreamy consciousness I lie , ' Twixt sleep and waking , fairy fantasie Culls from the golden past a treasured store , And weaves a dream so sweet , hope could not ask for more . In the cold splendour of a frosty night , When blazing stars burn with intenser light Through the blue vault of heaven  --  when cold and clear The air through which yon tall cliffs rise severe  --  When sleeps the shrouded earth in solemn trance Beneath the wan moon 's melancholy glance , I love to mark earth 's sister planets rise And in pale beauty tread the midnight skies ; While like lone pilgrims constant as the night They fill their dark urns from the fount of light  --  I love the Borealis flames that fly Fitful and wild athwart the northern sky  --  The storied constellations  --  like a page Fraught with the wonders of a former age , Where monsters grim , gorgons and hydras rise , ' And Gods and heroes blaze along the skies . ' Thus nature 's music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever mystic power , Still to preserve the unperverted heart , ' Awake to love and beauty , ' and impart Treasures of thought and feeling pure and deep , Which aid the doubting soul its heavenward course to keep !
