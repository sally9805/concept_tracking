txt These volumes have lain on our table a long time . While we have been occupied in plodding through a mass of what is technically called light reading , some of which is heavy enough , this book has wound its way into a pretty wide-extended popularity , and has even been brought in a dramatic form , as we have been told , upon the New-York boards . After this sort of immortality has been conferred upon it by the gentlemen of taste who guide the literary opinions of the metropolis of the " Empire State , " any addition that we can make will be but little worth . But we proceed to the discharge of oir duty , believing in the truth of the old adage , " better late than never . " The scene is laid , partly in South-Carolina , and partly in Georgia . The origin of the tale lies in the history of two brothers , Carolina gentlemen , who bear the name of Colleton . Their characters and fortunes are widely different . One of them lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obliged to leave his native state to try his fortunes in the West . The other is a closehanded gentleman , who goes on thriving in worldly goods , and gradually enlarging his influence over the county where lie resides . The former dies poor , // and leaves an only son , who is received and educated by the latter . Now it so happens that the surviving brother hath a daughter , comely to look upon , and of nearly the age of the orphan boy . In the multiplicity of his occupations , it never occurs to the political old gentleman , that the tender passion may play t2he dickens with the young things under his special care . Ralph Colleton ( for that is our hero 's name ) grows up to manhood , and Edith to womanhood . When the young gentleman 's education is completed , he returns to his uncle 's mansion , and finds , in the society of his amiable cousin , every thing he can desire . They are satisfied with each other , and feel the want of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , they fall desperately deep into the conditions which is proper for heroes and heroines . How could it be otherwise ? He was a high-spirited Southron , chivalrous , talented , handsome , and enthusiastic ; and she-bless us - she was-she was  --  but the subject is too affecting . They talk , walk , read , and gaze on beautiful nature together . Things would have gone on , nobody can tell how long , in this dreamy state , had not master Ralph chanced upon a romantic tale , which struck the right key , and showed him all at once what tune his heart was beating to . As soon as he had found out this , he rushed into the parlor , and a scene was gotten up which we should hardly dare describe ; suffice it to say , that just at the moment when the enraptured young gentleman had imprinted a kiss , on the forehead or lips , we forget which , of the no-less enraptured young lady , the old gentleman , who ought to have been in better business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much astonished at the sight . The lovers were , as in duty bound , quite thunderstruck at this unwelcome apparition . The unreasonable old fellow said some pretty crabbed things to young Colleton , to which he replied with sufficient tartness . Young and proud , he could not submit to be the guest of a man who had insulted him . Fortunately , he was the owner of a fine steed , and his pocket was tolerably well filled with the " sinews of war . " Having written a letter , couched in terms of suitable manliness , to the uncle , and a tender adieu to the niece , he mounted his noble charger , and rode off , in a phrenzy of lofty indignation . The course of his journey brought him into the gold region of Georgia . Ju t at the proper time he fell into a profound reverie , as young gentlemen are apt to do and wandered from his way . Before long he stumbled upon an outlaw , a member of the Pony Club , who was all ready to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outlaw , which has nothing in it , but tedious length , and utter absurdity . A scuffle followed , in which the young gentleman 's coolness , courage , and quickness of eye , brought him and his horse away victorious , leaving the robber sprawling on the ground , with the print of the horse 's heel upon his cheek . The escaping hero was shot at and hit in the leg , but did not at first feel the wound ; at length , however , he fainted and fell from his horse . A good-hearted , bragging , bullying fellow , named Forrester , picked him up , and carried him to the village-tavern , where he was laid up and well taken care of . As soon as his wound allowed , he left his chamber , and joined the circles below . At table he found a charming young lady , whom he knew , at first sight , to have received an education much above her present sphere . As soon as he could , he politely addressed his conversation to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as amiable , and intelligent , and beautiful as heart could desire . At another part of the table he espies a ferocious looking personage with whose look he seems to have a mysterious familiarity ; and his curiosity is painfully roused by observing this personage eyeing him more // Literary Notices . attentively than he thought good-breeding permitted . The strange man turns out to be Guy Rivers , and ( we may as well mention it here ) the gentleman robber whom he had so unceremoniously cheated out of his prey . A series of events now take place , most of which deeply concern the intrepid hero , and spring from the plotting brain of the mysterious outlaw , who shows an unaccountable thirst for his blood . Munro , the tavern-keeper , Lucy 's uncle , is leagued with the desperate fortunes of Rivers , and has already become the ready instrument of his superior genius . Bad enough this , for a young gentleman of nineteen ! About this time a Connecticut pedlar caine into the village , with a go-cart full of notions This worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the sharp-witted Georgians , a goodly qu ntity of wooden clocks , and tin pots that fell to pieces at sight of fire ; a catastrophe he accounts for by showing that said pots were not " calkilated " for a southern climate . The angry Southrons were proceeding to take vengeance on the unhappy pedlar , and actually did demolish the world of notions in his cart ; but a certain lawyer , Pippin by name , hoping to have an opportunity of bringing forward sundry actions of trespass and the like , slyly advised the pedlar to slip off , to his own retreat , while the work of destruction was in progress . The pedlar took the hint , mounted the lawyer 's horse , and vanished ; but the other part of his advice was forgotten . Great was the anger of Squire Pippin when he learned the true state of the case . Leaving the dealer in notions to take care of himself , which he is pretty well qualified to do , let us return to our hero , who needs a little looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escorting the amiable Lucy to a camp-meeting . On his way there , he entertained her with long speeches about the heart , and the comparative strength of woman 's affections , and other topics in that branch of divinity , as a sort of preparation for the services of the camp . All we can say is , we hope she did not find them so tedious as we did . We doubt not the young gentleman meant well ; but for a youth of nineteen to be such an unconscionable proser , promised sad things for manhood and old age . The sermon was interrupted by intelligence that a party of marauders had taken possession of a gold-region , worked by the villagers ; and the villagers were , of course , under arms at once to expel the intruders . When they arrive at the spot , a long dialogue takes place between the leaders ; then both parties are surprised by the coining on of a body of Georgia Guards , who threaten to expel them all . This leads to a union of forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off second best . Our hero must needs go to see the sport , and when there found it extremely hard to keep his head out of mischief , simpleton that he was . At length , however , he recognized in Guy Rivers , the robber who did not rob him . He charged him with it-was challen , , ed to a duel-but , with a careful eye to his own honor , refused to fight such a blackguard . This was sensible . Guy now burned with a fierce desire of vengeance . Our hero is not only the object of a wild personal hatred , but has in his possession secrets dangerous to the neck of Rivers , Munro &amp; Co . He returns to the village , receives mysterious warnings from Lucy , but is too proud to be influenced by them . At length she overhears the above-named worthies talking together , and gathers clearly that they are going to assassinate the young gentleman that very night . We may as well hint that the high-bearing , and long speeches of Mr. Colleton , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she was herself aware . So she determined to save him at all hazards . Our hero had thrown himself on his couch wrapped in his cloak , and was just fallen into pleasant dreams of home , and Edith , when Lucy , armed with preternatural strength , entered his chamber . She // awoke him . He started up , astonished as well he might he . She revealed his danger , and entreated him to flee ; at first he was incredulous , and got up a fit of pride and magnanimity ; she still urged he fell into his old trick of speechmaking , and we gave him up for lost ; but the lady ( as ladies always do ) gained her point , and he consented to depart . She guided him from the house , and having taken an affectionate leave , and thrown around her neck a gorgeous chain on which was hung a miniature of the incomparable Edith , he mounted his horse and was out of sight in an instant . The murderers were mad enough , to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call her , and laid a plan to cut him off . Rivers picked up a dagger which Colleton had dropped in his haste to depart , and in a short time they had set off in pursuit . Luckily he took the wrong road . In a short time they came up with a horseman whom they slew , by mistake ; it was Forrester , who had been obliged to decamp on account of his part in the affray with the guard . Rivers left , near the body , the dagger of Colleton , besmeared with blood ; and then set on foot the officers of justice , in pursuit of the supposed murderer . Colleton was arrested , tried , and the circumstances appearing to the jury conclusive , was sentenced to be executed . This to be sure was an awkward predicament . Lucy had made an attempt to save him , by testimony which she was suddenly prevented from giving , by the just remembered certainty of involving her uncle in the same peril . But she afterwards so wrought upon her uncle that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means which we can not stop to relate , to get the unfortunate young gentleman out of prison . A hot pursuit was the immediate consequence . The fugitives came to a river which they were attempting to ford , just as the pursuers came to the bank . Young Colleton looked back , and saw them preparing toshoot-he heard the fatal click ; but , with his usual presence of mind , plumped , like a duck , down into the river , and the balls entered his horse 's head . Munro , having reached the opposite bank , was shot at , and fatally wounded . Luckily , he had life and sense enough to disclose the whole truth ; luckily , a soldier had paper enough to write 4pwn the dying man 's confession ; luckily the moon shone brightly enough for him to do it ; and , most luckily , it was actually done . Colleton was released and restored to the arms of his friends , who had come to the village on hearing his unhappy plight . Guy Rivers was arrested , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed murder , and joined a gang of outlaws , after having been disappointed in politics and love . The secret of his enmity to Colleton , was that young gentleman 's successful attachment to Edith , the object of his own fierce and ungovernable aspiration . These are some of the main incidents in the tale . This novel shows very respectable powers both in thought and style . The author 's conception of character is strong and vivid ; but he does not finish according to nature . All his personages run , one way or another , into extravagances . They are all terribly addicted to prosing . Colleton proses , Lucy proses , the robbers prose , the pedlar proses , and the author himself proses . The hero is an improbable character . He is too wise for his years , and yet does some very silly things . The robber , Rivers , is improbable . He has great talents , and some distinction at the bar  --  and yet he is silly enough to become an outlaw for the purpose of avenging on society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected , and his election to the legislature defeated . The style is too verbose . The descriptions of persons and places are too frequent and too minute . They want clipping , condensing , clarifying , and strengthening .

In another passage he has stolen one of Cooper 's " furtive glances ; " arid in another he speaks of features of dress , &amp;c. f he number might be increased indefinitely ; but it is high time to stop , or we shall catch the author 's trick of prosing.
