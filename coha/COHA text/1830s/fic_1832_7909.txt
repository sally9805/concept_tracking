Fairfield , Sumner Lincoln , 1803-1844 : HIPPIAS , THE TRAITOR OF MARATHON . from The last night of Pompeii ( 1832 ) Hipparchus and Hippias , called the Pisistratid , the sons of Pisistratus , who during the latter years of Solon , through artifice and treachery , acquired the sovereignty of Athens , by many acts of arbitrary exaction and cruelty , had awaked the vengeance of the Athenians . Harmodius and Aristogiton led the revolt , ( indeed the inhabitants of Athens had never acknowledged the authority of Pisistratus or his sons , ) and slew Hipparchus , while Hippias escaped into the castle of the Acropolis , and exercised , for three years after , the most atrocious severities upon all , whom by fraud or violence , he could seize and torture . I have supposed Harmodius dead , and Aristogiton living , till the battle of Marathon , though the anachronism is obvious enough . Clisthenes , who contributed so much to expel Hippias , afterwards invented the ostracism , and was himself the first sufferer . The Panathenea , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Poem , was the most splendid festival of Attica : and the month Hecatombon , in which it was solemnized , being the period of the accession of the Archons and Thesmothet to office , would naturally awaken the people to the assertion of their rights . Autumnal twilight on the Zephyr 's wing Hovered o'er Athens , and its iris hues Blended with ether 's vestal blue , breathed o'er By the favonian airs , and with the clouds Pavilioned in the heavens , or diamond stars Now in their lustrous beauty coming forth . They myrtle and rose-flowered acacia flung Their vesper fragrance on the mellow breeze ; The illumined sea , dimpling with smiles , sent up The gentlest music to the parting light And dawning Pleiades , and , man might dream , The tritons with Poseidon , in a heaven Beneath the emerald billows , mid strange flowers , O'erclustering coral temples , dwelt and sung . The vales of Arcady , from meads of thyme And hallowed fountains , for dim oracles Renowned , uplifted evening orisons , With forest hymns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and latest light , Rejoicing in the loveliness of eve . And many a woodland pipe and cithern hailed Familiar constellations , as the blaze Of the divine Hyperion left the skies To the dominion of Love 's blessed stars . Yet ' mid the pomp of luxuries , within Athena 's citadel , in broidered robes , And tossing on his purple banquet couch In torture , lay the racked but noble form Of one who cursed the sunlight , and shut out The holy influences of the heaven , Loathing the beauty passion in his soul Had darkened with its midnight , and in wrath Shunning the spirit of magnificence He felt not in his bosom 's depth of gloom . Among the splendors of a power , erewhile By treachery grasped , yet ministered with thoughts Of grandeur , lay the last , least-gifted heart Whose pulses bounded with the glowing blood Of Pisistratus : o'er his lofty brow , And lips of beauty  --  which disdained the soul That mocked them with its weak and evil powers  --  The chill dews of an agony , that shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gushed , and in dark lines o'er his countenance The tempest of a foiled ambition fell . From burnished shield , statue and gleaming lance , Gem-hilted sabre and the pictured tomes Of Scio 's deathless bard , and all the pomp Of pillared porticoes , he turned and breathed Quick , panting execrations , as the breeze Rustled the olives of the Parthenon , Or with the orange leaves , like oreads , played . Listening with the intensest hope and fear , He rose upon the couch and forward leaned ; His pale lips writhed as if their scorpion curves Could fill his curse with venom  --  and his brow , Convulsed by pangs of guilt , e'en now in youth Burned with the ghastly light of blasted fame . " The Egyptian could not err  --  the Acropolis Hath never fail 'd its master ! yet the yells Of the wild faction  --  the dust-eaters  --  daunt My spirit  --  and I feel the spear-point glide Along my heart , whene'er Hipparchus ' doom Darkens the mirror of fierce memories ! " Thus in his solitude the tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was't not a voice beneath ? he comes to bring The soldiers of the isles unto my aid . Ay , shout , and shriek , and with your torchlight glare Affright the heavens , ye faithless herd of serfs ! I know ye merciless  --  can I be less ? Howl in your wild Panathenea , howl ! Your festival may close with unhoped feasts , Your saturnalia with the clank of chains ! My trusted Medon comes with tidings fit To soothe my ear shocked by your Teian oaths . A nearer step  --  and a white banner borne Proudly  --  he comes with succor in his smile ! " A lofty shadow crossed the vestibule , And in the purple twilight silent stood Before the tyrant , who but ill discerned Through the vast hall of revelries the face That with a marble sternness searched his soul . " Speak , Medon ! will the isles avenge our cause , And crush the rebel slaves that seek our death ? " " Gaze with a better judgment , Hippias ! once Clothed with a power thou dost no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herald-king Of the Amphyctions  --  who thus , from them Bids thee resign the citadel , and part For ever from the shores thy crimes have cursed  --  Or struggle with the vengeance thou hast raised ! " " Ha ! ' t is a gracious message , and I thank The artizans of Athens for their love ; But what my father builded and the blood Of bold Hipparchus sanctified , I keep ; Daring the Thesmothet and their host Of burden-bearers in their worst assault . " " The oppressor skills not in the lore of life , His grandeur is the sea-foam  --  and his power The gossamer a zephyr bears away . Beware thy answer , ' t is the very last The desperation of the land allows . Hast thou forgot Lena on the rack ? She spat her gory tongue at thee , and died Defying tyrants to make traitors , son Of the destroyer of the chainless Right ! Aristogiton and brave Clisthenes May teach thee wisdom ere thy Medon comes ! " " And I may teach it thee , unmannered slave Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To gain the masterdom by fawns and smiles Flung on the vile democracies of Greece !

" " One word , proud Hippias ! thou may'st depart With thine own Rhodope and all thy wealth , To any realm thou wilt  --  but hear me , lord ! Aristogiton with Platan troops Leads on the squadrons of brave Clisthenes ! The Spartan and the Alcmonid Are banded with Arcadia to o'erwhelm  --  " " And let them come ! it shall be joy , whate'er The gods resolve , to dip my hand in hearts That clove my brother 's ! Did I rightly hear  --  Aristogiton ? that thy place were his ! I would abscind a whole Olympiad From being but to quench that thirst ! he slew Hipparchus ! and he will be deified ! If ghosts are gods , my hand should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mine ! " Slowly the herald , spurning the dust , retired Unto the assembling host that through the gates Poured o'er the city , while thronged galleys lay In the Pirus , and the cries of wrath From the Munychian fortress hastened on The assaulters of the tyrant 's citadel . That night , festivities and liberal mirth , Accustomed at the nation 's gayest feast , When all in Athens banqueted and sang , Wanted their worshippers ; for human hearts , Goaded and gashed by wanton tyranny , Hurled their oppressions and oppressors forth , And robed their wounds with justice ! every clime Hath had its crowned and sceptred torturers , Its diadems and dungeons  --  every clime May have its armed avengers , if the mind Feels its immortal majesty , and bathes The brand of bondage with the monarch 's tears . The battle-cries  --  the rush  --  the trumpet 's voice  --  The glare of torchlight combat  --  the dismay And triumph  --  dinted shields and shattered helms  --  And broken palisades , and trampled halls Of desolated splendor  --  all are o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past glory , Hippias , through the gloom Of tangled wilds and shaggy caverns , groped His lonely path to banishment  --  amidst The forests , crags and torrents and defiles Of his wronged country  --  on the toppling peak , And in the voiceless grotto  --  danger  --  fear , And hopelessness and hunger , breathing one , One deep , remorseless passion , born of Hate And Agony  --  Revenge ! Revenge for all ! With ravening thirst of vengeance , borne for years , Through mountain gorges and o'er deserts fled The banished Hippias to the eastern king . Amidst the beauty and magnificence , The pomp and perfumes of the Sophi 's court The outcast tyrant bow 'd , while satraps laid Their foreheads in the dust and magi waved , From golden censers , odors o'er the throne Of Persia 's King , in conquered Babylon . The diamond diadem , the Tyrrhene robes Girded by broidered zones of gems and gold , The violet colored turbans thronging round The sceptre that awed Asia , and the dread Of the adoring crowd  --  o'er Hippias threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom of vassalage To breathe a glory they can never share . Might , majesty , the usages of kings , Palace and temple , and the matchless mind Of Greece had left the unsceptred wanderer now No admiration of barbaric pomp . " What wouldst thou , son of Pisistratus ? " said Royal Hystaspes.  --  " Refuge and Revenge ! " Replied the unfaltering prince .  --  " The first is thine , In Susa , by Choaspes , or the bowers Of fair Persopolis  --  or any dome Of all our empire that hath held a king , Till such time as the greatness of our cares Permits us further to discourse of thine . Thou shalt not lack our solace for the woes Revolt hath stirred within thy bosom , Prince ! Nor our fit aid to wrest from rebel hordes A ransom such as Babylon has paid For treason and Zopyrus  --  when time serves . Thou comest not alone ? " " My Rhodope , For we are childless , is the only charm That lingers round my desolated path , Great sovereign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awaits , in grief . The edict of the monarch 's gracious will . " " O Mythra ! doth it come to this , at last ? That a frail woman  --  like a summer cloud Upon the desert , is the only shade For the brave man in agony  --  the flower That with its fragrant leaves shadows the brow Which burns in Passion 's fever  --  that our pride And pleasure and renown and majesty Are vanities beneath her starlight smile ! Well , thou art happy , Hippias ! in thy love . Choose from our regal mansions as thou wilt  --  And Peace , like the cool fountain 's music , shed Her gladness round thee till we meet again ! " When Freedom , phrenzied by the scorn and wrong Of purple power , tears from the place of guilt The Atlas of the crushed heart 's agonies The sceptre trembles in each monarch hand O'er the glad earth  --  the brightest crown-gems fade , And battled legions  --  mercenary hosts  --  Are cast like avalanches , o'er the realm That doubts the archangel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime Becomes impolicy , and shedded blood Lamented chance , and princely palaces In other kingdoms shield the despot , cells Of darkness in his own should carcerate . Time is but thought ; and o'er the ill or good , It flies or lingers as their spirits will , Soothing misfortune , or to nurtured hate , Adding dark torrents of feigned injuries . Years drearily meandered o'er the heart Of Hippias amidst the loveliest bloom And verdure of the lote and myrtle groves , The Aurora and the vesper hymn of streams , The chequered shadows of the Zagros hills , The magic , love , romance and revelries Of his own beautiful and glittering home . Humiliation panted for revenge  --  Shame summoned demon pride  --  lost powers called up The faded apparitions of his hour Of homage and dominion ; and he sued By starbeam and by sunlight , through the years Of banishment , to satraps at his feasts , And princes in their palaces to lead The vast hosts of the east against the land Where , tyraat once and traitor now , his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoary and his countenance Trench 'd o'er , and charr 'd by evil thoughts , ere forth The heralds of the Medes and Persians passed , To bid Arcadia to the Persian bow . And Hippias buried time , till one returned . " Brings't thou the earth and water ? fear they not ? " Astarte save me ! I alone am left ; The Grecians hurled my fellows from the rocks Into the abysses  --  saying ' Take your fill ! ' " Mocked thus , Darius paused not , but arrayed His armies for the conquest , and the waves Of the Euphrates heard the shouts and songs Of thousands following thousands to the war . The barbs of Araby and towered elephants Bore dusky chieftains panoplied ; the waste And mountain pass and plain with silken tents And costliest pavilions , pillowed round , Seemed an enchanted land ; and instruments Of softest music breathed their harmonies On the spread camp and scattered wanton march . Emblazoned shields no blood had ever dimmed , And mirrored helmets ne'er a sword had left A hero 's witness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , Glittered and waved around the royal pomp . Beside the monarch in the centre rode The mover of this pageantry , and oft The doubting mind of Hippias , as he cast His troubled glances o'er the motley host , Betrayed the fear that , like a thraldom brand , Seared his proud heart ; yet dared he not arraign The satrap 's vaunted skill in high command . So on they passed , and o'er the gean swept The galleys of the Persian , and his bands , Like sundered glaciers , poured upon the plain Of deathless Marathon , leaving behind Dark solitudes of smouldering flame and gore . There stood Miltiades , mid the armed hearts Of Arcady , and in the bristling van Of the Platans towered an aged form . Unbroken by the harvest years of joy And virtue ; and the same heroic eye Watched the o'ercrowding foe , that erst , along The hallowed blade flashed on the cloven heart Of dead Hipparchus ; and the traitor 's brow Felt the pale shadows of the sepulchre , As he beheld Aristogiton there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The sanctities of ages shroud its deeds . It 's name is glory , and the hero 's fame , Shrined in the pantheon of deathless thought ! It thrills the soul of childhood and inspires The sage , the warrior , and the statesman , when All other fields of triumph pass away ! The earth became a reservior of blood , And carnage loathed its banquet , ere the waves Of war bore Hippias , crimsoned with the gore Of his betrayed and groaning country , near Its terrible avenger . " Art thou come , Hoar tyrant traitor ! to invoke thy doom From him who gashed thy brother 's perjured heart ? And heard Harmodius , in his torture , name Thy parasites , his fellows in the death ? Come ! let the trophy of my best days be Thy head , upon the shield , that shall not save Thy bosom  --  when thy country bids thee die ! " He grasped  --  he hurled him from his plunging steed  --  And , linked like maddened scorpions they strove , And on the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aristogiton is above him now ! Strike for thy country ! strike for human kind ! The sabre searched the tyrant 's vitals then ! Ha ! the blood bubbles from the ruthless heart ! Again  --  one other blow for Liberty ! Why roll thine eye-balls , patriot ? oh , the blade Of Hippias , by his dying anguish driven With all his living hate , is in thy heart ! The red streams mingle  --  the deep rattling voice Of Death exults in this last wild Revenge , And the low prayer of gratitude , and sigh Of love flow from the stiffening lips that breathed Their latest blessing on Arcadia 's realm . And there , at eve , the searchers of the dead , Locked breast to breast , and palled in darkened blood , The tyrant and the avenging patriot found . Fairfield , Sumner Lincoln , 1803-1844 : URN BURIAL . from The last night of Pompeii ( 1832 ) Give not the human temple of the mind To the dead loathsome dust of ages gone , In the cold , silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ebon throne ; Give not the quench 'd and shattered shrine , whereon Thought burned its incense , feeling breathed its prayer , O'er which Hope , Faith , and Intellect have flown , To the bleak , haunted darkness of despair  --  Oblivion 's utter gloom , where Love can not repair . Time rends the ties which frail Earth briefly gives , And the soul 's visions vanish like the wind , But love immortal in its glory lives , And in elysium links blest mind with mind ; E'en now , wing 'd angels , watching o'er their kind , In parted beings old affection burns , As hovering o'er the haunts of thought enshrined , To the heart 's home , that , once lost , ne'er returns , They wander gladly back and breathe upon their urns . The seraph visitants , who dwelt in forms , Redeemed by tears and hallowed by the grave , Float o'er our thoughts in starlight and in storms , And vainly languish for the love they gave ; While each loved bosom , to cold dust a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon Earth 's buried mysteries to save The spirit 's ark from sacrilege unknown , Or bring affection back with the altar and the crown . But there , pale tremblers o'er the prison tomb , Where Death from each heart-thrilling feature springs . The plumes of spirits quiver in the gloom , And vain sighs murmur in their restless wings , Uttering their deathless , doomed imaginings ; While life is stirring in the ardent veins Of cheered survivors , and each daybreak brings Fair gleams of hope and fresh Arcadian strains , To gild the weeds of woe ,  --  to hush Death 's clanking chains . Nourished in loneliness by beam and dew , The azure waters and the emerald shore , Light from the mind , like Gods from Ida , flew , And breathed the immortal seraph 's holiest lore ; And , from the world 's corruptings , thought would soar , When twilight taught religion , not of creeds , Beyond the power of evil , and deplore Frailties , o'er which the burning bosom bleeds , And guilt , that casts deep night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last refuge ? this , the home Of the heart 's ardors and elysian charms ? To Death 's cold mansion none of Time will come , Where thou sit'st , Earth ! thy dead ones in thine arms ! But shrinking fears and doubts and quick alarms Pervade and agonize the soul , that shoots Through the still dwelling , where no object warms The frozen sea of memory , and the roots Of Love decay , and leave sear trunk and blasted fruits . But , oh , how beautiful the olden rite ! The twilight burial and the spicewood pyre ! The asbestos robe , the witnesses of light From the blue heavens beholding son or sire Bearing the dead with torch , and urn , and lyre ! Hope , memory , feeling , adoration dwelt Within the mind , that purified by fire The form , which , late , earth 's sin and sorrow felt , Yet kept the dust beloved and with it gently dealt . Imagination , pathless and alone , Went with a soundless tread through being 's sky , Bounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could not die : No voice , no vision , no revealing eye Restored man 's error in his maze of dreams , But , solitary in creations high , He gave immortal thoughts to woods and streams , Bathed death 's cheek in young dew and filled death 's eye with beams . Thus , mounting to the fount of life divine , The spirit revelled in its visionries , Creating in each star a sacred shrine  --  Having its home in the blue evening skies ! Man 's hallowed love of beauty never dies , But , born with being , gleams along the track Of life , and , shadowing human destinies , Revokes the evelights of glad childhood back , And throws the rainbow 's hues along the dark cloud 's rack . These lofty thoughts around the dead became Soarings of tenderness , of Love that brought Electric union of the deeds and name , The flesh and the far being of the thought ; High Intellect hath even shrunk from NOUGHT , With loathing chill , and fashioned , at desire , Worlds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Can slay no more  --  where friendship and the lyre May hail , from ashes urned , the souls their songs inspire . But who will weep when I shall be no more ? Who to my manes offer life 's regret ! The barque departs from being 's desert shore  --  The storm-veiled sun of saddened mind hath set ! Few are the hearts my wayward fate hath met Which mine could fold as heaven unto my soul , And these Earth shrouds or treachery 's poison net ; And thus , alone , to Death 's world-darkened goal , Friendless , I haste and leave the orphans to their dole . Dread not thy doom as mindless vassals fear The tyrant 's lash and torture , but , through all The hours allotted to thy action here , Thy deeds , as incense , rise above man 's fall ! So wisdom redes : but man is feeling 's thrall . Shudders to part from gifts and blessings shrined In his unfathomed soul , and , most , to call In vain , along the boundless realms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humankind . In the grey dawn of Time , when high decrees Were uttered by each bosom 's pulse of pride , When waters and dim woods had deities , Oreads in the air and tritons on the tide , And Nature 's spirits o'er the heart did glide Like most familiar friends  --  each thought and deed Lifted exulting man , and purified The stain and taint of crime , till all his creed Was love to being 's God and charity in need . With what a passion , through all human things , Frail hearts have panted in their pain to know The mysteries that fold their midnight wings Around the daring spirit ! but earth 's woe , Like the lone upas fountain 's poison flow , Utters alone the oracles that thrill The soul , and , like the moaning ocean 's glow , Quiver along the waves of good and ill , That rush towards the gulph where all is cold and still . Inspired by grief , and guided by lone love , The seers and sages of a better time Gave beauty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every clime , And fellowship and faith and hope sublime . The deeds of years were , as Love 's offering given , To the dread manes of their sires , and crime Fled from the Dead 's Tribunal , wildly driven ,  --  Daring not souls on earth whose home and throne were heaven . Thus intellect and feeling gave to form Undying action ; to the eye and brow The shadows of divinity ; thus warm From the deep fount came thoughts that lift us now From earth , and wreathe our hopes with heaven 's own bow ! Thus could our living meditations dwell On doom , left fearless by the light and flow Of life and hearthlight commune , Death 's farewell Might on the closing ear like songs of seraphs swell !
