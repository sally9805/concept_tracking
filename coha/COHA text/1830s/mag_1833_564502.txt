txt THE ancient languages , then , being no longer a source of either science or history , and the study of them having no more influence in training and strengthening the higher faculties of the mind , than the study of modern languages , were the question put , " In what respect are scholars benefited by a knowledge of them ? " the answer must be , " In polite literature alone . " * How far they are benefited even there , shall be our next inquiry . This brings us , to consider a question proposed , in substance , in an early part of this article . Can an Englishman or an American , versed in modern languages only-say English , French , and Italian  --  but thoroughly disciplined in science , become as able and accomplished a writer and speaker , as if he had a knowledge of Greek and Latin ? This is an important problem , in the present state of the world , more especially , perhaps , in our own country . And we repeat , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has never yet been made . The effect of a true modern education has never been tried-certainly never on a broad scale . No one , we mean as far as we are informed , has been thoroughly imbued with modern languages and modern science , t and extensively practised in writing and speaking , without having some acquaintance also with Greek and Latin . Hence a vast majority of great authors and orators have been necessarily more or less of classical scholars . It would be strange were it otherwise . The tide of opinion , united to the influence of fashion , has compelled every one educated for professional , public , or literary life , to pay some attention to ancient literature . But has this study aided them essentially in the attainment of distinction ? or has it been only an accompaniment of it-tending , perhaps , to de*orate the mind , hut neither to enrich nor strengthen it ? To reply , that it has been an indispensable element of the greatness and lustre acquired , would be hazardous , we think , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern times , have had hut a slight acquaintance with Greek and Latin , and others none at all . Among the former may be mentioned Chatham , Erskine , and Hamilton ; and among the latter , Henry , Whitefield , and two or three Americans now living , whom it might be indelicate to name . Respecting authors the same is true . * It is urged , by the Committee , as another argument in favor of a knowledge of Greek and Latin , that it qualifies its possessor better ttran he could be without it , to travel , for information or pleasure , through Europe . To this we shall only reply , that we have never found it necessary to converse in either Greek or Latin , in Enrop , any more than in the United States . We have mingled somewhat there in literary ad scientific society , as well as in social and fashionable circles ; and English , Frencti , or Italian , never failed to serve us , as a medium of conversation . Through one or another of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impart , and receive , in return , all we wished to know . And we believe the same is true of every other traveler , who mixes only in enlightened society . True ; we met , by accident , a few bevies of schetastics , who manifested at once their learning and pedantry-not to say their ill-breeding-by speaking Latin , garnished occasionally with a scrap or two of Greek . But for such coteries we had no predilection , inasmuch as we usually found their k ss*tedgc of aecient affairs , fully counterbalanced by their ig seance of snadeca ones  --  the latter being , in our opinion , the more important . Under the phrase " modern science , " it will be understood that we include mathematics , and such other branches of science an were known to the ancients , with their modern improvements . // Shakspeare , the first writer , in some respects , the world has produced , was a stran0 , er to the ancient languages ; and Moliere , Fielding , and Cuvier were in the same condition . So was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspicuity , and chasteness ; and so was Washington , who wrote with uncommon elegance and power . Sir Humphrey Davy , an excellent writer , an eloquent speaker , President of the Royal Society , and the ablest chemist of his day , had no classical learning . We believe the same is true of Mr. Bowditch , one of the most accomplished mathematicians and astronomers of the age , and an able writer ; and we know the same was true of the late Mr. Rittenhouse . Yet so deeply versed in Astronomy was the latter , that , in the accuracy and importance of his observations on the transit of Venus over the Sun , many years ago , he surpassed all the astronomers of Europe . And , in a mere literary point of view , some of his writings are highly creditable . Yet none of these studied English as thoroughly , or obtained as perfect a command of it , as he might have done . Each of them , therefore , might have greatly improved his style and manner , as a writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the style of English authors is far from being perfect , in proportion to their knowledge of the dead languages , appears from numerous instances . Sir Walter Scott and Sir James Mackintosh were greatly inferior , in classical scholarship , to many we could name , who can scarcely write grammatical English . Of Jeffrey , Bulwer , Cooper , and Irwin , the same is true . Few men write better English , or express themselves more vigorously , than William Cobbett , who is totally unversed in Greek and Latin . The same was true of Thomas Paine . And some of the most correct and fascinating writers of the day are females , who are also strangers to the ancient classics. * Shall we be told , that our references here are only to individuals , possessed of native talents sufficiently powerful to raise them to distinction , without the aid of classical attainments ; but that with such aid , they would have been much more distinguished ? We reply that this argument , so constantly used on occasions like the present , and deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , it appears to us to be wanting in solidity altogether . To say that the individuals referred to , would , by the aid of Greek and Latin , have had greater power , and would , therefore , have attained more celebrity , is to assert , not to prove . lit is to hazard a conjecture on a point , which reason and experiment alone can decide . We should be justified , therefore , in resorting to a counter assertion , and saying , in reply to it , that they would not . But we must not deal in empty contradiction , although we are contending with empty supposition . Our business is to reason , not barely to deny . The question is not , Whether Shakspeare , Moliere , Franklin , Washington , and others , would have been benefited by such an early and general education , as would have disciplined and strengthened all In one respect , we have an iufinite advantage over our opponents . Ours is the positive , theirs the e , ative side of the question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the negations they can offer . But we have furnished sundry proofs , in mentioning the names of several individuals , who have heroine *ccomplished writers and speakers , without a knowledge of Greek or Latin . We consider our opinion , therefore , fully established . The maxim , that the whole is greater than a part , is not more so . // the faculties of their minds ? We believe they would . The point to be settled is , Whether the study of the dead languages would have bestowed that education ? and we believe it would not . Or the question may be , Could not the requisite instruction and training have been acquired , without those languages ? We think it could . We repeat , that an acquaintance with Greek and Latin does not teach its possessor to observe , think , or analyze . Some of the most accurate and successful observers , and most vigorous thinkers , are destitute of it , while many , who have it , are very feeble in these respects . Nor does it teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages without it . So can he , without it , listen to lectures , conversation , and other forms of oral communication . But these are the chief channels , through which information is acquired . It neither aids him , then , in collecting knowledge , nor in reflecting on it , preparing it for practical purposes , and then applying it . If it improves power in any thing , it is in expressing his ideas , when formed , in suitable language . As already stated , it disciplines his faculty of language alone . But that is comparatively a humble faculty , and constituted but little of the mental greatness and power of such men as Shakspeare , Franklin , and Washington . It only aided in manifesting that power . Their superiority arose chiefly from the great strength and activity of their faculties of observation , reflection , combination , and judgement . It consisted in the general vigor and compass of their genius ; and neither Greek nor Latin could have enlarged or strengthened that ) * ' To have attempted the invigoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an effort to add to the might of the eagle , by improving a single pinion of his wing . To write or speak powerfully is the result of powerful conception and thought , of which words are hut the drapery while the use of graceful , accurate , and classical language is compatible with feeble thinking . Hence many hooks , exceedingly limited in matter , are written in a pure and pleasing style . The mere cultivation of language , therefore , by the study of Greek and Latin , makes but a humble element of a complete modern education , and adds but little to mental development . It could not have increased , in any useful or even perceptible degree , the power or renown of either the philosopher , who disarmed the thunder-cloud , the hero , who achieved the freedom of a continent , or the chief magistrate , who governed a nation with consummate wisdom . Nor can it ever strengthen the feeble-minded . It can never confer distinction , in * Innumerable instances might be adduced to show , that much ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of mere book-learning , whether ancient or modern , the same is true . It is altogether insufficient to make a great man-especially a practical one . It has been already observed , that some of the greatest practical men that have appea ed-improvers , inventors , and discoverers , both in science and the arts , have had but little learning of any kind , and none at all in Greek and Latin . nut they have all been devoted readers of the book of nature , by observation and reflection . Their knowledge was , therefore , strictly their own ; and most of their intellectual faculties were competently exercised and strengthened in acquiring and using it . In the acquisition of knowledge lip readissg , the faculties are exercised comparatively in very moderate degree , and therefore but slightly strengthened and improved . Learning fills die mind , but does not invigorate it . IJolesm , therefore , the knowledge attained by reading , he seriously reflected on , and severely tested , by bringing it to the standard of nature , the mental faculties are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and thinks but little is cdled in form of disrespect , a bask-we , . It is often said that reading makes a full man , conversation a ready man , and writing an accurate one . To this may be safely added , that , without observation and reflection , neither books , conversation , nor writing , nor the three united , can ever make a man great or efficient . That they may be invigorated , and rendered available for high purposes , the faculties must be suitahly exercised . And it can scarcely be too often repeated , that the proper exercise of them can be derived only from the study of nature . // things of moment , on those who might not have been distinguished without it . If it serves as an occasional ornament , it can do nothing more . And to do even that , consistently with taste , it must be used but seldom . A brief analysis will show how limited an element of a modern education , a knowledge of Greek and Latin constitutes . Let it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an American , or an Englishman , must include the following branches of knowledge . The pupil must be taught to read and speak his native tongue , and to . write . On his attainment in these branches , it will not be contended that Greek and Latin have any influence . He must , also , be instructed in arithmetic , book-keeping , algebra , m*thematics in its several subdivisions , experimental philosophy , and astronomy . With the knowledge of these , again , the ancient languages have no connexion . But our pupil 's course of instruction is yet far from being complete . He must be versed in logic , general history , chronology , geography , *chemistry , mineralogy , botany , natural history , political economy , mental philosophy ,  --  including the science of morals , and belles-lettres ; including philosophical grammar , composition , rhetoric , taste , and criticism ,  --  and he ought to have an acquaintance with natural religion . Nor is it less important that he should know something of the structure , functions , dependencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this branch of science , in our seats of learning , is a fault , not to call it a serious evil . The study of it would - not only further enlighten and liberalize the mind , by exhibiting to it one of the most beautiful specimens of the wisdom of creation ; the knowledge thus acquired might be turned to an invaluable account , in the management of education , and the preservation of health . So numerous are the elements of a complete modern education , to which a few others might be added ; and in the attainment of only one of them does a knowledge of Greek and Latin afford any facility . We allude to belles-lettres . Will any one contend that it aids , also , in historical researches ? We reply , In a very limited degree ; and only in those departments of history , which are least useful . Nor do we hesitate to express our belieg that , as far as philosophical grammar , composition , rhetoric , and taste are concerned , belles-lettres , also , may be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , scholars , who have never studied the ancient languages , may speak and write the English tongue , as correctly , gracefully , and classically , and with as much eloquence and power as those who have . That an acquaintance with Greek and Latin aids in mere biblical criticism , especially as relates to ancient works , is not denied . But that attainment is comparatively of little value . It renders the scholar somewhat more learned ; but it does not increase his practical power , except on a few points , which are more curious than useful . The English language is a compound of three others ; the Saxon , which is its root , and the Greek and Latin , which , besides adding to its copiousness , variety , and force , have improved it in elegance , and some other qualities . When it was in its infancy , its amount of words being incomplete , its construction and spelling not m*tured , and considerable changes constantly occurring in it , a knowledge of the tongues , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the Saxon , * as well as of the others . It was then a dependent and imperfect language , unequal to the wants of science and letters , and needed , therefore , further cultivation . But , at present , the case is different . It is now as mature as Greek or Latin , and has as much of an independent existence . It is in its minority no longer . Its structure and principles are established , its meaning is defined , and its origin pointed out , in well-prepared dictionaries , and its literature , the most extensive in the world , is as highly finished , as any other . Nor , except as may relate to a few technical terms , does it seem likely to receive any further increase directly from Greek or Latin . It has already drained those languages of all it wants for common use , and it will be itself the source of the chief additions and improvements , it may hereafter receive . It might he easily shown that it contains already words enough , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary hereafter , for the expression of new modifications of thought . And the process of forming new words , from its present stock , is easy and familiar.t A thorough knowledge of it , therefore , may be acquired , by a sufficient cultivation of itself alone , without the least aid from the study of any other tongue . Dictionaries will give the true Ineaning and derivation of words ; well-prepared grammars will teach the structure and philosophy of it ; the study of the best English authors , under competent instructers , will form a correct taste in it , and diligent and persevering practice in speaking and composition , will confer excellence in both . In fine ; the philosophical and practical study of the English tongue , by itself carried to the extent , and executed with the thoroughness it deserves , may be made to produce more highly accomplished English writers , than have yet appeared . We have said the study of English " by itself ; " because the cultivation of one language can not improve a scholar in the knowl* edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forming an acquaintance with German , nor the study of the latter , in acquiring a knowledge of Spanish . Nor can the mere cultivation of Greek and Latin contribute to the formation of a finished English scholar. $ He * An acquaintance with Saxon , even now , is as necessary to a thorough knowledge of English , as an acquaintance with Greek and Latin . Yet nobody dreams of studying Saxon . The reason is obvious , custom has not rendered it fashionable . Thus is the parent-stream of our knowledge neglected , as useless , while two mere feeders are pronounced essential , and years spent in acqoiring a knowledge of them . For ample instruction on this point , see Webster 's *uarto Dictionary , article , GRAMM AR1 head , DERIVATION . The occasional formation of new English words may bra matter of convenience and perhaps of elegance but it can never be necessary . certainly no ground is discoverable , from which the necessity can arise . It mi5ht be readily demonstrated , that , newly discsrered objects e cepted , n idea or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which osay not be clearly expressed , in our language , with its present stock of nords , in perhaps a hsesdred d*ffcrent ay.s. to proof of this , it rarely , if ever , happens that the same thoaht is clothed in the same words , by any two original writers or speakers . Sorts is tile copiousness of our usother-ton ne . The number of different cosoisinatiotis , that usay be formed 01st of its seventy or eighty thousand words , is beyond the power of man to computc , or even fancy . If it be not infinite , it approaches so near it , that the lisse of separation can not tie imagined ; much less , shown . * We wish to be clearly understood on this point . We do not deny that an acquaintance with Greek and Latin may make the possessor of it a more eruditeEnglish scholar , than he cotild be without it . On the contrary , we acknowledge that it may . It will give hun a more accurate knowledge of tise etymology and roots of the language . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even to the writer and the orator it is much more curious than ttsefnl ; and , in the transaction of affairs , whether public or private , its value is still less . tt does not necessarily and certainly teach either the meaning , spellin* , or proussociation of words . Tisey are greatly influenced by custom and fashion , and are , therefore , far from being stable and uniform . The history of rIse Enalish language , for the last tsvo or three centisries , proves this . In fine ; a mere knowledge of its derivation does not , in one case in ten tho , soand , create a greater fitness to use Ilse English tongue , to the highest and best effect , lisa , , can be attained witlsotst it . Desides ; our best dictionaries teach the etymology of oar principal words , to an extent sufficient for all useful purposes . The Greek , the most perfect of langu es , had no mother-tongue , to which it could be // who would understand thoroughly either a language or any thing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal in capacity , be educated , one of them perfectly in English , and the several branches of science heretofore indicated , without Greek or Latin , and the other after the mode usually pursued in the seats of learning in England and the United States ; - let this experiment be fairly made , and we hazard nothing in saying , that , at the age of twenty , the student of English will be far the more accomplished , both in science and polite literature . He will surpass the other , as a writer and speaker , in every point of excellence . The reason is plain . All his faculties have been invigorated , and taught to work ; his mind has been well stored with knowledge , by cultivating the sciences ; his thorough study of English , united to his familiarity with the best authors in it , has formed his taste ; and long and steady practice in composition and speaking , has given him a ready and entire command of his resources . In the mean time , the faculties of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been consumed in the study of language ; but not of the English language . That has been neglected , for the sake of ancient literature ; or an attempt has been made to learn it through the medium of that literature , and has failed-as it always must . The consequence of all this is , that the mind of the pupil is neither well supplied with knowledge , nor are his powers of expressing what he possesses , either in writing or speaking , matured . But what is true of one , on this subject , is true of many . The two scholars here referred to , therefore , may be considered the representatives of indefinite numbers . Nor do we hesitate to believe , that , of two rival colleges , one bestowing the complete English education here designated , and the other adhering to the system of instruction usually pursued in our country , the former would have a striking superiority in the distinction and practical usefulness of its pupils . We regret to add our belief , that , as Greek and Latin are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the study of them , is , in a great majority of cases , thrown away . The attainment made in them is too superficial to be creditable , or in any way useful . Are we asked , Whether we would abandon the study of the dead languages altogether* We answer , No ; but we would reduce greatly the number of those , who should engage in the study of them ; and those , who might thus engage , should become thoroughly versed in them . We would have no smatterers-no linguists in name  --  but accomplished Greek and Latin scholars . They should be scholars by profession . And one such could do more good , in applying the ancient languages to the only useful purposes they are calculated to subserve , than the entire phalanx of those shallow Hellenists and Latinists , who swarm so thickly in Europe and America . We say " Europe ; " for , in a majority of cases , classical attainment there , is not much better than with ourselves . But few critical Greek and Latin scholars traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so may the English , i its present co dition , and be made as rich , elegant , and powerful a medium for the expression of feeling , and the utterance of thought , as was ever possessed by Greece or Rome . The well-known fact , that many erudite Hellenists and Latinists are very defective in their knowledge of English , and that many others are accurately versed in it , speaking and writing it with elegance and force , without an acquaintance with Greek and Latin , proves conclusively the point we are contending for-that a Insosotedge of the dead languages is not essential to the ticorough e itivation of all the faculties of the mind . // can be found any where . They are probably most numerous in Germany . We shall only add , on this point , that no one should be made to toil , for years , in the study of classical learning , unless his faculty of language is of a high order . If it be not so , his toils will be irksome to himself , and useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfitness to learn languages , though highly important , is rarely made , because the constitution of the mind , creating an aptitude for some studies , and an inaptitude for others , is under stood by but few of the teachers of youth . The general notion is , that a pupil , who masters one branch of study with facility , can , with equal facility , master all others ; and that if he fails to do so , it is because he is inattentive to them . Yet facts of hourly occurrence prove its fallacy . It is owing to this preposterous practice of attempting to train , in the same way , minds which nature has cast in different moulds , and marked with striking diversities , that many young men , possessing fine talents for other branches of knowledge , but a weak faculty of language , have become disgusted with the drudgery of classical study , and abandoned their education . Nor is this abandonment the only evil connected with the case . A youth , under these circumstances , leaves college with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin and Greek , he is accounted either idle and dissipated , or so dull as to he unfit for any useful exertion of mind . Thus is he discouraged , underrated , and perhaps ruined . These things should be looked to , and remedied ; and we are confident that the period is approaching , when they will be . A correct understanding of the constitution and powers of the human mind , generally diffused , especially among the directors of seats of instruction , will be the commencement of a new and brilliant era in the work of education . The belief is general , that to all young men destined to the professions of Divinity , Law , and Medicine , the study of Greek and Latin is indispensable-at least , that it is peculiarly useful . We decline offering any remarks on the preparations deemed necessary for the former of these callings ; but , as relates to the two latter , we are compelled to say , that we consider the opinion referred to erroneous . In no respect does a knowledge of the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the score of technical language ; and that can in less than be learned from professional Lexicons , a tenth part of the time usually devoted to classical studies . An acquaintance with the professional phraseology of law and medicine might be acquired in a short time , as a distinct exercise ; but the better way would be , for the student to attain it gradually from his Lexicon , during the progress of his professional studies . The portion of time consumed by this would be inconsiderable ; and the meaning of terms would be fixed in the * Shall we be told , in form of an objection , tb* t certain law-books contain many scraps of Latin , which the members of the Bench and Bar shoold be able to understand ? We reply , that this constitutes no objection to the principle we are contending for . Let the Latin quotations be translated , as they ou , ght to be , that the pedantry and mysticism of the profession may have an end . It is neither creditable nor fair , to yonceal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the administration of justice . Besides ; proof can be given , that Ihe objection hero stated has no weight-at least , that the obstacle said to be created by scraps of Latin , in law-books , can be easily surmounted . Chief Justice Marshall , one of the ablest jurists of the age-we might add , of any age-never received what can be correctly called a classical education , and is not therefore indebted to the ancient languages for his knowledge of Law . If he ever acquired any knowledge of Greek or Latin , it was a mere smattering , in a common grammar-school , which was of no service to him . Most of his brothers received what is called a " classical education . " Yet , without this advantage , he has towered above them all . He is , moreover , an able writer of his mother tongue , and has been an orator of high standing . // mind more firmly , than in any other way . The pupil 's Lexicon must be his oracle , whether he learn technical language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or previously , through the medium of Greek and Latin . To no other interpreter can he have recourse . There is , however , a wide difference between the two methods . The oracle must be consulted a hundred times in the latter , for each single time it will need to be consulted in the former . We may safely add , that of those who have read Greek and Latin , preparatory to the study of law or medicine , nineteen out of twenty are still obliged to consult their Lexicons for the precise meaning of technical terms . In truth , every one is . Shall we he charged with a disposition to ahridge the course of education preparatory to the study of law and medicine , and render it more defective than it is already ? The charge would be unfounded . We would greatly enlarge and improve the course ; but not by saddling it with a devotion of years to the learning of words , which will be afterwards but rarely used . Instead of this , substantial things should he studied , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and store them with valuable matter . The candidates for both professions should have a perfect knowledge of English , and be well versed in history , arid in the elements of all the modern sciences . They should have an intimate and comprehensive acquaintance with nature ; and those educated for medicine should be instructed in French , Italian , and German . Why in these languages ? Because they abound in medical works , some of them very valuable , which have not been translated into English , and many of which never will be . Besides , numerous discoveries and improvements in medicine are first recorded in those languages , and ought to be immediately known to British and American physicians . Respecting the necessity of an acquaintance with the modern languages of continental Europe to lawyers , we are not prepared to speak . All statesmen , at least , who may go abroad , on diplomatic missions , or in other public capacities , should be prepared to speak and write in French , if not in other foreign tongues . In fine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of medicine , should receive a well-finished liberal education , embracing a knowledge of two or three modern languages , and of the elements of all the sciences . Above all , he should be taught to exercise his own talents on the knowledge he may possess . Without this , attainment is but lumber . To complete this course of instruction and training will occupy the time of the most highly-gifted youth , from his sixth , until his eighteenth or twentieth year . Nor do we hesitate to believe , that the adoption of such a plan of education would usher in an era of professional , literary , and scientific splendor , such as the world has never witnessed . The study of the sciences would furnish the matter of knowledge , and give strength and activity to the whole mind , while the due cultivation of modern language would improve the power and all other qualities of expression , both in writing and speaking . It has been often said , that the chief reason , why British surpass American writers , in style and manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a mistake . The superiority of the British writers arises from their being better versed in English litera // ture . In other words , they cultivate with more care , and to a greater extent , tke art of coniposition-for it is as real an art , as the making of razors or penknives . And it must be brought to perfection in the same way-by constant practice , and a determination to excel . So must every other pursuit . Many Englishmen have long been writers , by profession , and have spent their lives , in improving themselves in the knowledge and use of their mother tongue . Hence their attainment of a fine style-not because they had learned Greek and Latin at school-nor because they had in their eye , when writing , a Greek or Latin model . lie who dwells , in recollection , on ancient literature , when composing in English , will never excel in style . It is but recently that any Americans have begun to practise authorship , as a profession ; and , as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disheartened . Without being any better versed in Greek and Latin , than formerly , they write English much better , , because they pursue the art with more care and constancy ; and , , should they persevere in it , to the proper extent , as many of them no doubt will , they will equal , in time , the best British writers . Nor will they owe their success to a closer familiarity with the ancient languages ; but to a more intimate acquaintance with their native tongue , and a more perfect command of their own powers . It has been already stated , that nothing can be thoroughly understood , without being attentively studied , as a special subject . To this may be added , that there are few things which may not be mastered in that way . It is therefore that we earnestly desire to see the English language more strictly cultivated . By that means alone can it ever be written and spoken , in the full perfection , of which it is susceptible ; and that course will complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language must be studied as a simple tongue , having a form and genius especially its own ; not as a mixture of three other tongues , assimilated to each , yet identified with neither . While cultivated in the latter mode , it will be hybridous and defective . The Greek is accounted the most peffect of languages ; and for this , it iS no doubt much indebted to its selfdependent character . It is not a mixture of several tongues . In their attempts to improve it , therefore , and use it in the most perfect manner , its cultivators had not their attention distracted by collateral and interfering claims . They studied and practised Greek alone , without looking to any higher source . Hence the success of their long-continued effort . As relates to English , the same would be true . If studied and improved , in a distinct capacity , it would be brought , more certainly than in any other way , . to the highest perfection it can ever attain . hence we would rejoice to see an Institute* established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject , the only approach toward an inotitt*tion of this kind , made in the United States , is the " High School " of Boston . Yet it is only an approach . As far , however , as the experiment has been carried , it has been eminently successful , and has opened the most flattering prospect for something more perfect . In that institution , nothing is taught , hut the elements of science , and . modern languages . Nor are those educated in it intended for what are called the " teamed professions . " They are designed chiefly to hecorne merchatits , mechanics , and English te-cliers . Notwithstanding this , we are told that when they meet , as they sornetinses do , the popits of Harvard , in any form of intetlectual strife , they occupy no inferior ground , hitt appear to great advantage . No stranger can tcti , except , perhaps , from an occasional scrap of Greek or Latin , who is from the " l1i*h School , " atid who from the University . We douht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English and scientific education , will he made in New-England , where most of our important improvements begiD . And we deem it exceedingly desirable that it be made soon . // number of able professors , and all the necessary means of instruction , where nothing would be taught but modern science and modern language . But they should be taught in perfection . We believe that such an institution would be amply patronized , and would produce in time the happiest effects . The experiment would at least solve the problem , How far a knowledge of Greek and Latin is indispensable as an element of a liberal education ? and the solution would be useful , by settling a controversy , which , without the experiment , threatens to be interminable . Finally ; were the Greek and Roman nations now in existence , possessed of no more knowledge than they had , during their most enlightened periods , they would be much more benefited , by studying modern languages , for the sake of science , than the moderns are , by studying theirs , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be their own opinion ; and their conduct would conform to it . Thus would the current of education be reversed , the less enlightened people being no longer considered a models for the more enlightened to imitate.
