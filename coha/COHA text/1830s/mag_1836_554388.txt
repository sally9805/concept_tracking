" My little bird , thou speak'st not true , A lie hast thou no'v said ; For see , I am a maid in love , And am not pale , but red . " Take care , my bird ; because thou liest , I now must punish thee ; I take this gun , I load this gun , And shoot thee from the tree .

N'iebuhr the Historian , during a Residence with him in . Rome , in the Years 1822 and 1823 . By FRANCIS LIEBER , Professor of History and Political Economy in South Carolina College . Philadelphia . Carey , Lea , &amp; Blanchard . 1835. l2mo. pp. 192 . IN the last Number of this journal some account was given of the iirincipal facts in Mr. Niebuhr 's life , together with an extended analysis of his great work on Roman History . It may not be uninteresting to the readers of that article to have some notice of Mr. Lieher 's Reminiscences of the opinions , // character , and appearance of so remarkable a man , laid before them . The author of this little volume has been well known in the United States , during several years past , for the variety and extent of his attainments , and his indefatigable literary activity . His edition of the " Conversations-Lexicon , " is a proud monument of learning , enterprise , and industry . His " Stranger in America " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , communicated in a style of uncommon liveliness and piquancy ; and his volume on education , submitted to the trustees of the legacy of the late Mr. Girard for a college in Philadelphia , shows a familiarity with the details of the science of instruction , which justifies the confidence that the governors of South Carolina College have lately reposed in him , in calling him to one of the most important chairs in that institution . These " Reminiscences " are extremely interesting and instructive . Thcy carry on their face marks of their entire fidelity ; and being , as tl ) ey are , records of the historian 's opinions and feelings , expressed in the ease and familiarity of domestic life , they give us more insight into his real character , than could be obtained from many a volume of much higher l ) retel ) sions . The value of such works does not consist wholly , or even mainly , in the importance of the opinions they record . A great man must he supposed to talk , in his moments of relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small men ; he probably says many things , which it would not severely task the intellect of a very ordinary personage to utter ; and yet these subjects and these sayings , when connected with the daily life of an illustrious man , acquire an interest wholly aside from their intrinsic importance . WIen , during Dr. Johnson 's Highland tour , the sooty blacksmith bounced out of bed for the accommodation of the sage aud his trusty squire , the event was by no means an extraordinary one ; yet , when it came to be related afterwards , first in English , and secondly in Johnsonese , it became almost as renowned in literary history as any event in the life of the great lexicographer himself . Indeed it is unreasonable to insist upon a great man 's always playing the great man 's part . A king can not always wear his robes of state ; he must have his hours of amusement , when he may chat with his friends , or ride a hobbyhorse with his children . And a great author must be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never got into type . His sentences can not always be rounded with rhetorical elegance and precision ; his thoughts can not always be thoroughly reasoned and oracularly delivered ; and it is precisely these exhibitions of his mind , in this unbended state , which are most attractive . We know , from his elaborate works , the grasp and power of his intellect ; the variety and depth of his learning ; the purity , elegance , and eloquence of his style . But the minute shades of his intellectual character ; the tenderness of his domestic feelings ; his whims , prejudices , eccentricities , which all take delight in knowing , we can only know through the medium of correspondence and reminiscences like these before us . But yet the familiar conversation of a great man will display at times his superiority over other men . The conversational talents of the late Sir James Mackintosh and Mr. Coleridge have acquired a well-merited and universal celebrity . Who has not heard of Dr. Johnson 's eulogy on Burke , that no man could step under a shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that he was the greatest man in England ? The scholar 's daily discourse will have a tincture of learning , the philosopher 's conversation will take a speculative turn , and the poet will adorn his most careless talk with the graces of imagery and sentiment . Somethnes , indeed , the excitement of conversation between congenial spirits draws out flashes of wit , of poetry , of wisdom , and of eloquence , which surpass in beauty the graver and more sustained productions of the closet . If these could all be transferred glowing with the warmth of excited feeling , and fresh from the talker 's lips , to the printed page , they would form a far more interesting chapter in the history of the human mind , than the cautiously weighed , coolly expressed convictions of private study . But as this can never be wholly done , and not often partially , we must be content with such scattered notices of eminent men as the memory of friends , and the letters of contemporaries , can furnish . Even Boswell 's admirable records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that great man 's life , and his work is incomparably the best , the most minute , and the liveliest book in that branch of literature . But to return to our author . He had an excellent opportunity of becoming familiarly acquainted with the moral and intellectual character of the great historian . It appears from the // Introduction that Mr. Lieber , animated , in common with many of his young countrymen , by a lively enthusiasm in the cause of struggling Greece , had engaged in her service in 1821 . Being disappointed in his hopes , and finding it impossible to remain , he was obliged to return in the following year . He accordingly took passage at Missolunghi , in a vessel bound to Ancona , having only one scudo and a half , after paying his passage . In this almost destitute condition , he was detained some time by quarantine regulations on the coast of Italy . Remembering that a friend of his had devoted himself to the fine arts , he immediately addressed a letter to him in Rome , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always found among fellow-students . Another difficulty was still to be surmounted ; when he applied to the police-officer to sign his passport to Rome , he was informed that orders had been received that no passport of a person returning from Greece should be signed , except for a journey home . However , he got it signed for Orbitello , a town in Tuscany , in the neighbourhood of Rome . Having succeeded thus far , he , and a Philhellenic friend in pretty much the same condition with himself , hired a vetturino , and made the best of their way to the Eternal City , which they entered without license and without obstruction . Mr. Niebuhr was , at that time , the Prussian Minister at the Papal court ; appointed by his liberal-minded monarch for the express purpose of giving him an opportunity to prosecute his historical researches with every advantage that a residence on the spot , and a high dil ) lomatic station , would afford him . Mr. Lieber determined to apply at once to his learned countryman , and to disclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome would not compel him to leave the city , until he had had time to study its antiquities as much as he wished . On his first call , he was unable to see the minister , but was treated with great kindness by the Secretary of Legation , and received , through his hands , the documents necessary to a residence in Rome , and funds to meet his immediate wants . The next day he renewed his call at the appointed hour , and received an invitation to dine with the Ambassador , the account of which , from its frankness and honesty , is at once amusing and touching . *C When I went the next morning at the appointed time , as I thought , Mr. Niebuhr met me on the stairs , being on the point // of going out . He received me with kindness and affability , returned with me to his room , made me relate my whole story , and appeared much pleased that I could give him some information respecting Greece , which seemed to be not void of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he broke off , asking me to return to dinner . 1 hesitated in accepting the invitation , which he seemed unable to understand . He probably thought that a person in my situation ought to be glad to receive an invitation of this kind ; and , in fact , any one might feel gratified in being asked to dine with him , especially in Rome . When I saw that my motive for declining so flattering an invitation was not understood , I said , throwing a glance at my dress , Really , Sir , I am not in a state to dine with an Excellency . ' He stamped with his foot , and said with some animation ) Are diplomatists always believed to be so cold-hearted ! I am the same that I was in Berlin , when I delivered my lectures : your rein ark was wrong . ' * No argument could be urged against such reasons . " I recollect that dinner with delight . His conversation , abounding in rich and various knowledge and striking observations ; his great kindness ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were so beautiful , that when , at a later period , I used to walk with them , the women would exclaim , iL-i guardate , guardate , cite angeli ! - a good dinner ( which I had not enjoyed for a long time ) in a high vaulted room , the ceilino of which was painted in the style of Italian palaces ; a picture by the mild Francia close by ; the sound of the murmuring fountain in the garden , and the refreshing beverages in coolers , which I had seen , but the day before , represented in some of the most masterly pictures of the Italian schools ; in short , my consciousness of being at dinner with Niebuhr in his house in Rome , and all this in so bold relief to my late and not unfrequently disgusting sufferings , would have rendered the moment one of almost perfect enjoyment and happiness , had it not been for an annoyance , which , I have no ( loubt , will appear here a mere trifle . However , reality often widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect for the moment become light as air , and others , shadows and vapors in reality , swell into matters of weighty consideration when subjected to the recording pen ; - a truth , by the way , which applies to our daily life , as well as to transactions of powerful effect ; - amid it is , therefore , the sifting tact which constitutes one of the most necessary , yet difficult requisites for a sound historian . // My dress consisted as yet of nothing better than a pair of unbiacked shoes , such as are not unfrequently worn in the Levant ; a pair of socks of coarse Greek wool ; the brownish pantaloons frequently worn by sea-captains in the Mediterranean ; and a bloc frock-coat , through which two halls had passed , a fate to which the blue cloth cap had likewise been exposed . The socks were exceedingly short , hardly covering my andes , and so indeed were the pantaloons ; so that , when I was in a sitting position , they refused me the charity of meeting , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brothers in Schiller 's Bride of Messina . ' There happened to dine with Mr. Neibuhr another lady 1 ) esides Mrs. Niebuhr ; and my embarrassment was not small when , towards the conclusion of the dinner , the children rose and played about the ground , and I saw my poor extremities exposed to all the frank remarks of quick-sighted childhood ; fearing as I did , at the same time , the still more trying moments after dinner , when I should be obliged to take coffee near the ladies , unprotected by the kindly shelter of the table . Mr. Niebuhr observed , perhaps , that something embarrassed me , and he redoubled , if possible , his kindness . " After dinner he proposed a walk , and asked the ladies to accompany us . I pitied them ; but as a gentleman of their acquaintance had dropped in by this time , who gladly accepted the offer to walk with us , they were spared the mortification of taking my arm . Mr. Niebuhr , probably remembering what I had said of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus walked with me for a long time . After our return , when I intended to take leave , he asked me whether I wished for any thing . I said I should like to borrow his History . ' lie had but one copy to which he had added notes , and which he did not wish , therefore , to lend out of his hou*e* but he said he would get a copy for me . As to his other books , he gave me the key of his library to take whatever I liked . He laughed when I returned laden with books , and dismissed me in the kindest manner . " - pp. 27-31 . A few days after this incident , Mr. Lieber was invited to become an inmate in Mr. Niebuhr 's house , and to undertake the instruction of his son , in which situation he remained , until Mr. Niebuhr returned to Prussia . After Mr. Lieber 's separation from the family of the historian , he kept up a friendly correspondence with him until the time of Mr. Niebuhr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niebuhr 's letters are given in the remainiug portion of the introduction , // which show their author 's character in a most favorable point of view . A judgment acute , discriminating , and cool , blended with feelings of the heart as pure and simple as those of childhood itself , is apparent on every page of them . The following is Mr. Lieber 's description of the personal appearance and some of the peculiarities of his friend . Mr. Niehuhr was small in stature , and thin his voice , of a very high pitch . lie 0001 ( 1 not see well at a distance , and made sometimes strange inista kes . Spectacles were indispensable to him and I had once to make a day 's journey in order to fetch his Dolland 's which had been forgotten . lie lived very frugally ; wine and water was his usual beverage ; he valued good wine , but did not drink it often . lIe frequently shaved while walking up and down the room ; and , when I was present , he would even talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but took snuff to such an excess , that he had finally to give it up . He ( lid not write , as the ancient scholar , a whole book with one pen ; but he used a pen a very long time before he mended it , turning it all round so as to use always its sharp point . Yet he wrote a neat an ( l legible hand . " his rare memory enabled him to study frequently without a pen ; an ( l I fund hini sometimes in a lying l ) osture on a sofa , holding the work of an ancient writer over his head . These were not works which he read by way of relaxation ; but , not unfrequently , those he studied with the keenest attention . His memory , in ( Ieed , was almost inconceivable to others He rerriembered almost every thing he had read at any period of his life . lie was about twenty years old when he studied at Edinburgh , and I was present when he conversed at Rome with an English gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English papers at the time of his residence in that country . The statement was iml ) ortant to the stranger , a member of Parliament , if 1 remember right ; and Mr. Niebuhr desired me to take pen and paper , and forthwith dictated to me a considerable column of numbers , to the great surprise of the English visitor . What an immense power such a roan would have in a deliberative assembly , merely on accou mit of his unrelaxing memory ! He did not undervalue the great importance of this faculty , which , thon*h it be but an instrument , is the most useful and indispensable of all instruments in all pursuits , disregarded by those only who have none . Nor is a retentive memory without its moral value both for individuals and nations ; and there was truth in the remark of Goethe 's friend in Strasbung , that a man with a bad memory was necessarily exposed to the vice of ingratitude. // " Mr. Niebnhr and myself had conversed one day on the great power which a man with a tenacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an array of facts and dates , though the strength of the argument may be decidedly on the other side ; and how necessary it therefore becomes to cultivate the memory . He said , Without a strong memory I never should have been able to write my History , for extracts and notes would not have been sufficient ; they would again have formed an inaccessible mass , had I not possessed the index in my mind . ' "  --  pp. 45-47 . The impression made upon the reader by the tone and spirit of this Introduction , is highly favorable to the personal characters of both the gentlemen who are concerned . The frank good nature , with which Mr. Niebuhr received the returning Phiihellene , is honorable to his heart , and shows that brilliant success in literattire , and the distinctions of high political station , had left untouched all the natural goodness of his character ; and the directness and honesty , with which the tale is told by Mr. Lieher , manifest a grateful sense of the generous conduct of his friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth . The Reminiscences extend over a great variety of subjects . Living , as the historian did , in the central scene where the great events of Roman history had taken place , and surrounded with the mouldering memorials of departed greatness , his conversation would naturally take a hue from such interesting associations . We find , therefore , in these records of his conversation , Mr. Niebtmhr 's opinions on questions of ancient history , on the history of language and philology in general , on l ) olitics , ancient an ( l modern , on topics of high literary interest , and on the distinguished personages with whom his studies or his political relations had brought him acquainted . We recognise , in all these opinions , a vigorous and enlarged intellect , enriched with vast and truly Gertnan erudition , and animated by a kindly and philosophical spirit . Though his studies principally lay among the ancients , yet he was fond of illtistrating his peculiar views by modern analogies ; and his knowledge of modern history , and of the literature contained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he used in the happiest manner . The criticisms scattered over this volume are full of good sense and impartiality . The opinions on other subjects are generally sound and weighty ; // and some of them exhibit an extraordinary depth and comprehensiveness of mind . There are some , to be sure , whose only value consists in the fact that they were the opinions of Mr. Niebuhr ; but we think Mr. Lieber quite right in inserting them . There are others , too , which show only some peculiar notion or whim of the historian ; and these have their value , according to the view we stated at the outset . They all go to furnish us with a lively idea of Mr. Niebuhr as a man . The style in which they are written , is generally very correct , idiomatic English . It is probable that the remarks lose some of their point , by the inevitable necessity , under which a translator labors , of varying the expression , and of varying familiar expressions more than any others . But notwithstanding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments of the historian , and in a manner to excite the interest of the reader to a high degree . The following opinion of the King of the Netherlands has an historical importance when taken in connexion with late political events . It shows both the good sense of the King , and the sagacity of Mr. Niebuhr . " I used to know the King of the Netherlands well , when he lived in great retirement in Berlin , after having been driven from Holland by the French . He took great interest in my History , and read and studied a good deal . He is a character of sterling worth : so is the Queen ; she is a woman of the purest character , mild and charitable . They are a couple wishing as anxiously the good of their people , as any that ever sat upon a throne . I believe there are very few women , in whatever rank of life , to be compared in excellence to the Queen of the Netherlands . The King asked my views respecting the union of Ilolland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was averse to takiwr Beloium I declared most positively that this would never do : if Belgium must be under the same sceptre with holland , they ought at least to remain separated like Norway and Sweden . There is , in fact , much more reason for separation with the Dutch and Belgians . They have nothing in " * I think t am correct in this statement ; quite sure I am , that he said he had communicated his views such as stated above to the Kin. * , which he hardly would have done had he not been asked so to do . But I think he said distinctly , that the sketch of the constitution had been shown him . I believe , moreover , that he said the King was of his opinion as to separate governments for Holland and Belgium , hut that he was outvoted by his counseltors. - The above remark was made in the year J 822. " // common ; language , religion , interests , every thing is directly opposed . The Belgians are poor copies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will end well ; I have very serious fears and misgivings . May God grant that my fears are unfounded , and my speculations will be put to nought ! " pp. 64 , 65 . Many readers will agree with the opinion of Pope 's Homer in the extract that follows . As translators , there is no comparison between Pope and Cowper , the latter of whom seems to have been unknoxvn to Niebuhr . In fact , the English themselves have never done full justice to the merits of Cowper 's version of the Iliad and the Odyssey . The melody of Pope 's versification so captivates the ear , that Cowper , though immeasurahly superior in all the important requisites of a translator , can scarcely gain a hearing . " What wisdom there is in Homer ! With a few omissions it is the very book for children . I know of no story , except Robinson Crusoe , which fascinates a child so much as Homer . It is all natural , simple , and capable of being understood by a child . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antiquity , without which we can not now get along ! How many thousand things and sayings does the child understand at once by knowing that gi*eat poem ! The whole Odyssey is the finest story for a child . " Have you ever read Pope 's Odyssey ? I answered in the negative . Well , he replied , you must read some parts of it at least ; it is a ridiculous thing , as bad as the French heroes of Greece in periwigs . There is not a breath of antiquity in Pope 's translation . He might have changed as much as lie liked , and called Jt a reproduction ; but to strip it of its spirit of antiquity , was giving us a corpse instead of a living being . It is a small thing . How totally different is the manner in which the German Voss has handled the subject . He shows at once that he knows and feels the poem is antique , and he means to leave it so . Voss s translation might certainly be improved in various parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now read by every one ; lie has done a great thiiig . You do not imagine it , yet it is a fact , that Voss 's translation of Homer has had a great influence upon your own education . I say it , well considering what I say , that time influence of the labors of Voss on the whole German nation will be so great that other nations will feel and acknowledge it . "  --  pp. 67 , 68. // Mr. Niebuhr 's remarks on handwriting are applicable to other manuscripts , as well as letters . A bad handwriting ought never to be forgiven ; * it is a shameful indolence ; indeed , sending a badly written letter to a fellow creature is as impudent an act as I know of . Can there be any thing more unpleasant , than to open a letter which at once shows that it will require long deciphering ? Besides , the effect of the letter is gone , if we must spell it . Strange , we carefully avoid troubling other people even with trifles , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or carelessness , and yet nothing is thought of giving the disagreeable trouble of reading a badly written letter . In England , good breeding requires writing well and legibly ; with us ( the Germans ) it seems as if the contrary principle was acknowledged . t Although many people may not have made a brilliant career by their fine handwriting , yet II know that not a few have spoiled theirs by a bad one . The most important petitions are frequent-. ly read with no favorable disposition , or entirely thrown aside , merely because they are written so badly . " - pp. 74 - 76 . A few more extracts , taken almost at random , must conclude our notice of this book . We can not , however , take leave of its entertaining and instructive pages , without thanking * * Mr. Niebulir wrote a peculiarly legible and fair hand ; an accomplishment of which not many German sevens can boast . " " t Writing seems to me to be just like dressino ' ; we ought to dress well aud neat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedantically fine hand show that the writer has thought more of the letters than the sense . It ought to be remembered , however , that it is far more difficult to write German characters well and legibly than Roman letters . Hence names in German manuscripts for printers are generally written with the latter . The English write best of all nations , using this alphabet ; the Americans next . The French write in general badly , especially ladies ; the Italians very poorly ; and Spaniards hardly legibly , to the great confusion of . their foreign commercial correspondents . It is curious to observe how the two last.named nations show by their handwriting that they have remained behind the general European civilization . They continue to use the contracted letters , abbreviations , and ornamental lines and flourishes , which were common with all Europeans a century ago . The art of writing has much improved during the latter centuries ; compare manuscript letters of the present day with those we have of the time of the Reformation . Nor does the progress of this art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other branches of human activity , domestic co , nfort , &amp;c . While the ancient expensive art of writing most beautifully and tastefully on parchment has fallen into disuse , the common handwriting of every man , for daily practical use , has vastly improved ; the one , expensive , and of an exclusive character , belonged to an aristocratic age ; the other is characteristic of a time of popular tendency . " // Mr. Lieber for this valuable and interesting contribution to our means of knowing , familiarly , one of the greatest and most philosophical scholars , that modern times have produced . How just are the following remarks , suggested by the death of Canova . " There is one good man less ! Canova was an excellent man , liberal in a rare degree , kind , without envy or jealousy , faithful , pious , and of a reflecting mind withal . He felt a true attachmeat to Pius the Seventh , which was probably increased by the misfortunes of the Pope and his dignified demeanor in affliction . Canova would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like his idea of making a picture for the church of the little village of his birth . Do n't you believe that such a work will of itself give certain moral dams to the whole little Possagno ? It will raise the morale of the village ; it establishes a visible connexion between the people of that obscure place and a gifted and successful man , which is leaving a great legacy . So are public statues of great moral value ; they excite , remind , teach . How very superficial are those who think they are but proofs of overwrought gratitude or flattery ! To be sure they have been abused ; what has not ? Canova was ever ready to assist and guide young artists ; and his idea of establishing prizes for the most successful among them was excellent . " - p. 128 . There is much truth in the following reflections . " There were times , iVir . Niebuhr said , when people would have considered it almost like a degradation of the ancients , had a philologer attemped to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own . The classical literature was superior to any thing modern nations had at the time of the revival of the sciences ; they therefore received every thing coming from the ancients with a reverence , which would not allow a doubt of any thing , and required no reconcilement of any contradictory statements in them . But you will observe , that , wherever a practical man , a statesman for instance , occupied himself with the classics , how differently he treated them from the schoolmaster . The latter treated the classics as if they were something entirely beyond the sphere of reality ; and this , indeed , is still the case with many . On the other hand , there is such a thing as flippant , impertinent familiarity , and such has not been very rare with the modern French before the Revolution . Its only object is to divert , from the contrast produced by a sudden comparison between the // most remote objects and those of our daily and common life . This is merely to amuse , and can amuse the little-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but that is a different thing . "  - -  pp. 137 , 138 . Mr. Niebuhr 's opinion on the pronunciation of Latin will be interesting to classical scholars . Many will probably dissent from his view of the comparative correctness of the Italian and Spanish modes of pronouncing it . " On my question , which of the ( different ways of pronouncing Latin he thought best , he said that he had adopted the Italian pronunciation . On my farther question , Why ? he said ; " I have a number of reasons ; but in fact the counter question , Why should we not adopt the Italian pronunciation ? would be a perfectly good answer . As to the pronunciation of the c , it is clear that the Romans did not pronounce it in the German way , Tsitsero ; this is altogether an uncouth northern sound . To pronounce it like Sisero , ( with hard s , ) is equally wrong ; no inscription or other trace induces us to believe that the Romans used c as equivalent to s . Besides , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronunciation of the vernacular tongue , it is preposterous to maintain that one or the other is the correct pronunciation , except the pronunciation of the Italian itself . That the g was not pronounced hard as the German , * seems clear from the fact , that most nations pronounce it soft . On the whole , Latin reads much better in the Italian way ; and I think many passages of the poets require this pronunciation to receive their full value . People ought to agree to adopt this pronunciation ; for it is too ridiculous to find the same language pronounced differently in every country , and subjected to all the caprices of the various idioms . The Spaniards sometimes claim to he , by way of tradition , in possession of the true Roman pronunciation . It is equally preposterous , that they whose language is so much more mixed , and whose country was never more than a province , should have retained a better pronunciation than the people of the mother country ! Italian is still , in a degree , a Latin dialect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
