txt The word Sylva can never be pronounced , without recalling the memory of Evelyn , who , retired and unambitious as he was , has long been numbered among the benefactors of mankind . It was no small service , to recommend the cultivation of ornamental trees , as a happy and elevating employment for men of leisure and fortune . Many a desolate village has been covered with beauty , and many a fiery street of the city shaded , in consequence of the enthusiasm inspired by his memory and example . Much too has been added to the glory of the visible world arid the sources of philosophical contemplation , by taking these lords of the forest from their retirement , and placing them before the eye : for what nobler object can there be , than a tree which has battled with the storms of ages , and still calmly waves from it the assault of the mightiest gales , standing in lofty independence , and throwing wide its protecting arms , as if it were offering shelter and shade to generations yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they would have little value , if regarded merely as materials and suggestions of thought ; but there are none , to whom their usefulness does not make them important . Man must resort to them to build and furnish his dwelling , and then solicit their friendly shield to defend him from the summer sun . In winter , he must resort to them again ; and they are ready to cast away their verdure to let in the sun ,  --  and to light up his dwelling with their cheerful fires ; ' like feudal vassals , willing either to live or die in the service of their chief . Even nations also // are compelled to lean their mighty arms for support upon the neglected trees of the wood ; the oaks which Evelyn planted , aided to bear the thunder of England in the bright chain of victories which ended at Trafalgar . It is consoling to think how much can be done by men in private stations for the benefit of their country and mankind . They are apt to feel as if their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their voice died away upon the air when they spoke , and they could give no impulse beyond the reach of their arm ; and yet here is an example of a man of private station and moderate fortune , who lived two centuries ago , and who is still successfully exhorting men to make themselves useful and happy in the way which he recommends , so that his advice and example are still forming characters , inspiring labors , and securing services to mankind which would otherwise be wholly lost . We should be glad to know the name of the statesman of that age , of any party , Cromwell or Clarendon , whose infiueiice is thus felt at the present day , either in the world at large , in his own country , or in any human breast . In this country , the example of Evelyn is likely to do more in future than in his own , unless some great change takes place in the internal condition of England . We are told that ten years ago there were but twenty thousand landholders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere tenants at will have no interest or ambition to plant trees , without the hope that their descendants will sit under the shade or rather , the reflection that they have no spot of crround which they can call their own , prevents their taking an interest in any kind of improvement . In this country the state of society is as different as possible : there are hardly twenty thousand in any territory of equal extent with England , who are not proprietors of land , or freeholders . There the nobility and gentry , if they chance to be men of taste , are too much engrossed with politics , or the pleasures of the capital , to find much gratification in pursuits of this kind ; there are some who set a worthy example , but there can not be many to follow it . The success of Sir Henry Stuart , in Scotland , who converted a barren heath into a noble forest , might strike the imagination of thousands ; but the great proportion of those who would be most desirous to imitate him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient for a grave . Owing // to our different circumstances , we are confident that such writers will do more for this country than their own . Our climate is more favorable to this kind of vegetation ; we need it to generate and preserve moisture , and to shelter us from our summer suns , which burn with fiercer heat ; we have more room to allow them , and our forests are so crowded , that there is less temptation to hew it down for the fires . But all such considerations are less effectual , than the pride which every man feels in his own paternal acre . Even if he have but one , he desires to have it such as to attract the passing stranger 's eye , and to bear a comparison with the estate of his richer neighbor in taste and beauty . We speak of the natural tendency to improvement ; we do not mean to say that this taste is by any means universal , even in this portion of our land . The suggestion of Cicero , that every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as elsewhere . He is therefore willing to plant his field or garden , from which he can reap the fruit , while he feels less inducement to plant trees which he may never live to enjoy . We have inherited little taste of this kind from our fathers . Besides that their whole life was a warfare with the forest , and that land was not considered cleared till it was bare as the sea-shore , it was evidently no particular object for them to cultivate trees near their mansions , as a convenient stalking-horse for the Indian marksman . Their children , as a matter of course , fQllowed their example , though the necessity for it no longer *existed . Even now , the pioneer of civilization begins his jn*rovements , as he calls them , by cutting down every tree within gunshot of his dwelling ; and when , at length overpowbred by the solicitations of his wife or daughter , he reluctantantly proceeds to plant , the result of his labors appears in a few long leafless poles , standing in solemn uprightness waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficiently evident that a better taste is growing among us , owing partly to the exertions of individuals , and partly to the natural tendency of growing prosperity and ambition . Our forests offer us treasures , such as few lands can rival and none can possibly exceed . We are told that in the United States there are one hundred and forty species of forest trees of the larger size , while in France there are but thirty of the same description , of which eighteen enter into the composition of the forests , and seven only are employed in building . The wild splendor of our // woods in autumn , their green lights and shadows in spring , the heavy grandeur of their evergreen masses with the snow above them in winter , or the fine outline of their naked arms against the sky , never fail to strike the most careless observer of nature : interest follows the first emotions of surprise ; that interest deepens as he becomes acquainted with the wondrous revelations which science opens in every plant that the earth bears , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of heaven . And this is easily accomplished ; for though , as Evelyn says , the aspen takes it ill to have his head cut off , ' this is not the case with most other trees , which submit to the operation with perfect indifference , and even after being mangled in root , branch , leaf and flower , will flourish and reward the hand that transplants them . Or , if his native trees are too common to be beautiful in his eyes , he has only to send to foreign countries , and as there are few trees like the home-sick palm-tree , which will not quit its place of birth , ' they will come , regardless of the voyage , and grow contentedly in a climate very different from their own . This interest , so easily satisfied , when once awakened is not likely to decline , and this labor is suited to prevail extensively , because , like virtue , it is its own direct , immediate and sufficient reward . But apart from the interest which an employment of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong hold on the affections : man learns to love his contemporary trees . We have often thought that the mysterious feeling awakened in the Swiss soldiers by hearing the Ranz des Vaches*. was owing to the distinctness with which the strong feat*e.s of their native scenery were impressed upon their minds : the frowning rock , the dashing river , the cloudy ridge were cle*c and visible forms in their memory , and the breath of a song was sufficient to touch the delicate spring , and make the whole vision start up into their souls . In the same way the memory of the absent fastens itself to the tree which shaded his father 's door , which still retains all its greenness in his imagination , though the children who once played in careless happiness beneath it have long since been separated , both in place and heart and the aged man who sat in his arm-chair , looking thoughtfully upon them , has long ago rested in the grave . We may any where observe that natives of places which have any remarkable objects of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in their home , and far more interest // in public improvement , than those who have no such landmarks for the memory : for example , the elm on the common of our city , which is said to have been carried there on a man 's shoulders in 1721 , is now not more deeply covered with foliage than with venerable and pleasing associations . The fact is that these must be the monuments of our country . Mrs. Trollope , disappointed at not meeting with Parisian manners in our western steam-boats , looked out for baronial castles upon the Alleghany mountains , and was indignant to find that no such vestiges of civilization appeared . Doubtless we should rejoice to have them ; but since the privilege is denied us , we do as well as we can without them . But this defect , great and serious as we confess it is , can not reasonably be charged upon popular institutions ; and the pious thankfulness which she expresses at being delivered from republicanism , is like that of a soldier in our late war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked that he was devoutly grateful that he had not a low-crowned hat on , as in that case the ball would have gone directly through his head . These things are evidently chargeable to circumstances over which we have no control . And yet had we such ornaments on every height , we fear that too many who regard comfort more than taste would remark , like her countryman at Rome , that the ruins were much in need of repair . ' But we must endeavor to prepare ourselves against the coming of all future Trollopes , by providing such monuments as our forlorn condition admits not such as the elements of nature waste , but such as they strengthen and restore . Almost all other monuments leave us in doubt whether to regard them as memorials of glory , or of shame . The Chinese wall is a monument of the cowardice and weakness of those who raised it : they built walls , because they wanted hearts to defend their country . The Pyramids of Egypt are monuments certainly of the ignorance , and most probably of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a corrupt religion , and the same baronial castles , the want of which we never deplored till now ; are monuments of a state of society in which every thing was barbarous , and are witnesses by their still existing , that the art of war , the only science thought worth regarding , was but wretchedly understood . To us it seems that Chaucer 's oak and Shakspeare 's mulberry-tree , the oak of Alfred at Oxford , and the one in Torwood forest , under which Wallace first gathered // his followers in arms , are as worthy and enduring memorials of great names and deeds , as any that can be hewn from the rock and built by the hands of men . The tower , as soon as it is completed , begins to decay ; the tree , from the moment when it is planted , grows firmer and stronger for many an age to come . We are the more earnest to recommend this cultivation to our readers , because in this country it can seldom be more than an incidental employment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it the great business of their lives . We are often told that this was the employment of man in paradise : it was so , but those who say it should remember , that the air of paradise did not prove favorable to moral energy and virtue ; it was made clear , in the case of our first parents , that a state of peaceful enjoyment and unmixed prosperity will never answer for man . He must have labor of body and mind ; he must have duties and trials ; he must associate with his fellows , in the race with the swift , and the battle with the strong ; he must have his powers unfolded in the broad sunshine of social life , and his feelings disciplined by those disappointments and sorrows which abound in the places where man contends with man , before he can ever become that useful , happy and glorious being which our religion tends to form . We do not recommend this cultivation , therefore , as an epicurean indulgence , but rather as the employment of hours which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aye sticking in a tree whei-i ye have naething else to do , ' he probably , considering the habits of his son and heir , thought it equivalent to a charge to make it the business of his life . We would give the same advice to our readers , understanding , however , that they have other employments , like Evelyn , who , though in a private station , was one of the most active and useful men of his day . We would not say that this cultivation is more important than that of fruit trees , but they carry their own recommendation with them : the most unrelenting destroyers of forest trees spare the others , because they can be of service only when living , and are of no value in the market when dead . The virtues of the trees of the forest are not felt by all , though they are open to every eye . The cultivation of fruit trees is left to the care of men , because they have an inducement to engage in it which can be universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the apple-seed , which can not // spread without human care they are meant to be gathered , and not to vegetate beneath the tree on which they grew ; while the trees of the forest , which would be less likely to find friendly hands to render them this service , are provided for by the parental care of nature ; their seeds are light , easily dislodged from the tree , in some instances provided with wings to bear them away on the winds of heaven , where they can be arrested in their flight , borne down to the earth , and beaten into the ground by the summer shower . The difference in their forms is also well worth observing . The trees which offer their fruits to men are generally low and easily climbed ; they grow with less t9wering height and less gigantic proportions : while the trees of the forest , which stoop to no burdens , rise and spread , as if glorying in their independence of man . It may generally be ohserved , also , that the law of compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flowers of the field are more beautiful than the vegetables of the garden ; and , in like manner , the difference between the trees of the forest and those of the garden is that of sovereigns and slaves . As much interest as could be expected or desired is now taken in the cultivation of fruit trees , and it will soon be well rewarded . Evelyn expressed a wish , that every man might be compelled by law to set out fruit trees on the borders of the public roads , for the benefit of the wayfarers ; but there is much reason to doubt , whether this class of worthies would confine themselves within the limits indicated by the law of Moses , reasonable as it is : when thou comest unto thy neighbor 's vineyard , thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at pleasure , but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel ; ' or rather , they might be too much taken up with obeying the first of these provisions to pay much attention to the last . We shall be content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not lead them into temptation , and will offer a still more abundant shade . We are glad to see works offered to the public , which call their attention to the subject ; and since the great point is to excite a general interest in it , the author judges well , who calls attention to the whole subject ,  --  to the physiology , as well as cultivation of trees . To study Botany according to the common practice , is an inversion of the order of nature ; some knowledge of the organization of plants is absolutely necessary to prepare the student to pursue the study with interest and // success : and it is well known to those who have paid any attention to the subject , that all the improvements in the practical department , in successful planting and cultivation , have been made by men who were most intimately acquainted with vegetable physiology ; who knew the use and importance of the various parts and organs , the nature and effects of soil , climate and season , and various other circumstances which require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown or disregarded . Nothing can be more grotesque and inhuman than the common process of a husbandman in transplanting a tree . His first step is to behead it , which , however intended , is an act of kindness to put it out of its pain : he then deprives it of the organs of respiration , both buds and leaves ; and last of all buries the root with as much haste and carelessness as if it were one of the cholera victims . So wonderful an exploit was it considered , to preserve the spark of life in a transplanted tree , that , as some of our readers may remember , a worthy in this region many years ago became celebrated for his powers , being supposed to have some gift of nature , like Sullivan for horse-breaking , or Prince Hohenlohe for healing . Every tree was supposed to gain life and vigor from his touch ; and such was the fame of his success , that he was summoned to all parts of the State , to practise in these desperate cases . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , he revealed his secret to a friend , and it appeared that his miraculous power in saving trees from death , consisted in rescuing them from the hands of their murderers . He did not suffer the tree to be deprived of its bead , so important a part of the system of all living things ; he gave a decent burial to the roots , and secured the stem by a stake from being shaken by the xvinds ; but , more than all the rest , he was careful never to undertake the important trust except when the wind was west and the moon was new . We do not consider the astronomical and meteorological part of his prescriptions quite so essential as he did , but we would recommend an acquaintance with vegetable physiology as essential to success . How little this is generally understood , any one may ascertain by a few inquiries of those whose business makes them familiar with the woods . We remember once requesting an individual who had passed his life among trees , to take a basket and gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of forming a small plantation. lie seemed doubtful for some time whether the request was made in // jest or earnest ; and at last confessed that he had passed thirty years of his life , without knowing till that moment that the elm had any seed . Beside the importance of this study just alluded to , it is a delightful one even for those who have no practical acquaintance with trees ' it contains some of the most wonderful marks of design and preparation , of Divine creative skill and seemingly intelligent action , where there is no mind within to direct it , which can be found in any part of nature , eloquent and ample as it is in its testimony to Him who made it . We shall not enter into the comparison between the properties of plants and the instinct of animals , our knowledge of both being quite too imperfect ; but to us , whether from accidental prejudice or not we can not say , none of the contrivances of the animal world seem so surprising , as the manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are able to gather food for their subsistence , to protect and restore themselves from Injury , to prepare for all the changes of season and climate , and at the same time to exert a constant action for the benefit of man , and in fact of all nature . The root , for example ,  - -  nothing can be more surprising than the manner in which it forms itself and spreads , so as to give the tree precisely the support and subsistence which it requires . If the soil or season be dry , it increases its nourishment by throwing out more fibres . The fibres themselves turn and move in the direction where moisture is most readily found , so that in the well-known instance of the plane-tree mentioned by Lord Kaimes , the roots actually descended the wall from a considerable height , in order to find subsistence in the ground below . The fihres continually suck from the soil with their spongy mouths water impregnated with whatever substances the tree requires ; and even after the stem is dead , they continue this action for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may accelerate their decay . The manner in which the stem rises and hardens itself to resist the elements , is equally striking . The new wood of the sapling is compressed by the new layer which covers it in each succeeding year , being thus compelled to shoot upwards , and at the same time to grow firm and strong . While the wood is thus formed hy accessions from without , the bark increases by layers from within , which swell it till it bursts , and becomes the rough external garment of the tree . The new layers of wood contain the channels through which sap is conveyed to // the leaves , like blood to the lungs of man . The leaves , formed of the fibres of the stem spread out and connected by a delicate net-work of green , are filled with veins and arteries , through which the life-blood flows . They are formed in the summer , to expand in the following year ; packed up in their buds with wonderful neatness and precision , covered with brown scales to preserve them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coated with varnish , which excludes the air and moisture through the season of danger , and melts in the warm sun of the next year 's spring , allowing the verdure to break forth at once and cover the tree . The early sap steals up the moment the sweet influences of Pleiades loose the bands of nature . When this has opened the buds and nourished the young leaves , the maturer sap rises , holding the food of the tree in solution , and passes directly to the leaves . These retain what they want and dismiss the rest by evaporation , which , like the insensible perspiration of man , is necessary to the health of the tree , but can not take place without the friendly action of the sun . In the leaves , the sap is prepared to form part of the substance of the tree , and is then distributed by vessels passing principally through the bark and partly through the latest formation of wood . It is from this returning sap , that the various gums and similar substances drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human system are secreted from the blood . The manner and effect of respiration through the leaves , is not the least singular part of these operations . They absorb oxygen from the atmosphere during the night , to combine with the carbon in the sap and convert it into carbonic acid ; the action of the light decomposes the acid , and , while the carbon is deposited in the returning sap , the oxygen is exhaled in the air . This is only returning what the leaves had borrowed from the air : it however would be sufficient to prevent injurious effects from vegetation , similar to those which animals suffer from the air which they have breathed in a confined room for any length of time ; and it shows that the presence of plants , though injurious in the hours of darkness , is perfectly harmless throughout the day . So far from being deleterious in its effects , the respiration of plants , of the million trees , herbs and flowers is actually beneficial to the air : they are constantly purifying the atmosphere , tainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of decay . For the oxygen they give to the air is not merely // what they borrowed : they repay the debt with interest . The oxygen , which was drawn from the soil in the sap , is exhaled at the same time with the other . It is matter of wonder to notice the effects produced both by its presence and departure . When it is exhaled in the sunshine , the carbon , deposited in the leaf and combining its dark blue with the yellow tissue , produces green , from the first pale tinge of spring to the rich deep summer shade ; and when , as in the closing year , the leavcs absorb oxygen by night , and lose the power of exhaling it by day , it destroys the green and produces the wild and fanciful wreaths by which autumn veils for a season the sad reality of its decay ;  --  a splendid confusion of tints which is seen to more advantage in our country than in any other , and is not the least part of the beauty by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe the manner in which trees , as the year declines , prepare themselves to resist the cold and to battle with the winter storms . They seem like vessels closing their ports , tightening their cordage , and taking in their sails , when only the veteran seaman would know that a tempest is on the way . They drop their leaves , bind close their trunks and suspend their vital movements , as soon as they hear the first whispers of the gale . The substance of the tree retains an even temperature throughout the year : it draws the sap from *t depth , where it is colder in summer and warmer in winter than the external soil . The bark , too , a slow conductor of heat , serves to retain its warmth ; and the tree seems to make this preparation , as if it knew that , should the cold penetrate and burst its vessels , it will surely die . It gets rid of its superfluous moisture as soon as possible , the danger of frost being increased in proportion to the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sad experience of the last winter , a sudden cold after a wet season is very apt to be fatal ; but , except in extraordinary times , they contrive to secure themselves so effectually , that the severest winter can not destroy them . Meantime the fallen leaves , unlike all other vegetable decay , seem to aid in purifying the air . Any one who has walked through a forest after the fall of the leaf , must have observed the sharp peculiar smell of its decay . In short , every thing about these lords of the wood is striking to a thoughtful mind . Their graceful and majestic f*rrns are pleasing to the eye ; their construction and internal action excite the curiosity // and worthily employ the mind ; they breathe health and fragrance upon the air , and in many , probably many yet undiscovered ways , declare themselves the friends of man . We will not dwell further on particulars of this kind , which many of our readers already know , though they well deserve attention ; hut we can urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if xve show what is done for them by the liberal care of nature . And this appears in the manner in which the seeds of trees preserve their living principle , and resist decay . They may be transported to any distance , and preserved for almost any length of time . This , however , is not peculiar to the seeds of trees ; those of frailer plants are equally suited in this respect to the convenience of man . If buried too deep in the ground for the heat to act upon them , they do not vegetate ; but if , years after , accident brings them nearer the surface , they are ready to spring and grow . This is often seen in gardens , where long-lost plants are recovered in this way ; and fields , where grain has not been sown for nearly half a century , have been covered with it in consequence of being ploughed deeper than usual . We are told that wheat , taken from an Egyptian mummy , has vegetated and is now growing ; and even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed , has grown readily after having been preserved in a similar way for not less than two thousand years . It is in this way , undoubtedly , that we must account for the fact which has been thought so difficult to explain , that when a forest is cleared away in the summary manner so common among us , it is succeeded by an entirely different growth . The seeds must have remained treasured under the soil ,  --  a benevolent provision of nature , to cover the place with verdure , as fast as man makes it a desolation . And the same kindness appears in the provision made for the geographical distribution of trees . We have already alluded to the winged seeds , which any one may observe in the plane-tree , or in fact in most of the trees of the wood . Elevated as they are , the wind acts freely upon them , and bears them in every direction . Birds also are the means of distributing many which could not be dispersed in the air : they swallow the berries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their flight , that young grapes are sometimes found in the crops of pigeons , caught here at a season when our vines are hardly in leaf . The trees often seen growing where no human hand could have // planted them , are generally such as have been sown by birds . Tavernier remarks , that birds from distant islands swallow tbe ripe nutmeg , and throw it up undigested ; so that a tree springs from , it , more luxuriant than such as are planted by human hands . All animals bear a part in this great work of nature . The Indians believed that the squirrel employed bis leisure hours in planting nuts for the benefit of man . Mice are equally philanthropic and unwearied in their exertions . It would be a shame to men , if they should do nothing for themselves , when all nature , living or inanimate , is thus engaged in their service . Trees transplanted from one soil and climate to another require care undoubtedly , but they will do much to naturalize themselves . Men certainly have done something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perfect success . Though Providence has given to every region the vegetation most essential to its wants , a great proportion has been added to every civilized country by human care . Ca*sar is said to have brought the chestnut from Sardis into Europe , an act by which he rendered more service to mankind , than by all his battles and victories . Many of the finest of our ornamental trees were originally imported ; as for example , the Chinese Ailanthus , which endures our severest winters without protection . But so long as the treasures of our own forests are neglected , we would not recommend to our readers to go abroad for that variety which they can easily find at home . They can follow the example of the old British planters , and search out the virtues of what they already possess . The loppings and leaves of the Elm , ' says one of them , when dried in the sun , are preferred to oats , by cattle . ' Beech leaves , gathered about the fall , before they are much frost-bitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The keys of the ash , when young and tender , make a delicate pickle ; its bark is the best for tanning nets , its wood for drying herrings and for burning in a lady 's chamber . ' There are many discoveries yet to be made , by which attention may be rewarded . The manner in which the wants of men are provided for is finely illustrated in this department of nature . Every thing appears when and where it is wanted . Sharon Turner has pointed out a pleasing instance of this in tbe sacred history of the world . Seeds , as is well known to cultivators , vegetate best in darkness , and till this change is commenced , are injured if not destroyed , by the presence of the sun . Accordingly , in // the history of creation , we find what would generally be thought an inversion of the order of nature : the vegetation is said to have begun before the sun made its first appearance in the sky ; that luminary was not created till its action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prospective care may be found in our country , where great changes are crowded into narrow spaces of time . When civilized man first came to these regions , the forests were ready to feed his gigantic fires ; and the same process which was necessary to clear the land for cultivation supplied him with comfort for his miserable dwelling , which could hardly be warmed by any thing less than a conflagration . Before the field could be subdued , the forests abounded with game , and the rivers with fish . But the moment these resources were no longer needed for food , the beasts began to retire from the forests and the fish from the streams , as a sort of intimation to man , that they supported him only so long as he could not live by his own exertions . And now , in the populous parts of our country , where the hands of all can be profitably employed and such resources would be no better than temptations , there is nothing left to invite or reward any sportsman , save only the forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the banks of the fabled river below , exulting in a nibble and beside himself with joy at the capture of a minnow . But civilization diminishes the wood ; and then , those who spend fortunes in the discovery of expedients for cheap fuel ,  --  who , as was said of Count Rumford , will not be content till they can cook their dinner with the smoke of their neighbor 's chimney , ' though they do not often benefit themselves , certainly aid to prevent ravages and waste of the woods . Meantime the treasures of coal begin to come to light ; not perhaps in every part of the country , but where they are within the reach of all ; for the free communication which all public improvement requires between all parts of the land demands its rail-roads and canals , and does not cease till the boat or the car can lay down its burden almost at every man 's door . It would seem , from the accounts of geologists , that we are indebted to vegetation for a great proportion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peat bogs of Scotland and Ireland , the remains of large trees are very abundant : they must have originally fallen with age , and by damming streams , made the soil unfit to support vegetation ; // so that whole forests fell and were buried under gradual accumulations of vegetable matter . When the levels of Hatfield Chase were drained , vast numbers of trees of all kinds were found buried under the soil , which were overthrown probably by the Romans , in order to drive out the natives who had taken shelter in them . In the peat mosses of Scotland , the pines which have been buried for ages , embalmed in their turpentine , retain their freshness ; similar remains are found in various parts of England . In many of these bogs are seen the marks of successive formations : the oak is found in the lowest stratum , and in some parts of Scotland , where at the present day oaks are dwarfish if they grow at all , they are found of This stratt very large dimensions . *m of peat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second stratum , there is a much greater variety of wood ; but birch and hazel are the prevailing kinds . Where there is a third stratum , the principal portion of the wood is alder . Though the peat is but little valued in this country where other fuel still abounds , there are regions in which it is very important ; and we find , according to the suggestion we have made , that in countries where woods have been wasted so that now they are almost gone , and where the transportation of coal would be expensive , if possible , these remains of ancient forests have been kept by the arrangement of Providence , as a buried treasure , within the reach of man 's wants , but safe from his devastations . Many of our readers know that coal , with the exception of anthracite , is supposed also to be of vegetable origin . Geologists are not agreed upon this subject ; but in some formations there are evident remains of vegetable matter , and some believe they can trace the successive changes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal formations are the peat bogs of the ancient world , which had become inundated with sea water . The fossil peat , he says , differs from coal only in not having been mineralized , and not having ferruginous masses in the strata above it . It is believed that the same action of water which changed vegetable matter into peat , can , after considerable time , produce the further change to bitumen , and that the whole process can be traced from the vegetable to peat , peat to lignite , and lignite to coal . Thus it appears , that a great proportion of men are now making use of the remains of an earlier vegetation , which has been preserved for their benefit by the unmerited liberality of nature . // We say the unmerited liberality of nature , because men are strangely wanting to themselves in these respects . It is natural enough , that the first settlers of a forest region should take summary measures to clear the soil for cultivation ; but to keep up a wild waste , both with axe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so natural for those who have common sense to govern their actions . The western hunters , who would kill the buffalo for his tongue , are not more merciless than the lumberers ' of Canada . A party engaged in a lumbering expedition provide themselves with axes , provisions , and cattle , and proceed to the spot eh&amp;senfhr their winter encampment , which of course is established where the pine timber most abounds . Here they build their log-hut in the usual extemporaneous manner , with a hole in the roof for a chimney , and pine branches for beds , on which they sleep with their feet towards the fire . The person employed as cook , provides the breakfast before day-light , if that name can be given to the meal , which they never partake till they have paid their morning devotions to the bottle . After breakfast , they separate into gangs , one of which cuts down the trees , another hews them , and the third conveys them to the water . Thus they are employed , till the streams are swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the logs into rafts , and are compelled to be so much in the water that they contract a determined hostility to that element , which lasts as long as they live . This however is not very long ; for their employment is almost as fatal to themselves , as to the trees they hew . Parties of this kind are fast destroying the best vegetation of the northern forests ; but careless as they are , they are not half so destructive as the clearing fires . Kindled without regard to any thing beyond the immediate purpose of clearing a few acres , it does not occur to the engineer , that it may possibly spread beyond them ; he takes it for granted that the fire , like the other agents he employs , will be likely to do less rather than more than he requires . Thus it often spreads into a conflagration which the floods can not drown , and the growth of centuries sinks in a day , a scorched and blackened ruin . This process is conducted on a smaller scale , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to future wants , but simply because less is left to destroy . Even now , whoever visits the northern parts of New England at certain seasons , is almost sure to see flames climbing the // 1832 . Amer*c*n Forest Trees . hill sides , and long red lines of fire reflected in the waters by night . Beside the vast tracts of forest , which are thus perhaps necessarily sacrificed ,  --  beside the immense quantities of wood , annually built up in houses and vessels and consumed in fires , our steamboats are every year increasing in numbers , and making vast demands upon the forests of the country . And yet , though the remark is frequently made , that all this must have an end , no one ever seems to feel that our forests are not inexhaustible . In the reign of Edward first , the nobility of England , whose delicate senses were offended by the use of coal , procured an order from the King that nothing but wood should be used . Perhaps at that day , such an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period since , when the comfort , prosperity , and even existence of England , have not rested upon her mineral treasures . The time must come , when our drafts upon the forests of our country must be dishonored , unless some attention is paid to this neglected subject . Wood must be used for various purposes , which anthracite coal has not yet been found to answer . If many tracts , which are now given to unprofitable cultivation , were allowed to cover themselves with this vegetation again , the husbandman might labor to more advantage in narrower bounds , and the country would not be obliged to give up an article , the want of which it would be extremely difficult to supply . Some other countries , which have begun to feel the inconveniences of this privation , have bestowed a degree of attention upon this subject , which would seem incomprehensible to many of our countrymen . The Germans have established forest schools , in which are taught all things relating to this kind of vegetation , and the culture and management of forest trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us at present , at least upon a similar scale ; for the Germans , thorough in every thing , include a considerable range of sciences in the forester 's education , embracing not only what are indispensable , but all that can aid him in his pursuits ; whereas among us , an acquaintance with the art of wood-chopping would be the only qualification required by public opinion . In France , where the forests supply nearly all their fuel in the form of wood or charcoal , a very rigid system of economy is enforced by law . In England , during the existence of the Republic , the forests were hewn down without mercy , and sold by men in power for their own advantage ; in France , on the contrary , during // the Revolution , the public forests escaped the fury of the storm . In consequence of their enactments , and the strictness with which they are observed , it is calculated that the supply will always equal the demand . In England , this matter is left to individuals , with the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in this country also , the only way to produce a change in this respect , is to impress the necessity of such attention upon the people at large . Our government has lately shown some little regard to the preservation of timb3r . It is said that every ship of the line requires all the good wood which can be found on fifty acres of woodland . As the ships decay long before the forest can grow again , and our navy must he constantly increasing , it is certainly time that something efficient should be done . Our government , however , is a mere expression of the popular sentiment ; and unless some conviction of the necessity of care should generally prevail , it is in vain to expect our rulers to regard such matters . Even if they should , they have no power to compel : the individual must he wrought upon by a regard to the public good ; a principle , which acts but seldom and sparingly , unless connected with some small hope of personal advantage . There are many who show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who said , that he should think it time to do something for posterity , when posterity had done something for him . The husiness of cultivating trees and supplying their places as they are cut away , is not one that can be wholly left to nature ; for , liberal as she is , she seems sometimes to grow weary cf offering her bounties where there are non*e to regard them , or none who will regard them . Forest trees , hardy as they are when they have reached a considerable height , are tender in their infancy , and require considerable care . If such care is * the*r reward it liberally ; but if it is not given , there are cases in which whole forests have perished , and left a wilderness where they stood . The earth needs them to shelter it from the extremes of cold and heat , to maintain and treasure the moisture , and to produce certain changes in the air ; and wherever they perish , the earth suffers , not only their loss , but the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other kinds , to say n6thing of the loss to man . The bogs of Ireland , desolate as they are now , were once covered with wood , and the same change has taken place in Lapland and the northern islands . In America , many vast tracts at the // north , which are now desolate , were , according to Indian traditions , which there is no reason to doubt , once covered with gigantic trees . Scotland in modern times has been noted for its deficiency in this kind of verdure . When Dr. Johnson lost his walking-stick , and was assured by way of consolation that it would be found again , he refused to be comforted , thinking that no doubt it would be found , but that it was equally certain he should not find it ; for how could it be expected , that any one who had possessed himself of such a stick of timber in Scotland , could restore it ? It xvould imply supernatural virtue ; and yet , in these very regions , not only the trunks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots of large oaks and even mouldering trunks are found on the surface , where they are unacquainted with the living tree . It is believed , that not only the soil , but the climate , has suffered a serious change by reason of this loss . It probably was owing to neglect , which produces the same effects with wanton violence upon the face of nature ; and we know not why other countries may not suffer in the same way , if they do not pay some regard to these blessings , which , if divinely planted , still need the care of man . It was the apprehension with which Evelyn witnessed the waste and neglect of the English forest trees , which induced him to write his Sylva , a work which turned the public attention to the subject . The government had become alarmed at the growing want of timber , which was employed in furnaces , glasshouses and mechanical works of various kinds , when coal would have answered every purpose ; and was still more diminished by the practice of cutting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by those who would never have thought of doing any thing to supply the wants of future generations . By pointing out the wonders which were hidden in every tree ; by making men sensible of their importance to health and comfort , as well as to national defence and glory ; by showing to the eye of taste how easily it might secure perpetual gratification with small expense or labor ; by teaching rich men that here was a way in which they might secure a growing inheritance to their children , while at the same time they served others ,  --  he undoubtedly produced a vast change in the gemieral feeling , and not only prevented waste of the resources which already existed , but was the means of providing new , to meet the wants of coming ages . Though we have as yet had no one in this country to prepare a similar // work , suited to our circumstances and recommended by the authority of patient and successful example , we are ready to welcome every attempt of the kind . The work before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well planned and in many parts well executed , and we have no doubt will be widely circulated and will aid to produce the effect we are desirous to see . We hope that the time is not far distant , when the streets and squares of our cities will be crowded with forest trees , and will proudly display to the stranger how much they are indebted to our native woods ; when the resting-places of the dead , which are now too often left in a state of desertion and neglect , which offends every delicate and sacred feeling , will have trees looking down in thoughtful majesty above them ; when the roads through our country shall offer shelter and shade to the traveller , provided by the voluntary care of landholders , and not the stern compulsion of law ; when each dwelling , however humble , shall have its patriarchal tree spreading its protecting arms above it , to he hung with tender and sacred recollections , not like garlands which wither , but like the dodder on the oak , which strikes a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shall be , the change will not he more favorable to the aspect of nature , than to the character and feelings of men . This is the excellence and glory of such improvements , that man , as he becomes more refined , improves the face of nature , and nature in its turn acknowledges the obligation by softening , purifying and exalting the feelings of man . This work commences with a dissertation on Vegetable Physiology , in which the striking facts of that science are stated with clearness and precision : they are necessarily compressed into small limits , that the work might not be too large for the popular taste , but not so much condensed as to be obscure . But while some parts of the work deserve high praise , others appear as if they had been executed by a different hand . In the account of trees , for example , it is said of the White Spruce , its trunk is more tapering than the Black Spruce , and like which , is a regular pyramid , but less branching and tufted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is strange that it should not have been discovered : it is an unfortunate one , because we find shortly after , in the account of the same tree , It flowers in May and June , which are succeeded by reddish cones . ' A similar expression is repeated in the description of other // trees . We see nothing in the rest of the work , which would make us charge these things upon the author ; they appear to have proceeded from a different hand ; but as no haste in the preparation nor any other circumstance can excuse him from the responsibility , we would advise him , when this work reaches a second edition , to revise it in every part . If we believed that these things indicated the attainments of the author , we should have no hesitation in speaking of them in a tone of censure ; but as they strike us differently , though we can not account for their existence , we feel bound to say as much ; while at the same time we are aware that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader would first open , and are among the first things that would strike his eye . The author has generally followed Michaux in his account of the trees of our forest . We are much indebted to this ir*telligent foreigner , who visited America twice to complete his undertaking ; the first time as an enthusiast in science , and again in a public capacity , being employed by the French Government , with a spirit which did them honor , to explore the forest mines of our country . His work , though splendid and expensive in its execution , was extremely popular in its plan , and seems to have been prepared more with a regard to the useful arts of life than to scientific distinctions . The act of another government has thus rendered eminent service to our land . He offers hints for the improvement of our forests , by pointing out what kinds should be encouraged and what destroyed , saying , that of two tracts of forest trees , the one from which the bad sort should be cut away would be worth fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be cleared sowe years after . Neither is this a matter in which every cultivator can decide for himself , without the aid of scientific observers . We know , on good authority , that with all the their favorite tree , having mistaken the *uercus &amp;ssiflora fo* the Quercus Robur ; a serious error indeed ; for the timber of the former is loose and liable to decay , while that of the latter is the firm staff which supports the arm of English power . The meaner species is supposed to have been introduced from the continent , where most of the oaks are of that description . The Quarterly Review assures us that the impostor was vigorously propagated in the English forests , and that there was good reason to believe that the outcry respecting dry-rot , // which was constantly heard from the English dockyards , was owing to this unconscious and unhappy substitution . It is said that the real Scotch fir has been supplanted in the same way ; the seed of the spurious kind , as is usual in. such cases , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true . We know not why similar errors may not prevail among ourselves , where we are less on our guard and where there are less sagacity and skill interested to detect them . At any rate , the tree which is suited to one soil would degenerate in another , and we need the scientific observer to inform us what kinds can be cultivated to most advantage . Doubtless there are many cases , in which labor is lost and hope disappointed , by the attempt to raise plantations in soils unfriendly to them , hut favorable to some other growth ; and the mistake is not discovered till it is beyond repair , or till the hands that made it are in the dust . Among the great variety of oaks in our country , are some very beautiful and useful trees . None however , except the allimportant Live Oak , is equal to the English Oak ; and the probability is that the latter , which has been successfully introduced , will soon be extensively cultivated . We do not know that it loses any part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its leaf till December , it is ornamental through a greater portion of the year than ours . The White Oak , which most resembles the European oak , is the kind most valued for its uses . It is not equal to the Live Oak for ship-building , though it is much employed for that purpose ; but for all the ordinary demands of life it is incomparably more important , and , as usual in such cases , is more within the reach of all ; the Live Oak not being found north of Virginia , hut the White Oak growing in more or less abundance in every part of the United States . Michaux describes twenty-six species of this tree ; but so various are the popular names , one might suppose that our country afforded more than twice that number . Almost all are used for important purposes of life ; but the White Oak is most valued for fuel as well as other uses , and therefore , considering the improvident manner in which it is cut away , will cease to abound in coming years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shade , though nothing can exceed the beauty of their leaves . The reason is , that they are not easily transplanted ; and the common impression is , that their growth from the acorn is exceedingly slow . We have cultiva // ted the English Oak , which grows rapidly from the seed ; and we suspect that this is one of those prejudices which subsist for ages , because no one attempts to ascertain whether they have any foundation . Such an impression , generally prevailing , has done much to discourage the cultivation of the White Elm , which is the most graceful and majestic of our trees . White Elm we call it , in submission to Michaux , whom the author of this work has followed , though we strongly doubt whether our readers ever beard it distinguished by that name . It is better suited for ornamental purposes , because less valued for the domestic and mechanical , and because it is exceedingly rapid in its growth ; so that we have known many instances , in which those who transplanted or spared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade . The Red or Slippery Elm is also a fine tree , and as it delights in a dry station , while the other prefers a damp alluvial soil , is well calculated for places where the common elm could not be cultivated to advantage . The intervah* grounds near the Connecticut river afford some of the noblest specimens of the common elm , some of them many feet in diameter , and of the finest forms , which have risen to their . glory almost within the memory of man . This tree affords a beautiful example of the provision of nature , by which the ends of the roots , the mouths of the plant , are liberally supplied with moisture . They spread beneath the surface as far as the circle where the drooping branches lean toward the ground ; and the rain or dew which gathers on the leaves and branches is drained from the tree , and falls to the ground in the precise place where the roots are ready to receive it . Whether a tree be wanted to shade a dwelling , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we know none better suited to the purpose than this : its appearance is grand and solemn , but without gloom . The foreign elm , which is cultivated in many parts of our country , is better to shade a burial place , on account of the depth and blackness of its foliage ; and since the Weeping Willow is liable to be destroyed by our northern winters , and therefore , beautiful as it is , can not be recommended for that purpose in this region , there is no tree more proper and expressive than the foreign elm to overhang the cities of the dead . The various kinds of ash afford trees of great value , and also of beautiful foliage and forms . The Mountain Ash , which // is so generally cultivated , is of a different family , though somewhat resembling it in the quality of its wood . It was formerly in high repute as a spell against witchcraft ; but now it is valued simply for its beauty , which it retains in the desolate season of the year , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford a splendid contrast of their fiery glow with the deep and death-like shade . The White Ash is used for every purpose in which strength and elasticity are required . The Blue Ash answers similar purposes in the Western States , but is unknown along our shores . The Black Ash is a familiar tree in our Northern States , and grows abundantly in damp soils ; but being less durable than the other , is used for making potash , for which its ashes are wonderfully well adapted . The Red Ash supplies the wants of our Southern States . Perhaps it would not be well to recommend the ash as an ornamental tree ; and the same may be said of every other , the wood of which is in much demand . There are always those whose taste , if they have any , is not allowed to stand for a moment in the way of gain ; and if the father should have sufficient public spirit and refinement to plant for the benefit of his successors , his children , influenced by the most universal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily tempted to defeat his designs for the benefit of others . Avarice is as inconsistent with any cultivation or indulgence of good taste and feeling , as light with darkness , or life with death . In other countries reverence for antiquity is stronger than ours , where the same spot is seldom the residence of successive generations . Here , trees have few traditional associations to protect them , and are very easily sacrificed , unless the law of taste , enacted by public feeling , makes it barbarism and sacrilege to cut them down . The maple is the tree to which our forests are most indebted for their splendor in the decline of the year . For the reason just mentioned , the White Maple , called in the Atlantic States the Soft , and in England the Sir Wager Maple , is to be preferred as an ornamental tree ; the wood being little esteemed , and the sap , though used for sugar , being less abundant than in the other kinds , and the silvery white of the lower surface of the leaf contrasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our region confounded with the Acer Rubrum , which passes under the various names of Red-flowering , Swamp , Soft and Scarlet-flowering Maple . This latter tree is much admired in // Europe , and well deserves it . Its blossoms are among the earliest ensigns of the spring , spreading out their deep red clusters in such profusion , as to cover the tree long before a single leaf appears . The fruit which succeeds is of the same color and beauty , particularly on the banks of ponds and low grounds , where its brilliant scarlet never fails to attract the traveller 's eye : again in the autumn the same tinge dyes the fading leaves , and gives them the appearance of flames kindling along the borders of the wood . This , however , is almost too valuable for other pur-. poses to be recommended as an ornamental tree ; for , beside its general uses , which are well known , one of its varieties affords the Curled Maple , which is so much used for gun-stocks and household furniture . In old trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give the wood that wavy shade which becomes so rich under the cabinet-maker 's hands . But of all the kinds of maple , the Acer Saccliarinum is most valued , and perhaps forms the noblest tree . It is variously known by the name of Hard , Rock and Sugar Maple , in the United States , and is called Erable Sucr* by the Canadians , who were in the habit of extracting the sugar , and sending it to France to be refined , nearly two centuries ago . In order to procure the sap , the tree is bored to a small depth with an auger , and tubes are inserted , through which the sap flows into troughs or buckets ; and so abundant is it , that a tree of ordinary size will yield , in the course of the seasou , nearly thirty gallons . The most extemporaneous preparations are all that are commonly made for this operation , consisting simply of a large boiler and an axe to cut the wood . The sap is boiled with a brisk fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly supplied , till the syrup is in a state to crystallize , when it is strained and permitted to cool and harden . The molasses is made by discontinuing the boiling sooner , and in the usual way by drainings from the sugar . As the sap flows at the beginning of March , this work is done when the husbandman 's time is not required for other labor ; and it is certainly an example of the usual bounty of nature thus to supply his wants , before the increase of population and internal improvement brings the products of other countries to his door . The supply of course diminishes when no longer required , and the tree is then cultivated for its clean and cool shade , which is always beautiful , but never so striking as in the waning year . It must , however , be rescued for this purpose from the hands // of the artisan ; for beside that it affords him a variety of Curled Maple , resembling that of the Acer Rubrum , it furnishes also the Bird's*eye Maple , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibre . The Black Sugar Maple , or Sugar tree , which is often confounded with this by botanists and cultivators , does not differ from it much externally , except in the darker color of its leaves . The Mountain Maple is little more than a large shrub , and the Striped Maple , or Moose-wood , though a tree of fine appearance , is too small to be of much value either for its wood or shade . The others , when transplanted , have not so secure a hold on life as the elm , but many prefer them as affording a deeper shade . Among the fruit-bearing trees are some admirably suited to ornamental purposes , such as the chestnut , which is stately and noble , and particularly striking when its blossoms burst from their forest bowers . ' But the people of New England would as soon think , to use their ancient proverb , of employing a chestnut-burr for an eye-stone , as a fruit tree for purposes of shade . But this and the Juglans Squamosa , or Shell-bark Hickory , are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no m*terial objection to them , If the experiment were fairly tried . The latter is the common Walnut , which supplies our tables , children and squirrels . We suspect that some readers will be surprised to learn from this work that it is unknown north of Portsmouth in New Hampshire , and even there , its vegetation being impeded by the rigors of the climate , its stature is low and its fruit small . ' With due submission to Michaux , we are persuaded that we have gathered this fruit near that parallel of latitude with much satisfaction in our younger days , and climbed trees of that description considerably higher than we propose ever to climb again . It is sometimes called the Shag-bark , hut the name Shell-bark Hickory is not in common use in New England . The Juglans Gathartica , or Butter-nut , is very generally cultivated , partly for the sake of its fruit , and partly for its shade . Its branches spread in a horizontal direction to a considerable distance , and at last rest upon the ground , affording a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , completely sheltered from the sun . There are those who will have nothing but a cheerful shade ; and this is offered them by the Platanus Occidentalis , better known by the names of Sycamore or Button-wood , a tree of // vast dimensions and very rapid growth in Massachusetts , though here it never approaches the size which it reaches near the rivers of the West . Much as the Oriental Plane-tree is admired in Europe the American is thought to give a finer and more ornamental shade . But as this abounds in New England , it is less esteemed than the Liriodendron , also a tree of bright and cheerful foliage , with the additional grace of flowers . This is not common in Massachusetts , though it grows wild near Connecticut river . Michaux speaks of its most common name as Poplar , but we must confess that we have never beard that name applied to it in any region of the earth to which our travels have extended . Whitewood is its most general name at present , but this is giving way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rare in our cities , and at the same time easily obtained , and its cultivation will probably at no distant time supersede that of the Plane-tree . For a cheerful shade , none would exceed the Robinia Eseudacctcia , known by the name of Locust or Yellow Locust ; the velvet green of its foliage is delightful to the eye , and its rapid growth recommends it to those who desire a quick and airy shade . But it is melancholy to one who regards such things , to pass through New England and see the fate of this tree ; hard and solid as the xvood is , it is eaten throughout and in all directions by the larva of a moth , so that its trunk is ragged and decaying in appearance , and its branches broken by the wind . There are plantations which have escaped at present ; but the evil is so general that we despair of preserving the tree , since not even the semblance of a remedy has yet been suggested by practical experiment or scientific research . This is the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the tree prefers . It chooses such as are light and barren , and therefore unfit for most others , and seems to thrive luxuriantly in the sands , and annually pays its ground-rent , by covering the soil with its leaves , which form the most fertilizing substance known in agriculture . Michaux transferred the Locust to France , where it grows without injury from this destroyer ; and thus foreign lands seem likely to enjoy the benefit of this invaluable xvood , after it is lost to its parent country . Its use in ship building , in which it is found stronger than Live Oak , and lighter than the Red Cedar , while it is as durable as either , and in making fences , where its posts will outlast all others , can not be supplied . The Rose-flowering or Glutinous Locust , a tree which // produces its rich flowers sometimes twice in the season , is suffering under the attacks of the same destroyer , and we shall probably be obliged to surrender one of the finest ornaments of our gardens . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , and will be cultivated for its elegant foliage and its rapid growth , though it affords no shelter from the sun . Where a light screen is wanted to obstruct the sightin a measure , while it admits the sun and air , this will be found a very desirable tree . It is now cultivated for hedges in many parts of New England , but we are assured by some , on whose judgment we rely and who have tried the experiment , that such hedges are wanting in the two most essential properties of a hedge , and afford neither beauty nor protection . It does not compare with the Ritamnus *atharticus , or Buck-thorn , a plant first applied to this purpose by E. H. Derby , Esq . of Salem , in this State . Whoever has seen hedges of this plant , properly managed , will allow that neither the Haw-thorn nor any other can bear comparison with it in any respect for which a hedge is wanted . It was said of Evelyn , that he had the honor to be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) into use and reputation , for the most beautiful of hedges and verdure in the world , and propagated it from Cornwall to Cumberland . ' We have no doubt that the Buck-thorn will come into general use before many years , and he who first suggested it will be acknowledged to have rendered good service to our country . The more delicate trees of our southern climates have been much cultivated in New England , but we are inclined to think , to but little advantage . The Catalpa , where it has room to spread and lean its long branches toward the ground , is certainly ornamental , particularly in the time of its large and showy flowers ; but if a gale come to try the strength of the boughs , or a severe wind lift the bark , the planter regrets that he had not given the same care to the hardier tree . The Magnolias are liable to similar objections , in our northern climates ; since , though they do sometimes flourish , those that escape are few in number compared with those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former of which grows with tolerable security under the shade of large trees , xvhile the latter , a fine shrub , will endure our seasons in almost every exposure . In fact the only place in Massachusetts where it grows wild , is in a swamp on Cape Ann , where it must be exposed to more // zephyrs than a tender plant could well bear . If gay flowers are desired , why not cultivate the Pavia Lutea or Ohioansis , the latter of which , tho*ugh an evident horse-chestnut , still goes by the name of Buck-eye ? Our country is remarkable for the variety of names given to almost every tree ; thus for example , the Magnolia Glauca , just mentioned , is called the Small Magnolia , Swamp Sassafras , Sweet Bay , White Bay , Swamp Laurel , and Beaver-wood , titles as numerous as our most modest learned societies confer upon their honorary members . The Pinus Australis , a tree unknown to New England , passes under the names of Yellow , Pitch , Long-leaved , Broom , Southern , Red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of a pleasing variety , our common White Pine , Pinus Strobus , is variously denominated Weymouth , Sapling , Apple and Pumpkin . In our opinion , no tree of our forests , except the grandest object it exhibits , a hemlock leaning with age , is so magnificent as the tree last mentioned . Its form is bold and towering , and its foliage distinguished for its soft and peculiar green ; nothing exceeds it for height and gigantic proportion . Belknap , in his History of New Hampshire , mentions one which was cut down near the Merrimac , and measured seven feet eight inches in diameter . The height sometimes reaches one hundred and eighty feet . Happily for its security , this tree does not abound in resin ; that article in New England is found in the Pinus Rigida or Pitch-pine , which has no beauty to recommend it to the eye . The tapering spire and light green of the Larch , known also by the names of Hacmatac and Tamarac , make it a graceful addition to plantations , particularly in damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thuya Occidentalis or Arbor Vitae , which grows in Maine and New Hampshire ; This in turn is often called White Cedar , a name which belongs to the Cupressus Tliuyoides , which in Maryland , Virginia , and North Carolina is called the Juniper , while in New England the name Juniper is given to a shrub , Juniperus Communis , which never rises into a tree . Thus is introduced a confusion as agreeable as that by which the names Partridge , Quail , and Pheasant , are transposed in different parts of the country . That elegant tree , theAbies Balsamifera , is not only known by its most proper and expressive name , the Silver Fir , but also by that of Fir Balsam and Balm of Gilead ; while this last name is applied to the Populus Gandicans , a tree a unlike as possible to the former , and which certainly does not // need it , being already equipped with the titles of Black Poplar , Tacmahac and Heart-leaved Balsam . But we have no time to dwell longer upon this part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will afford the planter every thing be can desire ; and by contrasting the light glancing ripple of the aspen leaves with the dark and steady calm of the evergreen , or the deep glossy oak-leaf with the silken pine ; by blending lights and shadows , and contrasting graceful and delicate with lofty and commanding forms ; by requiring the mighty to shelter the weak , and placing the humble under the protection of the high ; by adapting the vegetation to the character of the ground , and the hill , plain or valley , in which it is to grow ; and , though last , not least , by mingling the trees in such a manner as to secure the richest variety of autumnal colors , he may produce effects , which , though not the result of lavish expense and laborious preparation , shall enchant the eye , and improve the heart . The great proportion of those who pay attention to the business of planting in this country , seem to do it mechanically , with the single object of collecting trees in sufficient numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in fact to any principles of taste . If the enclosure be small , it is bordered by trees in regular file and at equal distances , arranged with military precision ; or if the improvements are made in a wider field of action , the trees are gathered by a press-gang and left to themselves , as if they could choose positions best suited to their habits and natures . Those who can embrace forests in their plans are few in number ; and where any conduct their improvements on this extended scale , the woods are still so extensive in our country , that they are seldom obliged to resort to the slow process of transplanting . A forest is a grand and imposing object , whether rising on the hill side like the galleries of an amphitheatre , or resting on the smooth and even plain ' ; and reminds us of the ocean , not only by the hollow sound that sweeps through its caverns , but by the bays and indentures that vary the line of its borders . But in this country we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than groves ; and the manner of arranging these , so as to lose the stiffness and formality of art , to secure the favorable points of prospect , and to shut out whatever might offend the eye , and to bring together in their best proportions the variety of colors and forms in nature , are refinements which at present // have excited but very little attention , though there is hardly an estate of the least pretension , in which they are not called for . Scarcely any one ever thinks of what is called the composition of the scene . As this branch of the subject does not come within the design of the work before us , we shall not dwell upon it here . If a man desire to improve the appearance of his estate , he naturally wishes to enjoy the result of his labors as early as possible ; and if his object be to improve the village road and burial place , or the streets and squares of the city , he will not have patience to plant the seed , nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and size , he able to endure the rough treatment to which they are necessarily exposed in public places . But the business of transplanting trees already grown is so laborious , expensive and slow ,  --  so much care is required , and so little given , without the constant presence of a superintending eye ; so many trees wither and die at once and so many linger on in a sickly and discouraging state , holding places which might be better filled , and , after all the care that has been given them , disappointing the planter 's hopes at last , that those who commence the undertaking with enthusiasm are apt to give it over in despair . It is therefore very important to establish and make known some rules upon the subject , which shall prevent such waste of labor , money and time ; and if this could he done , it would secure to the public the benefit of many such improvements ; for there are those who would have spirit enough to make them , if they could do it with a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe that there is much more public spirit existing every where , than we see displayed in this or any other way ; for no man attempts an enterprise with vigor unless he is confident of success , and so many endeavors of this kind have failed , that few have any very inspiring hope of raising arches of shade , which shall make those who come after him approve his taste and bless his friendly hand . The art of transplanting is old enough to be better understood than it is . It is one of those things which , because it is easily done , is seldom well done . It is well known that the Greeks and Romans were in the constant habit of removing trees and even plantations of considerable size , without observing any other rule than that which is now in common use among our planters , who trim the branches in proportion to // what the roots have suffered in the operation . Count Maurice , of Nassau , when governor of Brazil , chose a naked island for his residence ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years old and more , soon covered it with verdure and beauty . Similar attempts were made in Europe , some of them of a still bolder character , the trees being transplanted in mid-summer . Evelyn observes that huge oaks had been removed in France before his day . Louis XLV . was a great transplanter both of trees and men , but unfortunately he removed the trees with as little regard to principle , as be manifested in removing the men . In these attempts , a ball of earth was carried with the tree , which added considerably to the weight , particularly when the earth was frozen . All these improvements required great expense and labor , and were ways in which the wealthy showed their power rather than suggestions of taste and a love of nature . The well-known experiment of Sir Henry Stuart was the first attempt at decided improvement , and like most other valuable discoveries was not owing to accident , but was the result of scientific inquiry into the subject . It seemed as unnatural to him to mangle and hew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs of an emigrant before he leaves his country . It is true there must be sufficient root to convey support to the stem and leaves , but if the root be preserved unmutilated , so may the stem and branches ; and it may be so preserved , either by taking up the whole or by cutting off the ends of the larger roots in the preceding spring . They soon throw out fibres , and convey the same nourishment as before , though they spread in a narrower circle . Being thus contracted into a small space , it requires less time to dig round and raise them ; and , as the - place to receive the tree is previously made ready , the whole operation is finished with but small expense of labor or time . This suggestion , simple and natural as it seems , was entirely new , and the success with which it has been followed by himself and others , will inspire many to follow his example . On his own estate he supplied , by his own energy , both the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now affords the varieties of grove and forest , promontory and island , lake and river , produced , not by resisting but by following the dictates of nature , whose unceasing endeavor it is to remove barrenness , to extend and strengthen vegetation , and who spreads her bright green xvreaths even over the ruins made by the desolating hands of man . // But , in the face of these successful experiments , we must confess that we agree with the author of this work , that the best way of raising trees is from the seed . When sown in a favorable soil , they grow so rapidly that they will almost over take those which have been transplanted , which , though they live and flourish , do not always recover their vigor . Any one may observe how soon the tree which springs from the chancesown seed rises and throws its shadow over his garden , and he may be sure that it will not grow less rapidly when the seed is sown with care . We have seen those who have raised their shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been well rewarded in a space of time which seemed surprisingly short even to themselves . Doubtless if it were possible to procure young trees raised for the purpose , a few years might be saved ; but our nurseries will not afford them ; and to take trees from the forest , for the purpose , is like forcing owls into the sun . We would recommend it therefore to the planter to arm himself with that patience , which is said to belong to the hushaudman ; to sow the seed with both hands , and to take encouragement from the thought , that if he does not enjoy the results of his labors , others will . But these should be generous labors ; they belong to liberal spirits , they imply a certain degree of refinement ; such refinement as makes men willing to exert themselves without money and without price . We take the liberty to recommend to every man who has an inch of ground , to fill it up with a tree . There are many who will do nothing of the kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will find the truth of what Hesiod said to agriculturists thousands of years ago , that half an estate is more than the whole . Within these limits , however small , they produce effects which will fill even themselves with surprise . If their enclosure be within the city , where the object is to make the most of their possessions , they should remember that if they can not have verdure on the soil , they can have it in the air ; and if in the country , that nothing gives a more unfavorable and at the same time correct impression of the character of a landholder , than the aspect of an estate which presents no trees along its borders , to shelter the traveller from the sun . Every cottage should have its elm , extending its mighty protecting arms above it . The associations and partialities of children will twine themselves like wild vines around it ; and if any one doubt that he will be better and happier // for such , he little knows the feeling with which the way. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow , Where once his careless childhood strayed , A stranger yet to pain . ' We wish it were in our power to do something to call the general attention to the subject of respect to the dead . It gives a painful feeling , to pass through a city or village in our country , and to see the shameful desolation and neglect of the burial place , which , if no longer consecrated by religious acts , should certainly be held sacred by the heart . And yet , were it not for the monuments which here and there appear above the golden-rod and the aster , we should not know these from any other barren fields . A vile enclosure of unpainted wood is all that protects them from violation ; and if any tree cast a friendly shadow over it , we may be sure it is one planted by the hand of nature , not of man . We have seen places of this kind in the country , which the fathers of the hamlet seemed to have chosen with a taste seldom found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of rivers , or the borders of deep forests , where every thing around favored the contemplation to which the mind in such places is , and ought to he led , and have found evidence there of the degeneracy , not the improvement of their children , who had disappointed their designs , and suffered all to run to waste and barrenness , whether from want of refinement or from avarice , we did not know . It is perfectly surprising that none should be found to take away this reproach . Some of the most uncivilized nations are ages before us in their regard for these delicate and sacred feelings . They would not permit the young and beautiful , the aged and honorable , to be cast into a place so neglected , when even a *og who had been faithful would deserve a more honored grave . Our own evergreen cypress is as suitable as the Oriental to surround the place of death ; and were it not so , we have many other trees whose character of form and foliage is well suited to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such places to bear . There is no need of urging the claims of this kind of jmprovement upon the inhabitants of our cities . They are in general sufficiently attentive to their public grounds ; but one thing is a little remarkable in their proceedings ; they confine themselves to a single tree . Can any mortal inform us why a spot // like the common of our ' city , for example , where thousands of trees might stand without interfering with the public or each other , should not afford specimens of other trees beside the elm ? It is a noble tree , perhaps the finest that could be chosen ; but the polished foliage of the oak , the light green of the plane-tree and willow , the various forms and shades of the maples , larches , and pines would break the uniformity of the scene , and relieve the eye . Moreover , groups of trees might be scattered here and there to advantage , without injury to the public ; for if they should occasionally break the ranks of the train-bands , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country . Places for which nature has done much , require the more of man , because they offer him a vantage ground to begin his improvements , and constantly upbraid him if he neglects them.
