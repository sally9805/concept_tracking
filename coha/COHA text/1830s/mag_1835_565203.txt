txt WE present to our readers a few more of the loose sketches from our friend 's portfolio , which , we think , will , more clearly than those of the last month , shew the truth of our remark , that , like the careless drawings of a master-hand , they shadow forth a power and beauty , that might he visibly embodied into life-like forms on the canvass . The Afternoon Scene ' and The Night Scene ' will , we trust , suggest subjects to our landscape painters . The former , which has the mellow richness of a Claude , might be exquisitely done by Doughty ; and young Brown , whose promise is as great as the hopes of his friends , could employ his glowing pencil upon no subject better adapted to call forth all his genius , than the latter . THE CANAL-BOAT . I was inclined to be poetical about the Grand Canal . In my imagination , De V**itt Clinton was an enchanter , who had waved his magic wand from the Hudson to lake Erie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce of two worlds , till then inaccessible to each other . This simple and mighty conception had conferred inestimable value on spots which nature seemed to have thrown carelessly into the great body of the earth , without foreseeing*that they could ever attain importance . I pictured the surprise of the sleepy Dutchmen when the new river first glittered by their doors , bringing them hard cash or foreign commodities , in exchange for their hitherto unmarketable produce . Surely , the water of this canal must be the most fertilizing of all fluids ; for it causes towns-with their masses of brick and stone , their churches and theatres , their business and hubbub , their luxury and refinement , their gay dames and polished citizens - to spring up , till , in time , the wondrous stream may flow between two continuous lines of buildings , through one thronged street , from Buffalo to Albany . I embarked about thirty miles below Utica , determining to voyage along the whole extent of the canal , at least twice in the course of the summer . Behold us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our vessel , like the steeds of Neptune to a huge scallop-shell , in mythological pictures . Bound to a distant port , we had neither chart nor compass , nor cared about the wind , nor felt the heaving of a billow , nor dreaded shipwreck , however fierce the tempest , in our adventurous navigation of an interminable mud-puddle  - -  for a mud-puddle it seemed , and as dark and turbid as if every // kennel in the land paid contribution to it . With an imperceptible current , it holds its drowsy way through all the dismal swamps and unimpressive scenery , that could be found between the great lakes and the sea-coast . Yet there is variety enough , both on the surface of the canal and along its banks , to amuse the traveler , if an overpowering tedium did not deaden his perceptions . Sometimes we met a black and rusty-looking vessel , laden with lumber , salt from Syracuse , or Genessee flour , and shaped at both ends like a square-toed boot , as if it had two sterns , and were fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square hut , and a woman seen through the window at her household work , with a little tribe of children , who perhaps had been born in this strange dxvelling and knew no other home . Thus , while the husband smoked his pipe at the helm , and the eldest son rode one of the horses , on went the family , traveling hundreds of miles in their own house , and carrying their fireside with them . The most frequent species of craft were the line boats , ' which had a cabin at each end , and a great bulk of barrels , bales , and boxes in the midst ; or light packets , like our own , decked all over , with a row of curtained windows from stem to stern , and a drowsy face at every one . Once , we encountered a boat , of rude construction , painted all in gloomy black , and manned by three Indians , who gazed at us in silence and with a singular fixedness of eye . Perhaps these three alone , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from the white man 's mighty projects , and float along the current of his enterprise . Not long after , in the midst of a swamp and beneath a clouded sky , we overtook a vessel that seemed full of mirth and sunshine . It contained a little colony of Swiss , on their way to Michigan , clad in garments of strange fashion and gay colors , scarlet , yellow and bright blue , singing , laughing , and making merry , in odd tones and a babble of outlandish wor*ls . One pretty damsel , with a beautiful pair of naked white arms , addressed a mirthful remark to me ; she spoke in her native tongue , and I retorted in good English , both of us laughing heartily at each other 's unintelligible wit . I can not describe how pleasantly this incident affected me . These honest Swiss were an itinerant community of jest and fun , journeying through a gloomy land and among a dull race of moneygetting drudges , meeting none to understand their mirth and only one to sympathize with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Had I been on my feet at the time , instead of sailing slowly along in a dirty canal-boat , I should often have paused to contemplate the diversified panorama along the banks of the canal . Sometimes the scene was a forest , dark , dense , and impervious , breaking away occasionally and receding from a lonely tract , covered with dismal black stumps , where , on the verge of the canal , // might be seen a log-cottage , and a sallow-faced woman at the window . Lean and aguish , she looked like Poverty personified , half clothed , half fed , and dwelling in a desert , while a tide of wealth was sweeping by her door . Iwo or three miles further would bring us to a lock , where the slight impediment to navigation had created a little mart of trade . Here would be found commodities of all sorts , enumerated in yellow letters on the window-shutters of a small grocery-store , the owner of which had set his soul to the gathering of coppers and small change , buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the blessed Sabbath . The next scene might be the dwelling-houses and stores of a thriving village , built of wood or small gray stones , a church-spire rising in the midst , and generally two taverns , bearing over their piazzas the pompous titles of hotel , ' exchange , ' tontine , ' or coffee-house . ' Passing on , we glide now into the unquiet heart of an inland city - of Utica , for instance - and find ourselves amid piles of brick , crowded docks and quays , rich warehouses and a busy population . We feel the eager and hurrying spirit of the place , like a stream and eddy whirling us along with it . Through the thickest of the tumult goes the canal , flowing between lofty rows of buildings and arched bridges of hewn stone . Onward , also , go we , till the hum and bustle of struggling enterprise die away behind us , and we are threading an avenue of the ancient woods again . This sounds not amiss in description , but was so tiresome in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for amusement . An English traveler paraded the deck with a rifle in his walking-stick , and waged war on squirrels and woodpeckers , sometimes sending an unsuccessful bullet among flocks of tame ducks and geese , which abound in the dirty water of the canal . I , also , pelted these foolish birds with apples , and smiled at the ridiculous earnestness of their scrambles for the prize , while the apple bobbed about like a thing of life . Several little accidents afforded us good-natured diversion . At the moment of changing horses , the tow-rope caught a Massachusetts farmer by the leg , and threw him down in a very indescribable posture , leaving a purple mark around his sturdy limb . A new passenger fell flat on his back , in attempting to step on deck , as the boat emerged from under a bridge . Another , in his Sunday clothes , as good luck would have it , being told to leap aboard from the bank , forthwith plunged up to his third waistcoat button in the canal , and was fished out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our three rounds of applause . Anon , a Virginia schoolmaster , too intent on a pocket Virgil to heed the helmsman 's warning - bridge ! bridge ! - was saluted by the said bridge on his knowledge-box . I had prostrated myself , like a pagan before his idol , but heard the dull leaden sound of the contact , and // fully expected to see the treasures of the poor man s cranium scattered about the deck . however , as there was no harm done , except a large bump on the head , and probably a corresponding dent in the hridge , the rest of us exchanged glances and laughed quietly . Oh , how pitiless are idle people ! * The table being now lengthened through the cabin , and spread for supper , the next twenty minutes were the pleasantest I had spent on the canal  --  the same space at dinner excepted . At the close of the meal , it had become dusky enough for lamplight . The rain pattered unceasingly on the deck , and sometimes came with a sullen rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stirred through an opening of the forest . The intolerable dullness of the scene engendered an evil spirit in me . Perceiving that the Englishman was taking notes in a memorandum-book , with occasional glances round the cabin , I presumed that we were all to figure in a future volume of travels , and amused my ill-humor by falling into the probable vein of his remarks . He would hold up an imaginary mirror , wherein our reflected faces would appear ugly and ridiculous , yet still retain an undeniable likeness to the originals . Then , with more sweeping malice , he would make these caricatures the representatives of great classes of my countrymen . He glanced at the Virginia schoolmaster , a Yankee by birth , who , to recreate himself , was examining a freshman from Schnectady college , in the conjugation of a Greek verb . Him , the Englishman would portray as the scholar of America , and compare his erudition to a schoolboy 's Latin theme , made up of scraps , illselected and worse put together . Next , the tourist looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harangue on the iniquity of Sunday mails . Here was the far-famed yeoman of New-England ; his religion , writes the Englishman , is gloom on the Sabbath , long prayers every morning and eventide , and illiberality at all times ; his boasted information is merely an abstract and compound of newspaper paragraphs , Congress debates , caucus harangues , and the argument and judge 's charge in his own lawsuits . The bookmonger cast his eye at a Detroit merchant , and began scribbling faster than ever . In this sharp-eyed man , this lean man , of wrinkled brow , we see daring enterprise and closefisted avarice combined ; here is the worshipper of Mammon at noonday ; here is the three-times bankrupt , richer after every ruin ; here , in one word , ( Oh , wicked Englishman to say it ! ) here is the American ! He lifted his eye-glass to inspect a western lady , who at once became aware of the glance , reddened , and retired deeper into the female part of the cabin . Here was the pure , modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when no evil is intended ; and sensitive like diseased flesh , that thrills if you but point at it ; and strangely modest , without // confidence in the modesty of other people ; and admirably pure , with such a quick apprehension of all impurity . In this manner , I went all through the cabin , hitting everybody as hard a lash as I could , and laying the whole blame on the infernal Englishman . At length , I caught the eyes of my own image in the looking-glass , where a number of the party were likewise reflected , and among them the Englishman , who , at that mo ment , was intently observing myself . * * * The crimson curtain being let down between the ladies and o*entiemen , the cabin became a bed-chamber for twenty persons , who were laid on shelves , one above another . For a long time , our various incommodities kept us all awake , except five or six , who were accustomed to sleep nightly amid the uproar of their own snoring , and had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a curious fact , that these snorers had been the most quiet people in the boat , while awake , and became peacebreakers only when others cease to be so , breathing tumult out of their repose . Would it were possible to affix a wind instrument to the nose , and thus make melody of a snore , so that a sleeping lover might serenade his mistress , or a congregation snore a psalm-tune ! Other , though fainter sounds than these , contributed to my restlessness . My head was close to the crimson curtainthe sexual division of the boat - behind which I continually heard whispers and stealthy footsteps ; the noise of a comb laid on the table , or a slipper dropt on the floor ; the twang , like a broken harp-string , caused by loosening a tight belt ; the rustling of a gown in its descent ; and the unlacing of a pair of stays . My ear seemed to have the properties of an eye ; a visible image pestered my fancy in the darkness ; the curtain was withdrawn between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a blush . Finally , all was hushed in that quarter . Still , I was more broad awake than through the whole preceding day , and felt a feverish impulse to toss my limbs miles apart , and appease the unquietness of mind by that of matter . Forgetting that my berth was hardly so wide as a coffin , I turned suddenly over , and fell like an avalanche on the floor , to the disturbance of the whole community of sleepers . As there were no bones broken , I blessed the accident , and went on deck . A lantern was burning at each end of the boat , and one of the crew was stationed at the bows , keeping watch , as mariners do on the ocean . Though the *ramn had ceased , the sky was all one cloud , and the darkness so i*ntense , that there seemed to be no world , except the little space on which our lanterns glimmered . Yet , it was an impressive scene . We we*re traversing the long level , ' a dead flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rise or fall enough to require a lock for nearly seventy miles . There can hardly be a more dismal tract of country . The forest which covers it , consist ing chiefly of white cedar , black ash , and other trees that live in excessive moisture , is now decayed and death-struck , by the partial draining of the swamp into the great ditch of the canal . Sometimes , indeed , our lights were reflected from pools of stagnant water , which stretched far in among the trunks of the trees , beneath dense masses of dark foliage . But generally , the tall stems and intermingled branches were naked , and brought into strong relief , amid the surrounding gloom , by the whiteness of their decay . Often , we beheld the prostrate form of some old sylvan giant , which had fallen , and crushed down smaller trees under its immense ruin . In spots , where destruction had been riotous , the lanterns showed perhaps a hundred trunks , erect , half overthrown , extended along the ground , resting on their shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all of one ashy-white , all naked together , in desolate confusion . Thus growing out of the night as we drew nigh , and vanishing as we glided on , based on obscurity , and overhung and bounded by it , the scene was ghost-like - the very land of unsubstantial things , whither dreams might betake themselves , when they quit the slumberer 's brain . My fancy found another emblem . The wild Nature of America had been driven to this desert-place by the encroachments of civilized man . And even here , where the savage queen was throned on the ruins of her empire , did we penetrate , a vulgar and worldly throng , intruding on her latest solitude . In other lands , Decay sits among fallen palaces ; but here , her home is in the forests . Looking ahead , I discerned a distant light , announcing the approach of another boat , which soon passed us , and proved to be a rusty old scow-just such a craft as the Flying Dutchman ' would navigate on the canal . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the helm , in a glazed lint and rough great-coat , with a pipe in his mouth , leaving the fumes of tobacco a hundred yards behind . Shortly after , our boatman blew a horn , sending a long and melancholy note through the forest-avenue , as a signal for some watcher in the wilderness to be ready with a change of horses . We had proceeded a mile or two with our fresh team , when the tow-rope got entangled in a fallen branch on the edge of the canal , and caused a momentary delay , during which I went to examine the phosphoric light of an old tree , a little within the forest . It was not the first delusive radiance that I had followed . The tree lay along the ground , and was wholly converted into a mass of diseased splendor , which threw a ghastliness around . // Being full of conceits that night , I called it a frigid fire : a funeral light , illumining decay and death : an emblem of fame , that gleams around the dead man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes its brilliancy to moral rottenness ; and was thinking that such ghost-like torches were just fit to light up this dead forest , or to blaze coldly in tombs , when , starting from my abstraction , I looked up the canal . I recollected myself , and discovered the lanterns glimmering far away . Boat ahoy ! shouted I , making a trumpet of my closed fists . Though the cry must have rung for miles along that hollow passage of the woods , it produced no effect . These packetboats make up for their snail-like pace by never loitering day nor night , especially for those who have paid their fare . Indeed , the captain had an interest in getting rid of me , for I was his creditor for a breakfast . They are gone ! Heaven be praised ! ' ejaculated I ; for I can not possibly overtake them ! Here am I , on the long level , ' at midnight , with the comfortable prospect of a walk to Syracuse , where my baggage will be left ; and now to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So thinking aloud , I took a flambeau from the old tree , burning , but consuming not , to light my steps withal , and , like a Jack-o ' - the- lantern , set out on my midnight tour . THE INLAND PORT . It was a bright forenoon , when I set foot on the beach at Burlington , and took leave of the two boatmen , in whose little skiff I had voyaged since daylight from Peru . Not that we had come that morning from South A merica , but only from the New-York shore of lake Champlain . The highlands of the coast behind us stretched north and south , in a double range of bold , blue peaks , gazing over each other 's shoulders at the Green Mountains of Vermont . The latter are far the loftiest , and , from the opposite side of the lake , had displayed a mere striking outline . We were now almost at their feet , and could see only a sandy beach , sweeping beneath a woody bank , around the semi-circular bay of Burlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wharves and warehouses , with sloops and schooners moored alongside , or at anchor , or spreading their canvass to the wind , and boats rowing from point to point , reminded me of some fishing town on the sea-coast . But I bad no need of tasting the water to convince myself that lake Champlain was not an arm of the sea ; its quality was evident , both by its silvery surface , *when unruffled , and a faint , but unpleasant and sickly smell , forever steaming up in the sunshine . One breeze from the Atlantic , with its briny fragrance , would be // worth more to these inland people than all the perfumes of Arabia . On closer inspection , the vessels at the wharves looked hardly sea-worthy - there being a great lack of tar about the seams and rigging , and perhaps other deficiencies , quite as much to the purpose . I observed not a single sailor in the port . There were men , indeed , in blue jackets and trowsers , but not of the true nautical fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantaloons and coats preponderously long-tailed - cutting very queer figures at the mast-head ; and , in short , these freshwater fellows had about the same analagy to the real old salt , ' with his tarpaulin , pea-jacket and sailor-cloth troxvsers , as a lake fish to a Newfoundland cod . Nothing struck me more , in Burlington , than the great number of Irish emigrants . They have filled the British provinces to they brim , and still continue to ascend the St. Lawrence , in infinite tribes , overflowing by every outlet into the States . At Burlington , they swarm in huts and mean dwellings near the lake , lounge about the wharves , and elbow the native citizens entirely out of competition in their own line . Every species of mere bodily labor is the prerogative of these Irish . Such is their multitude , in comparison with any possible demand for their services , that it is difficult to conceive how a third part of them should earn even a daily glass of whiskey , which is doubtless their first necessary of life - daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake , but had caught only a few perch , which little fishes , without a miracle , would be nothing among so many . A miracle there certainly must have been , and a daily one , for the subsistence of these wandering hordes . The men exhibit a lazy strength and careless merriment , as if they had fed well hitherto , and meant to feed better hereafter ; the women strode about , uncovered in the open air , with far plumper waists and brawnier limbs , as welt as bolder faces , than our shy and slender females ; and their progeny , which was innumerable , had the reddest and the roundest cheeks of any children in America . While we stood at the wharf , the bell of a steamboat gave two preliminary peals , and she dashed away for Plattsburgh , leaving a trail of smoky breath behind , and breaking the glassy surface of the lake before her . Our next movement brought us into a handsome and busy square , the sides of which were filled up with white houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank . Some of these edifices had roofs of tin , in the fashion of Montreal , and glittered in the sun with cheerful splendor , imparting a lively effect to the whole square . One brick building , designated in large letters as the custom-house , reminded us that this inland village is a port of entry , largely concerned in foreign trade , and holding daily intercourse with the British empire . In this border country , the Canadian bank-notes circulate as freely as our own , // and British and American coin are jumbled into the same pocket , the effigies of the king of England being made to kiss those of the goddess of liberty . Perhaps there was an emblem in the involuntary contact . There was a pleasant mixture of people in the square of Burlington , such as can not be seen elsewhere , at one view merchants from Montreal , British officers from the frontier garrisons , French Canadians , wandering Irish , Scotchmen of a better class , gentlemen of the south on a pleasure-tour , country squires on business ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their horse-wagons and ox-teams , true Yankees in aspect , and looking more superlatively so , by contrast with such a variety of foreigners . ROcHEsTER . The gray , but transparent evening , rather shaded than obscured the scene - *-  leaving its stronger features visible , and even improved , by the medium through which I beheld them . The volume of water is not very great , nor the roar deep enough to be termed grand , though such praise might have been appropriate before the good people of Rochester had abstracted a part of the unprofitable sublimity of the cascade . The Genessee has contributed so bountifully to their canals and mill-dams , that it approaches the precipice with diminished pomp , and rushes over it in foamy streams of various width , leaving a broad face of the rock insnlated and unwashed , between the two main branches of the falling river . Still it was an impressive sight , to one who had not seen Niagara . I confess , however , that my chief interest arose from a legend , connected with these falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was already so to me , as I pictured the catastrophe out of dusk and solitude . It was from a platform , raised over the naked island of the cliff , in the middle of the cataract , that Sam Patch took his last leap , and alighted in the other world . Strange as it may appear - that any uncertainty should rest upon his fate , which was consummated in the sight of thousands - many will tell you that the illustrious Patch concealed himself in a cave under the falls , and has continued to enjoy posthumous renown , without foregoing the comforts of this present life . But the poor fellow prized the shout of the multitude too much not to have claimed it at the instant , had he survived . He will not be seen again , unless his ghost , in such a twilight as when I was there , should emerge from the foam , and vanish among the shadows that fall from cliff to cliff . How stern a moral may be drawn from the story of poor Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool , when he has left his memory around the falls of the Genessee , more permanently than if the letters of his name had been hewn into the forehead of the precipice ? Was the // leaper of cataracts more mad or foolish than other men who throw away life , or misspend it in pursuit of empty fame , and seldom so triumphantly as he ? That which he won is as invaluable as any , except the unsought glory , spreading , like the rich perfume of richer fruit , from virtuous and useful deeds . Thus musing , wise in theory , but practically as great a fool as Sam , I lifted my eyes and beheld the spires , warehouses , and dwellings of Rochester , half a mile distant on both sides of the river , indistinctly cheerful , with the twinklincr of many lights amid the fall of*evening. * * * * The town had sprung up like a mushroom , but no presage of decay could be drawn from its hasty growth . Its edifices are of dusky brick , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than now ; its churches are Gothic ; it is impossible to look at its worn pavements , and conceive how lately the forestleaves have been swept away . The most ancient town in Massachusetts appears quite like an affair of yesterday , compared with Rochester . Its attributes of youth are the activity and eager life with which it is redundant . The whole street , sidewalks and centre , was crowded with pedestrians , horsemen , stage-coaches , gigs , light wagons , and heavy ox-teams , all hurrying , trotting , rattling , and rumbling , in a throng that passed continually , but never passed away . Here , a country wife was selecting a churn , from several gaily-painted ones on the sunny sidewalk ; there , a farmer was bartering his produce ; and , in two or three places , a crowd of people were showering bids on a vociferous auctioneer . I saw a great wagon and an ox-chain knocked off to a very pretty woman . Numerous were the lottery-offices  --  those true temples of Mammon - where red and yellow bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners of painted cloth gave notice that the lottery draws next Wednesday . ' At the ringing of a bell , judges , jurymen , lawyers , and clients , elbowed each other to the court-house , to busy themselves with cases that would doubtless illustrate the state of society , had I the means of reporting them . The number of public houses benefitted the flow of temporary population ; some were farmers ' taverns - cheap , homely , and comfortable ; others were magnificent hotels , with negro waiters , gentlemanly landlords in black broadcloth , and foppish bar-keepers in Broadway coats , with chased gold watches in their waistcoat pockets . 1 caught one of these fellows quizzing me through an eye-glass . The porters were lumbering up the steps with baggage from the packet-boats , while waiters plied the brush on dusty travelers , who , meanwhile , glanced over the innumerable advertisements in the daily papers . In short , everybody seemed to be there , and all had somethino* to do , and were doing it with all their might , except a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally Irish // and Scotch , though they wore uncle Sam 's gray jacket and trowsers . I noticed one other idle man . He carried a rifle on his shoulder and a powder-horn across his breast , and appeared to stare about him with confused wonder , as if , while he was listening to the wind among the forest boughs , the hum and bustle of an instantaneous city had surrounded him . * * * AN AFTERNOON SCENE . There had not been a more delicious afternoon than this , in all the train of summer - the air being a sunny perfume , made up of balm and warmth and gentle brightness . The oak and walnut trees , over my head , retained their deep masses of foliage , and the grass , though for months the pasturage of stray cattle , had been revived with the freshness of early June , by the autumnal rains of the preceding week . The garb of Autumn indeed resembled that of Spring . Dandelions and l*uttercups were sprinkled along the roadside , like drops of brightest gold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a golden centre . In a rocky spot , and rooted under the stone-wall , there was one wild rose-bush , bearing three roses , very faintly tinted , but blessed with a spicy fragrance . The same tokens would have announced that the year was brightening into the glow of summer . There were violets , too , though few and pale ones . But the breath of September was diffused through the mild air , whenever a little breeze shook out the latent coolness . A NIGhT SCENE . The steamboat in which I was passenger for Detroit , had put into the mouth of a small river , where the greater part of the night would be spent in repairing some damages of the machinery . As the evening was warm , though cloudy and very dark , I stood on deck , watching a scene that would not have attracted a second glance in the day-time , but became picturesque by the magic of strong light and deep shade . Some wild Irishmen were replenishing our stock of wood , and had kindled a great fire on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of large logs and dry brushwood , heaped together with careless profusion , blazing fiercely , spouting showers of sparks into the darkness , and gleaming wide over lake Erie  --  a beacon for perplexed voyagers , leagues from land . All around and above the furnace , there was total obscurity . No trees , or other objects , caught and reflected any portion of the brightness , which thus wasted itself in the immense void of night , as if it quivered from the expiring embers of the world , after the final conflagration . But the Irishmen were continually emerging from the dense gloom , passing through the lurid glow , and vanishing into the gloom on the other // side . Sometimes a whole figure would be made visible , by the shirt-sleeves and light-colored dress ; others were but half seen , like imperfect creatures ; many flitted , shadow-like , along the skirts of darkness , tempting fancy to a vain pursuit ; and often , a face alone was reddened by the fire , and stared strangely distinct , with no traces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted and exaggerated by the blaze , now lost in deep shadow , now bursting into sudden splendor , and now struggling between light and darkness , formed a picture which might have been transferred , almost unaltered , to a tale of the supernatural . As they all carried lanterns of wood , and often flung sticks upon the fire , the least imaginative spectator would at once compare them to devils , condemned to keep alive the flame of their own torment.
