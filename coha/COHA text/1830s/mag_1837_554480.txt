txt THE Abstract of Massachusetts School Returns for the last year , digested by the accurate and intelligent Secretary , agreeably to a resolve of the Legislature of the year 1826 , embraces statements from 289 cities and towns , being the whole number of municipal corporations , with the exception of about twenty . They are divided into 2,517 School Districts , employing 2,154 male , and 2,816 female instructers . The schools were attended last year by 146,539 children , between four and sixteen years of age , ( 75,552 boys , and 70,987 girls , ) and were supported by a tax levied hy the towns and cities , respectively , amounting to $391,993 ' 96 , and by voluntary contributions amounting to $47,593.44 ; besides which , many towns ( about 90 , ) have funds , the income of which is devoted to this object , all have their share of the $20,000 interest of the State School Fund , and in many , the teacher derives part of his compensation from board furnished by families of the district . The additional amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated at $326,642*53 , giving a total of // emies . The number of scholars attending these latter institutions is rated at 28,752 , making the whole number of children at the public and private schools to be 175,291 . Other matters of valuable information are embraced in the Abstract ; in particular , lists are affixed to the names of the towns , of books used in their schools respectively . This common-school system , of which the government continues to take so much care , is known to most of our readers to be one of the most ancient institutions of Massachusetts . Indeed , it is only since the period of Independence , that any other schools have been known to our laws , the earliest incorporation of an establishment for instruction , below the rank of the University , being that of Phillips 's Academy at Andover , in 1780 . The first free school of the colony was that of Boston , where in 1635 , five years from the settlement of that peninsula , the inhabitants voted in town meeting , " on the thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philemnon Pormont shall be entreated to become schoolmaster for the teaching and nurturing of youth among us . " Twelve years after , the General Court of the Commonwealth , having accomplished the very serious enterprise of founding the College , turned their attention to the sources whence its supplies of competent preparatory knowledge were to be drawn , and to the still wider exigency of competent instruction for the whole l ) eople . One of their first acts under the charter had been to order , that " forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular hehoof and benefit to any commonwealth , and whereas many parents and masters are too indulgent and negligent in that kind , the selectmen of every town in the several precincts and quarters where they dwell , shall have a vigil ant eye over their brethren and neighbours , to see that none of them shall suffer so much barbarism in any of their families , as not to endeavour to teach , by themselves or others , their children and apprentices , so much learning , is may enable them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital laws . " In 1647 , being now strong enough to do better , they proceeded to enact , as follows ; " It being one chief project of Satan to keep men from the knowledge of the Scripture , as in former times keeping them in unknown tongues , so in these latter times , by persuading from // the use of tongues , that so at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded and corrupted with false glosses of deceivers ; to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers in church and commonwealth , the Lord assisting our endeavours ; - " Sec . I. It is therefore ordered , by this Court and the authority thereof , that every township within this jurisdiction , after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty householders , shall then forthwith appoint one within their towns to teach all such children as shall resort to him , to write and read , whose wages shall be paid , either by the parents or masters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of supply , as the major part of those that order the prudentials of the town , shall appoint ; provided that those who send their children be not oppressed by paying much more , than they can have them taught for in other towns . " Sec . IL . And it is further ordered , that where any town shall increase to the number of one hundred families or householders , they shall set up a Grammar School , the master thereof being able to instruct youth , so far as they may be fitted for the University ; and if any town neglect the performance hereof above one year , then every such town shall pay five pounds per annum to the next such school , till they shall perform this order . " Thus , before the Massachusetts Colony was twenty years old , the outline of its system of universal free instruction was complete . Wherever a space had been redeemed from the forest , large enough to let in the light upon two hundred settlers , there every child had a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his child , an education qualifying him to make his own way in the world , and acquit himself intelligently of his obligations as a citizen . And wherever twice that number was collected , making the back broad enough for the burden , there every child of sufficient capacity was enabled and invited to prepare himself , at the common cost , for the highest places of usefulness and dignity , which the cornmonwealth had to fill , or for the retired pursuits of laborious scholarship , as his taste might dictate . The sovereign head had teemed , and Minerva was born full grown . The scheme of keeping the people free , by seasonably giving to every one of them intelligence to understand his rights and duties , never afterwards received , it did not require , any essential improvement . We wish we could // but say as much , as that it had uniformly been cherished in all the enlightened and bountiful spirit of its original conception . But we fear it has shared , in some degree , the fate of most human things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system , as the experience of successive generations has revealed it , has not only secured it against any danger of abandonment , hut made it one of the most prominent objects of reverence and pride to the people of the Commonwealth . Still we can not but think , that , if nothing of the comprehensiveness of view , and enthusiasm of purpose , which attended its origin , had been abated , improvements in the details would have been adopted , corresponding to the different wants of different times , such as would now have left us less to desire . Massachusetts has not been false to this best legacy of her founders . We would not so libel her fair fame as to hint it . But if her people in recent times , careful to keep up substantially the institutions of their fathers , have not been so careful to imitate their fathers ' conscientiousness and zeal , it is certainly no new thing that the trustee should be found less busy and hearty than the giver . At all events , we suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction , that in proportion to the increased resources of the time , we bear a vastly less pecuniary burden for this great public object , than our predecessors voluntarily assumed , when before them it was a thing unheard of . It is equally unquestionable , that the course of legislation has in some degree concurred with , instead of obstructing , or qualifying , the tendency of other events , to bring down the common schools from the high place which they held , relatively to the wants of society , at the time of their institution . A law , passed soon after that which we last quoted , and providing that " every town consisting of more than five hundred families or householders , shall set up and maintain two grammar schools , and two writing schools , " we suppose was the last which increased the obligations of the towns in respect to common school instruction in the higher departments . An act of the first year after the government was changed by the Provincial Charter of William and Mary , confirms the previously existing legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above brought to notice , but apparently without continuing the obligation upon towns , however populous , to support more than one grammar , or classical school . // So things stood , down to the time of the Revolution . The Constitution of 1780 provided as follows " Wisdom and knowledge , as well as virtue , diffused generally among the body of the people , being necessary for the perpetuation of their rights and liberties , and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the various parts of the country , and among the different orders of the people , it shall he the duty of legislatures and magistrates , in all future periods of this Commonwealth , to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences , and all seminaries of them ; especially the University at Cambridge , public schools , and grammar schools , in the towns . " The first legislative act respecting town schools under the Constitution , dates from the year 1789 ; and its character is partly to he expkiined , if not excused , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towns of fifty families were now required to support a reading and writingschool half the year only , instead of constantly , as before , the latter duty being now imposed on towns of a hundred families and a population of two hundred families , instead of one hundred , as formerly , was made necessary to create an obligation for the support of a grammar , or classical school . The practice , however , by no means followed , with equal step , the laxness of the law . Such was the value generally attached to a good education , and such the sense of the importance of general information to the general well-being , that the towns continued to tax themselves to an amount much exceeding , in the aggregate , the exactions of the law ; in many instances making appropriations twice as great as were requisite to meet their legal liabilities . And , in fact , as to the liberality which has been shown in the support of the secondary class of schools , ( as distinguished from the classical , ) there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city of Boston , for instance , might satisfy the law by levying an anntial tax of $3000 or $4000 for the support of schools . It however raised last year no less than $88,000 for the purpose ; and this , of course , in the spot of the Commonwealth , where the best and most numerously attended private institutions are collected. * With this money , it maintained eightyeight schools , open to all children of the proper age . Seventy * The average number of pupils at private schools is 4000 , and the estimated cost of their instruction $100,000. - Secretary 's Report , p. 2. // four of them are what are called Primary Schools , attended each by an average of from thirty to fifty children , from four to seven years of age . The establishments of next highest rank are the English Grammar Schools , for boys from seven to fourteen , and girls from seven to sixteen years old . " In these schools , " - we extract from " Regulations of the School Committee of Boston , adopted May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of an English education . In the several buildings where the arrangement is complete , there are two large halls occupied by two departments , one of * which is for a grammar school , and the other for a writing school . rLlhe scholars are organized in two divisions . While one division attends to grammar , the other attends to writing ; exchanging half daily . In the grammar ( epartment , the l ) upils are taught chiefly , spelling , reading , English grammar , and geography ; in the writing department , they are taught writing , arithmetic , and book-keeping . " These schools are attended respectively by a number of pupils not varying far from two hundred and fifty of each sex . For the instruction of the boys , each department has a master and an usher ; and for that of the girls , a master and three female assistants . There are two public schools in Boston of a higher order , the English High School and the Latin Grammar School . Each of these institutions has a master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one instructer to every thirty-five pupils . The English High School C was instituted in 18*1 , with the design of furnishing the young men of this city , who are not intended for a collegiate course of study , and who have enjoyed the usual advantages of the other public schools , with the means of completing a good English education , to fit them for active life , or qualify them for eminence in private or 1 ) ublic stations . Here is given instruction in the elements of mathematics and natural philosophy , with their application to the sciences and the arts , in grammar , rhetoric , and belles lettres , in moral philosophy , in history natural and civil , and in the French language . This institution is furnished with a valuable mathematical and philosophical apparatus , for the purpose of experiment and illustration . " - Ibid. , p. 17 . Of the Latin Grammar School , we shall be sustained by those acquainted with the facts in saying , that , for a great part , at least , of the last quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission at the University , were found , on the whole , better fitted , than an equal number from any other place of instruction , public or private . It has been , in short , the best school in the country . The richest man could not buy for his son a better preparatory education , than here the poorest man 's son could have for nothing . This is as it should he . This fills out , for one instance , the magnificent idea of the founders of our system of Universal Free Education . We have implied , however , that this , though not a single , is a rare instance , and that the grammar schools , as might have been anticipated , have not fared nearly so well at the hands of the public , as those where only the English branches are taught . In fact , whatever of law survives upon the subject , goes only to support them in a small number of the most populous towns , which do not need State legislation to enforce the provision ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation all towns of less than five thousand inhabitants. * We always regret and wonder to hear it said , that the Academies , which have sprung up during the present century , in such numbers , have supplied the want thus created . Under the name of Academies , our readers understand us to speak of incorporated institutions , in county and other towns , governed by trustees , and generally aided , in part , - in no instance , that we know , maintained , - by public or private endowments . They do supply the want , after a manner , for the rich ; though , for the most part , they compel the rich man to a measure , which if he is wise , lie will often hesitate much to take , even with the prospect of such benefit as they offer ; that is , to send his son away , at the most critical arid impressible period of life , out of the safe and profitable circle of domestic influence . But how do they supply the want for the poor man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to spare his sons ' labor , and provide them with clothes and books while they study , this is the most that he can do . He can not afford to pay their board in another town . The privilege of having them educated on that condition is no available privilege to him . We suppose that there is little hope of our ever getting back , in this respect , into the old path . It is obvious that the Academies , now instituted , actually stand in the way of what we would else not permit ourselves to despair of . But if * The laws in force are digested in Revised Statutes , ch. xxiii. // we cannoLexpress unqualified satisfaction with the present , we can not refrain from unqualified admiration of the past . It was a scheme worthy of the founders of such a republic as this , - that of giving the poorest boy , first the means of becoming respectable and prosperous , an independent happy man and a useful citizen , and then the chance , ( if he but lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of becoming a useful and a famous man in the highest walks of public service . Would that we had them back again , the days when the State kept the best schools , and kept them open to every one of its children ; when all " the rich and the poor met together , " under equal advantages , in fair competition , and in the knitting of ties of lasting friendship . The system gave , and what remains of it prolongs ,  --  to use Mr.Webster 's words in the Convention of 1820 , - " the time , when in the villages and farm-houses of New England , there may be undisturbed sleep within un .. barred doors . " But what is gone of it , has carried along with itself a great excellence and beauty of the plan . And what was the community 's safety , and blessing , and glory , and everybody 's good , was especially the poor man 's wealth . Nothing could possibly be more opposite to the truth , than was the feeling , ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutions suffered to go into disuse were institutions for the advantage of the few . It was , on the contrary , the poor man who had the precious benefit for his children , - accessible to others in some other way , but not else accessible to him ; and it was the rich who met almost all the cost . But if such revolutions do not go backward , lamentation over them comes to nothing , while on the other hand there is the more reason for checking any tendency they may manifest to further progress , and laboring to " strengthen the things which remain . " The English , or as they are commonly called in the country , the District Schools , have in recent years been the object of particular solicitude ; and the attention of the Legislature has been repeatedly given to them , in consequence of the exertions of no one more than those of Mr. Carter of Lancaster , the present chairman of the House of Representatives ' committee on education , the same gentleman whose very valuable publications on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the attention that // we should have done to the operations of the American Institute of Instruction , we suppose also that the exertions of that association have effected much that is profitable , in the way both of stimulating and informing the public mind on this subject . In 1834 , was established the Massachusetts School Fund , in which were invested , by the act , the proceeds of the Massachusetts claim upon the General Government for military services during the last war , to the amount of $280,000 , and one half the net proceeds of the sale of Eastern lands , till the fund shall amount to $1,000,000 . The income of the fund , at present nearly $20,000 , is divided annually among the cities , towns , and districts , in proportion to the number of their children between forty and sixteen years of age . As encouragement to the tax payers to make somewhat better provision than otherwise their expenditure would admit , this is useful ; and will he more so , as the amount is increased . But , without undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the present law contemplates , we can not disguise our satisfaction at the existence of a principle of limitation of the fund , to an amount far below what the support of the schools requires . We hope never to see the time when , as in Connecticut , the towns shall he released from the obligation of self-taxation . The feeling on their part , that it is their own money , which maintains the schools , is , in various ways which might be specified , if they were not sufficiently apparent , altogether too valuable to be dispensed with . The subject of a State institution for the better education of teachers of the common schools , has within the last ten years been repeatedly before the legislature ; and last year the appointment of a Superintendent of Common Schools was urged upon it in a memorial from the Institute of Instruction . An act for the creation of this functionary was reported by the committee on education , but did not become a law . The Institute have again memorialized the legislature , at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special instruction of teachers , one or more seminaries , either stan&amp; ing independently , or in connexion with institutions already existing . " But at the time when we are writing , no definitive action has been had upon the project . For the present , we dismiss the subject of the actual condition of the common schools , with the expression of the great pleasure we have in knowing them to be as good as they // are , and of our earnest wish that they were much better , and especially that the now vanished feature of the institution were restored . Such as they are , they admirably teach some valuable lessons , which are not ostensibly comprised within their plan of instruction . It is calculated that they afford to nineteen twentieths of our population all the education which they receive . Of the other twentieth , we presume we should he within the truth , in reckoning that four fifths are indebted to them for some l ) art of their school instruction , making ninety-nine in every hundred of our people to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of thought and character are concerned , the lessons which they teach may accordingly be viewed , for all practical purposes , as enforced on the whole population , since the small fraction on whom they do not directly operate , is incapable of any influence to resist that , exerted hy so vast a preponderance of numbers . And thus we go on to say , that , whether these institutions teach more or less of geography , or grammar , or other things well worth the learning , there are some habits of mind and feeling of the first consequence , which they do effectually teach , and teach to all ; to their own pupils directly , and to the small remnant of others through their example and influence ; and among these things are the sense of individual independence , and the sentiment of mutual respect . We are not sorry to have this topic brought in our way , connecting itself , as it does , with some points on which we were touching in our last number . We there had occasion to remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities of the New England character . There are others , which , from time to time , have come under our notice , and probably under that of most of our readers ; and they happen to he of that kind , that if they could be substantiated , they would prove the population in question to be not only very blamable on other accounts , but to be capable of resisting , with a superhuman perversity , some of the most imperious influences under which character is formed . Till all signs fail , it may be pretty safely predicted , that , of a people circumstanced in childhood and youth like that of New England , few will be found manifesting , in later life , either the arrogance and narrowness of a caste on the one hand , or a servile deference to the opinions and wishes of associates on the other . // aristocracy , for instance , in New England ! In New England , of all places in the world , xThere , by the fast-coloring chemics of the common schools , the hoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with democracy , not in some conventional sense , which , in one or another part of the country , the word may have in this year or in that ; but with the conviction and the feeling of a perfect equality among men , except so far as merit makes a difference . Aristocracy in New England ! where , in the collisions and friendships and rivalries of childhood , collected in masses , not divided into ranks , the very last thing thought of is the distinction between more or less pocket-money , or a homelier or gayer dress , and the squire 's son is no better than the day-laborer 's , unless he happens to be able , which it is likely he will not , to get a longer lesson , or strike a harder blow . We are not arguing to clods , or we would take more pains to show , that , in such associations , it is the bright , and the bold , and the amiable , who will take the lead , and not the high-born , if such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later life will be incompetent to undo the discipline there applied , and quell the spirit there engendered , and make the one class craven , and the other domineering . Till we have men among us , who never were boys , or till our boys are brought up in a different manner from what now prevails , it might seem that we were tolerably safe against any discomfort arisino fr bearing spirit of an aristocracy . om the overBut others , we from time to time are learning , are of a different mind . Thus speaks a correspondent of the New York " Knickerbocker " for last October . We give the statement from this source , both because it is the most recent , of the same description , which has happened to come in our way , and because it appears in a work of that class which undertakes and intends a true representation of current opinions of the time . The article is headed " New York and New England . " Of the latter section it affirms ; " Because the emigrant from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows that he is so at home . We hazard the assertion that New England is a land of petty aristocrats . Is any one so ignorant as to suppose the reverence for rank and title , which the Pilgrims brought from England , could he done away by the mere intervention of the Atlantic ocean ? We refer not particularly to the Plymouth band , but to the early population of the East . // They had nursed , in their mother 's milk , a love for show , a respect for birth ; their being had been imbued with these feelings , and they insensibly taught them to their children . " Again , " The widest distinctions in society were known at the time of our revolution , and served to hasten it on . Old habits have continued to this day ; and there is throughout the States east of the Hudson , a fanily pride , - select circles , - upper and lower class doctrine , at war with the spirit of our institutions , and the general advancement of that section in intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there one class etrnnently distinguished for eloquence , learning , and taste , while the great 1 ) ody of the people are inferior , much inferior , to the general level of American character . This upper class are often too refined to attend to their political duty . They are too much immersed in letters and pleasure , too sublimated , to descend to the vulgar arena of elections . They may talk of public affairs , erect monuments to distinguished men , give of their abundance to all the showy , magnificent operations of the day , and yet do this with an exclusive spirit , and with a haughty patronage , that robs the thing of all republican odor . " Yet once more ; " That people should set themselves up as grandees , look down upon the working classes , instruct their children by example and precept to give themselves airs , and make them believe they are of a higher race than the re*-t of their countrymen , is shocking and disgusting in a country where merit is acknowledged to be the only path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no disgrace . " Here s a coil , my masters ! The author dates from a place which we suppose is somewhere in the interior of the Empire State ; and the vagueness of his terms makes it necessary to presume , that he has not had opportunity for personal observations on the state of society which they rebuke . Accordingly , we mean not the smallest disrespect to him , be he who lie may , when we say , that the sort of people with whom this persiflage originates , are simply those who have been piqued into giving it currency , in consequence of not finding in New England that standard of social rank , on which they rely to give themselves the consideration they demand . A visiter comes thither without any apparent claims of intelligence , virtue , or refinement , but with the reputation of being // eminently " good " on change . If lie commits himself so far as to assume any thing on this ground , he finds reason perhaps to suspect that the cold shoulder is shown him ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand aghast at any such apparition , and he goes away swelling with indignation at its impenetrable aristocracy . Or , a brother of Sir Plume , - " Of amber snuff-box justly vain , And the nice conduct of a clouded cane , " he looks for great effects to an exhibition of himself which really reflects credit on nobody hut the tailor and hair-dresser who made him . He appears in the barbaro-puritan city of the East , and if he is nothing hut well-dressed , not a fan nor a heart knows a single added flutter ; and the view of an aristocracy which chills even maidenly enthusiasm , is wormwood to his more enlightened spirit . Or , having been lifted as high on the shoulders of a mob , as that stature of which " the mind " is not " the measure " can reach , he falls in with such as have little awe for official dignity , except as it has been attained by merit , or been made the means of conscientious public services ; and the sight of their aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rank and title , ' ' respect for birth , " " family pride , " " grandees " who " look down upon the working classes , " in New England ! " Tell that to "  --  the part of the crew that does not sail the ship . " Rank and title " Everybody knows , or may know , that with us the rural squire ( and not a few of them are there ) is company for the governor ; and the priest or the schoolmaster for either ; and the hard-handed , worthy man , who built the house they meet in , for them all . They are avowedly and actually fit companions , and ( if need be , as it ofien is , ) equal opponents for each other , in the cares of public life . They are avowedly and actually fit companions at the hospitable board . " Respect for birth " ! Our blood is all one stream . It makes our union , not our division . It is that which in the olden day , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained full many a cavalier 's sabre on the other side of the water , and full many a savage tomahawk , in these western wilds ; the same red , warm , honest , Puritan fluid , which has always been so shy of any place in a villain 's veins , and so quick to mount when battle was to be done for principle and freedom . // " Family pride " ! If inequalities of condition among us as to property , - the only thing in which a distinction could exist , - were much greater than they are , the seven generations of New England have given time for some such ups and downs , as hardly admit of any loud assertion of such a feeling on the one hand , or any very cordial toleration of it on the other . They have given some opportunity for such repetition of the wise man 's spectacle , as is apt to occur , where there are no laws of entail , to interfere with the levelling operations of nature , - " servants upon horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New England , only with some checks arising from less volatile temperament , and more frugal prevailing habits , the progress and decline of family fortunes has been essentially the same as in other places , where a similar freedom for advancing and ruining one 's self has been enjoyed . The first generation has stood behind the counter . The second , retaining the habits to which it was early formed , and possessing every advantage of education , has adorned with all elegances , as well as often with all virtues , the station in which it entered upon life ; the third has been apt to drive , four in hand , to the bottom of the strong-box ; and the fourth , educated without method Or good example , and mortified by its " false position , " has had much harder work to rise , if it were so disposed , than did the founder of the domestic dynasty . And however it may be in less permanent communities , where people " come like shadows , so depart , " hereabouts we know each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to favor the purposes of any who should be inclined to fall out with the ladder they rose by , even if our habits of estimating character did not lead us to respect the fortunate heir , who should chance to have nothing else to recommend him , much less than we respect the memory of the honest and capable man , who gathered for him the means to make his coxcombry conspicuous . There is hereditary wealth in New England . - But , for the most part , the rich men of its cities are those who have come to them from the country , poor , and have made their way by industry and talent , and the qualities which make it honorable to rise . In many communities , this process , however desirable else , would bring vulgarity forward into thc high places of society . Here it is not so . Poor these adventurers were , when they started in life , compared with what they have made // themselves . But they did not therefore rise from the kennel . The furthest possible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of families , who were there as good as their neighbours , and as much trained to refinement of mind and manners . Accordingly , they brought with them no danger that they would shame the prosperity they might attain .

The hunks , ( we have to be indebted to English dramatic literature for the term , because , in the richest part of this country , scarcely having the thing , we have found no occasion for the name , ) the hunks is a specimen of our motley nature , of which we know little , except by hearsay . No doubt there may possibly he , now and then , a person just wise enough to make some money , yet foolish enough to think too much of it , and too much of himself on its account . But even such a person takes care to he incommunicatively " alone in his glory , " unless he is very patient of the mortification which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grandees " who " instruct their children to give themselves airs , and make them believe they are of a higher race than the rest of their countrymen " ! For the curiosity of the thing , we would gladly travel to any part of New England , to see one of those children of a grandee practising upon his august parent 's discipline , and mark the reception it would meet . Why , nothing is more notorious than that the richest and best-named father , with all the influence of his worth , not to say of his wealth , can not so much as keep his son on a footing in good society , if the youth is known to be a profligate . Loss of caste is the inevitable penalty . And on the other hand , how vast must he the influence of blood and guineas , when any one , who has actually been in the good society of New England , knows that he has habitually met there the distinguished male and female teacher of youth , on a perfectly equal footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say merely their honored guest , - for hospitality may be but patronage , - but exchanging with them , on perfectly equal terms , the attentions that belong to an elegant social intercourse . This is nothing to boast of . It is no more than sensible and cultivated people find to belong to their own position , and their own pleasure , as well as that of others . But the fact furnishes an awkward text for such an expounder // of national character , as the writer from whom we have just been quoting . We hope " The Monthly Magazine " is in no danger of cooling in its love of us , since its regretted emigration . But so it is , that it has taken to goading us in a tender part of our fame . In a notice of the Address of Mr. Sprague , which we commended in our last number , it quotes that gentleman 's declaration that " enthusiasm was the characteristic of our fathers , " and remarks ; " We do not think that he proves his proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that feeling which impelled the Puritans to seek a home in the wilderness of the New World ; and the bigoted despotism with which they domineered over all who departed from their stern creed , and who would not consent to stand , day and night , in the strait jacket , in which they enveloped alike the feeble and the strong , should not be dignified with the name of enthusiasm . " It was wicked , impute it to what cause we may . The tyranny , with which they were oppressed in England , was light in comparison to the relentless and unsated animosity with which they pursued the Quakers , the most harnless and kindest sect the world ever saw . These dark traits in the character of our forefathers certainly deserve not the epithet enthusiastic . " We quote this form of the charge , because we like to quote something ; and not because it is necessary , in order to show that we are not tilting against a man of straw . Anybody who was curious about this description of remarks , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly among those belonging to the classes in literature which have a kind of conventional liberty to use confidence , and eschew qualifications . When Lord Castlereagh had uttered himself in the House of Commons , the newspapers used to say that his Lordship had been " airing his vocabulary . " It is the limited vocabulary , of which the periods quoted above are a specimen , that a certain class of writers are wont to air , when they undertake the demerits of New England . What we shall say upon the topic , will do them no good . New England bigotry is an easy phrase to remember and to write , and very many times will they yet compound it , while they " build the lofty line . " The object of their disapprobation must endeavour that it may cause her as little grief as may be . We have hope of her that she will sustain no irremediable , at least no intolerable harm . // She has looked , sooner and later , on a good deal of such spilt ink , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she survived the seeing of the queen 's majesty . " Fanaticism is the more appropriate term for a part of that feeling , which impelled the Puritans to seek a home in the wilderness of the New World . " That is partly as people think . The assertion is one of that indefiniteness , which renders it particularly difficult to confute ; and at all events , it does not admit of being met , without entering into a course of discussion which does not comport with the habits of this journal . For ourselves , let us but know that we were animated by the feeling which impelled those glorious men to execute their glorious work , and anybody should be welcome to call it by any name , which might suit his notions of justice or of euphony . " The tyranny with which they were oppressed in England , was light in comparison to the relentless and unsated animosity with which they pursued the Quakers , the most harmless and kindest sect the world ever saw . " This comparison , we doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . We incline to the opinion , that there is that in their testimony , which will not allow it to be maintained . As for the eminence of the sect of Quakers for harmlessness and kindness , among all which the world has seen , the world has seen Quakers of the beginning of the seventeenth century as well as of the beginning of the ninetcenth ; and they did not look alike ; and if the essential guilt of persecution would be aggravated , when aimed against the quiet , patient philanthropist of the present day , it does not therefore follow that it would be attended with like aggravation , however wicked else , when the subject was the mischievous madman of two centuries ago , with whom the Massachusetts colonists had to deal . We suppose that the duty of toleration , comprehensive though it be , stops somewhere short of allowing men and women , for conscience sake , to run , as naked as they were born , through the streets , and into the churches ; or at all events , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name like Abraham 's by sacrificing their own sons , as one of the Quakers , in 1658 , was proceeding to do , when his neighbours , alarmed by the boy 's cries , broke into the house in time to interfere . " The relentless and unsated animosity with which they pursued the Quakers " ! We had always read , that it was the // Quakers who pursued them . It may be that the Quakers caught a Tartar in Puritan raiment , at last ; and then so much the worse for both hunter and game ; but that it was the Quaker bugle that cheered on the chase , no one can doubt who thinks that there is truth in history . Grant that it would have been better to imitate in New England the example of the Pope , or still better that of the Grand Turk , the former of whom put Fox 's emissaries in one of his Hospitals of St. Luke , and the latter treated them with that ceremonious respect , which it is a Mohammedan superstition to pay to alienation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrates must be considered as a remarkable one , for such as were impelled to a pursuit by a relentless and unsated animosity . When the Quakers found them out , in their distant hiding-place from the storm , they contented themselves with merely sending them back by the vessels which had brought them , thinking that both might live more satisfactorily , if they lived apart . The Quakers persisted , and were sent away a second time . A third time they came . Severer penalties were then resorted to . They were such as did not affect life , but they were too harsh to carry the public opinion along with them , and recourse was again had to the experiment of removal of the offensive visitants out of the jurisdiction . It failed ; and at length , by the majority of a single voice , the assembly passed that law denouncing the punishment of death against Quakers returned from banishment , which has had its chief life in history , for it was repealed almost as soon as enacted . The whole contest , from first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued about four years , when a more humane policy possessed itself of the public councils , and the Quakers , having carried the day , or rather finding more peaceable times than suited the manifestation of their gifts , gradually disappeared from the field . We will not repeat what , in a different connexion , we found occasion to say , in a recent number , upon this popular subject of the persecuting spirit of the founders of New England. * Nor will we dwell on the facts , of recent occurrence on the other side of the water , when the Quakers first landed here , which caused them to find the colonists in a state of most sensitive apprehension respecting the spread of fanatical // doctrines , which seemed to threaten the overthrow of all decency of private morals , and the dissolution of civil society , and to he particularly perilous to themselves in their yet unformed state . But we wish we could make our countrymen of other portions of the Union look a little more closely , than they have done , at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some of them appear to think a single severe paragraph or period quite sufficient to despatch . It is a great grief and offence to them , that church membership was made a qualification for the enjoyment of the franchises of a freeman of the colony . Let them chide , if they must . But we can tell them , that they would have had to wait somewhat longer for their independence , if it had not been for this intolerant spirit of New England legislation , which gives them so much disturbance . Lord Clarendon tells us , that the Royal Commissioners , sent out in 1664 , found the northern colonies already " hardened into republics . " They had been a short time hardening . What hardened them so fast ? Nothing more than the jealous and rigid pertinacity , with which they adhered to their theory of exclusion from political power , of all who might have used it to strangle their embryo commonwealth . It will not do to look upon the Massachusetts fathers as a set of heady zealots , careful only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that way not a very wise one . There were cool and far-sighted statesmen at the helm . King or Protector to the contrary notwithstanding , they meant to have a republic ; and they had it virtually from the first , exercising with the utmost freedom all attributes of sovereignty , though avoiding all ostentation of it with the utmost address . They were not so unfit for their delicate work , as to he willing to commit power to any who would have used it to obstruct their object , or even who would not sympathize with them in hearty zeal for its accomplishment . They meant that no man , attached to the monarchy of England through attachment to its Church , ( whether that should turn out to be Papal or Episcopal , ) should have a particle of power to annoy them in the prosecution of their great work ; and therefore if such a man came to live among them , they would have it that he should come as the subject , not as the sharer , of their government . Dexterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical a game , and little fit would they have been to win it , if they had volunteered to show // their hands to his Majesty 's Privy Council . To exclude churchmen from power , and admit to it other dissenters from their own communion , would have been to deprive their act of all color , even if otherwise it would have perfectly attained their end . Taking advantage of their reputation abroad for acting under impulses , which observers , less sagacious than themselves , supposed to be the only ones that had power over their minds , they cut off indiscriminately those who did not love their creeds from all participation in the government , and were quite willing that others should be stupid enough to ascribe to a stupid bigotry of theirs , a measure , which , had it been seen to be prompted , as it was , by the profoundest policy , would have brought down on them , too soon , the hard and heavy hand of England . So they had their own way , without any one in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their institutions , till , by the time when the second generation came forward , they had " hardened into republics . " So they kept up and bequeathed the intense and constant spirit they had brought with them . So they stood quietly by their arms , to watch the signs of the times , and do what , from one time to another , might be needful for the keeping of the treasure they had no mind to part with . So they were ready to depose and imprison a king 's governor , as they actually did in Boston , in 1688 ; and if matters had then gone otherwise in England , they would perhaps have antedated the Revolution by nearly a century . So they built firm the foundations of the commonwealths , which at length did the part of New England , - were that little or much ,  - -  - in the War of Independence . Blot the franchise laws of the Massachusetts colonists out of history , - for the sake of getting clear of the diatribes which small wits indite upon their bi0otry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council chambers of the New England Puritans , and we do not like to say , - for we are modest Yankees , no less than well-affectioned , - we do not like to hint how differently , by this time , the history , not only of one continent , but of the other , would have read . As to bigotry now-a-days , there is plenty of religious narrowness all the world over , and we do not mean to say that there is drawn around New England any spell to exclude the pest . But we do say , with confidence , and not without the opportunity of some observation upon other communities , that we know no part of this country , or of any other , where differences // in religious opinion do less to check the friendliness of general intercourse , or disturb the intimacies of private life . We claim for our compatriots , whether of one way of belief or another , the credit of as intelligent perceptions of the reasons on which they found their faith , as are possessed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the well-informed , but the ignorant sectary , by whatsoever name he may call himself , that is most likely to be exclusive and bitter . He who has respected his own mind so much as to enlighten it , will be all the more likely to respect those of others ; and whoever has examined a question to the bottom , has found occasion to look at reasons , which he is no longer surprised should have weight with others , though they do not satisfy himself . The great variety of sects among us , making a universal toleration the interest of each , is a circumstance not a little favorable to the diffusion of a spirit of mutual candor . In the general interest felt in the subject , members of the same family are often members of different religious connexions ; and fathers and mothers , and brothers and sisters , will know how to believe us when we say , that the mutual exhibition of a spirit of piety , under different professions , in the domestic circle , hardly admits the indulgence of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is the creed which one disapproves . And perhaps , more than all , the universal mtitual acquaintance and equality of our people in their childhood and youth , which has led us to these remarks , is absolutely and mightily hostile to any such result . You can not pick a John Knox out of the mob of hearty , laughing boys , who sweep by you in their hot game - of football , as you pass near the village school . There is not an urchin of them that has ever entertained the question , " Shall I give up the friend I have valued and tried , If he kneel not before the same altar with me ? " A very different thing from a Saint Dominic is that sweet little girl , who sits at her needle in all good understanding with her companions , though some of the group go with their parents to worship at the old meeting-house , some to the chancelled church , and some to the Methodist tabernacle . She herself goes perhaps to the Quaker conventicle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouting done , as they pass each other on the way . They learn to love each other before they have learned the definition of the word creed , to // say nothing of the definition of the matters which creeds contain . They learn these things too , in due time , but too late for them to be dispossessed of their childish experience , and made to believe , that to think otherwise than they think , is necessarily to be knave or fool ; nor do they easily fall into that delusion , even when they come forward to be prominent members , in the same circle , of the sects to which inquiry or circumstances have severally attached them . At all events , while sects in New England pursue energetically their separate objects , they are for the most part content to do this , without manifestations of mutual ill-will or disrespect ; nor are individuals , connected with them respectively , prevented from being each other 's bosom friends , or cordial fellow-laborers in some common cause . There are instances , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting exceptions to these remarks ; but theirs is any thing but the characteristic spirit of the region . We have , on the contrary , sometimes had occasion to witness elsewhere an acerbity of feeling connected with sectarian distinctions , and interfering with the courtesies of social intercourse , of which we never saw a solitary example in these New England States . We started upon this course of remark by saying , that from the equal footing upon which our children in New England are bred together at the schools , there is engendered among the people a feeling of personal independence , as well as that sense of mutual respect , which is hostile to aristocratic or sectarian assumptions . That under such circumstances , the natural tendency of a boy 's education would be , to make him an independently thinking and acting man , no one would question . That such is actually the result to be witnessed in the character of the mature New England mind , is a point which we can not give up , though it seems to be questioned in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lately had extensive circulation in the Western country . They come from a very high source , but it is only , on that account , the more our duty to take notice of them . Dr. Channing , in a letter to the Editor of " The Western Messenger , " published in last October 's number of that periodical , and reprinted in a separate form , writes as follows ; " Shall I say a word of evil of this good city of Boston ? Among all its virtues it does not ahound in a tolerant spirit . The yoke of opinion is a heavy one , often crushing individuality // of judgment and action . A censorship , unfriendly to free exertion , is exercised over the pulpit as well as over other concerns . No city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspection , and what is called public sentiment . We stand more in awe of one another than most people . Opinion is less individual , or runs more into masses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when enlightened , lofty , pure , is a useful sovereign ; but , in the present imperfect state of society , it has its evils , as well as benefits . It suppresses the grosser vices , rather than favors the higher virtues . It favors public order , rather than originality of thought , moral energy , and spiritual life . " Expressly , this is said only of Boston . But all the world , ( that part of the world , which thinks about the matter , ) thinks , and thinks truly , that Boston represents New England , in respect to the leading points of character . And a reader of the remarks quoted will consider himself still further justified , in giving them this comprehensive application , by language which he finds further on . That such was the writer 's intention , we neither affirm nor deny . It is no part of our object to fix a broader or narrower meaning on the words , but to protest against a prejudice which we are sure they will be so understood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me desire to visit it . I desire to see nature under new aspects ; but still more to see a new form of society . I hear of the defects of the West ; but I learn that a man there feels himself to be a man ; that he has a self-respect , which is not always to be found in older communities ; that he speaks his mind freely ; that he acts more from generous impulses , and less from selfish calculations . These are good tidings ; I rejoice that the intercourse between the East and West is increasing . Both will profit . The West may learn from us the love of order , the arts which adorn and cheer life , the institutions of education and religion , which lie at the foundation of our greatness , and may give us in return the energies and virtues which belong to and distinguish a fresher state of society . " We wish , as much as those who wish it most , for a freer intercourse between different parts of these United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which makes the subject of an earlier paper in this number of our journal , we are even fain to recognise a seasonable arrangement of that Providence , which has great // things to accomplish for the world by the continued union of this nation , - to obstruct what else would he the natural tendencies of the rapid extension of our territory , to say nothing of some other elements of mutual repulsion . And to the frank and generous character of the people of the West , we lately , * as at other times , had the satisfaction of bearing our full and cordial tribute . IBut as to travelling to the West , or to any other quarter of the horizon , for the sake of taking lessons in self-respect , freedom of thought or speech , or the habit of acting " more from generous impulses , and less from selfish calculations , " we are slow to believe that the descendants of the Pilgrims are yet reduced to any such necessity . We partly agree with Dr. Channing in regretting that habit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he specifies in connexion with what we have quoted , and by the mention of which he was led to those more comprehensive remarks . But to regard It as an indication of a prevailing intolerance of public opinion , we think would be generalizing , altogether too far , what belongs to the relations sustained by one profession . Mainly , we suppose , the fact complained of is to be viewed as a traditionary consequence of the position which the clergy occupied in our primitive times . They exerted an influence greater than that of any other class in society . The doctrine they taught was the leading subject of solicitude and inquiry ; how could it be otherwise , than that what they said should be narrowly watched , and thoroughly canvassed ? Moreover , their opinions had direct practical bearings upon the community 's movements . The annunciation of their opinions had immediate practical results . How could it be , but that , when important interests of their hearers were to be affected by views which they should take , those views should become the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their preaching . With respect to its being made the subject of criticism in a different point of view , - that of a rhetorical exhibition , - it is to be remembered that the clergy have been the scholars of New England , through a great portion of its history . The people , for a long time , looked to them for their standard of taste in composition , and each congregation had a pride in the literary name of its pastor . Habits of this sort do not cease at once , // when , by a change of circumstances , the original cause becomes less operative . They are of a kind extremely likely to be transmitted , by force of the mere example of elders . If the literary merits of preaching are now discussed in New England to a degree greater than these considerations will satisfactorily explain , it is natural to refer to the fact , that , up to the present time , some of the most eminent ornaments of our literature are found among the clergy . As to any intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not a ware that opinions there expressed are more exposed to sifting and comment than in other l ) laces , where the subjects of pulpit discourse command an equal interest on the hearer 's part . We have thought , indeed , that a somewhat peculiar latitude was allowed in this respect . We are old enough to remember that many of the clergy , in the high political excitements of twenty and thirty years ago , gave expressions of their views , which were most offensive to a large portion of their hearers , and that few were made to suffer any inconvenience on that account . Dr. Channing alludes , in this connexion , to a prevailing distaste for extemporaneous preaching . We shall not undertake to say , that it is not carried too far , though in some cases , where that method *of address has been successfully attempted , the distaste has not been found insurmountable . But we are inclined to trace it , not so much to an intolerance of rhetorical inaccuracy , - for then it would affect equally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but to an impatience of those exaggerations , into which an extemporaneous speaker on an abstract subject , is very likely to fall , in the warmth of his excitement or the exigencies of his invention . For the rest , sermon-making is a favorite form of literature among the New England people ; what wonder then , that , having a taste formed on good models , they should be somewhat fastidious about it ? The populace of Athens were strict critics of a play ; were they subject , therefore , to a general charge of want of a tolerant spirit ? did they therefore exercise " a censorship unfriendly to free exertion ? " Further ; wherever great subjects are thoroughly and freely canvassed , there some conclusions are likely to be reached that is to say , there will be eventually some strong and definite bias of public opinion . So , no doubt , it is in New England ; and , for ourselves , we are fond of regarding the // phenomenon in question , as a gratifying fruit and proof of free discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a bias of public opinion is not itself intolerance ; for a corn community , which has opinions , and understands their grounds , like an individual in the same condition , is not only not dispossessed of its candor by its intelligence , but is all the more likely to be candid , on that account . Let us see , however , whether intolerance is actually superinduced upon it , with its supposed result of " crushing individuality of judgment and action . " The question , thus , becomes twofold . We do not know better how to try it , than by taking the case of politicians . No case can be fairer ; for , in the movements of politicians , every man feels himself to be interested , and a politician every man can reach by his vote . Do the New England people , then , keep a Procrustes ' bed for their public servants , or are they rather fond of allowing them considerable latitude , when convinced of their intelligence and honesty ? Two or three facts , by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such , which we have not room to set down . - The war of 1812 has been the great party question of these times . One of the old parties was broken down , by taking the unlucky side in relation to it . Except by popular election , not a man can , at this day , set his foot in the federal councils , who is known to have disapproved that measure , unless he is also known to have since eaten his words . Though the voice of New England was against it , there can be no doubt that an overwhehning majority of the generation which has since come up , is , - rightly or otherwise , - of a different mind ; nor is there any more doubt , that , on that most exciting point , a politician among us may adopt the exploded doctrine , without prejudice to his prospects of advancenient . The case may be the same , elsewhere ; it is enough for us , that it is so here . - The practice of Instructions to Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ; nor with all the citizen 's natural jealousy of his agent , is the doctrine , sustaining that practice , by any means acquiesced in , as part of the true constitutional theory . The legislature of one of our States , a short time ago , adopting an exotic fashion , invited its Senator in Congress to obey its mandate or resign ; and it got a lesson for its pains , which it will not speedily forget . - Elsewhere there is a // habit of writing letters to candidates for public office , to exact from them pledges respecting the manner , in which they will use their possible discretion in some supposed emergency of the future . The thing has not been much more than heard of , in these eastern ends of the earth . - As to Boston particularly , let one fact have a hearing . The last incumbent of the mayoralty but one , was a gentleman of excellent qualifications for that office , and he sustained it admirably well . He was chosen to it , at a period of strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side on the absorbing question of national politics , and a large majority of the electors belonged to the other . We defy any one to infer the want of a tolerant spirit , from a fact like this . It is to no purpose to say , that police duties have small connexion with questions of general politics . In feverish times , it is not in this way , that partisans reason , where intolerance prevails . Intolerant party leaders are equal to harder feats than that of persuading intolerant followers , that the mere elevation of an opponent to a post of dignity and personal influence , is a desertion of the common cause . On the other hand , supposing the intolerance of the mass to be greater , is there a disposition on the part of those on whom it would operate , to let it break them down to a pusillanimous abandonment of liberty of thought and action ? This is the other part of the question . And respecting this we insist , that there are , in this same matter of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any general disposition of the kind . Candid , tolerant , trusting , large-minded as a community may be , still a degree of surveillance by the citizen over the course and character of the public officer , is the proper and the necessary incident of republican administrations . For the public good , the thing ought to be ; but however generously interpreted on the part whence it proceeds , such supervision involves a degree of discomfort to a man of a sensitively independent mind . As far as the conditions of humanity permit , he would prefer to be responsible only to his sense of duty and his God ; at least , not to be responsible to such , as can but imperfectly understand , however respectfully they may confide in him . Accordingly , such a man will not be inordinately covetous of public office . Considerations of public duty , when they can be made apparent , will of course move him to undertake it . But as a // matter of personal ambition , he will not desire it much . And especially , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popularity , which appear to him to be mortifications of one 's self-respect . With all charity for everybody , he will be indisposed to the attentions , which the low-minded may think themselves entitled to exact from him , by their power of giving or withholding a vote . He will be iml ) atient of being questioned , as to whether , in a given state of things , he will humor one or another prejudice , or so much as take one or another part . He has no relish even for that canvassing , by friend and foe , of his modes of thought and action , which is necessary to show the voters that he is the best man they could possibly elect . Now it is impossible , in our view , not to trace to this jealousy of personal independence , which ( with the fairest constituency , ) is somewhat threatened in the relations of public life , the fact that , in all quiet times , a large portion of the best spirits of New England have preferred to devote themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of the writers whom we have quoted above , has tortured it into a support of his charge of aristocratic pride . " The upper class , " he says , ( p. 514 , above , ) " are often too refined to attend to their political duty . They are too much immersed in letters and pleasure , too sublimated , to descend to the vulgar arena of elections . " This is not so . As to voting merely , it is , to a striking degree , the habit of all conditions in New England , to repair to the elections , and give their ballots , as the lists of voters in the towns , at any election , compared with the census of the towns respectively , would show . And as to public service , among all times of moment and peril , when the best men New England possessed were wanted for that employment , we should like to see one era pointed out , when plenty of her best men were not furnished . We own it , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ (  --  and we dare say , it may be that of other places equally ,  --  ) that good men aie intended for other uses , besides those of politics ; - for politics , doubtless , but for other uses too . And we own , further , that there are New England habits and instincts , as well as principles and sentiments , adverse to the business of office-seeking . They are such as would hardly admit the introduction among us , of machinery which exists elsewhere . We find no fault with methods elsewhere // approved . Let every community choose its own . For most established and unquestioned customs , there is some good local foundation ; and the custom of speaking at elections , in furtherance of one 's own claims , is observed and upheld by good and honorable men , who are better judges of its effect , where it prevails , than we could pretend to be . But it has , and has had , no existence among us . Except a soi-disant " Orator , " we cotild not name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , taken that step for his own elevation . And in this , and other like facts , indicating a reserve and shyness in respect to public office , we find any thing rather than a weak willingness to bow to a community 's dictation , or conciliate its goodwill and good offices by any unbecoming sacrifice . Let us tell those who will believe us , once for all , that the New England people , while they are tolerant of the various ways of acting and thinking , are rather characteristically chary of their own . They are not inclined to hear hard upon others , and they are unmanageably restive , when borne hard upon . So far from being blamably easy and compliant , they have rather , from the time of the Puritan fathers down , been marked by qualities exposing them to be charged with the opf ) osite faults of a very " fierce democratic . " To be sure of keeping straight , they have been not unapt to lean backwards . It has been extremely true of them , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not go. * And we commend this well-ascertained trait of their character to the * " The people began to fear , lest , by reirlecting Winthrop , they should make way for a governor for life .

Upon which John Cotton , their great ecclesiastical head , then at the height of his popularity , preached a discourse to the General Court , and delivered this doctrine ; that a magis. trate ought not to be turned out , without just cause , no more than a magistrate might turn out a private man from his freehold without trial . ' To show their dislike of the doctrine by the most practical of evidences , our ancestors turned out Winthrop at the very same election , and put in Dudley . The year after , they turned out Dudley , and put in Haynes . The year after , they turned out Haynes , and put in Vane . "  --  Quincy 's Centennial *1ddress. p. 33 .

" - Ibid. , p. 35. // attention of some belligerents of the newspaper press , whose course it would improve . Upon the matter which we have been treating , Mr. Fennimore Cooper deserves to he heard . 1-Je has no partiality for New England , to bring suspicion on his evidence . On the contrary , the politics , which most characterize her modern history , he hates as heartily as if they deserved to he hated . But his impressions respecting the self-respect and individuality of her people are strikingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made . " The effect of this diffusion of common instruction is preeminently apparent throughout New England , in the self-respect , decency , order , and individuality of its inhabitants . I say individuality , because , by giving ideas to a man , you impart the principles of a new existence , which supply additional motives of concern to his respectability and well-being . You are not to suppose that men become selfish by arriving nearer to a right understanding of their own natures and true interests , since all experience proves that we become humane and charitable precisely as we become conscious of our own defects , and obtain a knowledge of the means necessary to repair them . A remarkable example of this truth is to be found in New England itself . Beyond a doubt , nowhere is to be found a population so well instructed , in elementary knowledge , as the people of these six States . It is equally true , that I have nowhere witnessed such a universality of that sqf respect which preserves men from moral degradation . " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a union of the utmost scope to individual enterprise with the most sacred regard to the rights and feelings of the less fortunate of our species , be any evidence of an approximation to this desired condition of society , I think the inhabitant of New England has a better right to claim an elevated state of being than any other people I have ever visited . The activity of personal efforts is everywhere visible on the face of the land , in their comforts , abundance , improvements , and progressive wealth , while the effect of a humanity that approaches almost to refinement , was felt at every house I entered . Let me not be mnisunderstood : I can readily conceive that a European gentleman , who had not been , like myself , put on his guard , would have found numberless grounds of complaint , because he was not treated as belonging to a superior class of beings by those with whom he was compelled to hold communication .

My comforts and tastes , too , were uniformly consulted ; and , although I often travelled in a portion of the country that was but little frequented , at every inn I met with neatness , abundance , and a manner in which a desire to oblige me was blended with a singula* respect for themselves .

" - Ibid. , pp. 96 , 97 . We had something further to say on this last point ; but we must hasten to reward our readers ' patience , by releasing it . We have not volunteered this course of remark . Self-vindication , for a general rule , is not the most dignified office . But it is forced upon us by the existence and expression of sentiments , on the part of some of our fellow-citizens of other sections of the country , which it is not good for them nor for us that they should entertain . What we have been submitting to their consideration , has been said quite as much in justice to them , as to ourselves ; for we ought not be willing to have their minds abused by prejudices , which we can do any thing to dispel . For the rest , it is not they who are the objects of a groundless unfavorable opinion , that have the worst , hut they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , as well as other people , the good opinion of our neighbours , it is a thing which , in the last resort , we can afford to do without . Character is a better thing than reputation . If we take care enough to deserve the latter , it is likely that , in the long run , we shall have it , in all quarters where we shall think it of much account . But even if that result should fail , it would be a disappointment not absolutely beyond the power of endurance . We have heard wi-th sorrow and surprise , that some persons , understood to be emigrants from New England , have been known to give their countenance to calumnies circulated against her character ; - surprise , we say , but it is a surprise which // a little consideration tends largely to abate . That the number of such cases is small , we feel the strongest assurance . Of the crowds , who , in obedience to their native spirit of enterprise , pour from this officina gentium year by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good feeling , to cherish , wherever they go , among the most sacred sentiments of their souls , the reverence and gratitude which they owe to the home they have relinquished . As often as occasion presents itself , they are true enough to themselves , to be ready with a manly vindication of its character ; and they vindicate that character best by an honorable exhibition of it , in their own persons . But it would be extravagant to presume , that this will be the case with all . Among such numbers , it is to be supposed that there will he here and there one without character , - at least , without reflection , or without heart ; and that there will he others ,  --  honest and sensible men , too , in the main , - who are yet laboring under unfortunate biases . An individual , for instance , - it is not an uncommon case , - has left his New England home in early manhood , with his fortune all to seek . His nativity was cast in a comparatively mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reverse . In his new sphere he rises to wealth , consequence , popularity ; what xvonder , that , looking back thence on his birthplace , as the place only of his obscurity and indigence , he should have some feeling as if it had been unjust to him , unless he be discriminating enough to observe , that had he remained by his home to exercise the industry and intelligence which have elevated him , they would have yielded him there a like harvest to what he has elsewhere been gathering . That such a person should allow himself in unkind , disparaging comparisons between the scene of his brighter fortunes , and that which gave him the power to advance himself , is certainly in some degree excusable , if it is in no degree wise . - Some emigrants , it is to he apprehended there will he , of an entirely opposite character . There will be single instances of such as have gone abroad , simply on account of the bad odor they were in , at home . " True patriots they ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for their country 's good . " Their representations of the society which would not tolerate them , are not likely to he of the most favorable kind ; but their representations are of less account , by reason of the less // credit they will command . And between these two classes is yet another , of which , on manifest principles of human nature , we presume there are some few specimens , but which it is harder to reduce to any precise description . There are young persons , more or less well inclined and well principled , who are yet impressible and movable , to almost any extent , by the power of sympathy . It is not merely calculation , - it may be , much more , a mere foolish facility , - which disposes them to adopt , wherever they go , the habits of thought as well as of speech and behaviour , which they fiuid to prevail around them . This is not characteristically a New England frailty ; the contrary , rather ; it is but one of the endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hosts of New England emigrants , it is to be supposed that some will he found affected by it . In such cases , there will be sometimes an extraordinarily sudden and marked transformation . The Yankee youth , whom one meets in some remote city , or plantation , or wild , will be found as outrageously anti-New England , as the proselyte is warm against the principles he has forsaken , or the nouveau riche is inveterate against every thing which pertains to the shop . In certain visible symptoms , pertaining to the same disease , you have tolerably sure prognostics how such a person will speak of his home , before the subject has been introduced . If you remark , that whatever is peculiar in the forms of language of his new residence has been sedulously adopted , you may confidently augur that he has meant to make himself over again , merging all his Yankee identity in the process . If a dirk-hilt , or pistol handle , peeps from beneath his vest , ( things which a decent man in New England would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his walk with a four-pounder trailed behind him , ) you may be sure that New England parsimony , aristocracy , bigotry , and the rest , will find no quarter at his hands . It will be of no use to tell him , that , whatever his new associates may think of his country , they will think none the better of him for so ready an adoption of their views concerning it . It will be all in vain , at present , to commend to his attention the universal concurrence in the truth of the homely maxim , that " it is an ill bird that defiles its own nest . " You must wait . LIe is not to be despaired ofJ He may come to his wisdom , and his sense of character , yet ; and then he will come , at the same time , to bitter humiliation and regret for the recreant nonsense // he has vented . If , in the mean while , the mother that hore him must he prejudiced hy his abuse , her greatest grief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of his folly . We designed to speak further than we now can do , of Mr. Bradford 's " History of Massachusetts for Tr*o Hundred Years " ; particularly with reference to its introduction , as a text-hook , into our common schools . Besides being in form extremely convenient for that purpose , it is the work of a gentleman with whom our New England history has been the study of a life , and who , from the official relation which he long sustained , as Secretary of the Commonwealth , enjoyed peculiar advantages for its prosecution . Without saying that , in all respects , the work is all that could he desired for the purpose , we are sure , that , under the direction of competent instructers , it would render excellent service to our youth . At any rate , if this volume is not all that might he wished , let one be produced which would be . If need be , let the Cornrnonweahh offer a prize , suhable to obtain a history for the schools , from the best mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , in the Secretary 's Abstract of School Returns for 1836 , that in the schools of several towns , some history of the United States is studied , and in some Irving 's " Life of Columbus " ; while in only one , that of Scituate , have we remarked any mention of a history of Massachusetts as a text*book. * These things should be done , but the other should not be left undone . As far as public provision can effect it , Massachusetts should not suffer one of her children to leave her borders , or grow up within them , without knowing well the history , to the end of being the more imbued with the spirit , of his excellent birthplace . * The existing laws , which we perceive we have not fully described in the beginning of this article , are as follows . Towns consisting of 50 , 100 , 150 , or 500 families , must support one or more common schools , for terms , in every year , the aggregate of which shall be 6 , 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 families , in addition to their Common Schools , must support , 10 months annually , a school where instruction shall be given in the History of the United States , book-keeping , surveying , geometry , and algebra . Towns of 4000 inhabitants must have their school of this latter class under the care of a master , able to teach Latin and Greek , general history , rhetoric , and logic.
