txt I BEGIN with the first person singular , partly because I love to talk about myself , and partly that my readers may know that their adviser speaks from experience . There are infinite varieties of gun-barrels , each of which has its admirers , who will uphold that it is superior to all others . Every owl thinks its own young the handsomest . You will , no doubt , have been acquainted with some old and renowned sportsman , who has told you that he has killed a single pigeon with his favorite gun , at a hundred yards . Do not , therefore , buy a piece of the precise length and calibre he recommends . Setting exaggeration aside , the good man has told you of a single shot only . He has forgotten that he has missed a thousand times at a less distance . The ticket which draws the highest prize is remembered ; the blanks are forgotten . rrake it as a rule , that when you fire at a small bird more than forty-five yards off , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be true , yet your shot may so scatter , that the object shall remain untouched . The utmost possible distance that hail-shot will kill , is something like twenty rods . I have killed a duck , at a hundred and twenty yards , but it was one of a flock ; my shot were great Bs , and the drop that killed him , struck him in the head . It was mere chance . Sometimes a single hint , in a dull sermon , hits the conscience of some individual sinner . To shoot woodcocks , partridges , and such birds as rise suddenly , fly irregularly , and drop soon , a short gun is best . Charge heavily with fine shot ; fill the atmosphere with particles of lead . When your dog points , cock your piece , and place your finger on the trigger . When the bird rises , point your gun at him , and fire . It is ten to one that some grain strikes him . Thus , if you let fly a volley of compliments at a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very like the fair ; once touched , though never so slightly , you are sure of them . I have heard some sportsmen say that they took aim at woodcocks ; and , perhaps , they spoke truly , but I never could . I believe there is not one man in fifty whose eye and hand are as quick as a woodcock 's wing . Some of the best cock-shooters I have known , do not bring the gun to the shoulder at all , but point and fire , breast high , like the British Infantry . A long barreled piece is best to shoot at aquatic fowls , and all such birds as fly steadily . Some persons aim before them , and let them cross the track of their shot . I do not think that this way will suit any but men whose motions are very quick . I have always used to take aim at the bird , and accompany him in his flight , with the sights , for a short distance . Thus the shot gets two motions ; the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . To test this principle , stand on the deck of a canal boat , and throw an apple into the air . It gets the motion of the boat , and returns , not to the point in space from which it was propelled , but directly into your hand . Just so a lawyer humors his client , never firing across his temper , and thus bags him with certainty . // It is said , that the longer the barrel , the closer and farther it carries the shot . I doubt it . After a certain length of tube , the rest evidently increases the friction ; the power to be overcome is greater ; consequently , the shot can not range so far as it would were the barrel shorter . Why should the drops strike closer ? Three feet of tube will confine and direct them as well as ten . I have found , by experiment , that a barrel of three feet ten inches , carried its shot as close as a longer bore of the same calibre . Trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these respects . Certainly you may shoot more truly with it . There must , almost always ) be some trifling inaccuracy in the aim , and the longer the gun , the less it will affect the range . However , this advantage of the long barrel is counterbalanced by its clumsiness and fatiguing weight . Your solid men are always tiresome . I have heard it advanced , that a bell-muzzled gun scatters the shot more than a straight , cylindrical tube . I believe the contrary , having tried an experiment with two guns of equal length and bore , the one bellmouthed , the other not . The only reason I can give for the fact , is , that in the straight tube the shot expand more violently for confinement ; in the other , the gradual expansion moderates this violence . Just so a clergyman 's son is more licentious than other young men . The metal of your barrel is a matter of some consequence . Brass will not answer for any but a human engine . The stuff is too light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget having fired a brass pistol with the charge of an ordinary iron one . My fingers were sadly lacerated , almost broken . Cast steel is liable , in a less degree , to the same objection . Besides , a cast steel barrel can scarcely be without.a flaw , which may affect the range , or increase the probability of bursting . Cast iron is yet worse ; a barrel made of cast iron will assuredly burst , sooner or later . Wrought iron is the best material , and the more it has been *vrought , the better . We owe this discovery to the Moors . The temper of their lance heads and scymeters was unmatched . For a long while , a Spanish-barreled gun was esteemed the best . The more iron is wrought , the softer and tougher it becomes . Horse-shoe nails , welded together , are esteemed the best material for gun barrels , and justly . A leaden barrel would shortly wear out ; a steel or brass barrel is affected by vibration . Neither of these effects is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , when a cast steel , cast iron , or brass barrel bursts , the fragments fly in every direction , to the great danger of the gunner and his companions . A stub and twist barrel , on the contrary , merely rends , and rarely injures any one . The same principles apply to the boilers of steamboats , and the human passions . Percussion locks are best on some accounts . They are water proof , and explode quicker than ordinary flint locks . There is no derangement of aim , in consequence of hanging fire , with a percussion lock . But a gun with a percussion lock has not so great a range as another of equal length and bore . It is like your quick-tempered man , whose anger does not reach far . Gunpowder burns very quick , but there is a limit to the velocity of its ignition . But a certain quantity will burn in any gun barrel . Fire an overcharged gun over snow , and you will find the superfluous particles strewed before the muzzle . All over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so much wadding . It only increase the friction , and therefore diminishes the range . The explosion of percussion powder is too quick . It drives the powder out of the barrel before it can be ignited . For woodcock or target shooting , I should prefer a percussion lock . For a long shot , I should like a common flint lock better . The fragments of a percussion cap usually fly in all directions , thereby endangering the eyes of the gunner and his companions . This difficulty is easily obviated . Let the hammer of your lock be well hollowed , and it will confine the pieces of the shattered cap , or give them a downward direction . Thus , hide your irregularities , and they will do you little harm . In selecting a lock , take one of which the work is raised from the plate , so that no two pieces rub upon each other . As to the temper , you must trust to chance . Take notice , that no flint lock is or can be water proof . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ' wear will loosen it . The parts of a closely fitted lock remind me of man and wife , as they soon wear each other out . A smooth-bored gun can never throw a single ball with perfect accuracy . The bore can not be perfectly smooth , the metal of the barrel can not be of equal density in all its parts , the bullet itself can not be perfectly globular , and can not fit the barrel exactly . Any of these matters will cause a variation between the line of sight and the line of fire . However , a thick , smooth bore will serve ordinary purposes at short distances . To make your bullet go true , see that there be no windage , that is , that there be no vacant space between it and the barrel . If it he not lar , * , e enough for the bore , envelope it in a rag or bit of leather . A rifle barrel corrects all these inaccuracies . If the ball be too heavy on one side , and , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . A bullet from a smooth bore has , probably , four motions , viz , one forward , one parabolic , caused by the power of gravity , one caused by its own inaccuracy of figure , and one rotary from the same cause . The two latter do not occur when it is propelled from a rifle . A rifle ball has three motions only , the parabolic , the forward , and the spiral . Thus , the regular motion of principle corrects the eccentric flight of passion . A rifle barrel should be thick , that the metal may not vibrate . The grooves should be distinctly but not deeply cut . There is a manifest disadvantage in increasing their number . There should be enough of them to give the ball the spiral motion , and no more . Six will affect this purpose ; all over that number increase the friction , and consequently diminish the range . The ball should be enveloped in a wrapper thick enough to make it fit closely , but not too thick . It is a common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball is rammed , the truer and farther it goes . The contrary is the case . The explosion is the more dangerous , indeed , but that does not accelerate the velocity of the bullet ; it merely strains the metal of the barrel . A tightly-loaded gun is like a woman trusted with a secret . Both are in danger of bursting . There are different tastes with regard to the length and calibre of rifle barrels . With a short one , you get sight quicker ; with a long // one , any trifling deviation from the line of aim is of the less consequence . Habit must decide in this matter . Something more positive may be said respecting the calibre . A large bore holds up the ball better than a small one . Accuracy in rifle shooting depends , when the barrel is good and properly charged , on the sights , and the poise of the piece . The barrel should never be bright ; the glimmer deceives the eye , especially in a hot day . The whole piece should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) oint where it is upheld by the left arm in taking aim . When so balanced , the arm has but one force to resist ; that of gravity . When the muzzle or butt preponderates , both arms are strained , and the trigger is rarely pulled at the proper instant . The eyes move together ; the eye and the finger do not . Your forward sight may be of brass or silver ; the latter is best , because brightest and least liable to rust . The hinder sight should be black , that the contrast may catch the eye the more readily , and can not be , like a gentleman 's coat , too finely cut . The sights should not be parallel to the bore . Every child knows that a bullet drops from the line of its propulsion the instant it leaves the muzzle of the gun . The line of aim over the sights , therefore , should point lower than the line of fire , that is , the exact direction of the bore . The bullet crosses and rises above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the force of gravity brings it down again till it strike the earth . The point where the line of sight intersects the line of fire the second time , is the point blank , or , as the French call it , the but en blanc . A gun will shoot with perfect accuracy at the point blank distance , and no other . If you shoot at an object short of the point blank , you must aim under it ; if it be beyond , you must aim over . However , you may make the point blank any distance you please , between ten and a hundred and fifty yards , by a careful adjustment of the sights . I have found , by experiment , that a Harper 's Ferry rifle , which is about three feet long and throws a ball of half an ounce , drops its lead eighteen inches in a hundred yards . If it be intended to make its point blank a hundred yards , its line of sight should therefore point eighteen inches above the centre at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his auditors , and makes a more certain impression . I know no rule for the quantity of the charge . As much powder as will burn should be put into the barrel ; but the bulk will depend on the quality of the grain , and can only be ascertained by experiment . The western riflemen place the bullet on a plane surface , and take as much powder as will cover it for a regular charge . It is a very good practical rule . It is an error , to suppose that a high glazing increases the strength or quickness of gunpowder ; on the contrary , it does not ignite so readily . A polished person is not so liable to be set on fire by insolent sparks as another . All guns which load at the breech or pretend to combine the properties of the rifle and smooth bore , are inventions of the evil one , which no true-bred sportsman will carry . They can not be kept in order , nor will they serve the purposes for which their inventors intended them for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be compared to a beast between the grayhound and pointer , which // has neither the nose of the one nor the legs of the other . The me chanism soon wears loose , and the safety of the gunner is compromised . No good gunner will ever fire shot from his rifle , or use an iron ramrod . Either of these practices injures the furrows , thereby affecting the direction of the bullet . Ladies who cook , draw , and play on the piano , seldom perform all their avocations perfectly well . Ducks are best shot in the morning early , and in stormy weather . The noise and inclemency of the weather make them unwilling to rise , and prevent them from hearing the approach of the gunner . A single duck is easier to kill flying than sitting . His flight is perfectly steady ; a greater portion of his body is exposed , and his feathers are more open to the slugs . A duck 's breast will often turn shot sitting . I would recommend smaller shot for duck-shooting than is commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough . Ducks may be advantageously approached in a boat or canoe , covered with bushes . In some parts of the country they fly in a regular track , where sportsmen station themselves in huts of brush , and shoot them as they pass . Do not take your eye off from a duck when he passes apparently unharmed by your discharge . The whole species is much more tenacious of life than any bird of the grouse kind . I have known a mortally wounded mallard to fly more than a mile before he dropped . Thus a pious miss carries the arrow of Cupid a good way without showing it , but she drops at last . Watch wood-ducks in the spring , and you may possibly find their nests in the hollows of old trees . If the birds be not edible at that season , their eggs are . It will not be amiss to take a pewter spoon with you , to tie to the end of a stick . The eggs often lie beyond arm 's length . If you see two wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot the female . The male will return within shot by the time you will have re-loaded . Either ducks or geese may be decoyed by one of their own species , whose feet you may fasten to a floating log for security 's sake . Do not do this with a hammer and nails , however ; a cord will serve your purpose as well , and show more humaiuity . Those who put out the eyes of decoy-ducks and pigeons , deserve to be crucified . They do not even improve the decoy ; for a bird that can see will quack as loud and flutter as well as one that is blind . A dog ( a small , red one is best ) may be trained to decoy ducks . The sportsman takes his concealed stand , and the animal runs backward and forward on the shore . The ducks come nigh , probably actuated by curiosity , and are shot . Insects and women affect bright colors in the same manner , and often suffer by it . Swans and loons may be decoyed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flap in the wind , and conceal yourself . - The birds will , in two instances out of three , leave their offing to he killed . Speaking of loons , you may always kill them , at a reasonable distance , by firing through the leaves of a bush thick enough to conceal th *1ash of your gun . // Deer can rarely be hunted successfully on horseback , in this country . In an open plain a good horse will soon overtake a deer , but if a wood be nigh , the " fat and greasy citizen " will immediately take shelter in it . In the northern part of New-York , deer are killed in the following manner . Their tracks in any particular district are well known , and the sportsmen station themselves at what are called the runwa3ls , with their rifles . Staunch dogs are then set on the track , and the animal rarely escapes . But this is waste of time , which the spoil does not repay . The better way is to range the woods , and trust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not run a great while . The Indians take a fresh track , and follow it . If they start the quarry before they get within shot , they still follow . In fifteen or twenty miles the deer gives out , and suffers himself to be approached . Few besides Indians can hunt deer successfully in this manner . if a deer is running fast by you , utter a sharp cry , or whistle shrilly , and he will tarry long enough for you to aim . If he bounds away with his tail erect , there is little use in following him ; but if his tail drops , follow him up . The animal often runs long before he falls , and seldom drops on the spot where he is struck . If you are a good , quick shot , rely on a single ball . If your hand and eye are slow , load with two , or take a smooth bore and try buck shot .. In like manner , a wary mother will not discharge one unmarried daughter at a man 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one glances , another may hit . Above all , be cool . I have seen an excellent shot at a target miss the broadside of a buffalo at fifteen paces . His excitement blinded him , and shook his nerves . If , in your passage through the woods , you observe a pollard whose bark is scratched , examine it closely . If there be gray hairs sticking to the trunk , be assured that there is a raccoon in it . You have then nothing to do but to fell the tree . If you wish to make an especial quest for raccoons , it is best done after the first winter snow . Find their tracks in the day , and repair to the spot by moonlight . You will probably find them feeding , or at play . Moonlight is very dangerous to virgins and raccoons . I shall say nothing of the manner of taking wolves , because the animal is good.for nothing , and is very difficult to kill . I could speak largely on this head , but as there are very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English travelers come the nearest to the species of all the beasts that come among us . Bears are very easily tracked , and with a hardy horse , you will soon overtake one . One or more dogs ,  --  the more noisy and cowardly the better ,  --  are of great use in hunting this animal . They will not hurt him , but they will so torment his ears with their noise , and his haunches with their teeth , that he will climb a tree in a pet , and you can come up at your leisure and shoot him . Bears sometimes winter in trees , and I would advise you to examine every large one you pass , attentively . If a bear turn upon you , it is of little use to run ; for he can outstrip most men . Wait till he is within three paces , when you may be sure of inflicting an instantaneously mortal wound . If you are far from human habitations and have hunted all day without success , and are hungry , repair to the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take my word that they are excellent eating . Prejudice has banished frogs and blackbirds from the tables of New-England , though I can find hundreds who will readily make affidavit that nothing is better than either . So endeth the chapter.
