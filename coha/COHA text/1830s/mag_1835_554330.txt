txt WE regard as a peculiar privilege , the opportunity to express our admiration of the genius , character , and writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge . It is rarely , indeed , that God has placed such a mind as his in an earthly mould , to shed its splendor on a world in ruins . We regard him with feelings of veneration and love , which we have paid to few other names in English Literature . Nor does the obloquy , by which he was pursued through life , in the least degree lessen that veneration . It was the inevitable accompaniment of his greatness . It was the appropriate testimony of an age of littleness and superficiality , towards one , who towered in such grandeur beyond the measure of all his contemporaries . " It was not only in the Roman customs , " said Burke , with indignant feeling of the wrongs that had been heaped upon him , " it was not only in the Roman customs , hut it is in the nature and constitution of things , that calumny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of Coleridge 's mind rises in the world of intellect , like the " MONARCH OF MOUNTAINs " in the world of nature , a shape of severe and awful grandeur , arresting the gaze of the soul , and awing it with suhlimity and mystery . He was of that class of men , " whose mind is affected by thoughts rather than things ; and only then feels the requisite interest , even for the most important events and accidents , when , hy means of meditation , they have passed into thoughts . " His sublime apostrophe to Milton , we find it difficult to read , without applying its descriptive character , in hart at least , to himself . " My mind is not capable of forming a more august conception , than arises from the contemplation of this great man in his latter days ; poor , sick , old , blind , slandered , persecuted , Darkness before , and danger 's voice behind , " in an age , in which he was as little understood by the party for whom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // among men , before whom he strode so far , as to dwarf himself by the distance , yet still listening to the music of his own thoughts , or if additionally cheered , yet cheered only by the prophetic faith of two or three solitary individuals , he did nev-ertheless " Argue not Against Heaven 's hand or will , nor bate a jot Of heart or hope ; but still bore up , and steered Right onward . " For himsell Coleridge never desired notoriety , and indeed was averse from it . In how admirable a manner does he speak of the fatal influence of the passion for distinction ,  --  " the desire of distinguishing yourself from other men in order to be distinguished by them . Hoc reverh est inter te et yentatern . This interest does indeed stand between thee and truth . I might add , betwecn thee and thy own soul . It is scarcely more at variance with the love of truth , than it is unfriendly to the attainment that deserves that name . By your own act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the anxiety to be admired is a loveless passion , ever strongest with regard to those by whom we are least known and least cared for , loud on the Hustings , gay in the Ball-room , mute and sullen at the family Fireside . " There are some minds of so noble an order , that we would almost say humility seems natural to them . Burke 's was such a mind . Kindred in its character was that of Coleridge . To intellectual he added true christian humility . He never affected greatness ; it was inseparable from the exercise of such an intellect as God had given him . He was chargeable indeed , with a " too careless indifference to public opinion , and to the attacks of those who influence it ; " praise and admiration being little desirable to him , except as marks of sympathy . It is truly affecting to peruse his own remarks on this subject , at the close of the chapter in the Biographia Literaria , on the supposed irritability of men of genius , and the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter worthy of meditative study and admiration . " Indignation at literary Wrongs , " says he , " I leave to men horn under happier stars , I can not afford it I have laid too many eggs in the hot sands of this wilderness , the world , with ostrich carelessness and ostrich oblivion . The greater part , indeed , have been trodden under // foot and are forgotten ; but yet no small number have crept forth into life , some to furnish feathers for the caps of others , and still more to plume the shafts in the quivers of my enemies ; of them that , unprovoked , have lain in wait against my soul . " " Sic vos , non vobis mellificatis , apes ! " We earnestly hope that some one of his friends in England may collect these scattered and neglected fruits of his mind , together with the essays published in the Morning Post and Courier , and give them to the world . It is now , less than formerly , the lot of such minds to be criticised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the muses seem , from the greater part , analogous to the physical qualifications , which adapt their oriental brethren for the superintendence of the harem . " Few have had more to endure , or borne it with humbler patience of endurance , than this great man , from the sciolism , the impudence , and the malice of anonymous criticism . With a severity the more powerful , because so calm and lofty , he has cauterized the then prevailing style of quackery in criticism in the third chapter of the Biographia Literaria , in which he has vindicated Southey 's " fixed and well-earned fame , " from the abuse and indefatigable hostility of his anonymous critics , and recorded his own admiration of his friend , in a tribute of beautiful and heartfelt praise , only to be equalled for its sweetness , good sense , and power of discrimination , by his own more elaborate and detailed criticism upon the poet Wordsworth . What he said of Southey in the closing sentence of this chapter , might be applied with equal felicity to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quacks in criticism were his only enemies . " One of the noblest traits in the character of Coleridge was his delight to discover , and readiness to acknowledge ability and excellence in others . This feature was comhined at the same time with that humility in the appreciation of his own powers , which led him to underrate himself in the comparison . In how noble a manner does he speak of Paley 's excellence of language and simplicity of style , and of his own unwillingness to write the severe criticism , which yet a sense of justice demanded , upon Paley 's erroneous system . " 0 , if I were fond and ambitious of literary honor , of public applause , how well // content should I be to excite but one third of the admiration , which , in my inmost being , I feel for the head and heart of Paley ! And how gladly would I surrender all hope of con- temporary praise , could I even approach to the incomparable grace , propriety , and persuasive facility of his writings ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw the whole force of my intellect in the way of this triumphal car , on which the tutelary genius of modern idolatry is borne , even at the risk of being crushed under the wheels ! " The tenth chapter of the Biographia Literaria , ( a work to which we always recur with renewed benefit and delight ) is full of autobiographical interest . For mingled humor , and pathos . wit , good sense , and nobleness , and affectionateness of feeling , it is unsurpassed in the annals of biography . It contains a humorous history of his sufferings at the outset of hi authorship , when , though a poor man , he was , as he expresses himself , " so completely hag-ridden by the fear of being influenced by selfish motives , that to know a mode of conduct to be the dictate of prudence was a sort of presumptive proof to my feelings , that the contrary was the dictate of duty . " He gives the most amusing account of his campaign for subscribers to the " Watchman , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius . He says , in concluding the account of the periodical , " I should have been inevitably thrown into jail by my British printer , who refused to wait , even for a month , for a sum between eighty and ninety pounds , if the money had not been paid for me by a man by no means affluent , a dear friend , who attached himself to me from my first arrival at Bristol , who has continued my friend with a fidelity unconquered by time , or even by my own apparent neglect ; a friend , from whom I never received an advice that was not wise , or a remonstrance that was not gentle and affectionate . " During his retirement in Somersetshire , his mind seems to have experienced a mighty revolution on the great subjects of religion and philosophy . To the foundations of religion and morals he devoted his thoughts and studies ; but , in his own expression , " found himself all afloat . Doubts rushed in ; broke upon me from the fountains of the great deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fontal truths of natural religion , and the books of Revelation , alike contributed to the flood ; and it was long ere my ark touched on an Ararat , and // rested . " When it did rest , it was first in a speculative , but afterwards a heartfelt , experimental faith , in the doctrines of the gospel , and a spiritual philosophy shining in its light . While my mind was thus perplexed , " he says , " by a gracious providence , for which I can never be sufficiently grateful , the generous and munificent patronage of Mr. Josiah , and Mr. Thomas Wedgexvood , enabled me to finish my education in Germany . I made the best use of my time and means ; and there is , therefore , no period of my life , on which I can look back with such unmingled satisfaction . " He gives a noble outline of his almost Encyclopedic studies in that country of hard students and learned men . This instructive and interesting chapter concludes with a strain of wounded hut noble feelings in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not pretended to have found , in my compositions , triviality , or traces of a mind that shrunk from the toil of thinking . No one has charged me with tricking out in other words the thoughts of others , or with hashing up anew the crambe jam decies coctam of English literature or philosophy . Seldom have I written that in a day , the acquisition or investigation of which had not cost me the previous labor of a month . " It may be remarked as a great proof of genius , when the productions of the mind are impressed with the character of the author . A man of the highest genius , in communicating his thoughts , communicates himself ; opens his heart ; leaves the impress of his feelings in his works . Ohserve this beautiful trait in Burke . The best biographer in the world could scarcely , by the happiest or most minute delineation , give us a more perfect idea of Burke 's character as a whole , than we can gain by the perusal of his own volumes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and far more precious , for it is a moral interest , ) than the highest degree of mere intellectual power can confer . It links the being of the reader not merely in admiration , but in fervent attachment to the genius of the author . Thus it is that Coleridge 's sweet , affectionate , and noble feelings , always encircling and mingling with the movements of his great mind , ( even as the melody of music in a majestic anthem pervades the soul of the poetry , and heightens and completes its power , ) have won for him , as a man , a fervor of attachment unexampled , in the hearts of those who most admire the productions of his genius . // Coleridge . April , And yet , we can not contemplate his character , nor read a page of his works without a melancholy feeling . It is a melancholy not unlike that which we experience , in perusing those portions of the works of Burke , that were written after the death of his beloved son . The sorrows of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages are hallowed with the sacredness of his affliction . The sorrows of Coleridge were both from inward and outward sources , but more from inward ; a noble mind preying on itself . He was a being , whose extraordinary qualities of intellect and heart , the evil times on which he had fallen could not appreciate . Moreover , his sensibilities were all too keen for the body in which he was imprisoned , and the world by which he was surrounded . Years of pain , bodily and mental , were his to endure , aggravated , with bitterness inexpressible , by the sense of inability to realize the ideals of intellectual performance he was always contemplating ; a feeling of regret , it may be of remorse , in the conviction of the vast disproportion between his great powers of mind , and any image of them in his actual works ; besides , a constant struggle to bear up against the mechanical and material spirit of the age ; disappointment , not of ambition , but of a wounded spirit ; sickness of heart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps more than all , domestic affliction , compelling him , it may be , to take refuge from too bitter a sense of it , by " delving in the unwholesome mines of metaphysic depths . " " I have sought a refuge , " says he , " from bodily pain and mismanaged sensibility , in abstruse researches , which exercised the strength and subtlety of the understanding , without awakening the feelings of the heart . " He bore all his sorrows , and especially the anguish of the last months oC life , with sweetness of address and tranquillity of spirit . Would that those , who have spoken and written so freely against him , had power to appreciate , and nobleness of disposition to acknowledge , the moral worth of his feelings and his labors His own language , in his own poetry , can alone describe his feelings . The following passage is from his Ode on Dejection . " There was a time when , though my path was rough , This joy within me dallied with distress , And all misfortunes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness : For hope grew round me like the twining vine , // And fruits and foliage , not my own , seemed mine . But now afflictions bow me down to earth , Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth . - But oh ! each visitation Suspends what nature gave me at my birth , My shaping spirit of Imagination . For not to think of what I needs mustfeel , But to be still and patient , all I can ; And haply by abstruse research to steal From my own nature all the natural man , This was my sole resource , my only plan ; Till that , which suits a part , infects the whole , And now is almost grown the habit of my soul . " How affecting is this expression of his own sense of the influence which metaphysical employments , long pursued , had exerted over his poetical genius . If , however , we might judge from his latest poetry , his metaphysical studies through life must have rather increased than lessened the power of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of an individual mind , of which gift to his race we possess as yet a portion only , in the volume entitled The Excursion , ( that portion in itself a noble whole , ) seems to have wakened up in Coleridge 's being a powerful consciousness of what he himself also was capable of , and strong yearnings after its realization . Evening after evening , that great poet , amidst a circle of dear friends , a " happy vision of beloved faces , " poured forth , in the deep and solemn voice with which he recites his own poetry , that " long sustained song . " Coleridge describes it with unequalled power of beauty . " Eve following eve , Dear , tranquil time , when the sweet sense of Home Is sweetest ! moments for their own sake hailed , And more desired , more precious for thy song , In silence listening , like a devout child , My soul lay passive , by the various strain Driven , as in surges now beneath the stars , With momentary stars of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Into the darkness ; now a tranquil sea , Outspread and bright , yet swelling to the moon . " The night after the close of this recitation , he composed ( addressing it to Wordsworth ) one of the finest among his // own " Meditative Poems , " from which the passage extracted above is taken . In it there occur the following lines , in which be gave utterance to " the voice of moaning " over his own long silent genius . They express not only his own feelings , weeping over himself , in the consciousness of what perhaps he ought to have performed , permanent , and of ever-enduring influence ; but the feelings of others for him , beholding , in all that he has accomplished , so vivid proofs of that , far greater , which yet he might have realized , and placed " among the archives of mankind . " " Ah ! as I listened with a heart forlorn , The pulses of my being beat anew ; And even as life returns upon the drown 'd , Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - Keen pangs of love , awakening as a babe Turbulent , with an outcry in the heart ; And fears self-willed , that shunned the eye of Hope ; And Hope , that scarce would know itself from Fear ; Sense of past youth , and manhood come in vain , And genius given , and knowledge won in vain ; And all which I bad culled in woodwalks wild , And all which patient toil had reared , and all , Commune with thee had opened out , - but flowers , Strew 'd on my corse , and borne upon my bier , In the same coffin , for the self-same grave ! " We have spoken of his sorrows , and of the manner in which he endured them . His heart was fi*ll of tenderness to those x* ho loved him , and forgiveness to those , who , without provocation , ( unless kindness and good deeds be such , ) were his enemies ; nor could there be found , anywhere in English literature , expressions of nobler feeling towards his slanderers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of these , he sought with the earnestness of self-oblivion ; a generosity sometimes painfully returned by passiveness on their part , when his own character was at stake . " Think only , " says he , " what your feelings would be , if you heard a wretch deliberately perjure himself in support of an infamous accusation , so remote from all fact , so smooth and homogeneous in its untruth , such a round robin of mere lies , that you knew not which to begin with ? What could you do , but look round with horror and astonishment , pleading silently to human nature itself - and , perhaps , ( as hat/n really been the case wit/n me , ) // forget both the slanderer and his slander , in the anguish inflicted by the passiveness of your many professed friends , whose characters you had ever been as eager to clear from the least stain of reproach , as if a coal of fire had been on your own skin ? " To the delineation of Wordsworth 's excellencies , he devoted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an essay , which will remain a master-piece of philosophical criticism , coeval with the English language . Of another friend and benefactor , he has given a character in one of the essays in the first volume of The Friend , written in all the beauty of eloquence , from the inmost heart of the poet and philosopher . He speaks of his virtues , " themes for the energies of solitude , for the awfulness of prayer ! - virtues , exercised in the barrenness and desolation of his animal being ; while he thirsted , with the full stream at his lips , and yet with unwearied goodness poured out to all around him , like the master of a feast among his kindred , in the day of his own gladness ! Were it but for the remembrance of him alone , and of his lot here below , the disbelief of a future state would sadden the earth around me , and blight the very grass in the field . " Again , in one of the letters of his " Literary Correspondence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scientific meditations to which he was led while enduring them , he dwells in a passage , exquisite for its beauty , not less than for its profound philosophic thought , upon the influence of ill-health and pain in eliciting genius . We extract the following sentences , as a specimen of his power of illustrating . truth from scientific phenomena . " The cutting and irritating grain of sand , which by accident or incaution has got within the shell , incites the living inmate to secrete from its own resources , the means of coating the intrusive substance . And is it not , or may it not be , even so , with the irregularities and unevenness of health and fortune in our own case ? We to&amp; may turn diseases into pearls . The means and materials are within ourselves ; and the process is easily understood . " " That this source of consolation and support may be equally in your power as in mine , but that you may never have occasion to feel equally grateful for it , as I have and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish of your affectionate S. T. COLERIDGE . " // try , ) are every way worthy of Coleridge 's great intellect ; whether for the development of important principles in political , ethical , psychological science ; or for eloquence of feeling , sentiment , and thought ; or for philosophic and poetic beauty of style and illustration . The work is a FRIEND indeed , and to the young above all others ; venerable , yet familiar ; thoughtful , and of kindest , noblest feelings ; teaching wisdom for meditation , and alluring to habits of meditation , by presenting to the mind , not amusement merely , but Flowers Of sober tint , and herbs of medicinal powers ; admonitory of dangerous influences , and alluring to the love of every thin : , good and honorable ; taking the reader affectionately by the hand , and with most happy and instructive conversation to beguile the weariness of the way , leading him gradually upward to the very highest principles of speculative science . Were we to point out the essays most worthy to be earnestly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , on the " Principles of Method common to all Investigations ; presented as the basis of his future philosophical and theological writings , and as the necessary introduction to the same . " We do not believe , that in the whole compass of English , French , or German literature , there is to be witnessed so profound an exhibition of the ultimate principles of universal science ; the principles , by which alone " philosophy becomes scientific , and the sciences philosophical . " As a work , The Friend abounds likewise with passages of great descriptive beauty , exquisite delineations of character , and striking truths , such as are scattered , indeed , through all his pages , obtained from the thoughtful study of human nature and human life . Aphoristic sentences , that condense volumes of meaning , arrest the attention of the contemplative reader , as fixed stars in his hemisphere of moral truth . The remark on page twentyeighth , of the American edition , respecting the disproportion of human passions to their ordinary objects , being among the strongest internal evidences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind like Bishop Butler 's , might erect a work analogous to the ANALOGY . Another remark , a little farther onward , contains in itself the history of the corruptions of Christianity . So with the following remark on the same // page , in regard to the sacrifice of truth and expediency . " The duties which we owe to our own moral being , are the ground and condition of all other duties ; and to set our nature at strife with itself for a good purpose , implies the same sort of prudence , as a priest of Diana would have manifested , who should have proposed to dig up the celebrated charcoal foundations of the mighty temple of Ephesus , in order to furnish fuel for the burnt offerings on its altars . " As an instance of great conciseness and comprehension in one and the same thought , em bodying truth from history , take the following . " The Christian world was for centuries divided into the many , that did not think at all , and the few , who did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from defect of the act , the other from the absence of an obiect . " How truly magnificent is the following sentence in regard to the Bible : " It is God every where ; and all creatures conform to his decrees , the righteous by performance of the law , the disohedient by the sufferance of the penalty . " His power of definition is not less remarkable for the characteristics of comprehension in conciseness , and accuracy in universality . The political essays in The Friend , ( though not possessing the general interest of those , for instance , which contain his delightful sketches of the character of Luther , and his explanation , on psychological principles , of Luther 's satanic apparition , in the place of his imprisonment at the Warteburg , ) are yet replete with wisdom . Here , too , principles give value and permanence to facts , and history is adduced to illustrate principles ; and over all are thrown the light and warmth of moral purity and nobleness of feeling . In one of these pages he makes a remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of want of common sense and judgment , ) viz , that as to England 's " political strength and circumstantial prosperity , it is the national debt , which has wedded in indissoluble union all the interests of the state , the landed with the commercial , and the man of independent fortune with the stirring tradesman , and reposing annuitant . " We have no doubt of the main truth of this remark ; his own reasoning makes it clear ; though he promises afterwards to develope , with the same boldness , the injurious effects of the system on the literature , morals , and religious principles of the people . Paradoxical as it may seem , to assert that in any case debt is benefit and strength , we believe that the national debt of England , in // 310 April , its amazing pressure of the kin dom , whose interests it nevertheless unites and consolidates by that pressure , may be compared to the key-stone of an immense arch , itself supported by those sides of the arch , which yet themselves would fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ht they are required to sustain . Mr. Coleridge 's aim , in all movements of his mind , was towards general principles . In regard to The Friend , he says , " To refer men 's opinions to their absolute principles , and thence their feelings to their appropriate objects , and in their due degrees ; and finally , to apply the principles thus ascertained , to the formation of stedfast convictions , concerning the most important questions of politics , morality , and religion , - these are to be the objects and contents of this work . " These , it may be said , are the objects and contents of all his works , and of all his philosophy ; " having myself , ( he says , ) experienced , that no delight , either in kind or degree , was equal to that which accompanies the distinct perception of a fundamental truth , relative to our moral being ; having , long after the completion of what is ordinarily called a learned education , discovered a new world of intellectual profit opening on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , at the roots of those , which I had been taught from childhood , in my catechisin and spelling-book . " It is to principles , that he always directs us , without which , our knowledge , though varied as the forms of the visible and invisible creation , is little better than chaos ; " the depthless abstractions of fleeting phenomena , the shadows of sailing vapors , the colorless repetitions of rainbows ; " without which , " experience itself is but a Cyclops , walking backwards , under the fascination of the past , " - " without which , the fleeting chaos of facts would no more form experience , than the dust of the grave can of itself make a living man ; " without which history is fable , philosophy a formless kaleidoscope , poetry without life , and books without permanence . It is to the presence of these , that the works of Edmund Burke owe their endurance and amazing power . " He possessed , " says Coleridge , " and had sedulously sharpened , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in relation to the laws that determine their existence , and circumscribe their possibility . He referred habitually to principles . He was a scientijic statesman ; and , therefore , a seer . For every prin // ciple contains in itself the germs of a prophecy ; and as the prophetic power is the essential privilege of science , so the fulfilment of its oracles supplies the outward , and , to men m general , the only test of its claim to the title . " Of Burke , he made a remark , which we can not hut quote ; that , " in his public character he found himself , as it were , in a Noah 's ark , with a very few men , and a great many beasts. ** It is to the pursuit of principle , instead of temporary notions and fancies , ( that have their birth in every age , from the changing humors and movements of society , and in every age attract and waste the intellectual and moral strength of multitudes , ) that the scholars and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their fame , and the fact that their works do follow them . And it is to be greatly feared , that , for want of an excitement produced by the presence and pursuit of ultimate principles , the character of our own age will become more and more superficial , moneymaking , and self-complacent ; and that , even " amidst the vicessant intellectual activity of the race , the intellectual power of individual minds may be falling off ; and amidst accumulating knowledge , lofty science may disappear . " " We are fond , ( says Mr. Coleridge ) of styling our own the enlightened age ; though , as Jortin , I think , has wittily remarked , the golden a0e would be more appropriate . " And are we not proud of our very defects , and yet not willing to acknowledge them ? Ours is an age , it is true , of useful inventions ; of steam-engines , and rail-roads , arid libraries of useful and entertaining knowledge . But wisdom has sadly gone out of fashion ; and ours is an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an age of common . sense , in which all things and knowledges are sensualized to all . The speculative reason is forgotten in the enthronement of the practical understanding of man ; and where this is the case , there is neither insight , nor veneration for things venerable , nor fixed opinions , nor stedfast thought , nor spiritual yearnings , nor deep consciousness , nor humble acknowledgment of spiritual wants . The employments that occupy man as a creature of the mere understanding , are multiplied , and the world is a vast hive of buzzing intelligences as busy as the bees , and as intent upon external or physical pursuits as they , to the exclusion of all spiritual concernments. // Criticism , with Coleridge , was a great science , and perhaps he is the first English critic , who has scientifically pursued it . Possessing a philosophic power of discernment in the observance of mental laws , and in the application of those laws to the productions of genius , and connecting the science of the beautiful in all its forms with those psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the expression , he pours a placid light around him , as different from the undiscriminating glimmer of common criticism as the calm and solemn sunlight of noonday , revealing all things as they are , is different from the flickering torch-light . He tells us , hin*self , that he " labored at a solid foundation , on which permanently to ground his opinions in the component faculties of the human mind itself , and their comparative dignity and importance . " He has stated the two following critical aphorisms , abstracted from his reading , and meditation at an early age , and certainly important ; " first , that not the poem which we have read , but that to which we return , with the greatest pleasure , possesses the genuine power , and claims the name of essential poetry . Second , that whatever lines can be translated into other words of the same language , without diminution of their significance , either in sense or association , or in any worthy feeling , are so far vicious in their diction . " In expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great integrity of moral principle . " It is hardly possible ( he says ) for a man of ingenuous mind to act under the fear that he shall be suspected , by honest men , of the vileness of praising a work to the public , merely because he happens to he personally acquainted with the author . Ijudge of all works indifferently , by certain fixed rules , previously formed in my mind , with all the power and vigilance of my judgment . " We have referred , as an example of his power , to that grand critical essay upon Wordsworth , in the Biographia Literaria ; nothing of so great excellence , or such a model in that department of literature , can be found in the language . There is likewise an essay in the second section of the third volume of The Friend , in which he illustrates his subject by quotations from Shakspeare , especially from Hamlet , in a strain of critical remark , so profoundly philosophical , so clear and vigorous , and producing in the mind so strong a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader earnestly wish that what is incidental illustration of scientific principles , tested by // application to the works of that great Poet , had been itself extended to a volume . The critical remarks , in the first chapter of the Biographia Literaria , on the writers of the last century , including Mr. Pope and his followers , ( whom he characterizes , with great accuracy , as " the school of French poetry , condensed and invigorated by English understanding , " ) are equally admirable . He discloses the nature of the " painted mists that occasionally rise from the marshes at the foot of Parnassus . " Our genuine admiration of a great poet , is a continuous undercurrent of feeling ; it is every where present , but seldom any where as a separate excitement . " Again , he makes an observation , which we may apply to the poetry of Wordsworth , for illustration , that " it is peculiar to original genius to become less and less striking , in proportion to its success in improving the taste and judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prose writings , was such as might be expected in so great a poet , working with unlimited command of such inexhaustible materials of learning and science . All things actual and imaginable in the universe of knowledge , the sciences , natural and exact , the fine arts , and the common business of life , he lays under contribution , and yokes the spoils , in endless reach and variety , to his imagination , as to a triumphal car . Perhaps in no other created mind but Plato 's , were the powers of imagination and abstraction ever united in so remarkable a degree . Images , the growth of his poetic genius , are seen , amidst abstrusest subtleties , springing lovelier than ever on the perilous , barren heights of metaphysical speculations ; even as the flowers , that , sometimes of rarest beauty , and as it were , conscious and rejoicing in their place of danger , bend over the crags of a mighty waterfall , and wet their petals , and mingle their fragrance with the spray . His imagination might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there being no power , in whose exercise the influence of that divine faculty was not duly mingled . Thought , meditation , reasoning , argument , abstract definition and criticism , are all surrounded by that radiance . All things have groxvn in that light . His language is imbued with it . Even in metaphysical abstractions we are conscious of its power . Its influence on the medium of thought might be illustrated by the painted glass in old cathedrals . It is a religious // light , full of solemnity , and sombre magnificence . His very words are pictures . Yet this sublime faculty , which , bestowed in such abundant measl4re , generally usurps possession of the mind , instead of being possessed by it , with him was under perfect control , rnoving obedient to the severest judgment , and as a ministering spirit to his strong reasoning powers . Hence his figures are always natural , however unusual . They are part and parcel of the thought itself , and the legitimate result of energetic action in the intellect ; rubor quidem nalivus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , produced by powerful , but healthy , excitement in the heart . All the treasures of his immense knowledge were fused in the fire of his genius , and became transparencies , through which the light of his imagination shone , encompassing the figures with attractive splendor , and setting them in a fiery glow . In metaphysical researches it places the thought in such distinctness , that we think of the moon setting behind the trees , and putting every leaf and twig in a burning blaze of crimson and gold . But it is almost presumptuous to use an illustration , which has been consecrated , as it were , with glory , in Wordsworth 's grandest , happiest manner . Let us read the passage , for it worthily describes the actings of Coleridge 's imagination . " Within the soul a faculty abides , That with interpositions , which would hide And darken , so can deal , that they become Contingencies of pomp ; and serve to exalt Her native brightness .

" It is truly surprising to xvitness , in many of Coleridge 's illustrations , his accurate acquaintance with the exact and natural sciences . He loves especially to illustrate psychological by geometrical science . It is so with all the sciences . He is at home , and what is more , he dwells among the principles of each , worshipping , not in the porch , but in the inner sanctuary // of the temple . Open his works where you will , the mind can not long remain there , without being aroused into admiration and excitement . There are great forms around it ; countenances sublime and awful ; inscriptions of dread import ; furniture and imagery , that seem the work of supernatural presences for themselves . The same may be said of his conversation , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the fame of its splendor spread . To have enjoyed a day 's familiar intercourse with such a mind , would have been worth a voyage across the Atlantic . It has been finely said of Dr. Payson 's conversation , that " his thoughts flew from hun in every possible variety of beauty and harmony , like birds from a South American Forest . " This might describe the movements of the fancy iii Coleridge 's conversation , but would be an utterly inadequate image of its amazing richness , grandeur arid philosophic and imaginative power . And yet it was the spontaneous overflow of the mind , without effort , without rest , poured out wherever he found a human ear to listen . To him it seemed quite indifferent who should be the recipient of so much intellectual richness ; he talked not to display that richness , but to communicate thought , and to give play to a mind as restless in its thoughts , as the ocean in the movement of its tides . His countenance , while engaged in thought , we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed as if the soul , the whole principle of life and intelligence had withdrawn , for the time , from the outer man , to a hidden world within ; and the face would be a perfect blank , almost a picture of idiocy . Then , on opening his lips in conversation , suddenly the fire would leap back into his eye , and the soul into every feature . It was like a resurrection . It was like the sun , rising abruptly from beneath the sea , to shine upon the waste of waters . Nothing could be more diverse , than these two countenances of the visible and invisible soul . His power of condensing a world of meaning in one word , and flashing it upon the hearer 's sense , has been spoken of as possessed , if possible , to a greater degree in conversation than in writing . He once said , speaking of the difference between the two styles of architecture , that the Grecian architecture was a dung , - the Gothic an IDEA . Both in speaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No assertion could be more groundless , than the one , so oft repeated , of vagueness and mysticism in his style . The crude classification of his mind with that of Chalmers , by a writer in this country , is proof of the inaccurate and vague conceptions entertained in regard both to his genius and style , by those from whom a juster appreciation might have been expected . For no two authors could be more diverse , in their modes of thinking and expression , and in the whole character of their minds . If any qualities are distinctive in the intellect of Coleridge , they are , not only comprehensiveness , but acuteness and severity of thought , and accuracy and purity in the use of language . As his thoughts have no indistinctness , his language has no hiding-places . Here are neither mental waverings , nor half-meanings , nor indefinite phrases ; neither are there iterations of familiar truth tricked out in the finery of words or epithets . He never resorts to such stratagems . His language is so severe and scientific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . An indefinite mind would be in it as a blind child in the armor of invincihle knights of old . Sometimes he uses language with almost algebraic conciseness ; so that his words and phrases partake so much of the condensation of his thoughts , that they appear like hieroglyphics , in general , it would be difficult for any one , the greatest master of English , to put any specified thought , which Mr. Coleridge has committed to writing , into smaller compass , with equal distinctness , or into broader space , without loss of power . Nor are the qualities of conciseness and accuracy inconsistent with that poetical richness , which distinguishes his style ; the union of the imaginative and scientific , though very rare , bein.g nevertheless hut the natural union of poetry and philosophy . He was not only accurate himself in the use of language there is no writer , who so powerfully impresses on the reader 's mind the importance of such accuracy , or awakes it to so watchful an examination both of the etyniology and meaning of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be gained by this habit ; it is giving to the mind a new thought ; rather re-linking the word to that thouTht of or b which , in common use , it has ceased to he the exponent . It is like exchanging a worn-out coin , for one just struck from the mint . He has spoken , in one of his letters , of the remedy for confusion of thought , " to he provided by a dictionary , constructed on the one only philosophical principle , which re // garding words as living growths , offsets , and organs of the human soul , seeks to trace each historically , through all the periods of its natural growth , and accidental modifications . A work which , executed for any one language , would yet he a benefaction to the world , and to the nation itself a source of immediate honor and of ultimate weal , beyond the power of victories to bestow , or the mines of Mexico to purchase . The realization of this scheme lies in the far distance ; but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent to its furtherance , to contribute a small portion of the materials for the future temple , - from a polished column to a hewn stone , or a plank for the scaffoldiwr ; and , as they come in , to erect with them sheds for the workmen , and temporary structures for present use . ' * His own essay on the philosophic import of the words object and subject , is a noble example of what may be done in this way . " There are cases ( says he in one of his notes ) in which more knowledge of more value may be conveyed by the history of a word , than by the history of a campaign . We have only to master the true origin and original import of any native and abiding word , to find in it , if not the solution of the facts expressed by it , yet a finger-mark , pointing to the road , on which this solution is to he sought for . " He was himself an enthusiastic lover , and a profound master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not unfrequently does he throw a great light of illustration over his subject , from that particular language , as well as from the laws of universal grammar . Surely it would have been an anomaly , hard to be accounted for , if a mind , philosophic as his , and so disciplined , both in his school-days , and in all after life , had been loose or inaccurate in the use of his own mother tongue The clearness with which the thought lies in his own mind , he communicates in its expression , to all who will bestow the requisite attention ; and so he does the fullness of conviction , almost inducing the acquiescence of his readers , by the mere force of united strength and integrity , with which he utters a proposition . However mysterious his language , ( ourselves unaccustomed to the subjects , and for that reason finding mystery in the language , ) we are evidently in the presence of a man , who is not beating the air ; of a powerful intellect , that is not exerting itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - NO.87. 41 // blind-fold over regions where he has never been before . Whatever subject he is investigating , he does it as one who knows every step of the ground , and is conscious of , and properly confident in his own strength . Moreover , we see from his tread that it is solid ground ; the distant beholder may have thought it an unstable marsh , but he strides over it with the heavy tramp of a war-horse ; moving neither irresolutely , nor uncertain of his end , but as to a definite point , which he sees full before him , and is vigorous enough to attain . Whatever may be said of Coleridge 's difficulty to he understood by others , it is at least evident that he understands himself . What then are the grounds of alleged obscurity ? They lie partly in the difficulty of the subject , and its remoteness from common consciousness ; but i*ore , we believe , in the mind of the reader . Coleridge generally takes for granted a greater degree of knowledge in that mind , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , himself supplying only the necessary links in the argument . Some , who find him obscure , do so , because they have not studied him , nor become accustomed , either to his scientific use of language , or his abstract manner of elucidating principles ; others , because they are not willing* or have not leisure , to satisfy the demand for thought and fixed attention , which he makes upon the mind . Campbell has said of the poet Collins , that " a cloud of obscurity sometimes rests on his highest conceptions , arising from the fierceness of his associations , and the daring sweep of his allusions ; but the shadow is transitory , and interferes very little with the light of his imagery , or the xvarmth of his feelings . " Something analogous may be said of Coleridge 's metaphysical speculations . If any person from defect of mental discipline be unable , or from dislike of mental labor be unxvilling , to take those steps , which the author has not taken for him , though it may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely not the most honorable in the reader , to transfer what is the fault either of his own mind or heart , to the score of an alleged fault in the writer . A youthful student , at least , we should suppose , with the remembrance of Coleridge 's venerable age and profound learning , would rather , if an opinion expressed must necessarily involve the assertion of unintelligibility , preserve a modest silence . A mind sufficiently disciplined to appreciate Coleridge 's intellectual power , or sufficiently elevated // to enter into his nobleness of feeling ; a mind that , amidst the scoffing habit of the age , has not lost all veneration for genius in another , or humility in view of limited attainment in itself , would rather not be found pronouncing the pages of such a man , confusion and absurdity . The very declaration involves an opinion , that the individual who makes it understands his author 's ignorance . We would rather adopt the admirable language of Coleridge himself , in regard to those parts of Plato , to which , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent meaning , and acknowledge , that instead of understanding his ignorance , we are IGNORANT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING . " Metaphysical systems for the most part become popular , not for their truth , but in proportion as they attribute to causes a susceptibility of being seen , if only our visual organs were sufficiently powerful . " This being the case , it is very natural that his own speculations should be branded as obscure , for his philosophy is at war with all that is sensual , and he is the great and venerable defender of that which is spiritual in man , in opposition to all materializing systems . From the empirical decisions of those who have ruled in the last age , he appeals continually to first principles , and reasons from them with the accuracy and power of geometrical science . And his illustrations of metaphysical truth are often so purely scientific , that , while nothing could be better adapted to make his meaning sensibly clear to a scientific mind , the illustrations themselves , in order to be fully comprehended , demand not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in truth , occupied those heights in psychological science , which few have leisure , and still fewer the ability , and fewer still the patience , to scale . There , from that great elevation , which no other contemporary mind has reached , and in an intellectual atmosphere so thin and rarefied , that hardly another could sustain , he is occupied in the clear beholding of abstrusest truth . He describes the wondrous prospect , as it spreads out before his own soul , but with such exact language , and such discrimination , as few can follow , whose mental discipline has lain in an age of indistinctness and materiality ; so that , although with the power of a strong imagination he vividly illustrates the abstractest principle , almost painting to the senses , what is difficult ever for the mind to hold in contemplation , there is but here and there an individual // Coleridge . April , who fully comprehends him , and very many are content to put away the subject with the assertion , that in fact he is unintelligible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher branches of the mathematics , reason thus of the M*canique C*Aeste , ( and perhaps some of Coleridge 's metaphysical investigations occupy a position in psychological science , analogous to that which the work of La Place occupies in mathematical , ) the contemptuous obstinacy of such ignorance would be noticeable only to be despised . It is not so much , however , the ignorance of this age on psychological subjects , of which a mind like Coleridge 's has reason to complain , as it is the complacency of assumed wisdom , with which they deny the possibility of any truths in metaphysics , that transcend the intricacies of physical machinery , or lie beyond the comprehension of common sense . Were it not that the reasonings of Lord Bacon and of Sir Isaac Newton are of the laws of the natural world , and have the advantage of physical , or at least sensible exponents , and thus make by no means so great a demand on the power of abstract contemplation as those of Coleridge , we believe the two former philosophers would as often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter . The psychological philosopher has difficulties to encounter , that are never found in the way of the natural philosopher . The sphere of investi* , ation itself demands higher powers of mind ; it is , indeed , the sphere of the pure reason ; while that of the external physical sciences is the province of the understanding . It requires a power of continuous thought , without any positions or links of demonstration in external things to rest upon . The milestones on the road beguile the traveller of his weariness ; there are none such in metaphysical investigations . in natural science , the mind is led onward , by laws that can be read in external nature ; it does not lead , but isconducted by ideas realized , as it were , to the senses . There is a logical connection already markedin the successive steps , that has only to be followed with attention , the last indicating the next . In psychological science the mind must be its own guide ; there is no physical world , where its laws are realized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed like a mineral , nor demonstrated like an algebraic formula , or a geometrical quantity . Upborne with indefatigable wings , the metaphysical philosopher , who does // not materialize his science , and thus place it out of the limits of psychology , must steer through regions of abstractions in the infinitude of being , where there are no external diagrams or resting-places , and where contemplation only can supply a guide . Then , too , when we consider the amazing difficulties to he encountered in the absence of an adequate philosophical language ; the sensualized condition of language itself , and its want of precision in subtle distinctions of abstract thought ; it can be no longer wonderful , that when a writer undertakes to go hack to the common consciousness of men on metaphysical subjects , they should turn from his speculations with dislike . Little reflection is needed to acquiesce in a system , which merely watches and reports the operation of the human faculties , but that which searches out the grounds of those operations , and ascends upward to principles , must of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given the following translation from Plato , of which he says , " the fidelity of the version may well atone for its harshness , in a passage , that deserves a meditation beyond the ministry of words . " The passage is this . " One thing is the hardness to be understood of the Sophist , and then that of the philosopher . The former , retreating into the obscurity of that which hath not true being , and by long intercourse accustomed to the same , is hard to be known on account of the duskiness of the place . But the philosopher , by contemplation of pure reason , evermore approximating to the idea of true being , is by no means easy to be seen , on account of the splendor of that region . For the intellectual eyes of the many flit , and are incapable of looking fixedly toward the godlike . " Here , did our limits permit , we would call the attention of our readers to the deeply interesting fact , that so many of the ripest and most practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we may add , not a few of the holiest men . This fact might well make any student unwilling to yield himself to the fashionable current of ridicule about " Platonic jargon . " Have deep scholarship ( we may all ask ) and habits of accurate investigation , a natural affinity with a vague , mystical , absurd system of philosophy ? And is there legitimate relation between a piety like that of Leighton and Henry More , and useless and unintelligible speculation ? We do not // believe it ; when we read such an expression of the sentiment of a man like Coleridge , as is to be found in the opening of the twelfth chapter of his Biographia Literaria , we feel inclined to say , Let us return to Athens . Coleridge 's principles are clear , whatever of abstruseness there may be in educing them ; nor does he ever fail to present some grand and practically important idea to the view ; and though we may not he able perfectly to trace the steps by which it is evolved , nor recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it fills the eye with its brightness , like a city on a distant hill , seen towards evening in the setting sun , while all the interspace is hid in shade and indistinctness . The city itself may be new and strange to the traveller , and he unacquainted even with its name ; yet there it is , the habitation of many human beings ; the hum of the crowded streets and suburbs floats on the still evening air , and the roofs of its palaces blaze in the parting sunlight , and its gilded spires rise solemnly to heaven . Take , for instance , the rhrillin0 conclusion of the sixth chapter in the Biographia Literaria . " This fact , ( and it would not be difficult to adduce several of the same kind , ) contributes to make it even probable , that all thoughts are in themselves imperishable ; and that , if the intelligent faculty should be rendered more comprehensive , it would require only a different and apportioned organization , the body celestial instead of the body terrestrial , to bring before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , and this , - this , perchance , is the dread book of judgment , in whose mysterious hieroglyphics every idle word is recorded ! yea , in the very nature of a living spirit , it may be more possible that heaven and earth should pass away , than that a single act , a single thought , should be loosened or lost from that living chain of causes , to all whose links , conscious or unconscious , the free-will , our only absolute self , is co-extensive and co-present . " With what power arid solemn grandeur do these thoughts , though but an incidental result of the preceding disquisition , rise upon the mind ! Of a lower order , that is , from the nature of the subject not so magnificent , yet both beautiful and instructive , is the close of the seventh chapter in the same work . Or take the conclusion of the work , sublime perhaps beyond anything which even Coleridge has written , and affecting indeed , // when in connection with it we peruse that holy apostolic letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , concluding as , with prophetic yearning , he had expressed the wish more than eighteen years hefore. " 0 ! that with this my personal , as well as my literary life might conclude the unquenched desire , I mean , not without the consciousness of having earnestly endeavored to kindle young minds , and to guard them against the temptations of scorners , by showing that the scheme of Christianity , as taught in the Liturgy and Homilies of our church , though not discoverable by human reason , is yet in accordance with it ; that link follows link by necessary consequence ; that religion soars out of the ken of reason , only where the eye of reason has reached its own horizon ; and that faith is then but its continuation ; even as the day softens away into the sweet twilight , and twilight , hushed and breathless , steals into the darkness . it is night , sacred night ! the upraised eye views only the starry heaven , which manifests itself alone ; and the outward be-. holding is fixed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other worlds , only to preserve the soul steady and collected in its pure act of inward adoration to the great I AM , and to the filial WORD , that re-affirmeth it from eternity to eternity , whose choral echo is the universe. ** " rE*2 MON*2 AO*A . ' In this manner does Coleridge 's mind travel onward , throwing out its treasures , principles of overawing grandeur , and thoughts of interest and power , mingled perpetually with illustrations , that are , even in themselves , both thoughts and principles . It is a solemn triumphal procession all the way . The science of metaphysics loses its barrenness , Et dura* quercus sudahunt roscida indIa ; abstract subtleties appear not as mere skeletons , but clad in attractive flesh , living and breathing . While you are endeavoring , with intensest thought , and in meditative mood , to follow him , as lie " goes bounding on his dim and perilous way , " and you suppose no powers at work , but reason with her severest countenance , suddenly the whole landscape is irradiated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you almost forget the process of reasoning you are to trace , in the glow of delight at this unanticipated and beautiful vision . There are objects and ideas , " which their very sublimity // renders indefinite , no less than their indefiniteness renders them sublime . " Perhaps the very passages , which a critic of the old French school would complacently dispose of , as the thi ice distilled essence of sublime nonsense , we should select as evidences of the unequalled power and beauty , with which Coleridge uses language and imagery in conveying the highest truths of philosophy . There is scarce any chapter in all his writings , more eloquent with the majesty of truth and the beauty of poetry , than that included in note C. in the Appendix to the Statesman 's Manual . It contains a powerful description of the prurient , bustling , revolutionary spirit of French wisdom , then gone out over the civilized world , and become the spirit and character of the modern age . From the recommendation of the word of God , as the end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another book , likexvise a revelation from God , the great book of his servant nature . And seldom in one and the same passage are to be witnessed such evidences of clear and profound insight , unlimited mastery over language , grandeur of imagination , and affectionate tenderness of heart . The notion , that the true system of philosophy must necessarily he so simple , as to connnend itself at first sight to the understanding of all men without dispute , or to preclude the necessity of study in the intervention of things hard to he understood , is contrary to all experience in analogy , besides being degrading in itself . It is not too much to say , that in the nature of things it must be impossible . The least approach to metaphysical knowledge demands such a degree of attention and study , as the multitude of men will not exercise ; the scrence of metaphysics far more . If the soul be of another and a nobler nature than the body it inhabits , in just the same proportion will it require a superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its laws . Men are compelled to study , even to understand the machinery of a steamengine , with the whole connection of the parts open to sense . Is it to he supposed that psychological science can he more simple , in the common sense of the word , that is , easy to be understood , than physical science ? Even if the soul were a machine , only nobler than the steam-engine , because more useful , from its application to a greater variety of purposes , it could not require less attention and study to understand its principles . More simple the science of being certainly is , as the ground , // and containing the principles , of all other sciences ; but for this very reason more difficult of insight , and to be mastered only by the highest intelligences , with longest and profoundest meditation . Can the system of the intellectual universe be imagined more easy of discovery or acquisition , than that of the physical universe ? And does the true system of the latter , as evolved in the meditations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple to the understandings of all men , without expense of study or profound attention ? To behold the absolute ground or principle of any one phenomenon , either in the mental or physical world , is to have gained the key to the whole system . To know why an apple falls , was to have found the law of creation , as to the position of its parts . And to know why the mind perceives an apple , would doubtless be to discover a law of universal being . To understand law in either case , or follow it in its developments , supposes difficulties encountered and overcome by a degree of thoughtful study , for which mankind at large have neither leisure nor perseverance . Law undiscovered , the ignorance is mystery , darkness , superstition . It is superstition in religion , materialism in philosophy , fanaticism in both . Galileo was condemned to the dungeons of the Inquisition , for asserting that the earth revolved on its axis . To him , to whom law is unknown , the movements of that dread Being who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it , with reference to and in view of it , will inevitably appear unco : *-nected , unintelligible ; they will be misinterpreted by him , and perhaps , as ignoraiice is the parent of arro0ance , they will be scoffed at as absurd . There are laws enunciated in the pages of Mr. Coleridge , and other pages , contemplating facts in the light of those laws , kindling with high eloquence , imparted from the meditative joy of the writer . Now , to one unacquainted with the principles , the passages l ) produced by their influence , and trnnslucent only in their light , would very naturally appear as destitute of meaning as the eloquent ravings of a madman . By such a one , the loftier the truth , and the nearer the sonree of all truth , the more mystical will it be judged . Especially , if in psychological science he has been accustomed only to the observation of phenomena , or of the operation of the faculties of the human mind , as they are enumerated in most of our books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineralogical cab* // met , he would wonder at the folly of collecting such heaps of stones , and putting them on shelves and in glass cases with so much care ; and were he to be present at some interesting lecture on the science , where the professor , surrounded by his pupils , is enunciating its laws and principles , and causing every particle of matter , from the diamond of Golconda to the common earth scooped up at the door-step , to shine in their light , with exciting interest , he would , as he beheld the enthusiasm of the teacher , and the attention of the scholar , pronounce them a set of strange beings , if not madmen . Such is the judgment of some men , whenever they contemplate a writer moving in a sphere of which they know nothing , even though he be confessedly a man of wisdom , learning , and genius ! " There is , " says Mr. Coleridge , " a philosophic ( and inasmuch as it is actualized by an effort of freedom , an artificial ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , behind , the spontaneous consciousness natural to all reflecting beings . " - " A system , the first principle of which is to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual in man , ( i. e. of that which lies on the other side of our natural consciousness , ) must needs have a great obscurity for those who have never disciplined and strengthened this ulterior consciousness . " The passage between these quotations , and the whole chapter from which they are taken , ought to be profoundly studied , by those who would find ultimate truth in philosophy , or know why the system , which contains it , can not , in the common acceptation of the term , be a simple system . " The spiritual world is darkness to most minds , because of the glare and confusion , the gaudy , fantastic colors and flickering lights of the world of sense , to which the fallen soul has assimilated itself ( as certain insects turn into the color of the thing , they feed on , ) in a habit at war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waiting patiently , till the organs of sense cease to absorb the soul 's whole activity , it will scarcely wake to the consciousness of the possession of spiritual organs , or powers of intuition for the spiritual world ; much less be able to behold the countenance of truth . A man in a dark chamber must remain long before he can see anything ; hut gradually object after object will come into view , and the eye will have acquired a power of sight , which the full light of the sun does but diminish . In making // all things more sensible , it weakens the sensibility and power of the optic nerve . Thus Caspar Hauser for a long time possessed an accuteness of sense , which might have been deemed a supernatural marvel ; but after he bad become accustomed to the strong light of day , he lost this acuteness gradually and entirely . So the soul may be said to lose its power of beholding the world of spiritual reality , of which it is a part , from the long habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible glare and shadow , of which it is but a transitory tenant . Its spiritual powers , through disuse , being no longer objects of its consciousness , are even denied to have possessed any separate existence . " D*jh la nuit ( says Madame de Stael , and this remark is profound as a spiritual illustration ) s avance * mes regards ; mais le ciel n'est-il pas plus beau pendant la nuit ? Des milliers d ' *toiles le d&amp;*corent. 1 n'est de jour qu'un di*sert . Ainsi les ombres *ternelles reveillent d'innombrables pensi*es que l ' &amp;lat de la prosp*riti* faisait oublier . " In the same spirit the author of The Confessions of an Opium Eater observes , that " a thousand accidents may and will interpose a veil between our present consciousness and the secret inscriptions on the mind ; accidents of the same sort will also rend away this veil ; but alike , veiled or unveiled , the inscription remains forever ; just as the stars seem to withdraw before the common light of day , whereas , in fact , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as a veil ,  --  and that they are waiting to be revealed , when the obscuring daylight shall have withdrawn . " Thus , alas ! it is the obscuring daylight , in which merely we are satisfied to live , that conceals a world of pure glory , because a world of pure truth , wholly from our vision ! There is a sense , in which the true philosophy must be simple ; it will simplify all knowledge . It will be to all science , what the law of gravitation , in its discovery and application , was to astronomical science ; what the law of positive and negative electricity , or of the refrangibility of light was to other different branches of natural science ; or what the discovery of the circulation of the blood was to medical science . Law discovered is science revealed , in fulness and unity ; flilness without perplexity , unity without sameness . It is desultory phenomena , accounted for and brought together in intelligent relation ; arranged and classified in the order , beauty , and intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as the vital sap , that , circulating through the branches , gives greenness to the bud , life and freshness to the leaves , beauty and fragrance to the flower , wholesomeness and delicious flavor to the fruit . The true philosophy , though difficult of attainment in itself , will be a simplifying system , giving order and intelligent symmetry to things heretofore hidden in a supervening solution of falsehood , or looked upon as unconnected and without meaning . And this is the effect , which Leibnitz himself , in a most instructive passage , describes as the criterion of a true philosophy ; namely , that it would at once explain and collect the fra* , ments of truth scattered through systems apparently the most incongruous . " Mr. Coleridge*s system of philosophy is eminently a christian system . Its foundations , intellectual and moral , as well as its guiding and shaping principles , are in the word of God . He appeals to the sciiptures with a veneration , on all occasions , that is truly delightful . It was his conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human reason ; not the production of reason , but of God for the reason . He uttered noble sentiments in regard to the intellectual grandeur of the Bible , and its power in the education of the intellect , as well as the sanctification of the soul . " To give the history of the Bible as a book , would be little less than to relate the origin , or first excitement , of all the literature and science , that we now possess . " " Be assured , never yet did there exist a full faith in the divine word , ( by whom not immortality alone , but light and immortality were brought into the world , ) which did not expand the intellect , while it purified the heart ; which did not multiply the aims and objects of the mind , while it fixed and simplified those of the desires and passions . " " Religion is the poetry and philosophy of all mankind ; unites in itself whatever is most excellent in either , and while it at one and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , both the imaginative and the intellective faculties , superadds the interests of the most substantial and home-felt reality to both , to the poetic vision , and the philosophic idea . " He drew principles from the Bible to apply , not only to the movements of individuals , but of nations ; maintaining that that book is the best statesman 's manual , as well as christian 's guide ; and that , without its light , the most prosperous people are but a " busy ant-hill in calm and sunshine , " a revolutionary // cauldron in storm and tempest . His views in political economy were based upon it . " Men ( he thought ) ought to be weighed , not counted . Their worth ought to be the final estimate of their value . " He held it , for all n authority , a more commanding requisite of their rank , to be acquainted with the principles of govemment in the word of God , than with the doings of human sovereigns and legislators in the history of the world . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit with the Bible , is an argument of great weight in its favor . It is its elevated spiritual character , not less than the grandeur of his imagination , that imparts such eloquence to his metaphysical disquisitions , raising his own mind and heart to such a height of enthusiasm , as few writers , on the most animating subjects , have been able to reach . Such strains of eloquence as are continually breaking forth upon the reader , could have been inspired , one is tempted to believe , only by the countenance of truth . His is a system , " that recognises a 51 ) iritual world to come , and a spiritual nature in man to move in it ; spiritual presentiments and prefigurings ; spiritual wants , and obligations , and principles ; and grounds of conviction and action coeval with man 's spiritual being . It recognises God the Creator , and man made in his image ; but wilfully fallen , the subject of an evil nature . It is not merely a history of the human understanding . It asserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inward sense , whereby it has " the power of acquainting itself with invisible realities or spiritual objects . " It reco* , nises " truths that are either absolutely certain , or necessarily true for the human mind from the laws and constitution of the mind itself . " It recognises " spiritual truths , which must derive their evidence from within , which , whoever rejects , neither will he believe them , though a man were to rise from the dead to confirm them . " It strongly asserts the evil of permitting the mere understanding to usurp the dominion of the pure reason . it exhibits the entire difference between the two faculties ; " the legitimate exercise of the understanding , and its limitation to objects of sense ; with the errors , both of unbelief and misbelief that result from its extension beyond the sphere of possible experience .

In addition to sensation , perception , and practical judgment ( instinctive or acquirable ) concerning the notices furnished by the organs of perception , all which , in kind at least , the dog possesses in common with his master ; in addition to these God gave us REASON , and with reason he gave us reflective SELF-cONSCIOUSNESS ; gave us PRINCIPLES , distinguished from the maxims and generalizations of outward experience , by their absolute and essential universality and necessity ; and above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consequent personal amenability , lie gave us CONscIENCE . " This passage , from the fifteenth essay in the first volume of The Friend , though " the mere annunciation of a magnificent theme , " does yet constitute , with the eloquent sentences that follow , an epitome of the truths " demonstrated and doveloped , explained , illustrated , and exemplified , " in all the philosophical works of Coleridge .

Shutting the eye of reason on the eternal forms of substance and reality , towards which it is turned , and looking through the understanding , to judge according to sense , the sensible shadows with which the world is filled . Living by sight , instead of faith , both in intellect and morals ! The same obliquity and darkness in the will , which leads man to forget , neglect , and disobey his God , makes him turn his hack upon truth in its grounds and principles , forget the nature of spirit amidst phenomena and experiment , and give himselF up to the guidance of the understanding instead of the reason . To suppose that the influence of his fall would not extend to his intellect would not he less absurd , than to imagme that the tides would ehh and flow with the same regularity were the moon hurled from her orhit . Man loves to busy himself about the temporal part of his being , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the soul of science would do the same ; he must shut himself up to little truths , and feed on the husks of external knowledge , phenomenal , experimental , fragmentary , partial , unconnected . He loves to do this . It is depravity in the intellect . A meditative habit would , in the contemplation of truth and being , law and idea , inevitably lead to God . The " importance of speculative meditation , even for the worldly interests of mankind , " is a great and interesting topic , especially for an age , in which meditation is becoming rare , and contempt for old usages fashionable . in living by sense , man mistakes the true interest , even of sense . It was one of Mr. Coleridge 's greatest remarks , that " by celestial observations alone can terrestrial charts be constructed scientifically . " Even in natural science , no unity can be learned by mere experiment . Amazing discoveries of powers and affinities may be made , but no law discovered . Have great philosophers blundered upon law in experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then gone to experiment for the proof ? The observation of phenomena may suggest solutions , or set the mind at work to find them ; and among many guesses the truth may be hit ; but it is only law that can prophecy phenomena . The result of experiment would seem to indicate so and so , is the language of the experimental philosopher , groping after external clues . If my reasoning be correct , such // and such phenomena must result , is the language of the meditative philosopher , contemplating principles . " The knowledge of spiritual truth is of necessity immediate and intuitive ; and the world , or natural man , possesses no higher intuitions , than those of the pure sense , which are the subjects of mathematical science . " Now , it is the office of reason to behold absolute principles ; and spiritual intuitions are its world of action , especially if it be at one with faith . It is the office of the understanding to behold those principles acting in sense , and to follow them thus developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual world ; the face of the understanding points to the senses , and the world of material existence . To the eye of reason there is a hemisphere of gloiy spread out , and orbs of light hanging in the infinite expanse . To the eye of the understanding there is earth only , and its dark shadows , irradiated by beams reflected from that world of substance and spiritual glory , towards which reason looks with the calmness of intuitive vision . Understanding follows the developments of the laws of mind in inert matter , but , if left to itself , judges those developments to be mere material power , and recognises nothing but matter , and constructs a philosophy in respect to all man 's duties , interests , obligations , and belief , akin to the grovelling nature of materialism , and making him , in fact , but a higher order of animal . It can search out the powers of nature , so called ; turn the world into a vast laboratory of experiments ; and fill it with sagacious combinations , all tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish in the using , and to foster man 's pride in what he deems the rapid advance of his own perfectibility . It goes thoughtlessly on , wherever the discovery of new appearances in nature leads it ; and of itself would never dream that it had anything else to do but just to turn from everything inward , and examine and improve everything outward . It goes on , constructing new hives for the human bee to work in , where honey may be made in the smallest possible compass of space , and with the least possible expense of labor . The mechanical philosophy , constructed under the guidance of such a faculty , becomes " A puppet motion , That goes with screws , the notion of a notion . " // It reduces our intellectual and moral being , with all its operations , to a level with the compulsory movements of blind and dead matter , making the soul , as an independent being , a nonexistence , or nothing better than " the mere quicksilver plating behind a looking-glass , " whose only office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of sensation . rrl*e glass is the senses , the quicksilver the soul Under the influence of such a faculty , and of a philosophy constructed by it , whether materialism be acknowledged or not , in potential essence it prevails . Common minds , and perhaps philosophic minds , unconsciously , reason and act under its influence ; - and themselves they cheat With noisy emptiness of learned phrase , Their subtle fluids , imparts , essences , Self-working tools , uncaused effects , and all Those blink omniscients , those almighty slaves , Untenanting creation of its God ! " And all things , or rather , all products in the intellectual world , grow up in its unwholesome atmosphere , so stunted and dwarfed , that the commanding power over the soul , which belongs to the results of spiritual principles , is lost , nor does the mind , without difficulty , recognise in them its own birth-right . In that atmosphere , they are like the fungous mushroom plants , that have grown in the unwholesome shade of a tropical forest ; or like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healthy green , and vigorous , refreshing glow , of that nourished by nature in the open sun and air . The influence of false philosophy , when the falsehood leans towards materialism , is a malaria to the general intellect , a brooding fog over the whole mind of the age , scarce noticed but by some few , who have climbed up a great eminence where the air is pure , yet undermining the constitution , and diffusing everywhere a pestilential , stupifying power . Its influence on the religious character of the age is not less deleterious . The same guidance of the mere mechanical understanding , which denies life , and strikes death through the philosophy of the human soul , unspiritualizes that sacred word , which is the source of life , and reduces its living principles to a dead letter . Scientific theology ca*nnot exist under such an influence . Neither of God , nor of our true selves , were the philosophy real which denies intuitive principles , could we gain an idea . " The existence of // an infinite spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system , he mere articulated motions of the air . For as the function of the human understanding is no other than merely ( to appear to itself ) to combine and to apply the phenomena of the universe ; and as these derive all their reality from the primary sensations , and the sensations again all their reality from the impressions ab extra ; a God not visible , audible , or tangible , can exist only in the sounds and letters , that form his name and attributes . If in ourselves there he no such faculties as those of the will and the scientific reason , we must either have an innate idea of them , which would overthrow the whole system , or we can have no idea at all . " Mr. Coleridge reduces " the paralogisms , by the magic of which such a faith could find admission into minds formed for a nobler creed , to one sophism as their common genus ; the mistaking the conditions of a thing for its causes and essence ; and the process , by which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty itself . The air I breathe is the condition of my life , not its cause . We could never have learned that we had eyes but by the process of seeing ; yet having seen , we know that the eyes must have pre-existed , in order to render the process of sight possible . " Again , " we learn all things , indeed , by occasion of experience ; but the very facts so learned force us inward on the antecedents , that must be pre-supposed in order to render experience itself possible . " Again , defining the speculative reason as " the vis theoretica , et scientifit'a , or the power by which we produce , or aim to produce unity , necessity , and universality in all our knowledge , by means of principles a priori ; " he says , " by knowledge a priori we do not mean , that we can know anything previously to experience , which would be a contradiction in terms ; but , that having once known it by occasion of experience , ( i. e. something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it must have preexisted , or the experience itself would have been impossible . " A similar explanation may be found in a note on page 152 of the American Edition of the Friend . On page third of the Aids to Reflection , Coleridge beautifully remarks that our living soul , " in spite of the philosophy ( falsely so called ) which mistakes the causes , the conditions , and the occasions of our becoming conscious of certain truths and realities , for the truths and realities themselves , is a house not built with hands and gloriously furnished . " Again , // " by a science , I here mean any chain of truths , that are either absolutely certain , or necessarily true for the human mind , from the laws and constitution of the mind itself . In neither case is our conviction derived , or capable of receiving any addition from outward experience or empirical data , - i. e. matter of fact given to us through the medium of our senses , - though these data may hove been the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reflecting on the former , and thereby becoming conscious of the same . " Surely , these distinctions are clear , accurate and important . They reveal the wide difference between a system which supposes that we may learn all things by sensation , and reflection on sensation , that is , by an operation of the mere understanding , judging according to sense ; and the infinitely nobler system , which asserts a world of intuitive principles , certain from the nature of being , and discoverable only by the pure reason ; truths , to the knowledge of which mere sensation , or reflection on sensation , could never raise us , though it may awaken within us the conscrousness of their existence , and lead us to the earnest , stedfast , and meditative application of our organs of inward sense to their examination . Sensation , and the reflective operations of the understanding on the same , are but as steps in a ladder , up which we ascend to the region of spiritual truth , the empire of reason ; the steps are not themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal to us those truths ; and even at the topmost rounds of the ladder , it is the foot still , which is placed upon them , while the eye looks abroad upon the truth 's spiritual empyrean . If the philosophy of Coleridge be ttue , the system of Locke is perhaps erroneous , not so much by what it teaches , as by what it denies ; though indeed to deny truth is to teach error ; and in regard to the moral coloring of his system , one of his admirers and editors has remarked that he went to work , " at the very entrance on his essay , pointing out the true origin of all our passions and affections , namely , sensitive pleasure and pain , and accordingly directing us to the proper principle and end of virtue , private happiness in each individual . " It is rightly named of the understanding , and as the history of the human understanding , as an analysis and classification of its powers , and its operations in regard to ideas furnished by pure reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the distinction between these two faculties , and the whole grand // fabric erected on it , be not an utter fable , it is a treatise only on a portion of the human being , and that portion the least elevated , - placing , moreover , that portion for the whole , and laboring to resolve all ideas , as well as facts and appearances , into the work of the faculty , judging according to sense . With such a philosophy , it is evident that , instead of raising the soul to the contemplation of heights not to be reached , and truths not to be understood by the mere understanding , his labor would be to bring all truths , spiritual and temporal , down to the level of the same faculty judging according to sense . And at the close of certain chapters in his great work , as if there were , even in his own mind , a lurking consciousness , that a knowledge of the subjects of which it treats could not but appear unattainable through mere sensation , he adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing here , but what n ) ight be known through sense . In regard to the powers of the mind , the labor of the work is not an elevating , but a depreciating one , and its influence over the feelings must inevitably be corresponsive . May not this be the reason , why the soul of the student , in the pursuit of such a system , is so little excited with admiration , or made to thrill with awe , as in the presence of sublime and transcendental truth ? So far as we remember our experience in the study of it , we passed through it as on a dead uninteresting level of phenomena dissected , dried , and arranged , with all the skilfulness of anatomical knowledge , and reminding us all the while of Burke*s celebrated saying , that nothing can be conceived more hard , than the heart of a thorough-bred metaphysician . It is one of the most remarkable indications which way the truth lies , that even in the examination of sensible objects , philosophers are coming to conclusions above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , in the acknonledgment of life in nature , is leading to a philosophy of life above nature , in the science of true being . Sensation itself , and the world of sense examined in the light of reason , or even questioned by the mere understanding , make answer that they have in themselves a mystery of life , which can never be understood or explained from itself , nor by reflection on the data given to the mind through sensation , be they facts or phenomena , but by a reference to the powers of the mind , and to truths discoverable by pure reason , and necessarily true from the constitution of the mind itself . Nothing but // meditation on the laws of life in the soul , can reveal to the soul the laws of life in sense . What , indeed , is universal nature , but a world of external occasions , to awaken consciousness of the powers of the spiritual world within us ? The connection of the soul with sense , of the spiritual with the material , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , is as a tablet of wax , on which the soul reads the symbols of its own laws and intuitions . The world of sense , inscribed with these living characters , the result of spiritual powers in the observer , wears only a borrowed dignity , a dignity borrowed from the ideas of the soul . Now what can be said of that system , which contemplates the world of sensation as the origin of those ideas ? It is as if the mind of Milton , passing into dotage after the production of Paradise Lost , had read that work as the result of a peculiar combination of various forms of matter , the ink , the paper , and the printer 's types . Or as if , having forgotten it all , he had set himself to learn it , as the production of one ab extra , a power without himself . Even so , the soul has wandered from itself to the blind study of sensations , as if they were the sources of power and knowledge in the soul , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What in fact is but a reflection of our own being , has been supposed a property of the outward world ; even as men , moving in the desert , imagine the reflection , or rather projection , of their own persons in the distant mirage , to be a company of other travellers . Behold the fearfulness of this mistake ! The heaven , reflected in the bosom of a quiet lake , is gazed on in the reflection only , and as if the water and the unfathomable image were all one , and the glory of the image the result of power residing in the water . Thenceforth , the real heaven is forgotten , the aspect of the beholder is only doxvnward , astronomy itself is studied in the uncertain lake , and the science is as disturbed and void of unity , as the image of that reflected heaven is broken , when a pebble thrown in , or a breath of xvind moving , ripples the surface of the water . Even so , the very laws of man s spiritual being are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often deified , as the source of all his knowledge . The world of spiritual being and principles , of which the purest forms of matter , even the glory and the beauty of the external world , are but a dim , sombre , and dense reflection , // is forgotten , nay , its very separate existence is questioned or denied ; the soul is shut up to sense , and man is left to grope for spiritual knowledge amidst its fantastic images and uncertainties , its unsteady shadowings forth or developments of the living power that informs it , where , if at any time the soul seems to recognise , among the broken fragments , glimpses of great principles , remembrances of the heaven which is their source , if still , amidst all the whirring of external machinery , it experiences those " Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realized , High instincts , before which our mortal nature Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised ! " if it raises involuntarily those Obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can not be utterly repressed , and that faith in a higher life than nature , which even sense itself suggests , it is deemed guilty of transcendent mysticism , and visionary ravings . The yearnings after that , with which alone its immortal nature can be satisfied , the attempts to break its prison-house and soar away , are condemned as a reproach on the established condition of grovelling , and as indications of commencing insanity . Yet for all this , " Those shadowy recollections , Which , be they what they may , Are yet the fountain-light of all our day , Are yet a master-light of all our seeing , " shall prevail . They can not be concealed or darkened . They arrest attention , " Uphold us , cherish , and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal silence ; truths , that wake To perish never ; Which neither listlessness , nor mad endeavor , Nor man , nor boy , Nor all that is at enmity with joy , Can utterly abolish or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialism , // their voice is Peace ! be still I Listen to the mandate of the power that controls you , and acknowledge God ! ' It is a truth ( or call it a hope or beliel ) which we should not suppose any elevated mind would feel willing to surrender , that there are intuitive principles and ideas , inseparably and immutably connected with , and growing out of , the original constitution of man 's being . If this be so , it is asked , how happens it , that ideas , the idea of God , for instance , which are the common property and hirth-right of mankind , should be obliterated , apparently , in such multitudes , and so indistinct in all . Here we might answer with the great apostle . " Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , but professing themselves to be wise became . fools , and changed the truth of God into a lie , and did not like to retain God in their knowledge . " And this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so assimilated themselves to sense , that they have lost all consciousness of the existence of aught higher within them . But this is all they have lost . The ideas , though buried and forgotten , are there , and would be objects of consciousness , were this inner sense once awakened and sharpened by exercise ; nor ought the absence of consciousness iii regard to them , to be assumed as proof of their nonentity , nor the occasions , on the presentation of which they are drawn out into the consciousness by its own act , asserted as the external making known of truths from abroad . Amidst all the ruins , moral and intellectual , in which the greater part of mankind are lying , the features of those truths , though mutilated , are yet oftentimes to be distinguished ; offering to the denier of aught of spiritual intuition in man , a more difficult problem for solution , than the supposition that they are a part of his constitution in the image of his Maker . When we see in a newly split rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brake or a fish impressed in the substance of the stone , we attribute it at once to its right source ; nor can the soul do otherwise than believe , that the presence and agency of life bave been there . There are such Jbssil remains of godlike intuitions to be found in man , in his rudest and most ignorant condition . Images there are in his soul , of supernatural existences ; impressions , that must have been made in the very constitution of his nature , while the rock was forming , and that , however faintly and hardly to be delineated , // indicate a supernatural origin , and point to spiritual reality and life , and argue the existence in the soul of an organ of intuitive discernment of principles . The philosophical works of Coleridge , already published , profound as they are in themselves , were yet considered by their author as a mere preparation for the full development of his " system of philosophy for a christian man . " For the appearance of that work many have been long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , but one or two of the glowing letters of this illuminated manuscript , though enough to know that it is a flood of spiritual light . We know not whether the work , said to be now in a course of publication , be the same referred to repeatedly by him , apparently under different titles . Some of these references our readers will be curious to see , were it only for the view they give of what the poet and philosopher expected to accomplish . In the eighth chapter of the Biographia Literaria , he observes ; " I shall not dilate farther on this subject , b*cause it will ( if God grant health and permission ) be treated of at large and systematically , in a work which I have been many years preparing , on the PRODUCTIVE LOGOS , human and divine ; with , and as the introduction to , a full commentary on the gospel of St. John . " Again , afterwards , in a note on the works of Saumarez , he says , " In the preface to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logos , I have exhibited in detail the merits of this writer and genuine philosopher , who needed only to have taken his foundations somewhat deeper and wider , to have superseded a considerable part of my labors . " The first volume of the Biographiia Literaria was not concluded , but breaks off in the very middle of a sentence , ( to which point , its author says , " the work had been transcribed for the press , " ) with a letter from one of Mr. Coleridge 's friends , advising him not to print the remainder of the chapter on the imagination , because of its extreme compression and abstruseness , for which the minds of his readers would be utterly unprepared , and of which they would have a right to complain in a work like the Biographia Literaria . " I say , in the present work . In that greater work , to which you have devoted so many years , and study so intense and various , it will be in its proper place . " " Be assured , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILOsOPHY , which you have promised and announced ; and that // I xviii do my best to understand it . " The letter is admirable ; though often and earnestly have we wished that it never had been written , since its effect was the reservation of the chapter for a future publication , and the statement only of its main result . On page 104 , of the Aids to Reflection , its author again announces his great work thus : " The whole scheme of the christian faith , including all the articles of belief common to the Greek and Latin , the Roman and Protestant church , with the three-fold prong that it is ideally , morally , and historically true , will be found exhibited and vindicated in a proportionally large work , the principal labor of my life since manhood , and which I am now preparing for the vress , under the title , Assertion of Religion , as necessarily involving revelation ; and of christianity , as the only revelation of permanent and universal validity . " One passage , in the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings of its writer amidst the depths of Mr. Coleridge 's philosophy , that we can not but quote it . " The effect on my feelings , on the other hand , I can not better represent , than by supposing myself to have known only our light , airy , modern chapels of ease , and then , for the first time , to have been placed , and left alone , in one of our largest gothic cathedrals , in a gusty moonlight night of autumn ; now in glimmer , and now in gloom ; ' often in palpable darkness , not without a chilling sensation of terror ; then suddenly emerging into broad , yet visionary lights , with colored shadows of fantastic shapes , yet all decked with holy insignia and mystic symbols ; and ever and anon , coming out full upon pictures , and stone-work images of great men , with whose names I was familiar , hut which looked upon me with countenances , and an expression , the most dissimilar to all I had been in the habit of connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to venerate as almost superhuman in magnitude of intellect , I found perched in little fret-work niches , as grotesque dwarfs ; xvliile the grotesques , in my hitherto belief , stood guarding the high altar with all the characters of apotheosis . In short , what I had supposed substances , were thinned away into shadows , xvhile everywhere shadows were deepened into substances " If substance may be called , what shadow seemed , For each seemed either ! // We find it difficult to close this article , without a word upon Mr. Coleridge 's poetry , which may well he regarded as a luminous commentary on his philosophy . the same spirit animated both , and either mi*ht he called the soul of the other . If the tenderness and pathos of the heart of a true poet were never absent from his trains of speculative thinking , the meditative habit of the true philosopher is equally manifest in all his poetical efforts . Even in the translation of Wallenstein , the spirit of his philosophy is present , not less than the power of his imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of his philosophical and poetical being , as can be found even in his own eminently original compositions . The full amount which Mr. Coleridge has accomplished in philosophy , is yet to be determined ; what he might have done in poetry , every individual feels , who can justly appreciate the power and beauty of all that he published to the world . Nor can we cease to lament that lie should have passed through life , without dedicating his powers to the composition of a grand philosophic poem . it makes us weep inwardly , as often as we read his " meditative poems , " and experience , again and again , in the deepest recesses of the soul , a sense of their extreme beauty , to think of that noble mind , and the many noble schemes it left unaccomplished . Whether from causes within or without , in his own power to have removed or not ; whether he were Prometheus bound , the vultures raging at his heart , compelled to waste his vast intellectual energy in indignant lamentations to the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolent , and wasting as often as using the fire from heaven 's altar ; it makes but little difference in our sense of bitter regret for the loss we feel we have sustained . Though aware of the value of those efforts of his intellect , which in his prose works he has given to posterity , and that perhaps his mind would not have been employed for more lasting benefit to his race in the exercise of his poetic powers , yet we can not bear to think that such a genius should have dwelt among us , for so many long years , capable of so working , that without all doubt he might have produced a poem , which should have taken its place beside the Paradise Lost , a perfect orb of light for all future generations to gaze upon , a fountain of purity , strength and refreshment for the world 's mind to have resorted to ; that he should have been among us , and left us at length , with only // here and there a solitary polished shaft , a disconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials for that magnificent temple which he might have erected . The grandeur and exceeding beauty of these fragments show what the glory of that temple would have been ; for even now , there is no living genius , or if one , only one , who could bring a stone to compare with the precious workmanship of shaft , pedestal or arch . The very dreams of his mind were of richer stuff , of more spiritual texture , and extraordinary beauty , than all the poets since the time of Milton could supply . Images , that almost in themselves were poems , seemed the habitual medium , through which his mind cornmuned even with itself . His familiar meditations were poetry , and his poetry the uttered language of a meditative mood . His imagination was eminently original and creative ; an architect , powerful at any moment to upraise " A wilderness of building , sinking far , And self-withdrawn into a wondrous depth , Far sinking into splendor , - without end ! " And language of such spiritual beauty , that it was worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embody its ideal creations in the vividest reality of the archetype , almost with the very breath of the soul upon them , fell from him with no more apparent effort , than the surging music of a wind-harp , as it rises and falls with the movement of the passing breeze . If ever a spontaneous poet existed , Coleridge was certainly one . Sweetness of feeling , depth and sublimity of thought , the most beautiful imagery , and language that seemed itself a shining atmosphere , both of thought and imagery , seemed in him not so much the products , as parts of his intellectual being . He had all the stores of learning at command , and his genius dwelt among them like a permeating spirit , transfusing all things into an expression of itself , the soul of all . If to his great natural powers he had added the persevering fixedness of purpose , that distinguished his friend Wordsworth , in the realization of some permanent work , doubtless the planet added to the firmament of England 's literary glory would have shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morning star . For , with what perfectness of execution is ideal beauty realized in those short meditative l ) oeIns of his , that seemed , in the movement of his genius , an exercise as natural as to breathe . Perfect gems they are in themselves , and bearing proof , that // 345 deeper in the soil existed materials , where castellated palaces might have been hewn from one great diamond . That meditative pathos , which he describes as one of Wordsworth 's most valuable characteristics , existed also in himself , with a power much more concentrated . His mind was always finding symbols of spiritual being , and proofs of intellirent agency , indwelling and outshining through every lineament in the speaking face of nature . And he loved , in the exercise of his poetical genius , to shed over all images and things , and combinations from created objects , a softening , halloxved , and sacredly significant light ; even like that poured at sunset over all the rising landscape , making that lovelier , which before was lovely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have none ; till it appears to the beholder as if all nature , silent through excess of gratitude , were entranced in an act of evening adoration to the Eternal . It is the peculiar and invaluable characteristic , both of his poetry and philosophy , to inform everything with meaning ; he draws aside the dark veil of materialism , and reveals earth , air , and sea , instinctive with intelligent life ; everywhere we behold an Omnipresent Deity , all things , visible and invisible , unfolding the dread self-existing cause and ground of being , as living symbols of his power and glory . Creation is no more a temple of omnipotence without its soul . As poet or philosopher , through imagination combining and describing symbols of truth , or in philosophy explaining the language of its hieroglyphics in nature , he peopled the universe with praises . Solitude was not . He heard upon the wind the articulate voice Of God ; and angels to his sight appeared , Crowning the glorious hills of Paradise ; Or , through the groves gliding like morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked With winged messengers ; who daily brought To his small island in the ether ial deep Tidings of joy and love . " He has seemed to live and breathe , to converse and philosophize through the medium of poetry , as the highest form of truth . The few fragments we have in his works are only portions of an unintermitting process , rarely visible , that under all circumstances was going on within his mind . There , day and night , powers rarely conferred on man were working , and barmonists // constructin : , imaginable melodies , of which the strains we have heard were only snatches made audible at distant intervals . It is as if we stood beside a great gothic cathedral , in the heart of which a full choir are performing in unbroken circle the grand and solemn compositions of handel or Mozart , and sometimes in the half opening of the aisle doors , a closing harmony , or a powerful swell from the mid-volume of sound , bursts forib upon us . Such delights As float to earth , permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The massy gates of paradise are thrown Wide open , arid forth come in fragments wild Sweet echoes of unearthly melodies , And odors , snatched from beds of amaranth , And they , that from the crystal river of life Spring up on freshened wing , ambrosial gales ! " The versatility of his genius is proved in the success with which he has tried almost every style in poetry . His power over the supernatural , and in the province of the affections , and in the description of natural beauty , especially in the revelation of mind in nature , is always eminent . A master of thought , he is equally a master of language , in the beauty and purity of words , and in the sweetness and seemingly spontaneous harmony and melody , with which they flow to.gether . The incomparable grace , simplicity , and richness of his language , carry us back to the freshest and most delightful age of the English tongue . His power in its use is exhibited , as clearly as any where , in the translation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed in such sort , that one might easily persuade himself he is reading Shakspeare . Our limits compel us to refrain ; but do not our readers , while perusing a passage like the following , involuntarily exclaim , here breathes the very soul of the bard of Avon ? " Lo there ! the Soldier , rapid architect ! Builds his light town of canvas , and at once The whole scene moves and bustles momently , With arms , and neighing steeds , and mirth , and quarrel , The motley market fills ; the roads , the streams Are crowded with new freights , trade stirs and hurries ! But on some morrow morn , all suddenly , The tents drop down , the horde renews its march . // Dreary and solitary as a churchyard , The meadow and down-trodden seed-plot lie And the year 's harvest is gone utterly . " Or this : Oh day thrice lovely ! when at length the soldier Returns home into life ; when he becomes A fellow-man among his fellow-men . The colors are unfurled , the cavalcade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hark ! Now the soft peace-march beats , home , brothers , home The caps and helmets are all garlanded With green boughs , the last plundering of the fields . The city gates fly open of themselves , They need no longer the petard to tear them . The ramparts are all filled with men and women , With peaceful men and women , that send onward Kisses and welcomings upon the air Which they make breezy with affectionate features . From all the towers rings out the merry peal , The joyous vespers of a bloody day . Oh happy man ! Oh fortunate ! for whom The well-known door , the faithful arms are open , The faithful tender arms with mute embracing . " Did our limits permit the extract , the beautiful tale of Selma. printed in the appendix to the tragedy of Remorse , would be a passage more exquisite , we think , in itself , and more like Slinkspeare , than almost any other portion of Mr. Coleridge 's poetry The sublimity of Mr. Coleridge 's poetical genius would have been proved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there no other evidence of it . Perhaps there is ' but one other passage in the English language , of similar length , so truly sublime ; and that is , the expulsion of the rebel angels from heaven by the Messiah , at the close of the sixth book of the Paradise Lost . In like manner , the magnificence of his genius would have seen unquestionable , had he never written any other pieces but " The Frost at Midnight , " or " This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison , " or the " Ode to Dejection , " or even the dreamy fragment of the " Vi ion of Kubla Khan . " Almost any one of the pieces in the Sibylline Leaves , especially of those which he has classed under the title of " Meditative Poems , " would have put equally beyond question the greatness of his genius in respect to philosophic thought and meditative pathos . Its vivid and fantastic powe*- in exhibiting // the wildness and splendor and mystery of supernatural things , as personified and realized in description , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscurity , sometimes in a glare like that from midnight conflagrations , " now in glimmer and now in gloom , " yet always with singular boldness , is familiar to every reader of the " War Eclogue , " of the " Ancient Mariner , " and of " Christahel . " Then too , its domestic tenderness and sweetness , its purity in love , unsullied as the flowers that drink the dew , its mildness and affectionate friendliness , its entire freedom from misanthropy , its current of energetic thought , combined with healthful energy of feeling , and its exquisite and quiet accuracy in pictures of shade and sunshine , and shrubs , and trees , and goodly scenes in nature ; Here the bleak mount The bare bleak mountain , speckled thin with sheep ; Grey clouds , that , shadowing , spot the sunny fields ; And river , now with bushy rocks o'erbrowed , Now winding bright and full with naked banks ; And seats and lawns , the ahhey and the wood , And cots , and hamlets , and faint city-spire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dim coasts , and cloudlike hills , and shoreless ocean all these , with kindred qualities , are displayed in many of his pieces , in most delightful union . Take , for instance , the poem from which the preceding lines are selected , entitled " Reflections on havin* , left a Place of Retirement ; " with what sweet simplicity of description does it open ; it should he compared with the preceding piece , " The Eolian Harp , " which is still more beautiful , the opening lines being a description of the same scene at evening . " Low was our pretty cot : our tallest rose Peep 'd at the chamber-window . We could hear At silent noon , and eve , and early morn , The sea 's faint murmur . In the open air Our myrtles blossomed ; and across the porch Thick jasmins t*vined ; the little landscape round Was green and woody , and refreshed the eye . " Delightful , indeed , are Mr. Coleridge 's descriptions of natm'e* imbued , as they always are , with a coloring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fair luminous cloud , enveloping the earth " A stream of life is poured through creation , and a voice is sent forth from the soul , to be echoed back from vusi // ble things , as if it were indeed the answer of a soul dwelling in them , and constituting the principle of material beauty , and " of all sweet sounds the life and element . " In general Mr. Coleridge 's images flow through his poetry like a water-brook through a green pasture . He possessed , too , that power of genius , which condenses its imagery , and presents it in general terms , for the mind of the reader to carry into detail ; that power which , by one word or circumstance , reveals a wide unmeasured vast , as a flash of lightning in a dark night will light up the whole horizon to the traveller ; that power , which so operates on the mind of the reader , that the part undescribed , yet called up by the signal of the poet , shall be more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the poet uses , as if he had pointed with his finger and said , look , it comes . The difference between true poets lies eminently in the different degrees in which this power is possessed . It makes the difference between poetry that produces a confused impression by a profusion of brilliant epithets and details , and that which calls up in the mind , by single , simple words and well-selected circumstances , more than in such detail could be conveyed in volumes . Image after image presents whole landscapes , and word after word constitutes , as it were , the key-note to strains of unwritten melody . The language of a great poet is a sort of hieroglyphics for the imagination . Detail is the work of mere fancy ; the power of conversing with the soul through the medium of these comprehensive hieroglyphics is imagination . Wordsworth presents a noble instance of the exertion of this power from Milton . " Hear , " says he , " this mighty poet , speaking of the Messiah going forth to expel from heaven the rebellious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward came ; far off his coming shone ; " the retinue of saints , and the person of the Messiah himself , lost almost , and merged in the splendor of that indefinite abstraction , " His coming ! It is injustice to characterize Mr. Coleridge 's poetical works as fragments ; nor would they , if productions of an inferior mind , ever be so characterized . It is our sense of the magnificence of his genius , that dwarfs , as it were , its pub // lished fruits in our view . Little , comparatively , as he has given us in quantity , it is much in quality ; nor ought we to utter the voice of regret , when pages of such poetry are before us . " Long may the Spring , Quietly as a sleeping infant 's breath , Send up cold waters to the traveller , With soft and even pulse ! To Wordsworth and Coleridge , the latter the greatest philosopher and highest poetical genius , the other the most philosophic poet of modern times , the age is indebted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge . If to exert an almost magic power over minds of the noblest structure , and brightest promise ; if to turn the hearts of the young with keen and animated gaze to the unveiled countenance of truth ; if to waken and call forth their best energies of intellect ; if to form them to habits of thought and meditation ; if to rescue them from the baneful influence of that materialism , which has lain with a weight like death upon universal science ; if to make them feel the difference between wisdom and knowledge , and prize the latter only as a step in the acquisition of the former ; if to enkindle the imagination , and at the same time define its nature , enrich its wealth , and discipline its power ; if to detect and reprove the usurpations of the understanding , and give freedom to faith as above the understanding ; if to lead them to the contemplation of law in nature , and to the insight of principles in their own being , and to a reverential acknowledgment of the universal presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this can constitute a claim to admiration and love , surely these venerable men may demand it . Nor can any tell how far the exertion of their powers , the widely shining light of their intellect , may be the precursors of some great and beneficial change on earth . The full result of movements in the heavenly bodies , even upon our atmosphere , it takes ages to ascertain ; and there are stars , whose light has been travelling ever since creation , and yet has not reached us . The thoughts left on record , and those awakened in other intellects , by these minds , will be felt through the dateless revolutions of eternity . How far the works of genius in any de // partment , may be found hereafter to have filled their proper and necessary places in the advancement of the reign of righteousness on earth ; what sphere an Aliston , in the quiet , persevering pursuit of his noble art , may be found to have occupied in the spread of christianity , to the surprise of multitudes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more to do with extending its spiritual kingdom than years of the meditations of genius , we can not now determine . This we know , that sanctified genius , in all its departments , works and meditates for God . The truths of philosophy , as brought to view in the writings of Coleridge , are too nearly connected with those of theology , nay , they are too much the same with the realities of the word of God , not to exert a mighty influence in preparing the mind of the age for the reception of clearer , more scientific , and more spiritual views in religion ; unalloyed , we hope , by any mixture of that grovelling scepticism , which refuses to receive , because it can not understand , truths of all others in the universe of being the sublimest and most interesting . Let but " the fresh air blow through the soul 's shut up mansion ; " let the stifling influences of materialism be swept away , and an atmosphere congenial to spiritual truth , the universal , invigorating breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a spiritual being , and it needs no prophet to foretell the glorious results . " Creature all grandeur , son of truth and light , Up from the dust ! the last great day is bright , Bright on the Holy Mountain , round the Throne , Bright where in borrowed light the far stars shone . Look down ! the depths are bright ! and hear them cry , Light ! light ! - Look up ! t is rnshing down from high ! Regions on regions , - far away they shine ; T is light ineffable , t is light divine ! - Immortal light , and life forevermore ! ' Off through the deep is heard from shore to shore Of rolling worlds ! - Man , wake thee from the sod ! Awake from death , awake ! and LIVE WITH GOD ! "
