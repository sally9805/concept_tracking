Tekousa de to paidion , ekalesen auto Samouel , toutestin , akousei THeou . Chrysostom . Eis ten Annan . Log. a . PREFACE . The early books of the Old Testament not only contain much matter of historical value , but they act upon the reader with a peculiar dramatic effect . The effect , to which we allude , is noticed in any book , where individuals are introduced directly to our attention , as speaking in their proper persons ; and more sensibly , where several individuals are represented in dialogue . Thus we perceive this effect in the Histories of Xenophon and Josephus , of Livy and Tacitus and Sallust , in the Epics of Homer and Virgil , in the Satires of Juvenal , among familiar examples ; and we are interested more by these writers than by others in the same departments of literature , who have overlooked this cause of their popularity . For a similar reason , Allegorical Fictions and Novels , which all are epic or historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great many subjects do not , indeed , admit this effect ; and the largest number of books must be unavoidably without it . But historical narration becomes tedious , when it is , for any length of time , excluded . It is the life of narrative , the principle which gives animation and seeming reality to historical action . Besides , when we read the very language of an individual , we exercise our own discrimination , in forming an opinion of his character ; we become ourselves actors , judges , and are not mere passive learners ; while he is no longer one of whom we have only heard , but is made an acquaintance . Thus a Journal , or a volume of Letters , excites us more readily and intensely than any description of a man 's life or qualities by the author . Thus , too , an Oration is more entertaining than a Dissertation . Perhaps the preceding remarks suggest a reason for the interest which is felt in perusing the early books of the Old Testament , where each subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a key to his character and purposes and course of life , and is , as it were , introduced to our personal knowledge  --  in their dramatic effect . This effect may be aided by the simple idioms of an ancient language , and by the mode in which these Scriptures were composed . The four last books of the Pentateuch are chiefly a diary of Moses . Genesis seems to be a compilation by Moses , ( forming a necessary introduction to his diary , ) from documents in his possession , under a Divine guidance . The other of these Scriptures , from Joshua through the Chronicles , seem likewise to be selected and put together , under a similar direction of God , from later and larger books , authentic and well known in their age . From the mode of their composition , in connexion with the fact that they were written in that early , pastoral period , when language was in its youth , and history was dressed in the light and attractive garb of fable , we should expect to find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minuteness of incident , and unity in the several accounts ; and we are not disappointed . The Book of Genesis and the First Book of Samuel , are illustrations . What can exceed , in dramatic effect , the story of Joseph in the former , or those of Hannah , and Eli , and Samuel , and Saul , and David , in the latter ? Few formal dramas rise to their effect . The following pages are founded upon the first and second chapters of the First Book of Samuel , and the Acts succeed each other in the order of the Scriptural narrative . One object of them is to exemplify the composition and style of the early Hebrew Scriptures , as remarkably adapted to produce a dramatic effect . Any careful reader of the First Book of Samuel , for instance , will observe a succession of narratives , all connected in the whole history , each being a sequel to the preceding , each serving for the basis of a drama , and having its distinctive circumstances , and separate unity . The patience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of the first , perhaps the least interesting , in the succession . Another object is to exhibit the workings of the religious sentiment in a mind situated as was the wife of Elkanah , in an age , when Jehovah was manifest Theocrat in Israel , and when the predictions through their forefathers opened new and strange hopes to the mothers in the Twelve Tribes . The character of Hannah , as it may be collected from the condensed relation on which the following pages are founded , appears to be eminently spiritual ; evincing an uncommon fortitude and forbearance and purity , sentiments of exquisite delicacy , an unresisting acquiescence in the will of God , and unfaltering hope in His mercy ; so that the representation of her feelings given by us is not , it is trusted , unnatural or improbable . Moreover , she was endowed with a prophetic inspiration ; and she was worthy of it , as also of the dignity to which she was appointed in being the parent of Samuel . By her faith he was raised up , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Israel , and to prepare for the advent of the Messiah of mankind . One , who can not admire , in the character of Hannah , her patient submissiveness under affliction , her steady confidence in God , her cherished desire ( hallowed by its motives ) that she might at length devote , to her Father in Heaven , that most precious gift which a mother may lay upon His altar , has yet to realize the possession of some of the deepest , and purest , and loveliest rudiments of our devotional and social nature . The writer is aware that this production , from the nature of its subject , lacks that excitement in its incidents , and that complication in its plot , which are agreeable to all , and are considered essential by many , in a Dramatic Composition . But , since it is intended for only a quiet and contemplative perusal , this defect may be overlooked . The writer is aware , too , that whatever of interest is excited by it will be felt by the Devotional Affections , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manifest in their workings , lie nearest to our spiritual nature . But it is thought that our worthiest sentiments are such as these . The true and only nobility is , as a Heathen Moralist has written , " virtue , " or as we should say , in the words of a Christian Poet , " the princely heart of innocence . " Any may indulge anger and revenge ; few can forgive . Any may act , even violently ; few can suffer with patience . Any may trust in themselves ; few do trust , without complaining , in the Providence of God . Nor are these hidden sentiments less energetic , because we may not see them in the confusion of a visible excitement . The foam-crested and ragged and fitful waves do terrify ; but the long and heavy swells of the unbroken and glassy sea tell of its majesty and its strength . If any should object to the class of moral sentiments , which is chiefly developed in the history of the subject of this sketch , we will remind them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by Inspiration of God , is profitable ; "  --  that every emotion , of even our inferior constitution , when acting together with the sentiments of devotion , or directed by motives of piety , becomes exalted , and purified , and , as it were , spiritualized , by the association ;  --  and that no ordinary event in the Providence of God , and no elementary fact in the operation of that Nature , which Himself , the All-Wise , and Pure , and Perfect , ordained , are unworthy the contemplation of His creatures , or unfitted to their instruction and improvement . Even Philosophy , without Christianity , has taught , that " Omnia vero , qu secundum Naturam fiunt , sunt habenda in bonis . " Cicero . De Senectute .

HANNAH Hannah  --  ( walking in the field at evening . ) Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome be Death ! would he might quickly come , To lay my poor , tired body still at rest , And , ' mid dark Sheol 's noiseless mansions , give , What earth has not , the balmy peace I love !

Jehovah ! Thou art hid in mystery , And hidest knowledge ! still I worship Thee ! Now hath my soul long dwelt among her foes , My adversary hath provoked me sore , That I should murmur at Jehovah 's will , And curse my God , because He proves His own . Yet would I soon be gathered to the grave , Where sleep the fathers , and the happy dead , Then would I rest  --  ELKANAH Elkanah  --  ( meeting her . ) Hannah , why weepest thou ? Why , when the sacrificial feast is made , Dost thou not eat the worthy portion spread ? And why is thy heart grieved ? HANNAH . Hannah I seek for peace , Such as this world has never brought to me . My days have been of disappointment all ; And hope has been deferred , until my heart End note 4 : 1Kb Is sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I long for rest , Elkanah , rest in death ; In that long sleep my failing heart would lie , And be refreshed in its unbroken peace .

ELKANAH . Elkanah Why thus despond ? Is there no joy of friendship unfulfilled ? No humble duty left ? no tranquil hope ? Am not I better to thee than ten sons ? Shall one distress rob time of all its bloom , And leave thee desolate ? HANNAH . Hannah Not desolate . Yet strip from Libanus its ancient trees , And its tall peaks , shorn of their majesty , Would shine across the plain , naked and sere , E'en if the lowly vine should clasp its sides , And the small wild-flower blossom round its crags . So every human life has its chief grace , Without which it is solitary life , Whatever else remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature .

My husband , on Mount Ephraim , thou hast seen , End note 5 : 1Kb When the great eagle , who has built her nest Beneath the highest cliff , has been away Eastward to Jordan , and returns fatigued , And falters in her flight so long sustained , How she has dropped her food , at the loud shout Of idle shepherds , for the fresh hawk 's prey , And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyry , where she sits , And hears her hungry young , disconsolate , But can not help them . So I feel bereft , And well-nigh hopeless . ELKANAH . Elkanah Yet the same eagle Tarries not long upon her resting-place , But , quick revived , leaps off , and spreads her wings , And pierces upward , through the buoyant air , With narrowing circles , till she poises high , As if to meditate some new resolve ; And then , strong-nerved , she seeks again the place Where Jordan mingles with Asphaltites , And traverses the stretching space again , And wanders there above the winding stream , Until she bears another booty home ; And , after all , perchance , at the ninth hour , Her young may scream unfed . But she toils on ; For now she speeds her westward course afar , By fertile Ajalon , and its dark brook , That empties in the briny main of waves ; Beyond the outer coast she onward flies , So that the setting sun may light her search Upon the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , and the white moon Sheds her pale rays upon the loftiest hill , We 've heard the wakeful eaglets of the rock Rejoicing roughly for their late repast . Lean thou on God , who feeds the savage brood ; He may reward thee , Hannah , for thy faith ;  --  Thou art of Abraham . HANNAH . Hannah Thou hast said well , I am descended from the chosen seed ; And therefore I had hoped , the Sceptred One , End note 6 : 1Kb In whom all nations of the earth are blessed , Should trace his noble lineage clearly back , Through her the generous Elkanah loved . I have thought much about this future Prince , And in my broken spirit I have learned , What the ambitious mothers in these tents ,  --  Who have presented , all but me , their babes , Before God 's good high-priest ,  --  have never dreamed . My worn-out heart , dead to the Visible , And anxious for the grave , has found its peace In the unseen future of Eternity ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come , to bless with Love Divine , To give to man my peace  --  the spirit 's bliss  --  ( All else is earthly , this alone of God ) , To cheer the wretched world , and save the vile , To reign a Mighty God , the Prince of Peace . Hearken , Elkanah , I had rather be Such as I am , though scorned by Israel 's dames , Than be the mother of a Warrior King ; This is Peninnah 's hope , but I love peace . I am a daughter of the holy seed , Through which the promise runs to be fulfilled ,  --  In this is sorrow . ELKANAH . Elkanah Then hear thou my word . Thou knowest , Hannah , I have loved thee well ; And now my love endures , as when , at first , I led thee , with my train , betrothed and veiled , End note 7 : 1Kb Home , with thy maidens , to my father 's house . But I have known thy pure and blameless truth , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commune oft with heavenly messengers , Till thou hast caught the temper of their world , And tellest mysteries gathered from their lore . Now , I revere thee with religious love , And honor this desire , which is from heaven . Be not thus sad ,  --  there 's comfort in the Law . Our three first mothers , Sarai , Abram 's spouse , And fair Rebecca , Isaac 's cherished wife , And Rachel , dear to Jacob , from whose son Thy tribe of Ephraim sprang , were all like thee ; And thou may'st be like them , in trusting God . Think , too , He has commanded in His word To muzzle not the ox that treads the corn ; End note 8 : 1Kb  --  To pay the helpless laborer for his task , His daily task , soon as the sun has set ;  --  To leave the harvest-gleaning for the poor And fatherless .

Elkanah Now art thou worthy of the sacred line Of our great mothers . HANNAH . Hannah I will think of these , And strive to follow in their holy path . In pleading patience to my Maker 's will , And in complete obedience to His word , I will walk humbly , and rejoice in God My Saviour . ELKANAH . Elkanah I will never doubt thy faith . But come , the dews are falling , and their gems Are glittering , in the star-light , at our feet , And the chill night-air bids thee seek thy tent .

Sure he regards me with as fond a care As the last patriarch felt , who patient served , For Laban 's younger daughter , twice seven years , In Haran 's pastures . I will pay his choice , So undeserved , with kindest offices , And gain my happiness in yielding his ; I will endure my woes , and throw aside All selfishness , and wish to live for him . Behold , my heart has strangely hushed its throbs ; My senses all are calm , as the deep lake , When the low summer wind has ceased to stir , And the dry leaf floats on its top unwet .

Thou God , who mad'st these heavens and all their host , I bow before thy dreadful name I AM , And bless thee for thy love , O Lord of Hosts ! End note 10 : 1Kb Thou didst fast bind the Pleiades in one , With all their lesser bands , perpetual ; Vast Orion thou hast chained , and none can loose ; Mazzaroth , with his signs , thou leadest forth ; And , with his sons , ever inseparable , Dost guide Arcturus safe around the pole ; The Crooked Serpent , in his mazes bent , Thou holdest in his bounds ; and every orb Controllest by Thine ordinance of power . Thy Love is Life , throughout the universe , And in my soul ; and , while I stand and gaze Into the firmament , and search its depths Of viewless , boundless glory , I am rapt , And blended with the Universal Life .

But I am lingering long . Yet would I wait , Until I chant once more my evening song , Taught me , by sadness , in my lonely hours ;  --  Thus in all nature Goodness is and rules , For Sorrow 's self gives comfort to her child .

Light vapors , on the sky , Dim thee , in passing by , And now these dark clouds shut thee from my view ; But in a little while They vanish , and thy smile Plays through their edges with a lustrous hue ; So grief 's dull shadows cross my heart , To make it feel the happier yet when they depart ! Another Star shall shine , With radiance more than thine , And thou shalt joy , when His effulgence gleams ; New splendors will disperse Throughout the universe , Soon as the dazzling Star of Jacob beams ; Thou tellest , He will come at length , And my heart knows that He is rising in His strength !

This house we call Jehovah 's ; it is His , ( For all is His , )  --  and ours ,  --  our Father 's home ,  --  Where , when we come , we feel our brotherhood , And His Paternal love ; and pay our vows Of filial reverence at His sacred shrine , Claiming His promise , while we keep His word .
