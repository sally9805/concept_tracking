txt THE preceding volumes of this miscellany have been noticed in our journal . We learn with satisfaction , that it will be continued . The volumes , which have hitherto appeared , present an interesting and instructive variety of historical and biographical research . A work conducted on the plan of tl ) e library of American biography occupies an important middle ground , between a biographical dictionary and a history . It affords a convenient vehicle for information relative to distinguished individuals and memorable occurrences , which might run into too great length , for the opposite purposes either of a biographical dictionary or a generalhistory . The experience of all ages has pronounced in favor of works of this description . Plutarch 's parallel lives may be considered as their representative specimen , and perhaps for all classes of readers , Plutarch 's lives is as great a favorite as any work ever composed , the bible excepted . The present volume of the biographical library contains less variety than some of its predecessors , but it is equally valuable . A memoir of Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the volume is devoted to a life of // Sir Henry Vane . The life of Wayne is from the pen of General John Armstrong . It is a narrative of great interest . The grandfather of General Wayne , bearing also the name of Anthony Wayne , emigrated from England to Ireland in 1681 , where he established himself as a farmer . He fought on the popular side , at the battle of the Boyne . Not satisfied with the government which he had contributed to establish , nor with the manners of the people among whom he had settled himself , he removed from Ireland to Pennsylvania in the year 1722 , at the age of sixty-three years . He established his family in Chester county , where on the first of January 1745 , his grandson and namesake , the general Anthony Wayne of the American army , was born . He was the only son of his father , Isaac Wayne , and was sent to school to his uncle Gilbert . Almost all that is known of his boyish days is contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father , of the youthful chieftain , in which the former expresses himself in no very promising terms of his pupil . " I verily suspect , " says he , " that parental affection blinds you ; and that you have mistaken your son 's capacity . What he may be the best qualified for , I know not ; but one thing I am certain of , he will never make a scholar . He may make a soldier ; he has al .. ready distracted the brains of two thirds of the boys , under my direction , by rehearsals of battles , sieges , &amp;c . They exhibit more the appearan6e ef Indians and Harlequins than of students ; this one , decorated with a cap of many colors ; and others habited in coats as variegated as Joseph 's of old ; some laid up with broken heads and others with black eyes . During noon , in place of the usual games and amusements , he has the boys employed in throwing up redoubts , skirmishing , &amp;c . I must be candid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his books , I shall be under the painful necessity of dismissing him from the school . " The writer of this sketch of the life of the future hero regards the foregoing letter as a hasty report , " and far from prophetic in its forebodings . " But it really strikes us as an extraordinary instance of foresight as to future character . We read " mad Anthony " in every line ; and if such a thing as phrenology had existed in Chester county , in the middle of the last century , and worthy Mr. Gilbert Wayne had been an adept in that noble science , we should suppose , that he must have found , on the cranium of the youthful hero , language moderate , // combativeness large , and made his report accordingly . The account of the uncle drew forth an earnest and affectionate remonstrance from the father . Anthony returned to school with the best resolutions ; abandoned his redoubts and skirmishes , stuck to his books , and in the words of our author , " at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed a capacity for scholarship , but even drew from him a confession , that ' having acquired all , that his master could teach , he merited the means of higher and more general instruction . " His father was not slow in acting on this more favorable estimate of his son 's capacity , and the young Anthony was accordingly sent to the Philadelphia academy to complete his education . There he remained till his eighteenth year , when , having acquired a competent knowledge of the lower branches of the mathematics , he returned to his native county , and opened an office as a land surveyor . After the peace of 1763 , a land company was formed at Philadelphia , with a view to the settlement of a portion of the back country . Young Wayne , then in his twenty-first year , was selected , on the recommendation of Dr. Franklin , as the agent to visit the territory , inspect the soil in reference to its agricultural character and commercial facilities , and finally to locate the settlement . He acquitted himself in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be still farther entrusted by them , with the actual superintendence of the infant settlement ; which , however , was broken up in 1767 , by the increasing embarrassment of the relations of the Colonies with the mother country . In the course of this year , young Wayne married the daughter of Benjamin Penrose , an eminent merchant of Philadelphia , and , returning to Chester county , resumed his occupation as a surveyor , devoting himself , in the intervals of his employment in that capacity , to agriculture . Wayne was prompt in foreseeing the issue of the controversy with England , which had now reached its height . The military passion of his youth revived . He gave himself wholly up to preparation for the impending crisis , and devoted his time to the instruction , in tactics and drill , of the voluntary associations of Chester county . Such was their aptitude and his diligence , that in the space of six weeks , he had organized a volunteer corps , " having more the appearance of a veteran than of a militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit attracted // the public notice . In January , 1776 , Mr. Wayne was appointed to the command of one of the four regiments raised by Pennsylvania , in the continental service . He was ordered tojoiri the northern army under Major General Sullivan . He commanded one of the three regiments , detached under General Thompson , for the unsuccessful expedition to Trois Rivi*res on the 3d of July ; and on the capture of the commander in chief , General St. Clair , the next senior officer being disabled by a wound , the duty of conducting the retreat devolved on Wayne . Though wounded himself , he performed this duty successfully , and brought the greater part of the hrigade hack to the American camp at the mouth of the Sorel . On the forced retreat of General Sullivan from this post , the duty of covering the movement was assigned to Wayne with the Pennsylvania regiments , and so critical was it in point of time , that the boat latest in getting into motion was not beyond the reach of musket shot , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The army remained at Ticonderoga the rest of the year 1776 ; and on the march of General Gates , with a large portion of the men under his command , to reinforce General Washington , Col. Wayne was left in command , with two thousand five hundred men . This arrangement was sanctioned by Congress , who soon conferred on him a commission as Brigadier General . He remained in command of the fortress till the spring of 1777 , when at his own request he was transferred to head-quarters . He joined the main army under General Washington on the 15th of May , and was immediately placed at the head of a brigade , " which , " as Washington remarked on the occasion , " could not fail , under his direction to be soon greatly distinguished . " This prediction was shortly fulfilled . In the movements and maneuvres of the early part of the summer of 1777 , directed by Washington to countervail the demonstrations of the British army , General Wayne bore a conspicuous part , and received the public commendation of the commander-in-chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brandywine , General Wayne was posted at Chad 's ford , and sustained a vigorous attack by the troops under Knyphausen . He maintained his position with great gallantry , till learning the defeat of the American force in his rear , he deemed it necessary to fall back on the main army . In the affair of the 20th , the conduct of // Wayne was impeached by a subordinate , to whose own failure to perform his duty the losses of the night were imputable ; but the Court IMartial , which Wayne demanded , acquitted him with honor . In the unfortunate battle of Germantown , General Wayne bore a prominent part , and his own conduct and that of his brigade were mentioned with applause by the coinmander-in-chief , in his official despatch . In the following winter , General Wayne rendered essential service , by the successful manner in which he conducted the foraging department ; a branch of duty rendered as difficult as it was odious , by the necessity of resorting to force , in the entire exhaustion of the military chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marked by Washington , with particular expressions of approbation . The summer of 1779 was signali zedhy the capture of Stony-point , achieved by Wayne , at the head of a light brigade , organized at the commencement of the campaign . This affair is pronounced by General Armstrong the most brilliant of the war . It acquired to the fortunate commander a military reputation of the most enviable character . At the commencement of the attack , Wayne was struck by a musket-ball on the head and sunk to the ground . He immediately rose on one knee , and exclaimed , " march on , carry me into the fort ; for , should the wound be mortal , I will die at the head of the column . The author of this biography has taken renewed occasion of the narrative of the capture of Stony-point , to correct the alleged errors of the late Chief Justice of the United States . We confess ourselves not wholly gratified with the tone , in which these corrections are made . In the present case , as the statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his despatch to Congress of the 20th of June 1779 , the effect of the correction appears to be to impugn the accuracy of Washington , in a statement of facts necessarily within his own knowledge . In the body of that despatch Washington makes the statement explicitly , and repeats it in the posteript , that , owing to some misconception on the part of General Wayne , of the officers of the guard , or of Captain Fishbourn , the despatches of Wayne to Washington , containing the intelligence of the capture of Stony-point , were not forwarded to General M'Dougall . This failure is declared by Washington to have occasioned a loss of several hours , and is mentioned by him as one of the causes , why the projected attack on // Verplanck 's point did not take place . General Armstrong , in citing the passage of Marshall on which he comments , does not cite it as it stands , either in the first or second edition ; and his statement accurately quoted , does not appear to us obnoxious to all the exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , it appears to us to be borne out by Washington 's despatch already alluded to . The next service rendered by Wayne , was the attack of Fort Lee on the 21st of July , 1780 , and with this affair the active service of the campaign closed . In the following winter , and at the close of the festivities of the 1st of January , 1781 , the memorable revolt broke out in the Pennsylvania line , threatening the most disastrous consequences . The address and temper of General Wayne were signally manifested , in bringing the troops to a sense of their duty , and arranging the terms of the accommodation . In the summer of this year , General Wayne acted under the orders of Lafayette in the campaign in Virginia , which preceded the capitulation of Yorktown . In an affair on the 5th of July , when he unexpectedly found himself , with a small force , opposed to the whole British army , and about to be turned on both flanks , by a bold onset , as happily conceived as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defensive , compelled him to call in his detachments , and then , by a rapid retreat , extricated himself from the imminent danger of losing his whole corps . General Wayne had an active command in the army concentrated at Yorktown , and shared in the honor of the glorious event there consummated . In the month of December following , notwithstanding a wound received in the Virginia campaign , he was detached by General Greene , with a small force , to hold the enemy in check , and to establish the authority of the United States in Georgia . The manner in which he performed this duty , with a force greatly disproportioned to the seeming magnitude of the work to be performed , is truly admirable . The British were shut up within Savannah , the open country wrested from the tories , the auxiliary force of Choctaws and Creeks successively defeated , and all the objects of the campaign effected with singular success . General Wayne remained on this station till the close of the war , and finally granted a capitulation to the garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country . // On the conclusion of the peace , he retired to his native county of Chester , with a reputation for bravery , enterprise , and conduct , not perhaps surpassed by that of any of his brother officers . He was soon elected to the Council of Censors of Pennsylvania , and afterwards a member of the Convention , which was called to revise and amend the Constitution of the State . He performed the duties thus devolved upon him , with laborious assiduity ; but for private reasons , withdrew from any further pursuit of public life . A large grant of land was made to him by the State of Georgia , in consideration of his great services there rendered , at the close of the war ; but the unfortunate donation proved a source of serious and long continued embarrassment , which ended only with the sacrifice of the property . After ten years ' retirement , Gen. Wayne was again called to the field . Hostilities , as is well known , had never ceased on the western frontier . A cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians ; and the expeditions of Harmar and St. Clair had successively terminated in disaster . In the year 1793 , after a vain resort , for the last time , to negotiation , preparations were made by the general government for another appeal to arms . Wayne was placed in command of the force called into the field ; but it was not till mid-summer 1794 , that he was enabled to take up his march from Cincinnati . On the 8th of August , he reached the spot where the Indian and Canadian force was concentrated , at the junction of the Auglaize and the Miami of the Lake . On the 19th he attacked them in their entrenchments , from which , with a small loss on his own side , he drove the enemy with great slaughter . Pursuing his advantage , he penetrated the indian country to Greenville , laying waste the territory of the enemy . Taught by their experience the impolicy of continuing the war , the savages were brought to reasonable terms of pacification , by a treaty of which the basis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was definitively concluded in the course of the following summer . From this treaty , may be dated the efficient settlement of the territory North West of the Ohio . The biography before us terminates with this event , and in the following terms - " Plaudits and thanks , public and private , now accumulated upon Wayne . The Congress , then in session , unanimously // adopted resolutions highly complimentary to the General and the whole army . The President of the United States conveyed to him expressions of the warmest approbation and the highest respect . His entry into Philadelphia was triumphal . All business in the city was suspended ; he was met on his approach by its militia in mass , and conducted through the streets amidst the ringing of bells , the roaring of cannon , and the acclamations of a grateful people . Such was the spontaneous hurst of public admiration ; and such the high evidence of the universal sense entertained of the important services he had rendered . Nor , ( if estimated by the number and character of the benefits they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these were overrated Besides putting an end to a war , brutal as bloody , and waged without the smallest respect for age or sex throughout our western frontier1 they had the further effect of quieting Indian excitement in both the north and the south ; of opening to a civilized population the fine region , which had been the theatre of the late hostilities ; and of eventually adding to this a large territory equally inviting to settlement and culture . A further and most useful effect was to allay the feverish and factious feeling at home ; which , availing itself of the unfortunate issue of Harmar 's and St. Clair 's campaigns , had gone far to shake the confidence of the people in the executive branch of the government ; while , abroad , it hastened the execution of the pending negotiation with Great Britain , by which , the American posts , so long and pertinaciously held by that power , were at last given up . " Appointed by the government sole commissioner for treating with the North-western Indians . and receiver of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne again returned to the West ; and , after a prompt and faithful discharge of the duties attached to these new functions , while descending Lake Erie from Detroit , was attacked by the gout , which in a few days put an end to his life and his labors . His remains , temporarily buried on the shore of the Lake , were removed by his son in 1809 to the cemetery of St. David 's Church , in Chester county , Pennsylvania ; where a monument , raised to his memory by his comrades of the revolution , exhibits the following inscriptions . " North Front . - Major-General ANTHONY WAYNE was born at Waynesborough , in Chester County , State of Pennsylvania , A. D. 1745 . After a Life of Honor and Usefulness , he died in December , 1796 , at a military Post on the Shore of Lake Erie , Commander-in-chief of the Army of the United States . His military Achievements are Consecrated in the History of his Country , and in the Hearts of his Countrymen . His Remains are here deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished Military Services of MAJOR-GENERAL ANTHONY WAYNE , and as an affectionate Tribute of Respect to his Memory , this Stone was erected by his Companions in Arms , the Pennsylvania State Society of the Cincinnati , July 4th , A. D. 1809 , Thirty-fourth Anniversary of the Independence of the United States ; an Event which constitutes the most appropriate Eulogium of an American Soldier and Patriot . " - pp. 78- 81 . And now shift we the scene ; from the cemetery of St. David 's and the peaceful resting-place of a revolutionary officer , to Towerhill and the bloody scaffold of a murdered witness of the truth ; from the glorious battle fields of the war of independence , from Brandywine and from Yorktown , where Wayne , in defence of American liberty is found at the head of his division in the army , in which the militant hopes of the awakened continent , the allied armies of France , and the brave adventurers of half Europe , are assembled , - to the cradle of New England , the little band of austere and high-souled patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which disturbed their entire Commonwealth , at a period when its whole population might have been bestowed on one of the large islands in Boston harbor . The scenes are laid on the same continent . A span of time only has intervened . The mighty unities of time and of place are preserved in this stupendous drama , and the ACTION , in its great principles , is also one ; but what mighty expansion of interests what a marvellous chain of events , what an unexampled a connection of feeble beginnings , with a consummation , to which even we who have witnessed it , strive in vain to do justice ! On the third of March 1635 , a young nobleman , but lately arrived in Boston from old England , was admitted to the freedom of the colony . He has come , a youth of twenty-three years of age , to a region , where a purely scriptural respect for age is a leading trait of character , a fixed point of manners . Not closely associated with the founders of the colony before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interval of five years , and when the services , the hardships , and the experience of the first lustre would seem naturally to entitle the active leaders of the great undertaking to a preference , which no new comer , at the eleventh hour , could possibly expect to surmount . Nevertheless , a twelvemonth has scarcely passed away , before the Winthrops , the Dudleys the Endi // cotts , the Haynes are set aside , and the youthful stranger , at the age of twenty-four , is chosen governor of the colony . It is plain from this fact , that he must he no common personage . The proverbial notionalness of the Boston folks did not surely go the length of thus taking up the last new comer , merely as such . When we look into the English hooks , we find his name buried almost , it is true , under the bloody ruins of the scaffold , where he shed his blood , and we discern something , amounting almost to a conspiracy against his fame , among the popular writers of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright witnesses reveal the truth and vindicate the choice of our ancestors . Milton 's single sonnet is of itself a charter of immortal renown ; and the testimony of Sir James Mackintosh , after the interval of a century and a half , stamps upon that charter the seal of time , of posterity , and of truth . The caprice of the little colony was the prompt perception of merit . The leaders of New England were not disparaged , but temporarily set aside , for one " young in years , but yet in counsel old , Than whom a better senator ne'er held The helm of Rome . When the people called him , hardly a resident of the country , hardly a citizen of age , to the chief magistracy of the colony , they paid not a servile homage to an emigrating scion of nobility ; but a just tribute to a mind of the highest order , - a bold spirit which had sought liberty , on the outer verge of the habitable world , at an age when , in most men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet begun its heavings . With that sharpness of perception , which springs from extremities of fortune , strangeness of circumstances , and conscious purity of purpose , they saw at once the man , to whom Sir James Mackintosh has ascribed " one of the most profound minds , that ever existed , not inferior perhaps to Bacon ; " and if not inferior to Bacon in the intellectual , how vastly above him in the moral properties of a man ! Mr. Upham , in the biography before us , has discharged the debt of long delayed justice to this extraordinary person ; another brilliant instance of ' the " sera numinisjustitia . " The judgment of Sir James Mackintosh , pronounced in 1819 , at a public meetinginLo ndon , and afterwards more en ) pliatically reported by an American traveller from his memoranda of Sir James 's conver // sation , and given to the world , in the pages of this our journal , may be considered as the indication of a great re-discovery of a noble character , almost lost to fame . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark caverns of the earth , he has discovered a fossil fragment of some gigantic but perished animal . " His works , " says Sir James , " which are theological , are extremely rare , and display astonishing powers . They are remarkable , as containing the first direct assertion or THE LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE ! " From this doctrine no doubt , Sir James argued to the profundity of his intellect and to the wonder of his powers . He had disinterred from one of the rare volumes of Vane 's theological writings that glorious truth . It was but one hone of the buried behemoth , but the skilful eye of the philosopher could discover in it the whole form of the megatheriuin . Mr. Upharn , with affectionate assiduity , with a researci ) animated and guided by a congenial enthusiasm for liberty and for truth , has gone further and gathered up from their dispersion all the mangled and scattered members ; has reproduced us not a single fragment but the entire and noble form ; not the mere outline , the dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He has restored to America and Co England , to the cause of freedom and truth , the name of a glorious champion , whom his own succeeding times had almost left to perish . We hail the happy omen . The time can not he distant , when that whole chapter of English history , the age of the puritans , will be written with new perceptions of its connexion with the great cause of free government , of liberty of conscience , and political reform . Nothing can be narrower , less generous , less philosophical , than the tone , in which those lofty spirits have been alternately assailed and defended The English of the present day , who owe it to the Puritans that they are not tossed , like a shuttlecock , from the pikes of an enraged populace to the bayonets of a military police , as their neighbors in France , hurry over the history of the commonwealth with a kind of compassionate or supercilious non-chalance ; and even we , we , to our shame he it said , we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best blood of that highsouled race , we are eternally tasking our wits to find apologies and excuses for our fathers . Apologies for the asserters of the liberty of conscience ; excuses for the men that invented representative government ; and broke the iron yoke of feudalism ! // Exquisite degeneracy ; dainty unwortbiness of our origin ! What , could Burke himself , loyal to the core , - with the streaming horrors of the French revolution before his eyes , and wrought by them to a political , and almost to a physical phrenzy , could even he say of the leaders of the great English rebellion , " whilst they attempted or affected changes in the commonwealth , they sanctified their ambition , by advancing the dignity of the people whose peace they troubled . They bad long views . They aimed at the rule not at the destruction of their country . They were men of great civil and great muitary talents , and if the terror , the ornament of their age . The compliment made to one of the great bad men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinsman , a favorite poet of that time , sbews what it was he proposed , and what indeed to a great degree he accomplished , in the success of his ambition " Still as you rise , the State , exalted too , Finds no distemper , while t is changed by you ; Changed like the world 's great scene , when without noise , The rising sun night 's vulgar lights destroys . " These disturbers were not so much like men usurping power , as asserting their natural place in society . Their rising was to illuminate and beautify the world . Their conquest over their competitors was by outshining them . The hand , that , like a destroying angel , smote the country , communicated to it the force and energy under which it suffered ! " Abstract from this splendid eulogium , the qualifications manifestly attached to the praise , to the end that the praise might be forgiven by himself and his age , and what a tribute remains ! Cromwell and the men with whom and by xvhorn lie subverted the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , men of great civil as well as great military talent , the ornamentof their age ; proposing as they rose to elevate their country with them , and to a great degree effecting what they proposed ; not so much the usurpers of the places of other men , as asserters of their own ; illuminating and beautifying the world , as the rising sun illuminates and adorns the heavens ; outshining , not trampling down their competitors ; and if they smote their country like a destroying angel , imparting to it at the same time , the force and energy of the destroyer , to smite down and blast its enemies ! And shall this be said of Cromwell and his peers ; - this by Burke ; this at // the height of the panic of the French Revolution ; this in a discourse intended as a warning cry , a vox clamantis , to rouse England and Europe into a crusade against revolutionary France ! And shall we , the citizens of a free republic , founded by the long suffering puritans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel added to the civilized world ; shall we , who live in an are when even the heavendefying horrors of that French revolution begin to be partly forgotten , in the brilliant development of power and talent which it occasioned ; begin to be in some measure excused , for the ages of crying oppression which preceded it ; begin to he in no small degree atoned for , by the civil regeneration of feudal Europe to which it gave the impulse ; shall we , while the whole eivilized world , struggling on triumphant , with joyous strides or convulsive starts , is shaping its institutions of civil polity more and more upon the principles first practically set forth and exemplified by our puritan fathers ; - shall we , being what we are , and whence we are , and where we are , shall we basely qualify the homage due to these illustrious shades , the men who were faithful when Cromwell and his associates were faithless ? Miserable prudery ! Why do we not boldly and roundly , without strain or qualification , vindicate their fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults were the instruments , with which Providence vouchsafed to accomplish this great work ? " They were dark and austere. * ' They needed to he ; the children of sunshine would have drooped and fainted under the terrors and gloom of the enterprise . " They persecuted those who differed from them . " They had a right to do that , which is falsely called persecuting those who differed from them . The man , who possesses the power at home , and persecutes his brother who differs from him ; the man who at home will not let his neighbor live in peace and die in his bed , because he differs from him , is a tyrant . But the victims of persecution , the men who have given up native land , and home , and forefather 's graves to those who will not tolerate their difference , and crossed the awful deep , and found out a place of refuge in the horrid wilderness , where hardships and danger are their constant attendance , those men have a right to their own way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be undisturbed by sights and sounds and doings and sayings , which shock their sense of religious decency . No wandering melancholic , or fanatic opinionist has a right to // invade their place of voluntary exile , and claim the toleration and protection of the banished society , for his own annoying peculiarity . The utmost he can demand is a right to do what they have done , quit them in peace , and seek a wilderness still more remote , where he , in his turn , may claim a right to worship God according to his own peculiarity . " But the puritans were cruel , and hung persons charged with witchcraft ; " and what should we do ? If we honestly believed , as they honestly believed , that the wretched victims of these delusions , were in personal league with the enemy of man ; if we saw the incarnate principle of Evil where they saw it ; if the state of philosophy , of public sentiment , of popular theology , was to us what it was to them , and we believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing fires of the opening pit ; are we quite sure , that we should go into the ghastly contest , with soft and elegant phrases on our lips , and mild and placid affections in our bosoms ? No , no . Let it suflice us to be ourselves tolerant and merciful . Let us be content with our own liberality ; our own abhorrence of persecution , which in us would be our crime ; but let us not judge great and honored names of other days , by a standard either of opinion or duty , which does not apply to their age , their circumstances , or their vocation . Do not let us quarrel with the noble and massy edifice , because it was the work of successive generations ; be. * cause it did not rise like an exhalation from the soil ; because they who laid the foundation did not carry up the head-stone . Let us not murmur at the oak , because it did not shoot up from the acorn like a mushroom , in a single night . Let us not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , in a day , the system of social institutions , which required for its perfection that it should not be the work of a day ; which required precisely , more than every thing else , the operation of successive years , the seasoning of long time , the discipline of experience , the rectification of errors by their results , the preparation for one stage of advancement in the training of a former stage , the enthusiasm caught from prophetic glimpses of a gradually unfolding future . But it is more than time , to revert to Mr. Upham 's biography of Vane , and it is no exaggerated praise to pronounce it a production of the most distinguished excellence . The character of Vane , to which full justice had never before been done , is conceived in all its dignity , originality , and spirit . In turning // the pages , we pass through not a dry accumulation of dates and facts , but through the successive passages of a real life the strong and significant manifestations of a decided character , skilfully drawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peruses this volume , will admit that he has acquired much valuable knowledge , which he did not before possess , of a great and strangely undervalued benefactor of mankind . This result is produced , by the great diligence employed by Mr. Upham , in exploring and collecting the authorities , particularly as contained in the works of Vane himself ; by the penetration , with which he has seized and harmonized the traits of the character portrayed ; and above all by the strong sympathy , which animates the biographer with the lofty , varied , and tragic fortunes of his hero . It is impossible to bring into an analysis the entire contents of the life of Vane , forming as it does the chief part of the volume before us . Our only object is to give a general conception of its character ; and adequate specimens of the mode in which it is executed . Emigrating to America at the age of twenty-four , and chosen to the chief inagistracy of the colony of Massachusetts , the following year , the active life of Vane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief administration are related with spirit and judgment . it was distracted by the Antinomian controversy , of which Mr. Upham has given a very clear and philosophical account . In this part of the subject , Mr. LTpham introduces the following sound and ingenious remarks on the topic , on which we have ourselves just hazarded a few observations . " It has often been remarked that our fathers were guilty of great inconsistency in persecuting the followers of Mrs. ilutchinson , the Quakers , and others , inasmuch as they settled the country in order to secure themselves from persecution . They are often reproached as having contended manfully for the rights of conscience when they were themselves sufferers , and as then turning against others and violating their rights of conscience , so soon as they had the power and the opportunity to do it . But the remark and the reproach are equally founded in error . It was for religious liberty in a peculiar sense , that our fathers contended , and they were faithful to the cause as they understood it . The true principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had never dawned upon their minds , and was never maintained by them . // " In their own country they were oppressed and in various ways afflicted in the exercise of their consciences , and in the expression and enjoyment of their own religious principles and way of worship . They saw no prospect of a remedy , because it was then universally supposed , that , in order to live in peace and liberty , Christians must agree in sentiment and speculation . Such an agreement was manifestly impossible in the old world . They were therefore led to conceive the plan of withdrawing from Christendom into a wilderness beyond the ocean , where , without disturbing others , they themselves might enjoy ' freedom to worship God . ' It did not occur to their imaginations , that any , besides those who sympathized with them in views and feelings , would voluntarily join them in encountering the perils of the deep , and the sufferings of a new settlement , on a foreign and savage shore . It was their solemn and most sacred purpose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they rejoiced in having , as they thought , devised a scheme of society , in which , far removed from all who differed from them , they might enjoy their own institutions and profess their own principles , without giving or suffering molestation , and free from all division or dissent . " Such was the theory upon which New England was planted . It was , as the event has abundantly proved , visionary and imprac. * ticable . Without considering the difficulty of excluding persons of discordant opinions , coming from abroad , it was utterly in vain to attempt to bring any system of education to bear with such complete effect upon a whole people as to prevent difference of opinion among their descendants . It was however a beautiful vision , and , upon the whole , very creditable to those who indulged it . While we can not lament that it failed of being realized , it is impossible not to sympathize with our fathers in the disappointment they so bitterly experienced , when , after all their sacrifices , and toils , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably settled in their new abode , they discovered , to their amazement , that they had not escaped the differences and dissensions which they so much dreaded . It seemed hard , that , after having left Christendom , country , and home itself , and effected a lodgment in a far-off wilderness , where their only hope was a peaceful harmony of opinion , beyond the reach of oppression , and rescued from all temptation to oppress , - it was indeed hard to be pursued and tormented by those very disputes , which they had sacrificed their very all to avoid . It ought not to be wondered at , as a strange or inconsistent thing , that they used every effort to drive from their territory those who advocated discordant opinions , and that they employed every device to prevent their introduction . In so doing they did not violate , but on the contrary fully acted out the principles , upon which // they emigrated to America , and planted the colony . The law to which we have just referred was but an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they could be developed and preserved . It was regarded with disapprobation at the time , not because it was inconsistent with the principles of the commonwealth , but because it presented those principles in an aspect so naked and palpable , that their narrowness and deformity were more exposed to view than they had ever been before . " - pp. 147 - 150 . On his return to England , Vane was drawn at once into the vortex of affairs . Notwithstanding his known attachment to the doctrines and discipline of the puritans , his alliance was sought by the court , and he received the honor of knighthood . On the 13th of April 1640 , he took his seat in parliament , as the member from Kingston-on-Hull . That parliament , being dissolved , and another ( the long parliament ) convened , Sir Henry Vane was again returned a member of this body , which according to Warburton , comprehended " a set of the greatest geniuses for government , that the world ever saw embarked together in one common cause . " Vane , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its deliberations , " to use the words of Mr. Upham , " was one of the foremost leaders , and was destined to secure by far the brightest , purest , and most enviable fame . " In the eighth chapter , is related the extraordinary history of Strafford 's impeachment and fate , an event in the consummation of which Sir Henry Vane was called to a singu ! ar and painful participation . The passage , however , is too long to be quoted and would suffer by abridgment . The religious character of Vane forms the subject of the ninth chapter ; and the opposite opinions , of which his theological views and writings have been the subject , form no uninstructive commentary on the contrariety of human judgment and the violence of party prejudice . On this subject , Mr. Upham observes : " But his religious character , as it shone in his daily life , will be best illustrated by tracing the history of that life . I proceed therefore to the examination of his religious views and principles . And here , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies and calumniators have said respecting him , and then , after presenting the actual truth to the reader , leave him to form his own conclusions . " Anthony Wood 's view of his religious character has already been presented . Clarendon gives the following account . Vane was a man not to he described by any character of religion ; in // which he had swallowed some of the fancies and extravagances of every sect or faction , and was become ( which can not be expressed by any other language than was peculiar to the time ) a man abo*'e ordinances , unlimited or unrestrained by any rules or bounds prescribed to other men , by reason of his perfection . He was a perfect enthusiast , and , without doubt , did believe himself inspired ; which so far corrupted his reason and understanding ( which , in all matters without the verge of religion , was superior to that of most men , ) that he did , at some time , believe he was the person deputed to reign over the saints upon earth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expresses his wonder , that in Sir Henry 's writings there was none of that clearness and ratiocination , in which , in discourse , he used much to excel the best of the company he kept . ' " Burnet thus describes him ; For though he set up a form of religion in a way of his own , yet it consisted rather in a withdrawing from all other forms , than in any new or particular opinions or forms ; from which he and his party were called Seekers , and seemed to wait for some new and clearer manifestations . In these meetings he preached and prayed often himself but with so peculiar a darkness , that , though I have sometimes taken pains to see if I could find out his meaning in his works , yet I could never reach it . His friends told me , he leaned to Origen 's notion of an universal salvation of all , both of devils and the damned , and to the doctrine of pre*xistence . ' " Hume , after expressing an enthusiastic admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings . This man , so celebrated for his parliamentary talents , and for his capacity in business , has left some writings behind him . They treat , all of them , of religious subjects , and are absolutely unintelligible . No traces of eloquence or even of common sense appear in them . ' " Nothino* is more curious than the entirely different views , which discerning and discriminating minds sometimes take of the same subject . In The North American Review ' for October , 1S3*2 , the editor ( Mr. Alexander H. Everett ) relates a conversation held between Sir James Mackintosh and himself at London , in 1817 . On that occasion Sir James , speaking of the English Calvinists , says ; Sir Henry Vane was one of the most profound minds that ever existed , not inferior , perhaps , to Bacon . His works , which are theological , are extremely rare , and display astonishing powers . They are remarkable as containing the first direct assertion of the liberty of conscience. * " Thus we see , that the writings , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhibited no traces of eloquence or common sense , ' in the estimation of Mackintosh dis // played C astonishing powers , ' and entitled their author to the superlative praise of being one of the most profound minds that ever existed ! ' In such a case , we must each exercise an impartial and independent , discernment , and judge for ourselves what is right ' In all the transactions of the great struggle between the parliament and the Crown , Vane was a leader . He was one of the commissioners , who were sent to engage the co-operation of the Scotch , and Lord Clarendon having mentioned this circumstance adds , " therefore the others need not be named , since he was all , in any business where others were joined with him ; " and after relating the negotiation of the memorable instrument of the solemn league and covenant , he remarks of Sir Henry Vane , " there needs no more he said of his ability , than that he was chosen to cozen and deceive a whole nation , which excelled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dexterity . " But it was not in his diplomatic successes , that the glory of his character lies . The consistency of Vane might have shielded him from the sneers of Hume and of Clarendon . The moment the designs of Cromwell were unmasked , and the freedon of Parliament invaded , Vane retired , indignant and disgusted , to private life . He was guiltless of the blood of the king , and so well known was his disapprobation of his execution , that , on the organization of the Council of State after that event , which he was with great reluctance induced to join , the proposed oath of office , which contained a clause approving the king 's trial , was altered in consequence of Vane 's unwillingness to take it , in that form . The following passage from this portion of the history , will convey a just and satisfactory idea of his talent for business and the energy of his mind : " He took his seat in the Council nine days after its instalment , and immediately entered , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . He continued to be in the Council from 1649 to 1653 . The powers exercised by that body were very great . They were entrusted with the entire command of the military force of England and Ireland , and were authorized to raise and control a navy , and to conduct the whole administration of the country in reference both to its offensive and defensive operations in war . Sir Henry Vane was for some time President of the Council , and , as Treasurer and Commissioner for the Navy , he had almost the exclusive direction of that branch of the public // service . The foreign relations were wholly under his management . He planned and conducted the war with the United PrQvinces , in which Blake gathered his laurels , and won for his country the proud title of mistress of the seas ; and he imparted his own patriotic and generous spirit to his countrymen by exhibiting an example of disinterested devotion to the public cause . In order to lighten the burden of the war , and to encourage the people to carry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been before observed , the profits of the immensely lucrative office he held , and appropriated them to the common treasury . " It was in this period that the genius of England , both in the cabinet and on the waves , ' shone forth with its most resplendent lustre . The fire of liberty seemed , for a time , to burn bright and clear in every heart , and its spirit to nerve every arm . The trident was shaken from the hand of Holland . The world resounded with the fame of the Commonwealth , and every place in the empire became subject to its power . Scilly , Jersey , Guernsey , the Isle of Man , Virginia , and Barbadoes , one after another , all submitted* " But it was not without a desperate struggle that the Dutch surrendered their supremacy on the ocean . For more than three years the contest continued , and a series of naval engagements ' took place , which for the courage and resolution manifested on both sides , have never been surpassed . As the war advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed to gather strength from exhaustion . In November , 165S2 , Van Tromp , after immense preparations , in which the power of Holland was strained to the utmost , took the sea with a fleet of more than seventy ships and falling in with Blake in the Downs , a most sanguinary and long protracted action took place . They fought as though they felt that the fate of both nations was suspended on the issue* Blake 's fleet was much less numerous than that of Van Tromp* After maintaining the conflict from noon until night , the English admiral retired , with considerable loss , up the river , and the victorious Hollander rode master of the ocean , and paraded his fleet up and down the English channel with a broom fixed to his mast-head7 thus vaunting that he had swept his enemy from the sea . The effect of this defeat was felt throughout England , as a deep misfortune . The national pride was wounded , and a general gloom and despondency pervaded the people It was , of course , particularly disastrous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , which seemed to have been brought to so inglorious a close . It was supposed that the power of Britain was permanently broken down , and the period was com monly spoken og , at the time , as the present day of England 's adversity by her wars with Holland . ' // " But Vane was not disheartened . His energy rose with the difficulties of his position . The battle was fought on the 29th of November . He reported the estimates of the expenses of the navy immediately to the House . On the 4th of December it was resolved , that one hundred and twenty thousand pounds per month should be appropriated to the support of the armaments by land and sea , of which forty thousand were for the navy . The next point was , to raise the revenue to meet such an appropriation ; and the genius of Vane was not for a moment at a loss to devise the means . On the 6th of December a bill was introduced and read a first and second time , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Park at Greenwich , Enfield Castle , and Somerset House , the proceeds of the whole to be for the use of the navy ; and , by the beginning of February , Blake put to sea with eighty ships of war , and soon fell in with Tromp , at the head of a squadron of equal size , convoying two hundred merchantmen . A battle commenced on the 18th of February , off the Isle of Portland , which , for the weight of the armaments engaged , the determined bravery of the combatants , the length of time during which it lasted , and the brilliancy of its results , far transcended every previous naval action on record , and , all things considered , may safely be said not to have been surpassed since . The battle raged incessantly for three days . The power of England at length prevailed . The Dutch lost seventeen or eighteen of their ships of war , and seventy of their merchantmen . From that moment to the present day , the supremacy of England , as a naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduced or shaken . " But the genius of Sir Henry Vane was not confined to the conduct of foreign wars , brilliant and wonderful as was its exercise in that department . At this period of his life his labors were so various , so complicated , and so constant , that they were regarded as almost incredible . From an early hour in the morning until late at night , he was every moment engaged in the actual transaction of business . In May , 1649 , he had been placed at the head of a committee of which Ireton and Algernon Sydney were members , to consider the state of the Representation ; and , after the death of the King , and when the Commonwealth had become established , he reported a bill for REFORM in Parliament , which continued for a long time to engage the attention of the House whenever they had the necessary leisure to deliberate upon so important a measure . Every Wednesday was set apart for the discussion of its details , and there was good reason to indulge the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reform was this . The House was to consist of four hundred members , the small boAwghs were to be disfranchised , the elective privilege was to he // secured equally to persons of all religious persuasions , and the rights of the people were carefully guarded against corruption and oppression . " It was while Sir Henry Vane was thus conducting operations , which were covering the name of England with glory , and securing to her the position of the first commercial nation and naval power in the world , and at the same time contriving and constructing a just , and equal , and free government for her people , that his career of usefulness and honor arrested the attention of the great POET OF LIBERTY . John Milton addressed to him the following just trihute of praise . " Vane , young in years , but in sage counsel old , Than whom a better senator ne'er held The helm of Rome , when gowns , not arms , repelled The fierce Epirot and the African bold , Whether to settle peace , or to unfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then to advise how war may best upheld Move by her two main nerves , iron and gold , In all her equipage ; besides to know Both spiritual power and civil , what each means , What severs each , thou hast learnt , which few have done The bounds of either sword to thee we owe ; Therefore on thy firm hand Religion leans In peace , and reckons thee her eldest son . " * pp. 231 - 236* The scene of the final dissolution of the long parliament , and of Cromwell 's frantic behavior on that occasion , is finely told by Mr. Upham . On the consummation of the despotic de- ' signs of Cromwell in this wild act , Vane once more sought the retirement *of his patrimonial seat , Raby Castle , and solaced himself with the composition of his principal theological work , " The Retired Man 's Meditations , " a quarto volume of four hundred pages . He also published , " A Letter from a True and Lawful Member of Parliament to one of the Lords of his High* ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declara- ' tion , calling upon*the people to observe a general fast , " for the purpose of applying themselves to the Lord , to discover the Achan who had so long obstructed the settlement of these distracted kingdoms . " By this and other expressions , an invitation was seemingly given to all so disposed , to discuss the situation of affairs . Vane took the Protector at his word , and produced " The Healing Question , " which Mr. Upham pronounces " one of the most remarkable political papers ever written . " " It contains , " continues Mr. Upham , " the great principles of civil // and religious liberty , in a complete exposition , and lays down the rules to be observed in constructing a civil government . It developes and illustrates , and perhaps it may with safety be said , for the first time , the idea of a written constitution ; or body of fundamental law , by which the government itself is to be controled , restrained , and limited . " The general strain of this pamphlet was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ( l the views and judgment of the highminded and courageous author were expressed , at its close , with too much directness to he mistaken . For this publication , he was peremptorily summoned before the council . He acknowledged without scruple the authorship of the work , and was ordered to give bonds in five thousand pounds , " to do nothing to the prejudice of the liresent government and the peace ot the Commonwealth , or to stand committed . " He refused to give the proposed security , boldly denied the legality of the proceedings against him , and rebuked the Protector for deserting the cause of liberty . The consequence was his imprisonment in Carisbroke Castle , in the isle of Wight . His confinement was of short duration , but was followed by the more insidious and vexatious policy of subjecting his estate to ruinous litigation and vexatious suits , conjured up to strip him of his possessions . But none of these things moved him . The death of Cromwell brought about a new crisis in affairs . A new parliament was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by the Protector desired to perpetuate it through the instrumentality of his son . Measures were in train to effect this object , and no part of Vane 's eventful career reflects higher honor on his memory , than the part then taken by him . " Those , whose desire it was to have the government continue under the Protectorate of Richard Cromwell , considered it an object of the greatest possible importance to prevent the election of Sir Henry Vane to the ensuing Parliament ; and they resorted to the most extraordinary and extreme measures to keep him out . He offered himself at Kingston upon Hull , of which place he claimed , as of right , to be considered the lawful representative , having sat as such in the Loiig Parliament . His right was confirmed by the electors . He was re-chosen by a full majority of their votes ; but the managers of the election , being creatures of Richard 's p*rty , in defiance of justice and public sentiment , gave the certificate of election to another . Sir henry was determined // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , proceeded to Bristol , entered the canvass , and received a majority of the votes . Here , also , the same bold and high-handed outrage was committed by the officers ; and others whose names stood below his on the poll-books were declared to be elected . He still persevered and was finally returned from Whitchurch in Hampshire . " On the opening of the Parliament it was proposed that their first proceeding should be to confirm the government of Richard , and to sanction the House of Peers which his father had created . The republican party opposed these propositions from the first , and , although they were in a minority , finally succeeded . Their measures were taken with the skill and spirit for which their leaders were so predminently distinguished . The consultations of the party were generally held at Sir Henry Vane 's house , iiear Charing Cross , and he managed the debates , on their behalf , in the House of Commons . In opposing the further continuance of Cromwell 's House of Peers , he reminded the Commors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper House , during the royal government , the t*round then taken having been that bishops , receiving their appointments from the Crown , would naturally be nothing better than time instruments of the King ; and he proved that the argument was good also against the whole House of Lords as such , they all having been raised to the peerage by the late Protector , and heinr inclined therefore to sustain the government of his son , with im j ) iiCit and servile obedience . " While the republicans were ad* smicing thtse doctrine in the lower House , the members of the othci house and tL* pirin ipal military leaders , were endeavoring to res**t their measures and defeat their designs . And , in order to ji ut thc mesuit* which might be apprehended iii case the dmscussmmm ( 0 itinued much longer , a petition was drawn up by the 1 idino oih s of the army , and forwarded , through the he mm 01 i Ic 4 ( ml his hrother-in-law , and Desborough , his uncle to Richaid m**u sting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he did not do so without delay , time army would piOCeO ( l to ( iCl ) rive him of his power , and assume to themselves time vholegovermnneimt of the country . Richard accordingly despatehed time Keeper of the Seal , as he was bidden , to dissolve the Parliament but , lox ' - ing gotten information of the design , the House determined miot to be dissolved , ordered their doors to be closed , and the gentleman usher of the black rod was not permitted to enter . it was on this occasion , that Sir Henry Vane delivered a speech which produced an overwhelming effect upon the house and imation , amid entirely demolished the power of the Protector . It has fortunately been preserved , and is now presented entire to the reader . When it is // remembered , that this speech was addressed to a House in which Sir Henry was in a minority , that it was spoken almost withinthe hearing of Richard Cromwell himself , when he was in possession of the whole power of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , and acting in compliance with the will of its generals , we can in some degree appreciate the courage of the speaker , and the effect upon the House of his fearless eloquence . " Mr. Speaker , " Among all the people of the universe , I know none who have shown so much zeal for the liberty of their country , as the English , at this time , have done . They have , by the help of Divine Providence , overcome all obstacles , and have made themselves free . We have driven away the hereditary tyranny of the house of Stuart , at the expense of much blood and treasure , in hopes of enjoying hereditary liberty , after having shaken off the yoke of kingship ; and there is not a man amongst us , who could have imagined that any person would be so bold a to dare attempt the ravishing from us that freedom , which has cost us so much blood and so much labor . But so it happens , I know not by what misfortune , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eim. peror Titus , to make room for Domitian , who made away Augustus that they might have Tiberius , and changed Claudius for Nero . I am sensible these examples are foreign from my subject , since the Romans , in those days , were buried in lewdness and luxury ; whereas the people of England are now renowned , all over the world , for their great virtue and discipline ; and yet suf* fer an idiot , without courage , without sense , nay , without ambiti@n , to have dominion in a country of liberty . *C One could bear a little with Oliver Cromwell , though , contrary to his oath of fidelity to the Parliament , contrary to his duty to the public , contrary to the respect he owed to that venerable body from whom he received his authority , he usurped the government . His merit was so extraordinary , that our judgment and passions might be blinded by it . He made his way to empire by the most illustrious action* . He held under his command an army that had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him their general . " But as for Richard Cromwell , his son , who is he ? What are his titles ? We have seen that he has a sword by his side , but did he ever draw it ? And , what is of more importance in this case , is he fit to get obedience from a mighty nation , who could never make a footman obey him ? Yet , we must recognise this man as our king , under the style of Protector !  --  a man without birth , without courage , without conduct . For my part , I declare , Sir , it shall never be said that I made such a man my master . ' " // " This impetuous torrent swept away every thing before it . Oratory , genius , and the spirit of liberty never achieved a more complete triumph . It was signal and decisive , instantaneous and irresistible . It broke at once and for ever , the power of Richard and his party , and the control of the country again passed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having at the same time issued a Proclamation dissolving the Parliament ; and the general voice of the country was so clearly and strongly uttered , that the military factions bowed to its demand , and the famous Long Parliament which Oliver Cromwell had dispersed in 1653 , was once more summoned to assemble , by a declaration from a council of officers dated on the 6th of May , 1659. " - pp. 289 - 294 . On the downfall of Richard Cromwell , Sir Henry Vane was appointed one of the Council , to which supreme power was delegated . He was of course active , conscientious , and disinterested in his attempts to restore and constitute the State , but other events were in train . Monk 's splendid treachery was consummated , and Charles the Second brought in . Vane was one of the first victims . At first secluded in his dwelling-house , and for a short time removed to the Tower , he was afterward confined for two years , in a fortress , on one of the isles of Scilly . During his imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosophy , and composed several elaborate works . The titles of these productions , with an account of the most considerable of them , are contained in the fifteenth chapter of the work before us . Mr. Upham deserves great credit , for the diligence , with which he has studied the writings of Vane . They are found collected in none of our public or private libraries ; and it is only by great pains that they could have been procured from England , for the composition of the present work . A beautiful and pathetic letter to his wife will be found at the close of the chapter , but our limits do not allow us to cite it . On the 7th of March , 1662 , Sir Henry Vane was removed to the Tower of London , and the grand jury , having found a bill against him , he was arraigned on a charge of treason , the 2d of June following . His trial was conducted with that disregard of the principles of justice , and that contempt of all the bulwarks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused citizen , which will render the reigns of Charles the Second and James the Second infamous , even after their other // titles to the execration of honest men , shall be forgotten . And yet , unprincipled as was the conduct of the court , it whitensinto purity , compared with the meanness and treaohery of the king , who broke the solemn stipulation , into which he had entered , on the passage of the indemnity bill , to spare the blood of Vane . The closing scene of his life , his demeanor before the Court , and his last noble stand , when brought up to receive sentence ; his intercourse with his friends and family in the Tower , his prayers , his valedictions , his address to the people on the scaffold , and his deportment in the last tryin* moment , form a narrative of the most pathetic and thrilling interest . It is scarcely surpassed by the death of Socrates . When his wife and children left him for the last time , he was heard to say , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast it behind me , and press forward to my father . " The following account of his removal from the pl'ison to the scaffold seems , says Mr. Upham , to have been written by an eye-witness . " One of the sheriff 's men came and told him , there must be a sled ; to which Sir Henry replied , " Any way , how they please , for I long to be at home , to be dissolved and to be with Christ , which is best of all . " lie went very cheerfully and readily down the stairs from his chamber , and seated himself on the sled ; ( friends and servants standing about him ; ) then he was forthwith drawn away towards the scaffold . As he went , some in the Tower , prisoners as well as others , spake to him , praying the Lord to go with him . And after he was out of the Tower , from the tops of houses and out of windows the people used such means and gestures as might best discover at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , " The Lord go with you , the great God of heaven and earth appear in you and for you ; " whereof he took what notice he was capable of in those circumstances , in a cheerful manner accepting their respect , putting off his hat and bowing to them . Being asked several times , bow he did , by some about him , he answered , " Never better in all my life . " Another replied , " How should he do ill , that suffers for so glorious a cause ' ? " To which a tall man in black said , " Many have suffered for a better cause ; " " And many for a worse , " said Sir Henry " and when they come to seal their better cause ( as you call it ) with their blood , as I am now going to seal mine , may they not find themselves deceived ; and as to this cause , " continued he , " it hath given life in death , to all the owners of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the rails on Tower Hill , there were many loud exclamations of the people , crying out , " The Lord Jesus go with your dear soul , " &amp;c . One told him , that was the most glorious seat he ever sate on ; he answered , " It is so indeed , " and he rejoiced exceedingly . Being come to the scaffold , he cheerfully ascends , and being up , after the crowd ou the scaffold was broken in two pieces , to make way for him , he showed himself to the people on the front of the scaffold , with that noble and Christian-like deportment , that he rather seemed a looker-on , than the person concerned in the execution . insomuch that it was difficult to persuade many of the people that he was the prisoner . But when they knew that the gentleman in the black suit and cloak , with a scarlet silk waistcoat ( the victorious color , ) showing itself at the breast , was the prisoner , they admired that noble and great presence he appeared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " He does not look like a dying man , " said others ; with many like speeches , as astonished with that strange appearance he shined forth in . " Then , ( silence heftug commanded by the sheriff , ) lifting up his hands and eyes towards he yen , and then resting his hands upon the rails , and taking a very serious , composed , and majestic view of the great muititu e about him , he spake as followeth . " Gentle* *en fellow countrymen , and Christians , When Mr. Sheriff came to me this morning , and told me he had received a command from the king , that I should say nothing reflecting upon his Majesty or the Government , I answered that I should confine and order my speech , as near as I could , so as to be least offensive , savin* my faithfulness to the trust reposed in me , which I must ever discharge with a good conscience unto death ; for I ever valued a man , according to his faithfulness to the trust reposed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late controversy . And if you dare trust my discretion , Mr. Sheriff , I shall do nothing but which becomes a good Christian and an Englishman ; and so I hope I shall be civilly dealt with . When Mr. Sheriff 's chaplain came to me last night about twelve of the clock , to bring me , as he called it , the fatal message of death , it pleased the Lord to bring that scripture to my mind , in the third of Zachary , to intimate to me , that he was now taking away my filthy garments , causin * mine iniquities to pass from me , with intention to give me change of raiment , and that my mortal should put on immortality . I suppose you may wonder when I shall tell you , that I am not brought hither according to any known law of the land . It is true , I have been before a court of justice , ( and am now going to appear before a greater tribunal , where I am to give an account of all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this // time . When I was before them , 1 could not have the liberty and privilege of an Englishman , the grounds , reasons , and causes of the actings I was charged with , duly considered . I therefore de . sired the judges , that they would set their seals to my hill of exceptions . I pressed hard for it again and again , as the right of myself and every freeborn Englishman , by the law of the land ; but was finally denied it . ' " At this point , Sir John Robinson , Lieutenant of the Tower , whose duty did not call him to the scaffold , and who attended the execution , undoubtedly for no other purpose than to prevent any dangerous impression being made by the prisoner , interrupted him , saying , in a most furious manner , which gave great dissatisfaction , even to the loyalists who were present , Sir , you must not go on thus , you must not rail at the judges ; it is a lie , and I am here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry replied , " God will judge between you and me in this matter . I speak but matter of fact , and can not you bear that ? T is evident the judges have refused to sign my bill of exceptions . " The trumpeters were then ordered to approach nearer to the prisoner and blow in his face to preven his being heard , at which Sir Henry lifting up his hand , and then laying it on his breast , said , " What mean you , gentlemen ? Is this your usage of me ? Did you use all the rest so ? I had even done ( as to that , ) could you have been patient ; but seeing you can not hear it , I shall only say this , that , whereas the judges have refused to seal that with their hands , that they have done , I am come to seal that , with my blood , that I have done . " Sir Henry then proceeded briefly to relate the history of his life . After alluding to his birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early youth , when " he was inclined to the vanities of this world , " a course which was thought " the only means of accomplishing a gentleman . " He then spoke of his conversion to a life of virtue and piety in the following beautiful and admirable manner . " When my conscience was thus awakened , I found my former course to be disloyalty to God , profaneness , and a way of sin and death , which I did with tears and bitterness bewail , as I had cause to do . Since that foundation of repentance laid in me , through grace I have been kept steadfast , desiring to walk in all good conscience towards God , and towards men , according to the best light and understanding God gave me . For this , I was willing to turn my back upon my estate , expose myself to hazards in foreign parts ; yea , nothing seemed difficult to me , so I might preserve faith and a good conscience , which I prefer before all things ; and do earnestly persuade all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than disobey God by contradicting // the light of their own conscience . In this it is I stand with so much comfort and boldness before you all , this day , and upon this occasion ; being assured that I shall at last sit down in glory with Christ , at his right hand . " I stand here this day , to resign up my spirit into the hands of that God that gave it me . Death is but a little word , but t is a great work to die . It is to be but once done , and after this coinetli the judgment , even the judgment of the great God , which it concerns us all to prepare for . And by this act , I do receive a discharge , once for all , out of prison , even the prison of the mortal body also , which to a true Christian is a burdensome weight . " In all respects , wherein I have been concerned and engaged as to the public , my design bath been to accomplish good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and spreading aloft his hands , he made this solemn declaration , I do here appeal to the God of heaven , and all this assembly , or any other persons , to show wherein I have defiled my hands with any man 's blood or estate , or that 1 have sought myself in any public capacity or place I have been in. * " As might have been expected , and as the government had most seriously apprehended , a great impression had by this time been made by the prisoner upon the vast multitude that surrounded him . The people remembered his career of inflexible virtue and patriotism . They had been roused to indignation by the treatment he had received at the hands of Cromwell , and - of the restored monarch . His trial had revived the memory of his services and sufferings . The fame of his glorious defence had rung far and wide through the city and nation . The enthusiasm with which he had been welcomed by weeping and admiring thousands as he passed from prison to Tower hill ; the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost divine composure of his deportment ; his visible triumph over the fear of death and the malice of his enemies , all these influences , brought at once to bear upon their minds , and concentrated and heightened by the powers of an eloquence that was the wonder of his contemporaries , bad produced an effect , which , it was evident , could not , with safety to the government , be permitted to be wrought any higher . " When Sir Henry , therefore , had commenced another sentence after the appeal quoted above , the trumpets were again sounded . The sheriff attempted to catch a paper from his hands . " Sir John Robinson , seeing some persons taking minutes of the speech , ordered their reports to be destroyed . Six note-books // were delivered up to the officers . In this scene of confusion , Sir Henry preserved his usual firmness , patience , and dignity of n*anner , merely remarking that it was hard he might not be suffered to speak ; but , ' said he , my usage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; and all that will live his life , in these times , must expect hard dealing from the worldly spirit . ' The trumpets were again blown , and Sir John Robinson , with two or three others , rushed upon the prisoner and endeavored to seize his papers . He , however , kept them off from his person , and after a while , tearing the papers himself handed the remnants to one of his friends , from whom they were forcibly taken . The officers then attempted to thrust their hands into the prisoner 's pockets , and a scene of disorder and brutal violence occurred upon the scaffold , which filled the multitude of all parties with horror and indignation . Such was the bearing of Sir Henry , however , that all were loud in the admiration of it ; and in the midst of the tumult a zealous loyalist was heard to exclaim , in terms which to him were expressive of the highest possible commendation , He dies like a prince . ' " Finding that it was determined that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of life broken in upon by such disagreeable incidents , he desisted from all further attempts to address the people , merely remarking , ' It is a bad cause , which can not bear the words of a dying man . ' " - pp. 357-366 . When order and silence had been restored , he commenced his more immediate preparation for death by offering a prayer of the most sublime elevation and truly evangelical spirit . This being finished , the great sacrifice was consummated . " At the conclusion of the prayer , and when his garments had been adjusted to receive the stroke , he looked up , and said , I bless the Lord , who hath accounted me worthy to suffer for his name . Blessed be the Lord , that I have kept a conscience void of offence to this day . I bless the Lord , that I have not deserted the righteous cause , for which I suffer . ' " As he bowed his head to the block , he uttered these words , Father , glorify thy servant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discharge of his duty to thee and to his country . ' In an instant , and at a single blow , the executioner discharged his office . " Thus fell Sir Henry Vane . In his death the first age of English liberty reached its termination . It commenced , and it closed , in blood . Lord Strafford was the earliest victim of the incensed spirit of liberty as it entered upon the triumphant possession of the government ; and Vane was the last great sacrifice offered // up to the vengeance of restored despotism . They perished on the same scaffold . " - p. 370 . We must pass over the closing eloquent chapter of the work before us , and bring our remarks to a conclusion . Mr. Upham will receive the grateful acknowledgments of the friends of constitutional liberty for this Life of Vane . It is truly a fortunate incident , that his brief residence in this country should thus have given him a hold on the affections of the student of American history . It is doubtful whether his life could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . His memory , it is true , has found eloquent vindicators there but a portion of their zeal is required to roll off from his name the load of a mighty prejudice . Nor is it possible that in any country but this , full justice can be done to the truth and depth of Vane 's conceptions ; ideas are yet deemed chimerical in in England , which may be found plainly indicated , often fully set forth , in the writings of Vane , and which have been reduced to settled practice in America . Thus , on the subject of constituting a government ; he states that it should be done by a FULL CONVENTION of the People . The boldest radical reformer bas not , that we know , comprehended the simplicity , the justice , the efficacy of this conception , in which the whole science of free constitutional government is wrapped up . With all that is boldly , rationally , and patriotically said , in England , of a government existing by and for the people , it has escaped us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or agitator , radical or whig , a glimpse has yet been caught of the only way , in which a free government can possibly be constituted , with any pretence to a solid basis in the consent of the governed , to wit , the act of the people , in convention assembled ; an idea which , if conceived in England , is kept out of sight , as another name for the wildest form of political chaos , an unsettling of all the elements of society ; but which our experience has so often and so amply shown to be the great irenicon of agitated states . To this mode of forming a constitution Vane alludes in terms . His biography by Mr. Upham will make this extraordinary man better known . As there will be many readers , both in England and this country , who will wish to possess it in aseparate form , we would suggest the expediency of a new edition , in which it should appear by itself . In that shape it will cornpose // a volume of rare interest , reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has first effectually rescued from obloquy , misconception and forgetfulness.
