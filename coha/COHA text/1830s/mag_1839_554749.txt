txt " LEs choses vont vite en Bas Canada , " was a favorite maxim , less than two years since , with the partisans of the banished Speaker of the ci-devant House of Assembly of Lower Canada . Late events have indeed proved the saying true , though in a sense widely differing from that in which its author and his followers were proud to use it . An insurrection , suppressed by armed volunteers and a handful of troops , almost as soon as attempted ; a constitution suspended by act of Parliament ; a Governor-General and High Commissioner sent out , with unprecedented legal powers and military force , and charged with the complex duty of restoring tranquillity and good feeling , administering a temporary despotic government , and devising a new constitutional system in place of that which had just worked out its own destruction ; the first public act of this new Governor summarily disallowed , and his mission prematurely terminated ; a second insurrection , of yet shorter duration than the first , the ex-governor censured for his prompt return to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , by the British Ministry ; the Colonial Secretary , in whose name the despatches censuring him had run , all at once removed , and his place filled by another ; the Ministry // itself next resigning , and then restored to office ; its Canadian measures brought before the public , and then modified so often and so much at the suggestion of one party and another , that the public can scarce tell any thing about them , but that they differ in some of their most important features from the recommendations of the approved Report ; - all this , and much more that has vitally affected the interests of the British American Provinces , has been crowded within this short space of time . The commercial embarrassments , which caused a brief suspension of specie payments in this country , led to a like result in them ; and its effects upon the resources of the two Canadas were rendered doubly prejudicial by the incapacity of those , who at that crisis had the ordering of the financial blunders of the Upper Province . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second suspension . Insurrection has made its appearance in Upper as well as in Lower Canada . In both , men 's minds have been heated with civil strife and border struggles . From these , and , since , from the agitation of the iMaine boundary question , a war between England and the United States has more than once seemed imminently threatening . For much of the time , indeed , a quasi border war has been actually going on , with all the thousands of false rumors and varying but ever hurtful excitements , which must of necessity grow out of such a state of affairs . Things have been moving fast in Lower Canada . Her sister provinces have come in for their full share of the movement ; and eveit these United States have not escaped its influence . While matters were still in this state of rapid transition , it was impossible to present a satisfactory view of them , in the pages of a quarterly journal . The weekly and daily press could hardly keep pace with their progress ; and the statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out of date before they could have appeared in print . The present , however , seems to be a moment of comparative tranquillity . Lord Durham 's recommendations , the plans of the British government , and , in effect , all other plans heretofore proposed by any other party are before Parliament ; and its final action upon them is not to take place , till after a full discussion of the entire subject shall have been had in the mother country , and in the colonies most interested . In British America , meanwhile , little // seems to he in progress , except this discussion , and the conflicting efforts of the various interested parties , to influence the decision of the public voice and of Parliament in regard to the merits of the case in dispute . The excitement of insurrection and political trials , is for the time ended . The border disturbances we may hope , from present indications , are over , or nearly so . And last , not least , the vexed question of the Maine boundary , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being satisfactorily adjusted . These appearances of quiet may he more or less illusory ; and , by the time this article shall have made its appearance on our readers ' tables , some changes may possibly have taken place in the aspect of affairs . For these , in such a case , we must ask our readers to make the necessary allowances . It is often far easier to foresee the great revolutions which require a long course of years for their developement , than it is to anticipate those lesser changes which a few weeks may bring to pass ; and which usually strike us at the moment as more important than they really are , from the suddenness with which they take place . In our present remarks on British American politics and prospects , we shall do our best to avoid the embarrassments which these accidents of the day tend to throw in the way of such discussions . It will be our object to present a general outline of the actual state of affairs , not to fill in the details of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things we describe , not to speculate in the dark as to the precise events which are next to occur . How soon another opportunity may offer itself , equally favorahle with the present for an attempt of this kind , is very doubtful . We shall not discuss at any length the merits or demerits of the works , whose titles we have cited at the head of this article . Only one of them , and that immeasurably the least valuable and least interesting of the number , is before the American public ; its catch-penny title , we presume , having earned for it the distinction of a reprint in the United States . The others , very few of our readers can have an opportunity of seeing . Indeed , were it not so , with the limited space to which we must confine our remarks , we should incline to prefer the task of giving an opinion on the subject of which they speak , to that of merely criticizing them . The heavy emptiness of Mr. Justice Hallihurton 's " Bubbles , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narrative , " certainly tempt criticism ; but we shall resist the temptation , and keep as strictly as we can to the course we have marked out . We can not , however , help expressing some surprise at the omission to republish Lord Durham 's report in this country . The published Correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Canadian Governors is altogether too bulky to be read by people in general ; and even a selection from it , to comprise only the more interesting despatches , would have been of this character . But neither Lord Durham 's " Report , " nor Sir Francis 's " Narrative , " lie open to any such objection . The buyers of the reprinted " Bubbles of Canada , " niay thank their author 's popular nom de guerre of " Sam Slick , " and his piratical borrowing from an equally popular title of another man 's , for the disappointment they have purchased . One would have thought the name of the blower of the original " Bubbles from the Brunnens of Nassau , " might on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a like honor . The Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada has the merit of being in his production as exclusively amusing as the topic he has in hand , his own amusing conduct , will allow ; or even , which is pretty much the same thing , as the borrower from his old title-page is uniformly dull in his . To be sure , Sir Francis 's book is made up of despatches to Downing Street , addresses , answers , and other manifestoes , strung together very slightly in the way of narrative ; and perhaps people had had enough of that sort of thing before he left Canada , in the newspapers , which published so many of these queer productions . We observe , indeed , that even in the Canadas , where , till he left them , his admirers affected to be so many and so very warm , no one has called for a cheap edition of his book ; a circumstance which may well excuse the American public for having been guilty cf the like omission . But , even this reason does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is no collection of old public documents , and , even if it had been , his Lordship 's despatches and replies have not attained the unfortunate notoriety which attaches to those of Sir Francis Head . In the Canadas , the Durham Report has gone through a great number of editions , besides appearing in extenso in almost every newspaper . That the Canadians // are the parties most interrsted in its statements and their consequences , though very true , hardly accounts for this contrast . What is so vitally important to the interests of an extensive horder country like British America , can not really he a matter of indifference , or even of mere ordinary interest , to the United States . Nor is this all . The report is in itself one of the most interesting state papers ever published , and its style and subjects are such as should make it particularly interesting to an American reader . It is full of valuable information and sound reasoning , on every subject of which it treats . The common faults of official writing are avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a host of unimportant trifles , to give an air of authenticity and labored exactness to what is really a mere piece of patchwork copying from other sources , laborious to no one but the reader anti no dealing in official commonplaces , to mystify the uninitiated , and keep up a show of profound reasoning , where substance there is none . It is a plain-spoken , manly document ; hold in its statements , admissions , and conclusions yet temperate in language , and so carefully guarded in its argumentative portions , as to leave little room for hostile criticism , except to that dishonest class of antagonists , who invent , where they can not discover , material for censure . Nor must an American forget , that it is a state paper , the production of an English nobleman of high rank and political standing , in which constant reference is made , and never in a tone of disparagement , to the United States , their form of government , their people , undertakings , and objects , in connexion with the affairs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own government and countrymen with a faithful and unsparing hand , Lord Durham has not shrunk from the still more obnoxious duty of often placing the policy of foreigners and their government in favorable contrast with theirs . He has not stooped to flatter national prejudice at the expense of truth . There is in his representations none of that affectation of contempt for this country and its institutions , by which Englishmen have too often shown their ignorance of the subject they spoke of , or their dishonesty , or both . On the contrary , Lord Durham has had the good sense to see , that the wonderful prosperity of the descendants of the British race here , is any thing but a dishonor to the proud land of their forefathers ; that even the marked // superiority , in all that constitutes true prosperity , of these old colonies of Great Britain , now independent of her control , over her newer colonies still subject to it , is a matter to be regarded by her with other feelings than those of mere mortification . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old colonies , which forced them to erect themselves into another nation , and of later mistakes in her treatment of the colonies which are still politically her own , - it tells also of the energy of her early colonization on this continent , of the triumphs of her own people and their offspring . It is evidently in this light that Lord Durham is disposed to view the rapid advancement of this country . He sympathizes with that large and happily fast-increasing portion of the British people , which is rather proud of our success as their own , than hurt at the recollection , that it is not in name theirs ; which would make this recollection serve as a lesson for the future to their statesmen , how they deal with colonies , and not as a goad to the baser passions of their countrymen , to keep alive a feeling of hostility which ought never to have been excited . That a document of this kind should not have obtained general circulation in this country , we think is much to be regretted . ATe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on British American affairs , which its cheap republication would have diffused extensively among our people ; and much more , because of the favorable influence which its liberal and enlightened character must have exerted on the public feelings and sympathies , not merely as they regard Canada and its concerns , but also in the far more important matter of rheir general tone as regards the British people and their affairs . We , too , have among us a class , who imitate the English defamers of the United States , in the temper of their habitual remarks on the mother country . It is not to be wondered at , if a feeling favorable to such retaliatory warfare should prevail to a considerable extent among our people . We could well wish , for the sake of the influence it must have had in checking this disposition , that in this case , the ipsissima verba of one of the first of the English liberal statesmen of the day should have been made generally known among us . The silly tittle-tattle of every locomotive story-teller , to Marryat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as English opinion . It is time the // other side were heard , and the better judgment of the thinking portion of either people , a little more faithfully cornmunicated to the other . Perhaps it is too late now for Lord Durham 's Report to he made a very efficient means of accornplishing this end . The next that may offer , we may hope , xviii be put to better use . But we must turn from the Report to the consideration of its subject , - the political state and prospects of British America . As Lower Canada has been the scene of the most critical portion of the recent struggles , and as its condition in general is on all accounts the most interesting , we shall give it the largest share of our attention . The state of things in Upper Canada comes next in interest and importance . The four other provinces have much less in their condition to call for extended remark ; though it will he necessary to speak of them , in order to give any thing like a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue in the neighhouring provinces is no longer Canadian , but British American , - perhaps we might better say British and American , and include the United States among the parties directly interested in it . The marked peculiarities , social and political , of the Canadas , make it far more difficult of solution than it otherwise would have been ; hut this is all . They hy no means isolate the Canadas , or separate the prohlem of their future government from that of the other colonies . One can not in truth imagine a state of things established in either or both of them , that should not of necessity affect , for good or evil , and that in no slight degree , the States , as well as the colonies , which border on them . Our readers are , of course , sufficiently familiar with the general extent and form of the British possessions in North America , as they appear on the map ; the two large Canadian provinces extending along the northern frontier of the United States , and bounded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bay Territory ; the smaller provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , to the east of Maine ; and the insular provinces of Prince Edward 's Island and Newfoundland , - the former of trifling extent , and separated only by a narrow channel from the mainland of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , - the latter very much larger , and considerably more remote . Of the Hudson 's Bay Territory it will be unnecessary here to speak further , as it // can scarcely be said to have a political existence ; its few white inhabitants being all traders with the Indians , and dependents of the Hudson 's Bay Company . The population of the Canadas bears no proportion to their whole extent it is scattered , indeed , over a comparatively small part of it . The settled portion of Upper Canada nowhere reaches to any great distance from the St. Lawrence and the great Lakes , which form the boundary of the Province , and in some places the strip is very narrow . In Lower Canada , too , the settled country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very narrow , never above a few leagues in width , and often hardly admitting of measurement by miles ; to the south of the St. Lawrence , the inhabited tract is larger in proportion to the total area , but it still falls far short of it , and , in fact , below Quebec , becomes a mere belt of land along the south shore , diminishing in width as it stretches to the northeast , and ceasing for some distance before we come to the scanty settlements along the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and Bay of Chaleurs , which contain the population of the District of Gasp* . New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward 's Island , are far from being thickly settled , their aggregate population , according to the highest estimate , falling far short * of that of the State of Maine . The settled district of Newfoundland is but a small part of the island , extending only along the eastern and southeastern coasts , and that not continuously . This very partial distribution of inhabited territory must be borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population will be likely to excite surprise . The Canadas are generally supposed , at the present time , to contain a population of about a million ; Upper Canada claiming , of this number , about 400,000 , and Lower Canada 600,000 . The three Lower Provinces have a population of about 350,000 ; 140,000 ( a number probably beyond the truth ) being claimed for New Brunswick ; 170,000 for Nova Scotia ; and 40,000 being about the allowance for Prince Edward 's Island . New- Lord Durham 's report speaks of : 365,000 , as the highest estimate for the population of these three colonies at the present time , it is no doubt too high . In i*3O Maine had a population of 399,955 , 1n* census ; and taking her increase in former years as a guide , it must now considerahly exceed 500,000 . The superficial extent of iIaine is much less than that of the three Provinces , and the time , during which its settlement has been in active progress , does not a great deal exceed the time theirs has occupied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The six colonies together , therefore , have not quite a million and a half of inhabitants , which is not far from the present population of the three States of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Maine , and rather less than one tenth of that of the Union . It must not be inferred , however , from this statement , that the population of the British provinces has been any thing like stationary , or that its increase has been slow , even as compared with that of the United States , since their independence . At the close of the revolutionary war , what is now Upper Canada was a wilderness , and not yet set off from the Province of Quebec ; New Brunswick formed part of Nova Scotia ; and Prince Edward 's Island was almost without inhabitants . In 1784 , the population of the Canadas was officially returned at about 112,000 souls ; and about the same period that of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward 's Island ( was estimated , inclusive of some 20,000 loyalist settlers from the States ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite large enough , but they are probably not very far from the truth . Exclusive of Newfoundland , therefore , of the early population of which it is hard to find any tolerably accurate accounts , the population of British America has increased nearly , if not quite , nine fold in fifty-five years . 3uring the forty years between 1790 and 1830 , the population of New England did not quite double itself ; while that oY New York increased very nearly six fold , - a rate of increase , therefore , a trifle less rapid than that of British America . The new Western States have grown much more rapidly . The population of Ohio , for example , in 1830 , was more than twenty times as great as in 1800 , - a period of only thirty years . But it is not with these , that the comparison can be fairly made ; as the British colonies are only in part new settlements , and in this respect are much more nearly in the condition of the State of New York , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which of itself is in a position analogous to that of the Northwestern States , has not grown in wealth and population any thing like as rapidly as they have done ; but , as a whole , the Provinces have made great progress ; so great , indeed , as to suffer only in comparison with that of the new districts of this country , taken separately from the old . In the last fifty years , the // population of the whole Union has probably increased rather more than fourfold ; but the proportional extent of its territory , which has been long settled , is much greater than in the possessions of the British Crown , so that the analogy does not hold between them . We are apt , on this side of the Atlantic , to complain , " not without cause , " of the indistinct and often erroneous notions , entertained of us and our doings , on the other side . The good people of the neighbouring provinces have , perhaps , almost as good reason for complaint , in the views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one respect the cases are considerably unlike , inasmuch as our opinions of our neighbours are founded altogether upon their own representations of themselves ; but otherwise the resemblance , so far as mere vagueness of statement and grossness of mistake are concerned , is strong enough . In general , our citizens have taken up with one or other of two conflicting accounts of the actual state of things ; the one , the workmanship of the most violent of the refugees and their partisans , the other , the chosen counter-statement of the most violent of their antagonists . The former describes the colonial policy of the mother country as a model of all that is hateful , oppressive , and corrupt , and the people as suffering under its tyranny to an extent no longer bearable . The latter , in so many words , denies the existence of abuse or grievance in the colonial system , and all but denies even the exist&amp;nce of discontent in the minds of any considerable portions of the community , said by the malecontents to be thus grievously oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , property of all kinds daily losing value , a population daily lessening , - in a word , every interest prostrated ; and all this , not the accidental , temporary consequence of civil strife , but its cause , - the abiding result ( long ago felt in its less terrible beginnings , and foreseen in all its whole progress from bad to worse ) , the result of a long course of misgovernment , and of this only . The other , if it can not , at the present moment , show a country in the actual enjoyment of prosperity of any kind , at least throws these darker parts of the view as far as possible into shade ; exhibits them as a mere effect of political agitation ; and , in fact , charges the disaffected party with having themselves created all the evils they now declaim against and magnify , for their own purposes . // It is hard to say , which of these two versions is the furthest from the true one . What there is of truth in either is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ; nor will it , as we think , he a work of much difficulty to show , to any candid mind , the preponderance of this alloy in the composition of both . This will be best done , perhaps , by a brief , connected statement of the real features of the case , to the best of our knowledge and belief . The conclusions we are about to present , though in the main agreeing with those so ably urged in Lord Durham 's Report , are not hazarded on the mere faith of the Report , but are the result , in part , of a careful study and comparison with it of other and hostile authorities , and in part also of observations , made under circumstances more than ordinarily favorable , on the course of events and state of parties in British America . The colonial system , then , as it has been in operation in the adjacent provinces , and more especially of late years , has not been , either in design or in effect , what the party lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever of intentional or even of active oppression of any kind , on the part of the mother country or its government , towards the colonies . The cases of 1776 and 1839 are , in this respect , as little analogous as they well can be . The thirteen Atlantic colonies , of the former period , were in a situation entirely different from that of the six Northern colonies of the present day . The former had brought with them , in their emigration from the old world , every element of the most perfect system of municipal freedom , which the world had ever seen . New England , in her first settlements , of the free will of her Pilgrim settlers , established all these principles in full operation ; and the nine other Colonies , though in these respects not equal to those of New England , were yet further in advance of all other communities of their times , than they were behind the four model colonies of the east . The war of the Revolution grew out of an attempt to force from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoyed . Their free institutions , though chartered by the Crown , were not held as its gift , or as the gift of the Parliament or people of Great Britain . The Crown had merely recognised , and generally with extreme reluctance , a state of things which the cobnists // had established for themselves . Its governors were , in a great many instances , hostile to the integrity of those institutions , and had thus been brought into frequent conflict with the great body of the community , who clung to them the more firmly for the reason , that they were in every sense their own . For a long course of years , the French settlements on the continent had forced the British colonists to live in a state of almost constant warfare . From a variety of causes , the hostility of French and English on this continent was , if possible , more bitter than on the old . The political system of the French colony of Canada was as perfect a model of the military despotism , as the New England colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antipodes of theirs ; language and origin , and all the memory of old feuds , growing out of European hostility , conspired to set them at variance ; and the Indian policy of the Canadians , by the character of atrocious barbarity which it stamped upon their warfare , filled up the measure of the abhorrence with which they were regarded by the constant objects of that warfare . A great effort at length resulted in the final overthrow of the French rule on the continent . The " heat and burden of the day " had fallen on the colonists , and they naturally looked to enjoy , to their full extent , the great advantages of the conquest for which they had so long sighed . But , instead of this , the occasion was before long embraced , by the Crown and its infatuated advisers , to attempt to carry to a successful issue their own long-standing controversy with the colonies on the subject of popular rights . The French Canadian system , in its leading , odious features , political and religious , was now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown , - not merely within the old limits of the French settlements , where it might not have been easy to persuade the first generation of the ' conquered people to adopt an entirely new system , - but over the whole extent of the vast , unsettled countries on the Ohio and Mississippi , to which the two Crowns had , in former times , laid conflicting claims . The old colonists thus saw the preparation made for inclosing them within a hostile population , to worse &amp;ffect than ever ; for , in former times , they had the Crown and its resources to aid them in their wars against the French and Indians , and now the Crown itself was setting up their old enennes against them ; then the hostilities of the French // were a check , rather than otherwise , on the arbitrary disposition of the Crown , inasmuch as they forced it to rely continually on the active loyalty of the people for the preservation of its Colonies , and now this same hostility was to be relied upon hy the Crown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask was thrown off . The taxing power claimed , was successfully resisted ; and the thirteen colonies became the United States . Old grievances there had been , against which Provincial Legislatures had protested , hut it was not on account of these , that the last resort of civil war was tried . Still less was it a struggle on the part of the insurgents for new institutions of government , which the mother country refused to grant . It was , on their side , a war of defence , waged to protect the cherished liberties of their whole people ; and , on the part of the government of that day , a war of aggression , undertaken of its own accord against those liherties . There is nothing of this kind in the recent colonial history of Great Britain . The solemn renunciation of the asserted right of taxation , which was made by the Declaratory Act at the close of the war of Independence , has been faithfully adhered to ; and whenever the mother country has of late actively interfered in the internal affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , and with very different views , from those which rendered her policy , in 1770 , so unjustifiahle . Since these States gained their independence , there has always been an apprehension felt as to the duration of the colonial tie in other quarters , and more especially on this continent . The preservation of the colonies , thus held in doubt , has been much more carefully looked to by the government than before . In some of its precautions , as we shall soon show , the government has been most unwise . The object has in fact been hazarded hy the means taken to insure it . But it is not the less true for this , that they were intended as precautions , and that the policy of the government has been any thing but one of aggression upon the liberties of the colonists . The complaints of the provinces have not , for a reason we shall soon he able to explain fully , produced so prompt a redress of grievances as they should have done ; hut they have been attended to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowmoving machinery of office would allow . The struggle has // long been one of successful aggression on the part of the colonists , generally for the purpose of obtaining a larger share of local independence , but sometimes for much more questionable objects . Concession , - frequently to unreasonable demands , though almost always , from the vice of the system , too tardy to produce the effect of satisfying those who made them , - concession has long been the order of the day with the home government . Nor has there been , on the part of the mother country , so far as British America is in the case , any apparently intentional or interested misgovernment of her dependencies . Their foreign trade , though not in all respects on the most advantageous footing possible , has certainly not been injured by any course of legislation designed to advantage the mother country at their expense . On the contrary , whatever of loss has resulted from its errors , falls rather on Great Britain and the Empire generally , than on those of her colonies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the restrictions on the West Indian trade with the United States . If their internal resources have been slowly and inadequately developed , it has been owing to a cause within themselves , and not to any short-sighted , jealous interference from without . Great sums have been expended by the parent state in internal improvements ; not always wisely , it is true , or economically , but for this again there has been a cause within the colonies . J7he public lands have been ill managed ; granted in such quantities and to such men , as to have often interposed difficulties in the way of improvement , instead of being made the means of promoting emigration to the colonies to the utmost extent ; but here again , the mismanagement is to be charged to the account of local , not of metropolitan corruption . There has been no postponement of colonial to British interests ; but a sacrifice of both ( and more especially of the latter ) to the jobbing propensities of an influential interest within the colonies themselves . Nor has the patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a source of power , or an object of any sort of consideration to the government . The salaries of their officials are higher than with us , but much too low to be in any number of cases a temptation to persons having the requisite influence with the authorities in England to apply for them . Six men can be appointed governors or lieutenant-governors , // with emoluments which according to European ideas are any thing but high , and which , while they do little or nothing more than maintain the functionaries receiving them , in the discharge of their office , are only in part defrayed by the colonies themselves , - the governors in almost all cases being paid in part from the Imperial treasury . Each of these six officers has his civil or private secretary , and his aid-de-camp , the latter of course a junior officer in the British service , the former generally a person in some way connected with the governor under whom he serves . The cost of these two offices to the colony is trifling . Besides these eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which till within the last two years has generally been very little in demand in these colonies , and has never been an expense except to John Bull 's own capacious pocket , - there is no kind of patronage within them , direct or indirect , of which the colonist has not his full share with the native of Great Britain . Of course , with an extensive emigration continually going on , from the educated as well as from the poorer classes of the nation , there must be many persons of British birth holding office as judges , sheriffs , and so forth , in the colonies to which this tide of population is directed just as in Michigan or Iowa , New-Englanders and New-Yorkers are , for the same cause , to be found everywhere in the discharge of local trusts . But were an Englishman to apply in Downing Street for its good offices to help him to such advancement at the present day in Canada or Nova Scotia , he would very quickly see by the surprised reception he would meet with , how completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage . In some possessions of the British Crown , no doubt , the East Indies for example , a very different state of things exists in this respect ; but the North American colonies have no golden cushions for official drowsiness to repose upon , and offer therefore no such tempting prospect to the privileged applicants for ministerial patronage . The slumbers of their office-holders , though beyond all question equally profound , are not equally well paid for ; and the " berths are left to be drawn for by the passengers after they have got on board . Where then has been the cause of all the actual maladministration , which has resulted from some cause or other in every one of these provinces , and which has led to so much // discontent in all , and at length in two of them to insurrection ? Effects like these do not occur without a cause ; and it is not easy to suppose any cause short of very great mismanagement of some kind , capable of producing them . Men may complain , and that loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when , in a community , agitation is carried to that point at which property and life are hazarded in civil strife , we may be sure that something more than a trifle is at stake . If the matter in dispute seem at first view a trifle , we may be sure there is something more in it than meets the eye . Imaginary evils find imaginary remedies , or remain unredressed without doing much harm . It is only when injudicious treatment has made them real , that real remedies become necessary , and men grow too impatient to brook long delay in applying them . In the case before us , it will not be difficult to account for all that has taken place , if we direct our attention to two points ; the radical defects of the constitutional system which has been in operation in the colonies under consideration and the natural tendency of the state of things in England , and of the ignorance which has there always prevailed on all merely colonial affairs . - We will endeavour to bring this inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Prince Edward 's Island had received constitutional charters before the war of the Revolution ; the former as early as 1758 ; the latter in 1770 . New Brunswick was not set off from Nova Scotia till the year 1785 , when it received the grant of a constitution formed on the model of that of Nova Scotia . The government of Canada continued to be vested in a governor and council , appointed by the Crown , and holding office during its pleasure , till 1791 ; when the Imperial Act of Parliament was passed , which divided it into the two Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada , and established a representative constitution in each . The constitution of Newfoundland was only granted in 1832. - The Canadas being the two colonies most important for our present view , it will be enough if we descrihe the constitution given to them . Those granted at an earlier period differed from it in some particulars of secondary importance ; but they have since undergone changes which make them in substance identical with the Canadian . By the constitutional act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within each of the new Provinces , in a Provincial Parliament of three branches ; each having duties and powers analogous to those of the corresponding branch of the Imperial Parliament , on the model of which these local legislatures professed to be framed . The Governor , or other person administering the government , was endowed with nearly all the Parliamentary prerogatives of the Crown , as settled by English usage . Subject to provisions requiring the assembling of a Parliament in every year , limiting the duration of any Parliament to a term of four years , it rested with the Governor to convene , prorogue , or dissolve Parliament at pleasure . Like the English Sovereign , he had an absolute veto on all its legislative acts . If unprepared to exercise this power , and yet doubtful of the propriety of yielding the royal assent to any measure , he might " reserve " it to be sent to England . In this case , if approved within two years , the fact was to be proclaimed in the colony on the return of the Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved within that time , the royal assent was considered as withheld . - The Legislative Council was to be in theory the counterpart of the House of Lords ; but as the provinces afforded no material for an hereditary aristocracy , it was necessary to make this body in reality very different from the English model . The hereditary principle was abandoned , and the appointment of life Legislative Councillors vested , without reserve as to numbers , in the Crown . By a singular oversight , no provision was made allowing a councillor to resign his office , or enacting its forfeiture even in case of the grossest personal delinquency. - The popular branch of the Legislature , styled the House of Assembly , was to consist of the Representatives of the people , returned for counties and boroughs , very much after the fashion of the English House of Commons , but by a suffrage which in effect was nearly universal , - the landed qualification ( a 40s. freehold ) being possessed by almost every one of age to vote . In theory , the body thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colony ; but the theory , as we shall soon see , was one thing , and the l ) ractice another . - No provision was made for the payment of members of either House . A system of payment , analogous to that in use in the United States , has however grown up in practice ; the members of the House paying themselves at a fixed rate by vote , out of the // sum allowed for its contingent expenses . Besides the Legislative Council , thus established as a branch of the Provincial Parliament , there has existed another body , with distinct and in many respects anomalous functions , styled the Executive Council . The members of this body are named by the Crown , or in other words by the Governor for the time being , and hold their office during his pleasure . A certain number of them are paid a small salary . If more than that number are appointed , the junior members serve without pay . They are sworn to secrecy , like the members of the British Privy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the performance of certain of the official acts of the Governor . In general , they may be considered as the confidential advisers of the Governor , though , as be is under no obligation to ask their advice except in a very limited number of cases , it is obvious they do not stand at all in the position of the responsible advisers of the British Crown . They are consulted in general only at his discretion ; and , when consulted , they take an equal share in the discussion of the business before them , the individual members having no departmental duties or responsibility . In fact , from the impossibility of its being ever known on what particular subjects the Council has been called to give an opinion , or what opinion any particular councillor has given , this body can not be said to be subject to any real responsibility at all . To a certain extent , it is presumed to approve , if not to influence or induce , the conduct of the Executive ; and its members thus share in the popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to hope or fear from the public for their political acts . The Legislative Council has not the general judicial power which is enjoyed by the House of Lords . The right of trying for political offences or official misconduct , or impeachment presented by the Assembly , has been claimed for it ; but the jealousy , which the popular branch has always entertained of the other House , has prevented it from acquiescing in the claim . Certain judicial functions on the other hand , which our limits do not allow us here to particularize , are exercised by the Executive Council . In the Nova-Scotian Constitution , and those which were modelled upon it , the powers of the Executive and Legislative Councils were vested in a single body , and not in two , // as by the Canadian constitution . In other respects the differences were not material , so far as our present inquiry is concerned . The earlier charters have of late been modified , in consequence of urgent popular demands for some change in that respect , so as to assimilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Nova Scotia , this change has taken place within the last two years . Our readers are of course aware , that in February , 1838 , the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended for a term of two years , by act of the Imperial Parliament , and a temporary government , by a Governor and Special Council , appointed by the Crown , with restricted legislative powers , was substituted . A few remarks will serve to show the character of this scheme of a constitution , as it was of necessity manifested , when put in operation . The Governor or Lieutenant-Governor , it will be remembered , has always been , in Newfoundland , an officer of the Navy , and in the other colonies , with two late exceptions only in Lower Canada , an officer of the Army . There was thus a mistake made in the very first step taken . A functionary charged almost exclusively with civil duties of administration , and intrusted besides with the delicate task of managing a representative body , was selected from a body of men whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . A military officer is apt to look up with too much of the dependent disposition to his superior , and to expect too much of the same to he shown towards himself by his inferiors ; in a word , he is apt to carry with him his notions of military subordination from head-quarters to the council-room . And a more fatal error for men to fall into , whose success depends on the influence they exert , and not on the mere commands they issue , can not well be imagined . Again , in the absence of a natural aristocracy of birth or property , - in colonies where none are born to titles of nobility or to wealth much beyond the ordinary standard , and where , in fact , even the accumulation of very large fortunes by successful enterprise is difficult and rare ,  - -  to whom can the Governor look for the life Legislative Councillors , who are to play House of Lords to his King ? What more natural , than that he should surround himself with quasi peers , from the quasi aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commissioners , were the material ready to his hand . They lived at the // seat of government and could attend Parliament at pleasure . They were the society of his little court , the men whom every governor was sure to know the instant he arrived . Above all , they were the men from whom a something very like military subordination could be secured ; and was it nothing for a military man , to make sure of one at least of the two Houses of Parliament that were to be indicted on him ? Of such , accordingly , were all the Upper Houses , as they came into existence , under the signing and sealing hands of their Excellencies . Let us add , that in those colonies in which the Executive and Legislative councils were not one body , these causes insured the nomination of Executive Councillors from the same class ; that the same individuals were often members of both , and , worse still , that the paid clerk of one was often a member of the other . This added , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The constitution and powers of the representative branch of the Legislature were not put on a much better footing . No arrangement was made in the first instance , for any future changes in the representation of different districts . The country was set off in counties , at first tolerably equal in respect of population , but which soon became , in a new country , as unequal in this respect as they had from the first been in extent . Hence arose a most unfair local advantage to the old districts near the seat of government , over the newer and more remote localities . In some of the colonies , this was much more severely felt than in others ; and in general some attempt has been marie in name at least to remedy it by Provincial legislation . But in all these cases , the remedy has been of a very insufficient character , and has not been applied till after long and vexatious delays ; the ruling interest in the cAnny finding its account in keeping all things , to the best of its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has had the effect of more or less weakening the hold of the elected House upon the constituency as a whole , and thus indirectly aiding the official body in its warfare with the House , - of contributing to make a great portion of the community everywhere discontented with the existing order of things , - and , in Lower Canada , of adding increased bitterness to the controversy of the rival races , by the undue preponderance it gave to one of them in the representation . But this was a trifling evil in comparison with that of // which we have next to speak . At the time when these Assemhlies came into existence , the Executive was already in the enjoyment of certain revenues , - revenues , indeed , which were generally almost or quite equal to its then wants . These were of two kinds , the hereditary revenues of the Crown , derived from a variety of sources , which we can not here particularize , and the avails of certain taxes levied under acts of the Imperial Parliament . The Executive laid claim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and for a time , in the early weakness of the Assernhlies , the claim was tacitly acquiesced in . But when , as shortly happened , the government had to apply for additional votes of money and new taxes , the Assemhlies hegan to claim the right of at least overseeing the accounts of the other branches of the revenue , to judge with what degree of economy and propriety they were administered , and what were the real merits of the application for further grants . From this claim , the transition was easy and inevitable to the claim of an indefeasihle natural right , as the people 's representatives , to control the appropriation of the whole revenue , however raised . It was hardly less inevitable , that the military governor should side with his council or councils of office-holders , in their death-struggle against all such claims from first to last , and that thus the singular spectacle should soon be presented in every colony , of an Executive striving to carry on the government , with a majority of the representatives of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , it will he rememhered how nearly powerless , to all appearance , the Assemhlies at first were . They could send up hills , hut their official antagonists were then to sit in judgment on them , and say to what extent they might become law . And when , hy their permission , sent up to the Governor , and hy him ratified , it was further at their pleasure , and after their interpretation of them , that they were then to he put in force . The Assemhly had no voice in the appointment of this official body , to whom the execution of its laws fell . " During the pleasure of the Crown , " was their tenure of office ; or , in other words , during the pleasure of those head officials , who , as Legislative and Executive Councillors , had the ear of the Governor , and wielded therehy all the patronage of the Crown , in behalf of themselves , their families , and adherents . These men were subject , as // we have remarked already , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as the Crown bad revenue enough at its disposal ( or rather at theirs ) for the payment of their salaries , they could well afford to laugh at all the hostile efforts of the House . Our limits do not allow us to go into the history of this finance controversy , and show the slow steps by which , at length , most of the demands of the Assemblies , in this respect , have been conceded . We can not even trace out the results of the warfare between the Assemblies and the officials with any degree of minuteness . The portion of Lord Durham 's Report , which relates to this subject , enters into a great variety of particulars , and is interesting and able in the highest degree . We must confine ourselves within such narrow limits , as will materially detract from the mass of evidence , by which our statements would otherwise be found supported . No one , however , at all familiar with the course of events in the colonies , can fail to see , that the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a faithful representation of what bas been in constant progress in them . To give facts here , one by one , would be to fill volumes . It must he tolerably self-evident , that , in a controversy of this kind , neither of the parties to it could adhere to a line of conduct that should be unobjectionable . Office-holders , in their control of public expenditure , are inevitably lavish ; and this , the moment their craft is in danger , as inevitably renders their use of the public funds corrupt . The more violent the opposition of a popular body to their privileges , the more corrupt and lavish is the unpopular body obliged to become in its support of them . the assailed Councillors have their military chief in their hands to begin with ; and there he is almost certain to remain . Their acts are , to all appearance , his ; for all patronage , in name , emanates from the Crown , and he is its representative . The Assembly , of course , attack him , not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can find cover for attack . He retaliates by throwing himself more intimately than ever into alliance with their natural enemies ; and , since he has the ear of the colonial office , just as the local officials possess his , he enlists the home government in his support , as they , in the first instance , enlisted him in theirs . That this should be the case , necessarily argues very little against the Colonial // Department , so far as intentions go . It is distant , and therefore of necessity at first ignorant ; the Governor is its norninee and representative ; his despatches are all it has to decide upon , and they are in effect the special pleadings of the knot of office-holders , for whom and hy whom the war is really waged . Thus for years may things go on under such a system . But , in course of time , the pecuniary wants of the local governments become urgent . The House grows holder , as its power of annoyance grows . Its remonstrances assume the form of threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor 's course to the home government . It has the power to make its complaints heard ; and the ohnoxious Governor is superseded . But the root of the evil is still untouched . The new Governor falls into the old hands . For a time , his instructions to conciliate the House may do something to check the course of things ; hut , in the end , and generally very soon , the old measures in the colony , and the old story in the despatches , are the sure result . And how , meanwhile , is the Assembly acting ? Right at first , is it not sure to he carried into extravagances , which must give the officials great advantages over it , not merely in the view of the Downing Street officials hy whom the controversy is to he judged , hut even in the view of a considerable portion of that colonial community on which the House had to rely for support ? The Governor 's advisers it has no means of reaching . They are not , as in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the people , if they sustain the principles of the House , can hring them into harmony with it . Nor are they , as in England , directly responsible to the House , so that an adverse vote of that body can force them to resign and give place to men who can secure its confidence . The popular leaders of the House soon find themselves , therefore , cut off from all chance of ohtaining the direction of affairs . They may have a Speaker of their party , and may command the votes of the majority of the people ; they may force , hy dint of long and hard fighting , some of their favorite measures into laws ; hut , for all this , their enemies , the enemies of all their measures , are irrecoverahly the government of the colony . In England and here , the prospect of being some day in administration , always tempers down the violence of an opposition party . It may profess // more than it means to practise , and commonly does . But this inconsistency has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that success may at any time expose the insincerity of their professions ; and they keep them , therefore , within some bounds . But , with a state of things like that we are describing , there is none of this . The agitator can not go too far or too fast for the object immediately before him . He may profess , promise , assert , deny , assail , or defend , at pleasure . He is a chartered fault-finder , fearless of ever being subject to the same fault-finding ordeal in his turn . His antagonists use the public purse against him ; he too must use it against them . Nor are the means wanting to bis hand . His constituents want money from the treasury to make roads and build bridges , to pay for schools , hospitals , &amp;c. ; perhaps , even to buy seed-wheat and potatoes . * What can he do better than gratify such longings in the way most conducive to his own popularity and interest ? It will never do to rest content with appropriating moneys to these objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , therefore , as a thing of course , his bills have his own and his friend 's names on their face , as commissioners to expend them the right way . If the officials refuse to pass such a bill , well ; theirs is the odium ; and it is apt to be so intense in these matters that affect the pockets of so many , that he knows they will shrink from incurring it , and indeed would be glad probably if he could make them . If they pass it , well ; he fights them with their own weapons . But the struggle does not end here . He soon finds , that the less he does to make * The Legislature of Lower Canada , for a great number of years , distributed large sums yearly amour the inhabitants of several counties , for this last purpose , noniinally in the shape of loans . In one year ( 1817 ) , $ 140,0 ( 10 were voted away in this manner ; and of the whole , some 30 or 40 dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment by an extraordinarily cautious purchaser of a mortgaged farm ! By a number of these alms-giving acts , seed-wheat could be had almost for the asking , without reference to the size of a man 's farm , to the amount of 60 Winchester bushels ; other grain , to 45 ; and potatoes , to 30 ; and this , too , in counties lying north of Quebec , till the 25th of June or 1st of July ! The later acts were not a great deal better in their provisions , than these early ones . On all the other subjects named in the text , the popular legislation was often almost as bad as on this ; and , though Lower Canada , in this respect as in many others of the same kind , had won the palm of preéminence , it must not be supposed by any means , that its legislature is the only one which has resorted to measures of this kind . " Jttutato nornine , ' and with some qualifications as to frequency and extent , the charge lies against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the distributor , the better it is for his purposes ; and he is thus led to make it the policy of his body to centre all patronage of this kind in itself , as the one great popular corporation of the lands , instead of struggling for that invaluable boon to any country , the multiplication of corporate or municipal bodies , vested with powers of local taxation and administration for local objects . The officials can not , from the nature of the case , be the advocates of popular local institutions , to supersede the clumsy , centralized system whereby they live . And thus , between the two parties , no honest attcmpt is ever made to secure this end . The popular leader may , for appearance ' sake , pretend to aim at it but his acts will too often belie his words . Sometimes , of course , in practice , the rule we have laid down in this case , will be infringed upon , and a popular leader will be acting on more enlarged views than his proposition would naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less a rule , for such exceptions . We are speaking of general tendencies , not of isolated acts ; and , for every exception that could be cited to our rule , could easily cite a dozen facts in evidence of its correctness . The ball is still rolling . " When we want a bridge , we take a judge to build it , " said a popular member of a provincial legislature , whose pithy saying is well quoted in Lord Durham 's Report . The popular leader has not before his eyes the fear of being soon himself a judge on a low salary . It is not in his line . He is at war with the judges ( for unluckily the judges in general have been in front rank in this party warfare ) and with all the rest of the salary-receiving fraternity ; and his zeal to cut off their resources and increase his own , by diverting all the public money he can from their expectant pockets to his commissioners ' hands , is checked by no visions of an approaching exhaustion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stop short , under such temptation , at the precise point at which each salary becomes just what it ought to be , for the advantage of the public service ? He is more than politician , more than what most men call patriot , if he can . But we must go further yet , if we would see the whole length to which this controversy has been carried , and the means eventually resorted to by the Assemblies , to decide it // in their favor . Unable , by mere hostile votes , to remove their antagonists from office , and indisposed to wait the tardy process of battling away fraction after fraction of their emoluments , in the vain hope of starving them out of its enjoyment , it was natural , that they should before long try the experiment of singling out obnoxious individuals for attack , by direct , or , as was the more common course , by indirect impeachment . Here , again , their leaders were exempt from all immediate fear of the lex talionis . They could play their game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but to complain of persecution , and stand on their defence . Of the impeachments , formal and informal , which grew out of this state of things , some were richly deserved , and many not wholly undeserved ; but the temptation to an abuse of power in the resort to them , was altogether too stroiig to be resisted . No competent tribunal existed for the trial of these high complaints , for the House , of course , repelled with scorn the idea of submitting them to the judgment of the Legislative Council , as a House of Peers ; and the ordinary courts of law were obviously inadequate to entertain them , even if their own high functionaries had not been , as tbey were , continually their object . The House proceeded , therefore , by committees of inquiry of its own bod ) r , always of necessity hostile to the parties to be accused . In collecting material for accusation , this body often set aside every form of justice and rule of evidence . r* he committee reported . The House sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor to suspend , and the colonial Minister to remove , the accused officer . Did the Governor hesitate to become a party to the proceeding , and require , that the accused be heard before being treated as a criminal ? - a supplementary address was ready on the instant , to extend the benefit of the proposed impeachment , so far as it might be possible to do so , to such offending Gove nor himself . Does the colonial Secretary , too , seem reluctant ? committee follows committee , address follows address , and threats of the stoppage of the supplies follow all ; till from sheer weariness , if for no better reason , the Secretary some how or other gets rid of the complaint , and the hunted official is removed to some berth in another colony , or is suffered to resign uncensured , or is dismissed as a delinquent . In any case , his party has been harassed and humbled , and his assailants have gained their ends . // Partial successes , after a long and severe struggle , seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gained them advance as fast as they are gained . A successful leader , who has carried matters thus far by agitation , is apt , on each new concession , to take new ground upon which to urge a claim to something more . After a certain time , so spent , he is not unlikely to lose all desire to have the popular wishes really satisfied , or its substantial interests advanced . Agitation has become a trade ; and the agitator sees the loss of his capital in the redress of grievances . Delay of redress has soured the feelings of his followers , and they are , ready to be induced to advance new claims . Demand is now heaped upon demand ; not to obtain justice , ( though the many still themselves seek nothing more , ) but to force from the ruling power a refusal of what is asked , that the work of agitation may go on , and its workmen prosper . This last stage has by no means been reached in all the British colonies . Perhaps we ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in two of them , - the Canadas , where , for reasons we shall speak of presently , the controversy has assumed a much worse form than in the others . In the Canadas , however , it certainly has been reached earlier in Lower Canada than in Upper , and to much greater effect , whether we regard the number and character of the demands made , or of those who have made them . But of this hereafter . We have , as yet , said nothing of the course of events in England , and their influence on this colonial struggle . During all its earlier stages , it will not be forgotten , that the party in power in the mother country was that which there set itself against all reform or change , as far as it was possible to avoid it . The sympathies of this powerful party , were , of course , for a variety of reasons , altogether with the official party in the colonies . We are all apt to see things as we wish ; and it hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonies , if those , who in their whole course of policy were nervously anxious to avoid change at home , should have been slow to admit the occasion for radical changes at a distance . Be this , however , as it may , ( and we have no disposition to underrate the mischiefs of this course , or to defend in the gross the very mixed motives which led the party to adopt it , ) it is certain , that this sympathy was to the // colonial officials , in all their controversies , a tower of strength . They had , in fact , three principal resources ; the first , in the extravagance of the claims often urged by the Assemhlies , and the frequent violence of their measures , by which many in the colonies were driven from the popular ranks , and , at least , inclined to yield them a measure of support against such assailants , and hy which , also , they are so materially aided , in pleading their cause in England , with all modei'ate men , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phalanx ; the second , in the patronage of the Crown , which they wielded in the colony , to multiply and secure their supporters , hut which was useless to them beyond the , colony ; and the third , in the sympathy of the dominant faction in the English Court and Parliament , to which at least they always looked as the grand security of their continued power , not merely from its direct effect in securing them a favorable hearing , whenever Downing Street was called upon to give judgment on their demerits , hut still more from the general impression it contributed to give in the colonies , of the probable permanence of their power . In 1830 , however , this metropolitan party was doomed to undergo defeat ; and , from that time to this , professed reformers have wielded the powers of the government , and even radical reformers have been found in general supporting the administration . Before this great change took place , the colonial liberals had gained some advantages , but their progress had heen slow . It did not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made matter of complaint in consequence , by those who were disappointed in this result , that the English liberals in power have been just as thorough colonial Tories , as their antagonists were before them . The charge is not a Just one . The policy of the colonial office , since 1830 , is open to attack , no doubt , but not justly to this . The new head of the department has had the old subordinates about him , and much of what goes forth in his name is in fact of necessity theirs . Besides , his correspondents and agents in the colonies were still the same . It was from the officials there , that he received his ordinary information , and it was to them that he had to intrust the developement of his plans . How could the policy of a department , thus divided against itself , be other than wavering ? On the whole , however , the candid // observer must acknowledge , that , in general , Downing Street , under the new r6girne , has decidedly favored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that party have , in consequence , been much more rapid than they otherwise could have been . Still , for the reasons we have explained , its victory was not complete . The reform governments were too busy at home , to give their full attention to what was still an obscure controversy beyond the Atlantic . The colonial Tories still lived in hope , that their old friends would , ere long , return to power , and they therefore abated no jot of their pretensions or zeal . The opposition , on the other hand , by the near prospect of success , was often made more exacting in its demands ; and when , as soon happened , a number of these were not at once gained , its complaints were so much the louder and more bitter . A state of things like this had a strong tendency to hurry on that last stage in the colonial controversy , which we have already described , and to which things have advanced in the Canadas , though not elsewhere . But we have thus far confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This contest with the officeholders , or , as the Lower Canadian opposition not inaptly styled them , the " Bureaucrats , " was by no means the only , nor even the immediate , cause of the recent troubles . There are elements of internal strength in a popular party , which insure it a speedy triumph , where the battle is an open , standup fight of the few against the many . In New Brunswick , the Bureaucracy have quietly lost the day . In Nova Scotia , they have all but lost it . Had the struggle in the Canadas been merely what it was in them , there would no more have been an insurrection in the one case than in the other . Let us turn our view then a little more closely to some of the other grand , early errors of the constitution-makers , and the effect of the state of things since existing in England , in respect to them . On this part of our subject , we can not hope to say enough for the full explanation of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are writing , a hook , not an article . We have seen how clumsily the constitution-makers provided for future government and legislation in the colonies . What sort of system did they establish or allow de facto , for their ill-contrived machines of constitutional government to // set to work upon ? If a good one , the clumsiness of their machine might have been of less consequence ; if bad , the opposite . - To omit , then , all rumor errors , and all considerations not absolutely necessary . The germs of a politico-religious feud were introduced into all the colonies . The church of England , and , though to a less extent , the kirk of Scotland , too , hore with them to the colonies the claim of spiritual superiority . Yet of those who emigrated to form their population , the great majority were not members of those sects . Catholics and dissenters constitute three fourths of those who leave the old world for the colonies . The settlers from the States are , of course , all " voluntary-principle ' * men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put forward to a different extent , and have led to very different consequences , in degree , in different Provinces . In all , however , as a matter of course , there has been an intimate alliance between the church and the Bureaucracy , not , of course , that every officer-holder has been of the favored sect , hut that the great body of them have been , and that their policy has been that of the sect in its claims for power . In justice to the Scottish church , we are hound to say , that , in this unholy struggle , it has never stood the foremost . To the English church , in every colony , has belonged this unenviable distinction ; and the church of the sister kingdom has generally , rather stood on her rights , as a recognised established church , against the all-exclusive spirit of her rival , than attempted to urge claims of its own to any unfair advantage over other religious bodies . The exceptions to the rule are not many . This alliance with the high-church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of the Bureaucrat faction . It gave them a stronger hold on Tory sympathy in England , and served , to some extent , to mystify the question of colonial parties , in the eyes of very many , in the old country , who were not Tories , but whose prejudices were in favor of the church establishment at home . In the colonies it had no tendency to make either of the allied powers popular ; for there both office-holders and high-churchmen were , from the nature of the case , hopelessly in the minority . But it strengthened them , notwithstanding . it secured a class of influential settlers , who would otherwise have had no bond // of union with the oligarchy of the bureau . The emigrants of the established churches were very often men of wealth ; and , on the average , they ranked , at all events , beyond any other class in this respect . With the officials , they were generally strong enough to make their profession fashionable , though not popular . In the lower provinces , this fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bishopric and the elevation of the bishop to the Council , as a quasi Lord Spiritual , on the English plan . There was a grant from the Home government in aid of the church of England , and an apology for a grant to that of Scotland . And , by virtue of the highchurch composition of the Bureaucratic Councils , there was no small share of influence and patronage exercised in favor of " the church ' as a **25;605;TOOLONG corporation . But here the matter rested . Of late years , the grants in aid of the richest sect of the colonies have been cut down ; and , under the popular influence which has effected this object , they must soon cease entirely . The same influence has dealt and is dealing heavy blows on the church ascendency in their Councils . In fact , with the exception of Newfoundland , where the great numerical preponderance of the Catholic body has had its influence on the controversy , it may be said to be now nearly over . In the Canadas , the case is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the colonies , the Constitutional Act of 1791 inflicted on these colonies a provincial endowment for a future establishment . The Catholic church was found established and liberally endowed at the conquest ; and , by the first solemn acts of the conquerors , it was for ever guarantied in its endowments , and , with a few reservations of minor importance , in its other rights and claims . Among the latter was a claim of tithe , - not the tenth part of the produce of the country , however , but only a twenty-sixth part of the grain crops of the Catholic parishes . This the British government guarantied ; with the reservation , that it should not be exigible by the Romanish church on the lands of any Protestant . To counterbalance , probably , these advantages , it was enacted , in 1791 , that an eighth* of all lands thereafter alienated by the Crown , should * The act says , " equal in value to the seventh of the land SO GRANTED , " in other words , to an eighth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set off from time to time " for the support and maintenance of a Protestant clergy . " Of what sect this " Protestant Clergy " was to be , did not appear ; though from the power , which another part of the act gives to the Crown , of erecting , by a certain procedure , " rectories of the Church of England " in the colonies , and endowing them out of these reserves , it has been insisted upon by the adherents of that church , that no other sect could have been had in view in the act at all . The Provincial legislatures were prohibited hy it from making any laws touching these " clergy reserves , " or the uses they should be put to , without the virtual permission of the Imperial Parliament in each case ; all such acts requiring to be laid before both Houses , previous to the royal assent being given them . It is quite beyond our power here to go into the tedious history of this fertile source of discord in the unlucky colonies that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crying evil , it has been less a source of religious animosity than in Upper for the reasons , that the entire amount of the reserves there is less , their value smaller in proportion , the number of Protestants to dispute about them not one fifih of the inhabitants of the colony , and other all-engrossing matters of dispute ( of which we shall speak presently ) forcing them to stand as much as possible together , against a common antagonist . But , in Upper Canada , the mischiefs that have flowed from it are almost endless . The violence of the controversy between the different sects of Protestants , led the Crown , many years since , to take no measures that should give interpretation to the doubtful phraseology of the act , till the local legislature should have passed a bill for that purpose ; after which it ( the Crown ) would use its influence with the Imperial Parliament , to procure its acquiescence in the terms of such bill . Year after year , accordingly , this question has been debated in Upper Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other party quarrels , and embittering them by the most abundant infusion of the gall of sectarian animosity . Bargains , almost without number , have been proposed be- common parlance , this has been called a seventh . In practice , also , the terms of the act have been set aside , and the seventh set off . In Lower Canada , hy a happy piece of official juggling , exposed in one of the special reports , appended to Lord Durham 's general Report , more than one fifth of the land , actually granted , has been , in many cases , set off , and as much as one fifth in all others . // txveen rival sects , to give them the power to seize and share the tempting spoil . Tricks more numerous still , have still ever been detected in time to defeat each proposed coalition and make the breach between the parties wider . The great body of the stancher liberals have long insisted on the devotion of these reserves to the advancement of general education , without distinction of religious creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect , have looked coolly on this project , and favored some scheme or other of religious distribution . To fill the cup to the brim , one of the last acts of Sir John Colborne , before his recall in 1835 , was the endowment of fifty-seven rectories of the English church out of these reserves . The legality of the act was long questioned ; but , after a long course of self-contradiction , the Home government seems at length to have acquiesced in it . Not so , however , the opponents of the church in Upper Canada . By them ( and on this branch of the question all , save the members of the sect , are in violent opposition ) there has been manifested but one feeling in regard to it , that of undisguised and increasing dissatisfaction . The present House of Assembly was chosen under circumstances of peculiar excitement , which threw this question into shade ; arid it has not , therefore , at all represented this public feeling . Its last act , - an act passed in a manner so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigue to which it is to be traced , - has been to re-invest the reserves in the Crown ; the partisans of the dominant church hoping thereby to gain from th5 Crown better terms than they could have got from the people . But the intrigue , however it may prosper for the hour , promises little for the future . The province is on the eve of a general election , and the reserve question is now again a prominent one . A new House of Assembly is tolerably sure to protest , and that strongly , against these dealings of its predecessor . We should have mentioned , en passant , that , pending all these controversies , the current proceeds of the reserves come into the hands of an ecclesiastical commission , and that the church of Scotland receives a meagre pittance in either province , and the richer church the large remainder . The reserves are now in process of sale , and the moneys paid for them are invested as the principal of a church fund . This disposition by no means tends to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-continued agitation of the subject . To turn to another topic . The precedents and modes of thinking of the old world did not stop short in their effects at this attempted union of Church and State . The same ignorance of the state and tendency of things in a new country , which alone could have led the framers of the colonial system of British America into the blunders we have been considering , betrayed them into many others of the same kind . A new country , for example , requires to have a constant stream of population poured in upon it from without , to develope its resources to any thing like their full extent and , for this purpose , its unsettled land must be kept in the market on such terms and in such a manner as shall present the utmost possible inducement to the settler to purchase and improve it . It is difficult to conceive a stronger exemplification of the unfitness of men merely conversant with the laws and usages of an old country , for the task of directing a grand operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land-granting department in these colonies . In this country , under the colonial regime , things were often had enough in this respect ; hut it seems as though the politicians of Europe had been learning backwards during all that time , if the sins of omission and commission since chargeable upon them are to he taken in evidence . It is *impossible here to give any adequate idea of the disclosures of the Durham Report , and its supplementary documents . They all speak the same language , however , as that which we have been applying to the case in its other aspects . A few great mistakes on the part of the Home government in the first place ; and then a long series of local frauds and malversations , so many , varied , and audacious , as to excite surprise , not less at the boldness of the Bureaucratic party 's devices to postpone their fellow-colonists ' interests , and the orders of their nominal masters of the colonial office , to their own fancied advantage , than at the easy ignorance on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things to he possible . We will give an example or two in illustration . One of the most glaring instances , perhaps , of mistake on the part of the Home government , is furnished in the early history of Prince Edward 's Island . Nearly the whole // of this most fertile island ( 1,400,000 acres ) was in this case alienated in a single day , in favor of a few individuals , resident in England ; who , in general , expressed no design whatever of settling personally on their grants . There were conditions annexed to the grant , binding the grantees to establish a certain number of settlers on the island within a fixed time , as well as to pay a certain quitrent . Neither condition was fulfilled ; and no serious attempt was made to enforce their fulfilment . The consequences to the colony , from its first establishment to this day , have been most serious . Another of these errors , and one far more extensive in the mischiefs it has produced , is that which inflicted on the Canadas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of its aspects . Aside from its effects in embittering civil and religious strife in these colonies , this system has led to results in the land department , so mischievous , that , were it even possible to keep out of view all its other consequences already spoken of , it would still merit to be classed among the most potent inventions the wit of man could have devised for retarding the advancement of a colony . For every grant of land , said the Constitutional Act , made by the Crown , by sale or otherwise , a reserve shall be set off " equal in value to one seventh of the land so granted . " The first idea obviously was , that all this land should be for ever held by the Crown for the church , or by the church for itself ; and that its improvement and cultivation should take place , as in the old world , through the agency of tenants at will or under lease . As any man , however , who knew any thing of an unsettled country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forthcoming . Some tracts of the reserves were leased , but only for a song ; and their holders did so little to improve them , that the prospect to the clergy for the second lease , was little better than for the first . But by far the greater part remained in its state of wilderness , producing not even so much as a nominal rent to the expectant clergy . Of late years , a system of sale and investment has been in operation , under an act of the Imperial Parliament ; but the process has been slow , and in many other respects open to objection . During all this period , in all parts of the two provinces , ( except only the old French Canadian districts of Lower Canada , ) these unreclaimed reserves have thus been kept back from settlement , interposed everywhere between the improved lands of the injured settlers . // To give some idea of the nature and extent of this dead weight on the industry of the hardy pioneers of civilization . For some time it appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of each grant , as clergy reserve ; these grants being commonly made in lots of two hundred acres each , and one seventh ( not one eighth ) of each being reserved . After a time , however , it became customary to set off in all parts of the country , as fast as it was surveyed , a seventh part of these two hundred acre lots ; and , in general , the reserved lots were separate from one another . Jn Lower Canada a system of very much the same character has prevailed , though with some aggravations . The whole extent of the reserves at the present time , exceeds three millions of acres , cut up into these fractional nuisances . But this system , though bad , could be made worse ; and those who were in charge of it were the men to make it as bad as it could be . Whether the original sin of the contrivance we are going to describe , rested with the Home authorities ' ignorance , or with our local Bureaucrats ' selfseeking short-sightedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think the latter . It has all the look of being a device of a local oligarchy , dependent for the continuance of their profitable power on the future increase of those revenues of which they might have the disposal , in the name of the Crown , and without reference to the Assembly . The public lands were held to be Crown property , and their revenues were sacred from popular interference . By what means the local officials were all this time quietly killing , for their own behoof , a large proportion of the geese which were one day to lay these golden eggs , we shall soon see . There was a plan for keeping enough of the geese alive , to supply at some future day , the revenue not absolutely necessary to their purposes then . If the Home government suggested it , the crime it committed was nothing to the blunder . The men who saw and knew its consequences , who hoped future profit from them , and therefore entered into , defended , and maintained a system which they could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first contrivers or not , are the men most to blame for it . Besides the seventh part of every township reserved in lots for the clergy , as a plague to the poor laity , a second seventh was reserved in the same way , for the future dispo // sal of the Crown ! Two lots out of every seven were thus kept for an indefinite time in wilderness , paying no tax , and yielding no revenue ; hut taxing the scanty population everywhere , with all the extra road-making &amp;c. , rendered necessary by this impoverishing separation of each settler from his neighbours . A luminous device , to make settlers loyal and religious , by putting Crown and clergy at every turn before their eyes , in the shape of uncleared woods and marshes , to plague and paul ) erize them . Pass we to another feature of this land system . The administration of the public lands was vested by the Home government in a few local officers for each colony , and the oversight of these men committed to the Executive Council thereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference in directing private grants , in addition to any that might be made by the Council , and a right ( for many long years , of course , tolerably inoperative ) of directing the Council 's proceedings , and , if necessary , reversing any of them . We need not do more than remind our readers of the composition of this Council , to prepare them to imagine the general tenor of their proceedings in virtue of this power . A single example , of a multitude which press forward for citation , must suffice . It is the earliest in point of time , and the foundation stone is a fair specimen of the building . The first instructions to the local executive of Lower Canada , on this subject , direct that , to avoid the evils of excessive grants , no settler should have more than two hundred acres granted him . To meet the special case of a settler with more than ordinary means for clearing land , the Governor was authorized at his discretion , to grant as much as one thousand more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nearly 1,500,000 acres would , under these instructions , have passed in a few years Linto the hands of a few officials and their friends , in quantities of from 10,000 to 50,000 acres each ? Yet so it was ; and the mode of accomplishing the trick was this . The influential claimant for such a grant would procure the required number of signatures , to a petition headed by his own name , praying the Governor and Council to grant each signer the two hundred or more acres that could legally be disposed of by them . Private bonds were at the same time entered into between the " leader ' * and his " associates " ( as the parties were commonly called ) , // stipulating for the immediate relinquishment by the latter of their mock grants , in favor of the former , for some consideration merely nominal . The grants were made with a full knowledge of this fact . Indeed , blank forms of the required bond , drawn up by no other hand than that of the provincial attorney-general of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will readliy be understood , first , that all these grants were free grants , fees excepted ; and , secondly , that hardly any of the land thus jobbed away , has been cleared in any degree by its grasping holders . The system produced the same kind of fruit everywhere . In 1826 , however , the Colonial Office interfered to check the abuses which had been growing up ; and , in 1831 , further and more efficient measures were taken to this end . A system of sale of lands by public auction was directed but still under regulations not altogether judicious , and which left a good many opportunities for evasion to its administrators . Among Lord Durham 's recommendations is one , which there appears no reason to doubt will be acted upon , for the complete reform of this whole department ; but our limits do not allow us to continue our remarks on this subject to the extent which would be required , to explain its principles and efficiency . Our readers can be at no loss to imagine the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads in the new districts , or the effect of the want of roads on the settlement of the country . Here , again , the Home government is chargeable with the sins of omission , rather than of commission . It has spent large sums on colonial improvements , but it has not taken care to have them expended in the most econOn ) ical and effective way . It has given the provincial authorities abundant legislative powers for them to have effected the construction of all the roads the country could need ; but it failed so to balance those authorities in the first instance agaiust each other , as to insure their discharge of that , or indeed of any other , public duty . One colonial party has jobbed in lands , so as to make roads in many districts almost impossible ; the other has too often jobbed in roads , so as to throw yet further obstacles in the way of the improvement of the country . We might apply the same remark to a variety of other topics , to the provision or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , for a rural magistracy , for the judiciary , and , more than all perhaps , for popular education . But our limits admonish us to pass to a subject , which can not possibly be overlooked or even very hastily discussed , if we would convey to our readers any idea of the true features of the whole case before us . The policy of the English Crown in guarantying their language and institutions to the descendants of the French Canadians whom it conquered , has already been noticed in its connexion with the history of the old colonies , now the United States . We have yet to glance at its effects within the present colonies of Great Britain ; and first , for the real character of the laws and customs thus perpetuated , and the measures taken to perpetuate them . The political system of the province was improved , beyond question , by the conquest . The complete military despotism of the French government was exchanged for a form of government , sufficiently arbitrary , it is true , hut still neither military nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony would have been an inestimable political boon , had it stood alone , which it did not . The first step taken by the British government was one , which , if it had been followed up in the spirit which appeared at first to dictate it , might have made the history of this continent read very differently from what it now does . In 1763 , a Royal proclamation invited settlers to all parts of the newly acquired territory ( comprising most of what is now British America ) , promising them for ever the enjoyment of laws as near as may be conformable * to those of England . The French law was abrogated , and the courts were enjoined to proceed on the principles of the English . The Governor was empowered to convene a Representative Assembly and it is a fact now not very generally known , that most of the elections to the proposed House actually took place accordingly . A difficulty as to the form of oath required for its Catholic members , alone , prevented it from meeting ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a representation of the impolicy of such a step in a newly conquered country with a foreign population . The Thirteen Colonies of course enjoyed the advantages of this invitation and these pledges . In fact , their officers and men , who had served in the war , were offered grants of land in Canada , if disposed to settle there . // But the disputes of the Crown with its old colonies soon led it to adopt the fatal policy of fostering all that was peculiarly French in its new subjects ; and in 1774 , the Act called the Quebec Act was passed , at its instance , by the Imperial Parliament . By this , the French civil law was restored to the province of Quebec , leaving the criminal law of England still in force ; and the government was permanently vested in a Governor and Legislative Council named by the Crown . This state of things lasted through the war of Independence , and till the passage of the Act of 1791 , which divided the Canadas and gave each province the constitution already described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Upper Canada ; but the French civil law was guarantied anew to Lower Canada , or rather to such parts of it as were held under the feudal tenure , - the system of land-granting in use under the French regime . The criminal law continued as before ; and the whole body of English law , indeed , was , by implication , to prevail everywhere , beyond the seigniorial portions of the province . Besides so much of the French civil law as was thus renewed in its operation over a part of the country , it will be remembered , that , with slight modifications , the laws and usages relative to the Catholic Church , and its endowments , had been guarantied by the earliest acts of the British Crown within the province . Beyond the seigniorial districts , as there were then no French settlements , and consequently no Catholic parishes , these laws and usages were inoperative . The assigned reason for this separation of the Canadas , was the desire of the British government of the day , to give each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own ; within which its own language and institutions should prevail , and where it should be left free to govern itself , and maintain or modify its laws , at its own pleasure . At the first glance , a project like this may seem statesmanlike enough ; but a very little closer examination will suffice to show the contrary . The object aimed at was unattainable and , had it not been so , its attainment would still have been on all accounts most undesirable . The means were as illchosen as the end ; not simply because they had no tendency to produce a result at all like that which we have just declared impossible ; but because the whole of the results which they had in fact an inevitable tendency to bring about , were mischievous // to the last degree . They delayed the collision of the races for a time ; only to make it longer and more severe when it should occur at last . They produced a state of things iii the mean time , which was far worse for both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural time , would have been , for the short period during which it would in that case have lasted . The policy of the United States , when they came into possession of Louisiana , was precisely the reverse of this . The statesmen who made the purchase of that territory , and had the ordering of its affairs immediately afterwards , well knew , that in an extensive country , where a popular government is to prevail , it is an object of the last importance to have for the whole a common language ; and an object only second in importance to this , to have a general similarity in the laws , institutions , and usages throughout even its most remote districts . To give the command of the Mississippi , the outlet of the great Western valley , to a community which should keep itself apart in speech and laws from the other States , was an idea never entertained . The difficulty , which the presence of a French population presented , was at once met and overcome . The simple process of extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Territory , requiring that the language of the United States should be that of its constitution and public acts , and throwing open its rich lands for settlement on equal terms to all comers , was enough . Every thing else has followed . Louisiana has become a State , with every privilege and power any other State possesses . She is as heartily American as any ; and , though the French language is not yet wholly superseded , no contest in regard to it , or effort to perpetuate it as a local language , is anywhere maintained . Her laws , though touched by no rude hand from without , have been thoroughly revised by herself ; the anomalies which a concurrent action of French and American legislation had produced in abundance in the practice of her courts* have been effectually removed ; and the code of Louisiana is a model which jurists of the old world have studied , and from which they have borrowed . The collision , in a word , was brought on at once , by the simplest and yet most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it has found vent within a narrow space , where it has done the smallest imaginable amount of // harm . A little legislative bickering , never carried beyond the State ; a harmless rivalry of municipalities , confined to the city of New Orleans ; and , in a few years , it is all but over . - Great Britain , for her Canadian experiment , had the advantage of us , in point of time , by many years . Perhaps she had an advantage too , in the superior facilities which her form of government afforded her , for governing her Territory as she pleased , while her fusion of the races should be going on , and till they should be sufficiently one people , and her own people , to he safely intrusted with self-government . She was wise enough to throw away her time . How much has it cost ? And how and at what cost can the time now be bought back again ? Was there any thing in the then position of the colony , to require that this course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian population numbered about 70,000 in 1791 , probably not 100,000 . What could have been easier than to have done with them at the first the little that was done in Louisiana , and then to have let things take their course ? The French Canadians are now 400,000 strong , perhaps more ; and no step has been taken yet towards assimilating them to the overwhelming majority who speak the English tongue in all directions round them . To dam up a river , though , is not to stop its source , or to make the rush of its waters , after they shall have burst the dam , useful or safe . It might not have been altogether easy in 1774 , for the government , which had then so embroiled the affairs of all the other colonies , to manage the experiment , had they been so minded . At each successive period the difficulty has been growing . And it has to be met at last . Setting aside , however , the principle of sameness of language and a general similarity of institutions throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Lower Canada , that they should have been recalled from the tomb of the Capulets , to linger through a fifty years ' semblance of renewed vitality ? Of the many antiquated systems of law which the French revolution blessed the French nation by sweeping from its courts , there was one which had prevailed over a fraction of the country , and was in no way favorably distinguished , that we ever heard , from any other abrogated by the Code . JVapohion . This was the " Coutume de Paris , a matter for an antiquary to amuse himself withal in // France ; a law for advocates to study , and judges to decide by , in Lower Canada . It is a curious fact , in how many of the colonies of Great Britain , laws of foreign origin , which their authors have long since abrogated , are to this day retained , just as the Couturne de Paris is retained in Lower Canada . Her old gift of conquering her neighbours ' colonies , has done strange service to the antiquary . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is peculiar to the Lower Canada courts . It was modified by edicts and ordinances of the French government , which never were of force beyond its limits ; and these are still the law of the land . The ordinances of successive English governors and their Councils come in again to affect this body of law . And last of all , the acts of the Provincial Parliament , and some special acts of the Imperial Parliament , contribute further to swell the confusion of principles , precedents , and rules , French , English , and Canadian , which pass current under the sobriquet of Civil law , in the Lower Province . The Criminal law is that of England in 1763 , with a few changes made in it by ordinances and provincial acts . The great reforms , which England has of late years made in it at home , are of no avail for her colony , which " might , could , would , or should " have made them for herself , if she had wanted them . We have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , as that which Mr. Pitt and his immediate predecessors entailed on Lower Canada , by the course they followed . Had they retained the whole French law of the colony , as the basis of its future code , - making in it at once a few necessary changes , so as to strip it of such features as were irreconcilable with English ideas of criminal procedure , - the result would at least have been a somewhat less confused chance-medley of conflicting principles . How could the criminal law of England harmonize with the real-estate , commercial , and other laws of a part of France ? * * In illustration , we may just remark , that the " Coutume de Paris " gives the fell force of a mortgage on a man s whole property , real and personal , to any written engagement he may make before a notary . The notary is the sole Custodier of all these papers . The French law had its penalties for abuse of the vast facilities this system gave for fraud . But the English law , knowing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two together , therefore , leave the Canadian notary to act in the premises as he pleases ! // Had the whole law of England been established , and the abrogation of the French code been made perpetual , the result would still in time have been a system of intelligible and practicable law . The transition would have been violent ; and some rights of I ) roperty would have suffered , while it was going on . But time would have effected it ; and in time its vexations would have been forgotten . In either of these cases , the courts and future legislature of the country might easily have been so constituted , ( by the exercise of an ordinary degree of foresight on the part of those who should create them , ) as to have performed this work gradually , indeed , but still effectively . As the case stood , the country was placed in a position , in which it was morally impossible for it to remedy the embarrassments of that position . We do not mean to say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into operation , side by side , prevented their fusion into one code applicable to the wants of the community . A general constitutional system , that should have worked well , might have overcome this difficulty ; but we have seen to some extent , what that of 1791 was in this respect . The ordinances passed before 1791 , had done very little to bring things into form . The laws enacted since have done , - we were on the point of saying , - nothing . The vision at any rate must be microscopic , that can see aught they have done , which would not have been much better left undone . We profess not to be learned in these cherished " laws and customs " of Lower Canada ; nor would we wish our readers so hard a fate as that of being forced to make themselves learned in them . * But we must not pass on without endeavouring to convey some faint idea of their necessary effect on all persons , matters , and things , subject to their sway . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , to a great extent , commercial , not merely because a commercial people , of English and American origin , have gained a footing in it , but because , from its command of the St. Lawrence , the trade of a great part of the continent must pass through it , must keep that commercial race on its soil , and must give them wealth there , and influence , and , in the end , numbers ; all laws and usages // of any uncommercial handful of men born there , to the contrary notwithstanding . Can a law , for example , which , along the whole course of the St. Lawrence , so far as it is directly open to the sea , would keep every acre of real estate suhject to the payment of a heavy tax , on all improvement , to a seignior who does nothing to improve it , - can such a law , by any skill of man , he kept in force for ever ? Yet there it is in force , in this thirty-ninth year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seigniorial tenure , is burdened with a yearly payment of a fixed irredeemable rental ( cens et rerdes ) , to the seignior , often light , but not unfrequently the reverse . Whenever it is sold , a txvelfth part of the * chase money is due to this same seignior , in the shape of lods et ventes . Thus , if a man buy land for $1,000 , and in a year or two improve or build upon it to the value of $20,000 , it will cost him a twelfth part of that snm to dispose of what he has just spent so much to get . If he had made no improvements , he might have sold again for the twelfth part of his first $1,000 , the cost at which his unimproving predecessor parted with it . Let an estate change hands often , and its whole value is soon gone , in successive twelfths to the do-nothing seignior . The seigniories extend all along both hanks of the St. Lawrence , and for miles back on each side , till we get beyond Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of the Richelieu almost to the province line , or outlet of Lake Champlain and for some distance up most of the other considerable rivers of the province ; in a word , everywhere , where trade and enterprise have the best field offered them by nature . there is a Jaw in force ( an act of the British Parliament by the way , and most vehemently complained against by the French Canadian Assembly ) providing a means for getting rid of this tenure ; but unluckily it put the cart before the horse , by requiring the seignior to move first in each case , and the said cart has stood remarkably still on the strength of it . There is an ordinance , too , just passed by the special Council , for the emancipation of the city and island of Montreal ; but , from some of its provisions , it may be doubted , whether the procedure under it will not prove much too tedious for the exigencies of the case . What those exigencies are , may be readily inferred from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very oldest European settlements on the continent , and with natural advantages probably inferior // to those of no other site in North America , New York and New Orleans hardly excepted , ranks with the third or fourth rate cities of the Union . By nature the seaport of a territory only less than the great valley of the Mississippi , having water-power easily available , - and enough to cover her island with the mills and factories it might keep at work , - with a denser rural population round her , than surrounds any other city on the continent for the same distance , and with no serious natural difficulty in the way of the extension of her trade in any direction whatever , - this city has a population of little more than thirty thousand souls , and the whole island on which it stands , thirty-two miles long and ten broad at its widest part , city and country together , numbers only about fifty thousand ! Does any one need further witness to convince him , that a result so striking is to he traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence enough in store for the most incredulous . What if it he harder still to borrow on the security of seigniorial land , than it is to sell it to advantage ! An acknowledgment of debt passed before a notary becomes , as we have observed , a binding mortgage on all a man 's real estate ; and , of course therefore , most creditors take good care to have one . These mortgages are not merely general , but secret . rVhe notary keeps the originals , and , as there is no office of registry where copies are to be filed , it is impossible to tell how many different notaries may hold the same man 's mortgages . On the death of a notary , his papers of this kind are deposited in a public office , and may be seen by parties interested ; but , during life , the notary acts under an oath of secrecy . An intending purchaser can thus , in no way , guess the incumbrances on the estate in treaty , except from the representations and supposed character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be inferred , when we add , that it is not merely the incumbrances the present holder may have brought upon the land , that are in question . Any uncancelled " acte " of any former holder will serve as well as one of yesterday . Such bonds are oftcn held back for years , so long as a poor man , who can not satisfy them , may continue in possession , and if , for any cause , a seizure and forced sale be thought inexpedient . The moment a new holder , who can pay , steps in , he is greeted with them , however , to a certainty . Arrears , too , of seigniorial dues , are held to be secured as by a mort // gage . By a sham seizure and sheriff 's sale , these claims may be brought out before purchase , or , if not brought out , cancelled ; and this course , therefore , though both costly and tedious , is the one in common use . But even this does not bar all claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laws about dower and inheritance ) by the widows , children , and children 's children of all who have ever held real estate ; the claims growing out of which neither sheriff 's sale nor time extinguishes . How is a man to buy , sell , lend , or borrow , with mill-stone laws like these about his neck ? Prices , credit , trade , - what meaning can the words have , where such a code furnishes the glossary ? The American reader , not conversant with the subject , may think that a representation like this must be overcharged . The Anglo-Canadian will feel and know , that it is the reverse . We have given an outline sketch of a part only of the picture . Could we add half the minor touches , which should go to a sketch of this part of the system as it exists in Lower Canada , and then proceed to show , how the other parts of the system all tend to make one another more intolerable , the representation would be rendered as much more faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the perpetuation of the French language , and the laws and usages co-existent with it , in Lower Canada , as a thing impossible ; and have said , that , if possible , the attempt to bring it about , would still have bcen , as it was , most unwise . Enough has surely been said , to establish both these positions . It remains , that we offer a remark or two on the measures taken with this design , and show , that they too were all that we have called them . It will not require much argument to do this . Whether we look to their inevitable tendencies , as regards the proposed English province of Upper Canada , or as it regards the English race in Lower Canada , or , finally , as regards the French themselves , we shall see them still in the same light , - ill-chosen means to an ill-chosen end . How then was it , that the authors of the Constitutional Act , intending to separate the two populations for ever , and give each its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , divided the country as they did between them ? From the St. Lawrence towards the Ottawa , the division line sets out along the southwestern boundary of the highest of the // French seigniorial grants ; and this reason alone was looked to in selecting it . It was forgotten , that the navigation of the St. Lawrence was broken hy a rapid , just above iNlontreal ; so that this arrangement , by giving that city to the Lower Province , left no seaport to the Upper . r1i0 be sure , if the island of Montreal had been given to Upper Canada , there would have been an end put , in another way , to the project of dividing the races and their systems ; for this island and city of Montreal formed a seigniory , inhabited chiefly by French Canadians , and the property of a Catholic ecclesiastical community . But , to show the weight of this objection to the line of demarkation selected . The two provinces had hut one natural outlet to the ocean , and that their only direct channel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal access to this common outlet , the mischief would have been less ; but , as it was , one of them had it all to herself . All goods imported for either province must be land*d in the Lower . The duties must be paid there . But Upper Canada paid part of these duties , and had a right therefore to part of the revenue . To how much , then ? Could the two colonies , one French and the other English , one collecting the whole revenue , and the other claiming part of it , the one which had the seaports uncommercial in its habits and laws , and that which was cut off from the sea commercial and maritime , - could these fail to quarrel ? But , besides the embarrassments of a revenue in common , they had those of a task in common too . The navigation of the St. Lawrence is impeded in both Provinces ; to a considerable degree , indeed , even below Montreal . Upper Canada must have water communication with the nearest seaport , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best communication possible with the distant sea . But let her expend her money as she might , on canals towards Montreal , Lower Canada must finish them , or they would be worth nothing ; and below Montreal , Lower Canada still must be the party to improve , or no improvement could be had . These two matters of dispute , accordingly , have been in agitation from the first . The Imperial Parliament has been forced to try its hand at the adjustment of the quarrel about revenue ; hut the award naturally made both parties more angry than ever . The improvement feud was // left to take its course ; and unprofitable it has been to both the parties to it . But the English in Lower Canada ! If their countrymen in the Upper Province had reason to complain , how much more had they ? They were not numerous in 1791 ; but their first settlement had been on the faith of a promise of English laws . Besides , their presence in the colony , and their comparatively rapid increase in wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unavoidable . Quebec and Montreal must have merchants , if only for the trade of Upper Canada ; and these merchants , as a class , must be English , for the French were not and would not be merchants , either to the extent or in the mode required . On the north bank of the Ottawa , too , was the chief supply of timber for the trade with Great Britain ; and the English merchants must have their full supply of it . These lands , too , had not been granted in seigniories to any distance up the river , and the English Crown now granted land in free and common soccage only . The French Canadians would not settle there , as it was beyond the hounds within which their laws were confined ; and thus an English population extending up the Ottawa must have part in Lower Canada . In fact , for this latter reason ( which everywhere made the French keep near their old settlements ) , a population of the other race was sure to settle more or less rapidly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of them . A great part of this population was equally sure to be of American origin . The townships * first surveyed , were along the frontier of the United States ; and these soon began to be settled from the southward . At a later period the tide set in from Ireland and Great Britain . It was just as certain , moreover , that the race speaking the English tongue must be , for a long series of years , a small minority under the system set in operation , as it was that it must all the while be present in the colony . How then was this race to fare , with the French law we have been describing in force over all the French part of the country , the validity of the English law , for many long years , called in question , as regarded the remainder , and an overwhelming French majority The land , granted in free and common soccage , was set off in " town . ships " of some one hundred square miles each . The division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , the basis of a municipal system . // 422 to maintain their own laws , without change , in their own territory , and to struggle for their extension over the whole province , simply because they were the laws , of all others , fitted to keep it , the said rival race , out or under ? And the French , - with Upper Canada thus hostile from without , and this English minority ( steadily advancing in numbers and wealth , as compared with themselves , ) hostile within , to all which they were indulged with the seeming power of perpetuatiug ,  --  what were they to do ? Their province set off on purpose to give them this power , were they not sure to make the attempt to exercise it ? If so , was not this , again , sure to embitter the hostile rivalry of the races , in a sort of geometrical progression ; till at length all other questions ,  --  of Bureaucrat or Liberal , - of reform in law or government , - of local improvement , taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fairly lost sight of in the meUc , and be merged in the one war of race and language ? From this hasty review of the chief causes which have been at work to produce confusion in the British American colonies , we pass to speak in few words of their results . And here our notice must be more hasty still . The facts are too many to be cited one by one ; or the proof could be made clear to moral demonstration , that all we have been saying of the tendencies of the system , may be truly said of its results . We have not the space even to present a full summary of those results , as they differ in different colonies . A remark or two on the state of parties in each , is all we can venture upon . In Newfoundland , then , the controversy is , in the main , that of a popular party against a Bureaucracy ; though this is certainly not its sole feature . The great hulk of the community is Catholic ; most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The religious element accordingly enters largely into the feelings of each party . In general , the merchants residing near the seat of government , side with the administration against the House . The constitution has been but a short time in being ; and the struggle under it is at its height . The Colonial Office , however , has made a number of concessions to the assailants of the local government . In Prince Edward 's Island , the all-absorbing question grows out of the ownership of the soil ; the resident population endeavouring // to tax the non-resident owners of the greater part of the island , that it may compel them to improve or sell the land , which they are at present holding in waste to the great detriment of the colony . The owners being mostly men of wealth and influence in England , and the colony small , the former have been able till of late to make their representations pass current at the Colonial Office . An arrangement , however , as to the sale and taxation of these lands , is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - by which the question will be satisfactorily settled as regards the colonists . The Bureaucratic quarrel has never risen to any height in this little island . Nova Scotia has been the scene of a long and tolerably warm dispute between the official and popular bodies . In strength the two for a time were nearly equal ; the Bureaucratic party at the outset having in some respects more than the usual quantum of local influence . Though the party hostile to it are a majority in the House , the minority siding with the officials is still respectable in numbers . The urgent representations of the House have gained for its party some most decided advantages ; and , though changes are not yet made to the extent demanded , it is clear , that , if the popular party can maintain its hold on the Assembly , every thing will shortly follow that it requires . The question of highchurch has been already spoken of , as respects this colony . It has had more influence here , perhaps , than in New Brunsxvick . The adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated by the Bureaucratic dispute but the complete triumph of the popular party has for some time made the state of things quite different . The leaders of the majority in the House now act in harmony with the Councils , in consequence of the changes made in the composition of the latter . In Nova Scotia , these changes did not go far enough to produce this result , and the Councils are not at one with the House , though their disputes are now far from violent . Indeed , as a general remark , we may observe , that in these three provinces there has never been a manifestation made by any party , however small , of the feeling of disaffection , as contrasted with that of temporary dissatisfaction . The present lieutenant-governors are all esteemed ; and those of // New Brunswick and Prince Edward 's Island are decidedly popular , and have every prospect of continuing to be so . Even in Newfoundland , the most violent of the opposition strongly disclaim every thing like disaffection to the mother country . Of the six provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . Her Bureaucracy were at first naturally of English origin ; the conquered French population being then of necessity excluded generally from office . For years , however , the national element of the dispute remained in the shade , though the office-holders were still mostly of the origin of the minority , and their conduct in office was any thing but unobjectionable . The French majority were not the material for displaying political activity ; and their representatives , therefore , though from the earliest period rejecting all demands for change urged by the English minority , were not for a long time found arrayed in active hostility to those individuals of that minority , who stood before as " de par le Roy . " When the transition to active hostility took place , the more efficient popular leaders were generally English , * who acted with the French against the officials , and hoped to induce the French to abandon their inert opposition to all improvement , so soon as the incubus of the Bureau should have been thrown off . A great portion of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned to the officials , from an opposite impression . In process of time , however , as the officials lost ground , these English allies of the majority party became disgusted at the unequivocal manifestations which were made , of a determination on the part of those French leaders , who always carried the great body of their countrymen with them , to adhere to the cherished project of French nationalit6 ; and the English leaders , one by one , fell off from the side of the Assembly . The official party , now weakened and in fear for their craft , sought to throw themselves into a semi-alliance with the English minority ; and thus the dispute gradually changed its real character , while in form , and professed objects , it remained much the same as ever . Not aware of the true nature of the contest , the English Liberal government sought , by yielding , in sub- Under this term we include here ( and elsewhere in speaking of Lower Canada ) all who use the English tongue ; Americans , Scotch , and Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every claim urged by the French party , as a popular demand against a Bureau oligarchy , - to stay the controversy . But this was oil , not water , to the flame . The French were only emboldened ; the English only exasperated . The former , throwing off the mask , daily more and more , put forward demands that could not have been granted , without the consequence of driving the latter to absolute desperation . Revolt , indeed , began to be threatened , by many of the English , as inevitable , on their part , if such demands were granted . The government , as it could not but do , refused to yield further . The French leaders openly declared revolution to be their object . Suspicious alike of the Bureaucracy , the Home government , and the French , the English generally held back for a time , as though doubtful what course to take , in a dilemma so perplexing . After a time , the instinct of self-defence forced from them an uncertain note of preparation , as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 1837 , when the arrest of a few of the French leaders threw the party into insurrection , a few weeks sooner than the time at which they had proclaimed their determination to resort to it , the whole English population was in arms on the instant for its suppression . The consequences are well known . Lord Durham 's Report goes at great length into the subject of this war of races , and shows most conclusively , by a variety of considerations , that the grand features of the case are as we have Just stated them . That a few English names should be found on the revolutionist side , proves nothing against it . The names so found , are none of them names of the rank and file . The community , speaking the English tongue , suppressed ( or by their support enabled the government promptly to suppress ) the insurrection . It stands aloof from the - officials still ; and from the Home government too ; - from the former , as much as ever ; from the latter , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are openly at variance . With all this , however , the attachments of English , Scotch , and Irish , almost without exception , are , to all appearance , as warm as ever to their country and the connexion with Great Britain . The coolness of their feeling towards the government is purely a result of the French struggle , and the recollections and suspicions it keeps alive . The French and their feelings , it is not so easy to describe // in few words . As the English are united in nothing but hostility to whaL is French , so are the leading men of the French in nothing but hostility to what is English . There is , however , this marked contrast between the two . Of the former , nearly all take sides and express opinions of their own , and hence arise differences of sentiment , which extend to all classes ; among the latter , it is the few , only , who attempt this , and the great body simply follow the lead of those from among that few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few who are more moderate , are without followers . The character and position of the race , however , we can not here describe , further than we have already done incidentally . The subject requires much more space than we can here give , to explain it fully . rrhe contest , in Upper Canada , has been of a less equivocal character , than in Lower ; although , here , too , ( as Lord Durham 's Report conclusively shows , ) there has been a strong under-current of semi-national controversy . The tide of immigration has been strong from the old world ; and the feelings of the old and new residents of the province have been , on several accounts , the reverse of cordial . Besides this circumstance , which has divided the population of Upper Canada everywhere , the form and size of the province are such , as to cut it up into a number of separate localities , each with its own little centre of party feeling and opinion . This , again , has tended to divide the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction . The Clergy reserve question has embroiled matters , and divided parties further . And , lastly , the extent of the country , by the facilities it has given the Bureaucracy , for the multiplication of offices of petty trust , profit , or distinction , in all quarters , and for land and other jobbing in general , has still added fresh strength to that faction . The same causes have thrown more than ordinary temptations in the way of the Assembly ; and it can not be denied , that it has often yielded to them . The consequence has been , that , for a length of time , the rival parties have had alternate sway in the Assembly ; one election going for the one , and the next , almost always , for the other . The struggle was thus necessarily longer , and , in its effects on the legislation and general welfare of the province , as well as on the temper of all the parties to it , far more mischievous , than in any other province , Lower Canada excepted. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as LieutenantGovernor , the popular party were in the ascendant . Sir John Colborne had just been recalled , on their representations ; and his successor came with instructions to concede almost every thing they had asked . These instructions were made public , and gave satisfaction to most of the reform party . The Executive Council was remodelled , as an earnest of their approaching fulfilment . But Sir Francis quickly got himself into trouble with his new Council , by performing important acts , not only without its knowledge , but against the known principles of its new members . The Council complained , and demanded to be consulted on the whole business of the administration , or not at all . They were dismissed , and Sir Francis appointed a new Council . The Assembly took part with the dismissed Councillors , and stopped the supplies . The Governor dissolved the House the chances of a general election were tried ; and the result was the return of a great majority of members hostile to the party lately in the ascendant . A numerous body had seceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Francis 's instructions , that , if allowed his own course , he would , in the end , do all that the province really needed , and others alarmed at what they thought the precipitancy of a portion of their old associates . Sir Francis , too , had entered the lists openly as a partisan . His liberal instructions had been appealed to , and the designs of the majority in the late Assembly declared revolutionary . The candidates in opposition to them , stood forward on the hustings in the garb of Constitutional Reformers , as opposed to Revolutionists . The real cause of the quarrel ( the question of a responsible Executive Council , an old demand of the popular party , ) was thus almost wholly overlooked ; and the result , a great many at the time imagined to be a defeat of a grand revolutionary project . But the " sheep 's clothing** was not slow to fall off . The new House , with the old Legislative Council , took ground against the " instructions , " under cover of which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of his having gained a " mighty moral triumph , " and surrounded by a Council too well pleased with the gifts of office to be troublesome under their dispensation , became , from that day to the day he left the province , the devoted partisan // and servant of the old official party . The Colonial Office held back and showed displeasure ; but the Toronto officials knew their advantage and their man , and kept the field with exemplary pertinacity . At length , however , Downing Street patience was worn out , and Sir Francis was recalled , or , which amounted to the same thing , obliged to leave his post . The demonstration was not quite in time . His rashness had enticed a fraction of the ci-devartt reform party into insurrection , and had done all that the folly of one man could do , towards securing the insurgents the sympathies of all parties in this country , and the boon of a foreign war besides , to give effect to them . The insurrection in Upper Canada has had the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to its real insignificance . Its defeated leaders , of course , magnified it in this country ; the party , of old their bitter enemies in the province , have done the same thing there ; the former to gain sympathy among our citizens ; the latter to throw popular odium upon the whole body of those who have been active as their opponents , in the province , by representing them as extensively implicated in a rebellion . The truth is , that the Head election , and its immediate consequences , for a time disorganized the old reform party . The men who had left them on the occasion of the former , did not at once return on account of the latter . A large body , too , of those who had fought hard for the party at the elections , held aloof from politics in angry mortification , from the time their results were made known . And thus the least reflecting and judicious , with a good many others , the more unprincipled of the party , were left to the very indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as little gifted in any of these respects as themselves , to guide , or make believe guide , the whole . The prospects of the general election , now on the eve of taking place , may readily be inferred . The Durham Report , recommending all that the more temperate reformers ever called for , - the bitter disappointment of the Head experiment of abandoning those claims , - in a word , we might say , the history of the last four years , - can not be without effect . Nor does it appear , from present indications , that they will be . All seems to promise a reappearance of the liberal party on the field , in stronger force and under better auspices than // at any former time . But we are digressing from the line of remark we had laid down to ourselves . Of Lord Durham 's administration in the Canadas , and its abrupt termination , we do not propose at this time to speak . It is not a subject to be dismissed with a slight notice , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case ( as between the ex-governor-general , the British ministry , and his and their political antagonists ) so as to present any thing like an adequate view of its true merits to our readers , without having first given them at least as much preliminary information as we have just been giving . And it would occupy us at least as much more space as that which we have already occupied , to do so now . His Lordship 's recommendations for the future government of British America must meet universal approval , wherever they are known , among our people . In the provinces , cut up as parties are by causes of dispute of all kinds , a like unanimity can not be expected yet , in regard to them . But they must , ere long , combine in their support all lovers of good , popular , and stable government , there also . The signs are not inauspicious in this respect . To remedy the evils growing out of the national feud in Lower Canada , his Lordship recommends , that that colony be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to throw the French race into a minority ; securing them , at the same time , from every thing like oppression at the hands of the new majority . He would give them their full weight in the representative body ; would unite them , not merely with Upper Canada , but , as soon as possible , with the Lower Provinces too , where no feeling of hostility to them can be said to prevail ; and by committing to every locality the utmost extent of power , for local government , that can safely be delegated to it , would , in fact , place their own concerns , after all , in their own hands , taking from them only the unreal mockery of a power to direct those of the other race . Easier terms than these , they can not hope for from any party whatever , and have no right to ask . Harder , there is no good reason for any party 's wishing to impose . This general union of British America , with the proposed subdivision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a scheme which , as its author proposes to carry it into effect , promises the most essential // improvements of every kind . It would break up the little oligarchies of each province , would sweep away the thousand petty causes of feud which their influence has fostered or occasioned , would give a new and sufficient field for the full developement of the energies of the whole people , in the future government and improvement of their newly created country , and would hold out a reasonahle prospect of their future avoidance of those errors , which have till now so fatally contributed to impede their prosperity . To this new province , Lord Durham would give , in substance , an entirely new constitution . The Legislative Council he would reform , by placing such restrictions on the power of appointing to it , &amp;c. , as should be most likely to insure the respect of the province at large for its opinions . And the Executive Council he would so remodel , as to have it consist of Heads of Departments , responsible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - except , that , on matters not purely provincial , they would , of course , not be competent to decide and act , without reference to the Imperial Parliament and ministry . The Governor would thus become , in fact as well as in name , the representative of the Crown . The internal affairs of the province , he would be required to administer , through a Cabinet commanding the confidence of its people and their representatives . Imperial interference would be limited to that comparatively small number of cases , in which an interest , strictly Imperial , might be at stake . It is to this , more than to any other measure Great Britain can adopt , that she is destined to be indebted , if at all , for the lasting preservation of her Colonial Empire . It is the sine qud non of colonial prosperity , content , and consequent adherence to her fortunes . Lord Durham 's proposed reforms extend to a variety of other subjects , indeed to all , which an Imperial enactment could possibly affect . Much must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is , as we have observed , the grand feature of the Report , that it insists on the unreserved grant to the province , of the power of hereafter acting ( with the prospect of being able to act wisely ) for itself . V/e would it were in our power to say , that the measures proposed by the British government are identical with these recommended measures . They savour of weakness , - weakness of two kinds ; the one growing out of the state of // parties in England , the other out of that inherent defect in the constitution of the colonial office , to which we have so often adverted . Between the fear of the Tories at home , and the back-stairs influence of the oligarchists in the colonies , the best features of the Durham Report have no place in the ministerial plan . The union the government proposes , is a mere union of the Canadas ; and the measure of measures , the dii'ect establishment of responsible government , is to be sought in it in vain . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minor reforms are well enough in their way ; but they are not enough here . The new wine can not be kept in the old bottles . But this , too , is a subject we must dismiss , without venturing to enter on questions involving so much discussion . One remark , and we have done . The ministerial measure , it must be remembered , is a mere suggestion . The same weakness , which has made it defective , has prevented the government from attempting to force it through Parliament . The colonies are consulted . Let us hope , that their voice will be expressed so unequivocally , as to lead to its effectual amendment . If the people of the interested colonies fail to make their voice heard , in such a cause , we can only say , they deserve the consequences , be they what they may . In a case thus abounding with difficulties and embarrassments , and pending the discussion by those most interested , of what so deeply interests them , what course should those pursue , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of good-will to their neighbours oblige them to take ? Had they better leave the case for those who must , to their own cost , he troubled with it , to decide ? Or had they better , by uncalled-for interference , embroil their affairs tenfold worse than ever ? Would charity , because it sees the ship in danger , and needing all the best and coolest efforts of her crew , fire into her shells and rockets , to distract those efforts , and insure , so far as in them lies , the triumph of those elements of danger by which she is surrounded ?
