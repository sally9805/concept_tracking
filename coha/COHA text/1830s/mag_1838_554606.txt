txt IT has often been considered as a singular phenomenon in the literary history of Italy , that a people remarkable for lively and inventive genius should have accomplished so little in the department of Historical Romance . Nor has the surprise , generally felt upon this subject , been diminished by a more attentive examination of the history and literature of this nation ; the one abounding with romantic incident and striking developments of wild passion and strongly marked character ; the other , rich in accurate and powerful descriptions of real events , and still richer in fascinating pictures of the most enchanting creations of the imagination . Nature too would seem to have performed her part , in the character which she has imprinted upon the scenery of the country , and in the materials of romantic embellishment , which she has interwoven , which a lavish hand , in every line of its varied features . Plains , mountains , and quiet valleys ; wild torrents , and broad , majestic streams ; gigantic fragments , which carry the mind beyond the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of that history which the long lapse of agcs has made romance for us ; an air , whose breath calls forth every latent seed of poetry , and gives a charm even to the monotony of daily life ; these are // among the features of romance which nature has scattered over the external aspect of the country . And still deeper are the principles which she has implanted in the hearts of its inhabitants . How then has it come to pass , that they have accomplished so little , where every thing would seem to promise the highest success The character , which the literature of every nation assumes , from the first moment of its formation , depends upon a variety of local and incidental causes . Its strongest traits , those which it preserves through every period of its revolutions , will necessarily be derived from the peculiarities of national character ; and the same causes , which contribute to the formation of the one , will act constantly and effectually upon the other . It is thus that climate and natural scenery acquire their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forming as it were the shade and coloring of its pictures . It is thus , also , that the political situation of every country , or , more properly speaking , its political character , takes a part in that of its literature , and is manifested with more or less fulness in all its literary productions . Language too comes in for its share in this general formation , and while it borrows many of its peculiarities from those of the minds that employ it , communicates to them , in turn , a portion of its own original spirit ; like the stream , which , in part , derives its beauty or its grandeur from that of the landscape through which it flows , and at the same time shares with that landscape its own distinctive features , softening its beauty , or adding new majesty to its grandeur . The influence of these causes may be considered as general , and can easily be traced in the early history of every literature . Others , scarcely less important , were peculiar to the revival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing upon our subject , as the direction which the three great men , by whom this revival was accomplished , gave to the studies of their contemporaries , and through them to those of the following century . First among them was Dante , who came at once to guide and be guided by the passions which were in action around him . In him the romantic gallantry of the Troubadours was refined into the pure and devoted love that led to the deification of his Beatrice . The subtile metaphysics of the schoolmen were elevated to the profound and sublime , though often obscure and extravagant , theology of the " Paradiso " ; while the // virulence of party had no small share in the judgments which suggested the terrific descriptions of the " Inferno . " Dante , in short , or rather the form which his genius assumed , was in a great measure the consequence of the character of his age , and of the general causes to which we have already alluded . But the inspiration , which he had derived from these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commedia " became the model of all those , who aimed at the higher flights of poetry ; and , as is ever the case , the streams which were thus drawn forth , and taught to flow , by art , ran slow and silently hy the side of those which had sprung from deep natural sources . Similar in kind , though not in degree , was the influence of Petrarca . Never had romantic passion been sung so sweetly ; never had gallantry and love been so blended ; never had philosophy and nature been so lavish of their treasures , the one to describe passion , the other to illustrate and adorn it . A soft , bewitching charm floated around the " Canzoniere " ; and is the contemporaries and successors of Petrarca listened to the melody , each , like the Passions at the cave of Music , seized the lyre and sought " To prove his own expressive power . " It was not by verse that Boccaccio formed his school . But a prose whose frill , harmonious flow approached the varied melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to every subject , while , in truth , it raised the lowest subjects to its own standard , veiling the coarseness of vulgar details , and giving an irresistible attraction to the most harrowing descriptions , by the charm of words and idioms , grave or gay , thrillingly powerful , or gracefully expressive , and everywhere so appropriate , that five centuries of constant study have produced nothing more perfect ; this was the art by which the father of Italian prose won so large a train of disciples into the path which he had opened . The school of Boccaccio , though not so large as that of Petrarca , was larger and more durable than that of Dante . rrlie Tales , or " Novellette , " which he carried to the highest point of perfection , still form an integral part of Italian literature ; and there are few of its great prose writers who have not drawn from this fountain as from the purest source of eloquence . Such was the direction first given to Italian literature . The three great men , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the foundation of another school , whose // effects may be traced throughout every period from the days of Dante to our own times . We mean the classic school . The veneration , which they felt and invariably manifested for the ancient classics , fell little short of religious devotion . But the study of these pure models of taste and eloquence was pursued with a spirit , worthy both of the disciple and of the master . It was not a mere poetic fiction , which represented Virgil as the guide of Dante . Every step , which the Italian of the Middle Ages took in the three realms of the catholic creed , was directed by the spirit of his master . Who that studies the " Divina Commedia , " even in those passages , where the poet , entangled in the web of his theology , strives to explain what can not he t*xplained , and almost succeeds , by the force of language , in giving form and reality to the subtile distinctions of his school of metaphysics , can deny that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to words that magic and long-forgotten power ? And although in reading the Latin works of Petrarca , we may often find it difficult to believe that Cicero and Virgil were the avowed models of his style , yet the grace , the harmony , and the polished correctness of his Italian verses , clearly show how much his taste had been elevated and refined by his familiarity with the Latin classics . But with their followers this study was degraded into a servile imitation of manner , and a dry analysis of forms . They had no knowledge of that imitation , which refines the taste , without fettering the action of the mind , which shows where and how the forms of one work may be adapted to another , and transfuses , as it were , the spirit of ancient beauty into productions which bear all the characteristics of their own age . But although the scholars of this class accomplished but little in real literature , their labors were far from being destitute of utility . The sixteenth century showed , that , however dry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a great and direct advance . The men , who so successfully resumed the work , commenced by the three great writers of the fourteenth century , were like them endowed with that original genhis , which , while it avails itself of all that has been accomplished by others , creates more than it borrows , and gives even to the ideas and inventions of other men an air of originality and a coloring of its own . They were deeply imbued with the classic spirit , which prevailed in all the studies of the age ; hut they partook of it as their masters had done . // Style , elegance of description , elevation of philosophy , polish of language , all were classic ; but the subjects and tone of their works were modern and original . The metrical romances , which Ariosto carried to that pitch of perfection , which has justly made it doubtful to whom the laurel of Italian epic belongs , were more numerous than the imitations of Dante , or of l3occaccio , or in short of any class except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Visions , of Lyric Poetry , of Prose Tales , and of Metrical Romances , the genius of Italy found sufficient variety in forms of its own invention , to employ all its powers . When , finally , the example of Tasso had shown how well the ancient epic could be adapted to the spirit of modern poetry , and when the revival of comedy and tragedy had begun to excite the emulation of all classes of writers , nothing hut a very peculiar combination of circumstances could have led to the invention of a new branch of literature . Such a combination was far from taking place . Italy had long ceased to be a nation . The great interests , the strong feelings , the ardent aspirations after freedom , which had preceded the first revival of letters , had disappeared ; or , where they still continued to exist , hut added new force to that truth , already too evident , that individual virtues , when foreign to the age , serve but to call down contempt and misery upon those , who were formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nation , which had hitherto been the guide of Europe , then became , in part , the humble follower of her own disciples . Translations , imitations , and servile copies , succeeded to original creations in almost every department ; and the corruption , extending to the language , seemed to threaten her literature with total destruction . Yet this very period gave rise to some of her choicest works in history and in science ; and some of the brightest names in the scientific history of Europe are to be found among the Italians of this degraded epoch . The musical drama also , as every reader of Metastasio knows , from a merely idle recreation , became a branch of permanent literature , no less fascinating from the charms of its verse , than instructive by its truth to nature . Tragedy , comedy , and satire in its more extended and artificial form , though each can boast but a single name , were carried to a very high point of perfection . There has been no time , therefore , in which Italy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , and has not made some progress in creative liter*iture . But , at the same time , there has been a constant tendency toward the formation of particular schools , and , except in the case of those great men , who , however they may be situated , strike out a path for themselves , a strong disposition to follow in the beaten track of some well-known guide . The true source of this must be sought rather in the political condition of the country , than in the natural character of the Italians . But it is in this tendency , that we must seek for one of the causes of the constant neglect of the fuller historical novel , which although contemporary with the " Divina Commedia , " first appeared in so rough or rather uninviting a form , as to hold out no attractions for men capable of relishing the superior beauties of the different writers , whose names we have had occasion to repeat so often . This applies only to those writers of the second class , by whom in every country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have kept back the higher order of men from this attractive field , lie still deeper in the character and history of the people . The first of these we shall merely allude to , without venturing to enlarge upon it . It is found , we are at a loss whether to say , in the peculiar cast , or in the absolute want of society . Here , as in some other cases , the general fact is apparent , but can only be illustrated by those who have made profound and extensive observations , with the advantages which no foreigner has , to our knowledge , ever obtained , of a free admission into Italian circles . The second , and one which seems to us to have contributed more than any which we have hitherto mentioned , to retard , and perhaps render impossible , the success of the novelist in Italy , is the peculiarly romantic character of Italian history . Of the romantic cast of its scenery and of its people we have already spoken . The peculiar relations in which Italy has stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different states of her own territory , during the most important periods of her history , have brought these materials into play , in a manner which has left nothing to be done by the warmest imagination . In the place of one people , united under the same government and impelled by the same motives , we find the whole population divided into rival states . Where the craggy // peaks and wild fastnesses of the mountains offered a shelter for crime , or a secure retreat for feudal pride , the bandit built his tower , or the noble his castle . Amid the fertile plains of Lombardy , along the banks of the streams which roll their waters to the Mediterranean or to the Adriatic , the combined exertions of a bold and hardy populace had erected the walls of their independent cities . In none of these situations did the current of life flow smoothly . The robber traced from his watch-tower the movements of the inhabitants of the plain or valley , and hastened to plant his ambuscade at the first turn of the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passes which his castle commanded , or , when least expected , descended with a train of daring vassals to carry destruction to the fields and sometimes even to the gates of the wealthy cities , which he coveted and despised . In these , in place of the bustling , cheerful , regular movement of industrious citizens , the cares of business and the turmoils of faction were wildly blended . Each house was a fortress , each street the field of innumerable conflicts . Commerce itself was a constant warfare ; and the fleet , that sailed for trade , went armed for resistance or for conquest . Thirst of wealth , ambition of power , party spirit excited to exasperation , and public jealousy ripened to the profoundest hatred , all that passion has of virulent and cruelty of terrific , were found in the events of those ages . The bloody contests , which prevailed in the free cities , and gave to the daily life of every citizen the fearful excitement and uncertainty of war , would almost sicken us at the terrors of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the inhuman ferocity which suggested the pastimes of a Visconti , present such pictures of the excesses of tyranny , as would dispose us to choose any state rather than be exposed to the capricious jealousy of individual l ) ower . But when the mind shrinks , loathing and horror-struck , from the contemplation of these scenes , and is ready to deny the value of descriptions which seem to l ) resent nothing but a repetition of unnatural crimes , interest of another kind , characters of a different cast , arrest its attention , and fix it upon these pages of blood . Amid the merciless contests of faction , and at the side of remorseless tyranny , patriotism assumes a form and a power , which circumstances less trying could never have developed . The wild energy of the poetry and sublime daring of the architecure we still admire , were caught from the events and neces // sities of those times ; and it was by that terrific conflict of barbarous passions , that human nature was redeemed from the debasement of the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has enabled us to judge with so rigid a justice the virtues and the vices of her infancy . To whatever portion of Italian history we direct our attention , we shall find the same powerful and romantic developement . Ferrucci , the final hope of Florence in her last , long struggle for freedom , sinking beneath the sword of his assassin , and calmly replying to the blows with which a savage hatred vented its fury , " Thou but strikest a dead man ! " would furnish a no less striking character for romance , than young Corradino renouncing the charms of power and ease , to reclaim at the point of the sword the heritage of his fathers , and paying upon the scaffold the penalty of his daring and of his virtues . What might not be made of the life of Filippo Strozzi , whose mind presented the two extremes of elevation and of debasement , as his history was marked by those of prosperous and of adverse fortune ? Or where can we look for richer materials than we find in that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong passions , and variety and grandeur of enterprise , combine to form a history that would task the ablest pen ? Were the composition of historical romance as easy as we are apt to suppose ; were it so light a task , as at the first glance , it appears , to combine the truths of history with the creations of imagination , in such a manner as to reproduce and illustrate the events of distant and interesting periods , the circumstances which seem to render Italian history so favorable to fiction , would really prove what they seem . But it is in fact an undertaking , which requires the highest exertions of the most gifted minds . Its basis is truth ; and history must be thoroughly and skilfully studied . Its illustrations are those general traits of character and those every-day occurrences of life , which , though so deeply rooted in our nature as to be renewed in every age , are yet so flexible and subtile in their details , that they adapt themselves to and mingle with the leading characteristics of each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn from the carefully gathered stores of an observant and reflecting mind , and so disposed , as to act , at the will of the writer and with the full force of his art , upon the fancy , the judgment , or the heart . // When an Italian , possessed of power equal to such an undertaking , enters upon the study of his native history with a view to illustrate it , he can not long hesitate concerning the course which he should choose . For him , more than for any other writer , is the composition of history a task of deep responsibility . He is responsible to the ages that are gone , for the manner in which he repeats their lessons of awful warning . He is responsible to posterity , for the weight which every word he writes , every character he paints , will throw into the scale of their happiness or of their misery ; aiding to forge the fetters that are to bind , or to work out the freedom that is to gladden them . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account that he must render them ; and well does he know , that as he suffers his mind to be swayed by the passions of his own times , he is preparing for himself the suspicions and the hatred either of his government , or of his countrymen at home ; a garret in Paris , or a dungeon in Speilberg . Taking up his pen with such feelings and with such prospects , it is hardly possible for an Italian of genius to fix upon romance rather than history , as the medium of communication with his contemporaries , and with that posterity , upon which , more than the writer of any other country , be is dependent for his reward . Every step he takes , in the course of his researches , confirms this decision . The chronicles and documents , which supply his materials , contain pictures and descriptions of so striking and dramatic a cast , that he feels as it were transported , by the simple and energetic language of the writer , to the very scene which he is describing . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , he repeats the tale with that magic power of narrative and description , which raises Italian history , in this particular , above that of every other nation . Another circumstance , wholly dependent upon the political situation of Italy , concurs with these in retarding the progress of the historical novel , if it should not rather be considered as opposing an insuperable obstacle to its success . We are fond of speaking of the ennohling and refining influence of literature , and of the glory of renouncing the coarser occupations of life for those elevated pursuits , which extend the sphere of our actions and of our influence to the remotest posterity . That these sentiments really do mingle with the varied motives 1*OL . XLvT . NO. 99. 43 // which guide the pens of a large proportion of writers , is a truth that we should be loth to deny . That one still purer , the love of literature for itself ; the delight which every creative genius must experience in contemplating those forms of beauty , which arise under its own hand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward from link to link in the great chain of moral and physical truth , which binds this vast system of the universe ; that these motives still continue to act upon some minds , and will go on purifying the spirit of literature , is so fascinating , so winning a belief , that we should dread to find it untrue . But it can not be denied that motives of a very different cast are at least as often listened to , as any of those , which have so long ( and might we not say , so vainly ? ) formed the ideal perfection of literary character . The sacrifice of permanent glory to the thirst for immediate applause is not peculiar to our own , nor to any times . It has acted with more or less power in all ages , and often upon the highest , as well as upon the lowest order of minds . It has assumed different aspects , adapted to the nature and to the necessities of the moment . It has sacrificed poetry to the corruptions of a false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has made eloquence the vehicle of corruption , and rendered satire subservient to the littleness of personal malice . The duties which literature imposes have been neglected ; the deep responsibilities of genius have been forgotten ; and here , as everywhere , where reputation becomes the sole end of our exertions , each aspirant has stripped himself for the contest without a thought beyond the prize at which he nims . This passion no longer stands alone , if indeed it ever did . A more powerful stimulant , and more in unison with the spirit of our age , acts with it . The one is dependent upon the other ; and the gratification of the former is invariably attended by the full success of the latter . One who should attempt to renew the once just complaints concerning the neglect of literary merit , would have to go back another century in search of his examples . Genius is not only esteemed , but rewarded ; nor that with empty praise alone , but with a large share of that wealth and influence , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really command its comforts . Nothing can be more just ; nothing can contribute more powerfully towards placing intellectual superiority upon its proper basis . The man of letters , who derives all his power from // the resources of his own mind ; who , with no other reliance than his pen , is enabled to compete with pride of birth and with hereditary wealth , and who , when assailed by misfortune , and entangled in perplexing and harassing embarrassments , can draw from the inexhaustible treasures of his own intellect , the means , not merely of resistance , but of triumph ; such a man does more towards establishing the superiority of mental , over every other form of power , than volumes of rapturous panegyric , or of metaphysical analysis . The lot of genius was certninly never cast in better days . How far literature itself has gained by the change , may fairly be considered as a subject open to dispute . It is a question , however , which can only be decided by those , who at the distance of another century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing . For our parts , it is a question which we can never approach , wjthout feeling ourselves involved in perplexing doubts . And if at times we share in the pleasure , with which every one must view this triumph of intellect , at others we can hardly repress the conviction , that the success of the individual is won with more than a partial sacrifice of the cause in which he is engaged . But the point more closely connected with our present subject , is the influence of the pecuniary success of popular writers in directing their attention to particular branches of literature . Nor can it require illustration . Surrounded as we are with every form of proof , which can be required in order to show how close a connexion subsists between popular taste and the taste of popular writers , it is impossible to hesitate in our conclusions . Nor should we suffer ourselves to be deceived by a change of terms . Popular taste is but a synonyme for interest ; and compliance with the former means nothing more than a discreet obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of a high order laboring in the composition of ephemeral productions , and pouring forth volume after volume of works , in which its own taste must find much to condemn and still more to amend . Hence we see the crowd of imitators , which , numerous as it always has been , exceeds any thing that the annals of literature have hitherto recorded , and which , watching every fluctuation in public taste , follows blindly wherever it turns . These circumstances naturally suggest a form of literature , by which the writer can constantly hold such a place in the public // eye , as to secure the favor of a large class of readers ; the only sure path to the purse of his publishers . This can not he done by history , for the composition of history requires long , and patient , and laborious research ; nor by poetry , unless the hard he gifted with the fertile genius of a Byron nor by philosophy , nor by any branch of science , for however extensive and durable the fame , which success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended by popular favor , or extensive gain . Prose fiction , whether in the form of novels or of tales , whether grounded upon facts , or derived from the imagination of the writer , is the only branch of literature , which can gratify at once the passion for immediate reputation and pecuniary profit . This enables him to keep constantly before the l ) ublic ; to prevent his readers , by the regularity of his appearance , from losing sight of him amid the crowd that never fails to flock into every successfLll path ; and when he has once secured attention by writing well , to command it at will by the mere authority of his name . We have dwelt upon this point longer than we had intended , from an anxiety to induce our readers to examine and weigh carefully the correctness of our views , before we proceeded to uncover the other side of the picture . The inducements , which we have represented as contributing so much towards the cultivation of romance by men of great intellectual power , exist not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under the dominion of different families , renders the privilege of copy-right , even where it can be obtained , of little or no advantage . No sooner is a work announced in one part of the country , than the publishers of other states , and often those of different cities within the same states , prepare themselves for its appearance . If it proves successful , it is immediately reprinted wherever there is a chance of finding purchasers . If it be a failure , the first publisher feels the loss and nobody ever hears of it again . But as far as the pecuniary interest of the author is concerned , both cases , success and failure , are nearly alike in their consequences . He gains nothing , or at best but a trifle . Were this all , there would still be a certain appearance of justice in his lot . But he has often to lose in his own person , and , while struggling with poverty , to view , without the power of reclamation , the profits which others derive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have from the lips of the individual himself , // will place this melancholy truth in a stronger light , than any observations of ours can possibly do . Bot*ta 's History of the American Revolution is well known in this country ; and the translation of it has passed through two editions under the sanction of American copy-right . The French translator , also , was liberally rewarded for his labors by the publishers of Paris . In Italy , the editions of the original text have been multiplied in every part of the country ; and have proved in every form , a fruitful source of gain to the editors . What in the mean while was the reward of the author ? He had drawn upon his scanty patrimony in order to defray the expenses of the original publication ; for no bookseller could he found in Paris willing to undertake it at his own risk . While the Italian reprints and the French translation were obtaining an unexampled circulation , the copies of the first edition were lying a dead weight upon the hands of the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred of them , at the price of waste paper , for a few sous a pound , in order to purchase for his wife the privilege of dying in her native land . What then can induce the Italian to renounce the ease of a life of indolence , or the advantages of commerce , for the cares and anxieties , and in speaking of Italy we must add , the dangers , of literature ? We know of but two causes at all adequate to such a result . The love of literature for itself ; and the thirst for a durable reputation . To these should be added , but as acting with them , rather than as a separate cause , the hope of doing something towards the regeneration of his fellow citizens . That the love of letters does exist in Italy , if not in perfect purity , at least flee from the corruptions by which it is tarnished in other countries , would seem to be sufficiently evident from what has already been stated with regard to the situation of its votaries . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we consider the obstacles which obstruct the path of the man of letters , in this unhappy land ; his sacrifice of peace and of domestic quiet ; the alternative to which so many are reduced of choosing between a prison and an exile , and the meagre and uncertain rewards which attend the most successful exertions ; and , upon the other , contemplate the ardor with which the best talent o* the land consecrates itself to literature , and the unwavering devotion , with which it meets every sacrifice and hardship that its choice imposes ; we are struck with an admi // ration which we had never felt before , and are compelled to acknowledge that beautiful arrangement of Providence , which , when every ordinary motive* would turn us hack from the paths of intellectual culture , decks them with a winning , an irresistible loveliness , stronger than the suggestions of indolence , or the attractions of interest . Neither is the prospect of an eph.emeral reputation , overshadowed as it is by cares and vexations , and deprived of all the advantages , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die literary devotion of a modern Italian . He undoubtedly labors for applause ; but the fame after which he endeavors is that tardy fame , which is sculptured upon the tomb , and which , by an unaccountahle , though undeniable illusion , reconciles man to the trials which he actually endures , by the hope of those tributes of love and veneration which he can neither hear nor enjoy . If the view which we have taken of the personal inducements to literary exertion in Italy be correct , it will necessarily follow that men of genius will choose that course , which promises to lead more directly and surely to the reward after which they aspire ; or , in other words , they will naturally adopt that branch of literature , which gives the greatest security of durable fame . We can hardly he accused of rashness or of prejudice , when we assert , that of all the various forms of composition , although none may lead more promptly than romance to immediate applause , yet none is so insecure a guide to permanent reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one of the earliest and most curious pictures of the Middle Ages . It has followed every turn of society , and everywhere adapted itself to the feelings and character of the age . But , as these give place to new feelings and to new character , the fictions which formed the delight of one century have been almost instantly forgotten , if not caricatured and despised , in the next . Nor has this proceeded more from those changes in our pursuits and in our mode of life , which call for a concurrent change in works of this kind , than from the nature of the writing itself , which , holding a middle station between poetry and history , and neither shackled by the difficulties of the one , nor requir .. ing the laborious research of the other , presents temptations to the formation of habits of carelessness and haste , which few have the strength or the courage to resist . Our own age // has already witnessed the rise of three new forms . Two of them , though at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third , and most recent , still survives . Whether it be destined to share the fate of its predecessors , is a question which can not yet be decided . Bound as westill are by the spell that it has thrown around us , we are unable to see beyond the magic circle , and tell how far the current that has swept away every other class will carry this . Then it is distinruished from all others by one great advantage . With the same privilege of taking its subjects from real life , and thus representing human nature as it is , it possesses the additional one of throwing light upon those parts of history , over which the pen of the historian passes with a faint and rapid stroke . But history has accused it of yielding too often to the temptation of misrepresenting and falsifying its pictures , and this even in the hands of the greatest of its masters . Here the advantages and disadvantages are peculiar to this class . In every other respect , and in the fatal facility with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all other prose fiction . But these disadvantages , notwithstanding their tendency to repress that ardor , without which no writer can hope for success , might be overlooked by the Italian , were it possible for him to believe that this might be rendered more subservient to the cause of Italy , than any other kind of composition , and that , whatever his fate as a writer , he would have secured the gratification of contributing something towards the future prosperity of his country . But he can not fail to perceive , how inadequate and ilLealculated such an instrument is to the accomplishment of what every enlightened Italian aspires after . Were Italy really oppressed with that torpor which many suppose , scarce any thing could be better adapted to rouse her , than that exciting mixture of historic truth and high colored fiction , which acts so powerfully upon the warm blood of the south . But the tragedies of Alfieri have done more towards forming the Italians to that stern and elevated patriotism which is essential to a successful effort for freedom , than romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events of the last forty years have scattered those seeds , which , even though they fall upon stony ground or by the way-side , never fall in vain . Italy now requires the slow but certain guidance of sober history . At the side of those passions which should // work out her freedom , are those wild and fanciful hopes , which , if left to their free play , would poison all its sources . It s only by chastening these in the school of real life , that so fatal a catastrophe can be prevented . Excitement and passion have done their part . If reason , speaking with the voice of experience , be listened to , they will not have done it in vain . Whatever has a tendency to work upon the imagination , and carry excitement beyond the point which it has already reached , although it may hasten the moment of action , and produce by a convulsive effort that which the natural course of events is inevitably bringing about , will retard , for at least another century , th' true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , which seem to us capable of moving the minds of Italians of the highest orde neal ect of historical r , tend to confirm that romance , which has prevailed at every period of their literary history . As long as these remain in force , so long will the success of this school be doubtful . Literature has always been the child of circumstances ; and they alone of her followers have been successful , who have known when to yield to their impulse , and when to temper it . For the last twelve years , there has been a struggle in Italy , between the state of things which we have hastily sketched in the present paper , and the enthusiasm kindled by the romances of Scott . Had the writer , who is acknowledged to be at the head of this party , been endowed with a fertility of invention proportioned to his accuracy of observation , and a force corresponding to the delicacy of his genius , it would be difficult to conjecture how far he might have succeeded in triumphing over the obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hands of his partisans . As it is , his beautiful production stands almost alone . We may endeavour , in another paper , by a full examination of the work of Manzoni , and a sketch of the works of his disciples , to enable our readers to decide for themselves , how far we are right in the opinions which we have ventured to express in this.
