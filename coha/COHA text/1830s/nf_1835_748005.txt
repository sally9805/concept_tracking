txt /z/ Faithful Christian biography has at once its sanction and its model in the word of God ; and in our own times , its excellent practical influence is confirmed in the history of many eminent individuals . Most of these , hy their superior talents , education , or commanding spheres of action , present an example which the community in general may indeed admire but which few , comparatively , can hope to imitate . The present unpretending memoir exhibits the fidelity and success of a humble Christian , whose opportunities and powers were scarcely superior /z/ to those of thousands ; and is chiefly designed to illustrate a single point - the power of prayer /z/ It is obvious to all , that the kingdom of Christ can be extended in our world only by the accession of individuah . His blood avails not to the salvation of men in the Tnass ; but to those who individiially repent of sin , and accept of his mercy . The Holy Spirit strives with men and sanctifies them only as individuah . It is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven , or sink to hell . Yet to how great an extent are the prayers and contributions of Christians made indefinitely for the conversion of the world as a whole , while the salvation of no one indimdual is the object oi ilieu perso7ial and persever ing endeavors . How great a portion of that " light of the world , " which the church is commanded to reflect , is so " hid , " that no one individual sees it and feels its influence ; how great a portion of the of the earth , " by which men are to be purified and saved , is so kept in the mass , as to be brought INTO CONTACT with none I The truth evidently is , that personal efforts for the soids of individuals - the lip and thoughts and heart of a living man , brought into contact with the lip and thoughts and heart of a living man - /z/ is a grand institiitio7i of God for the conversion of the world ; and we must expect success , not in neglecting , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they that feared the Lord spake often one to another , that his book of remembrance was written . His command is , " As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another . ' ' Not only " the Spirit and the Bride , " but " he that heareth ' ' must " say , Come . " Christians are exhorted to " shine as lights in the world , holding forth the ivord of life f and the blessed encouragement is given , " He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way , shall save a soul from death , and hide a multitude of sins . " The parable of Nathan illustrates this principle with inimitable force and beauty : " Thou art the man , " humbled the king in the dust before God . The same principle is exemplified in the success off the personal efforts of the pious mother ; of the skilful Sabbath-school and Bible-class instructor ; and of faithful pastoral visitation : in all which divine truth is happily pressed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible confirmation in the fact , that wherever the Holy Spirit is largely poured out , the ministers and members of the church abound in faithful conversation and prayer with each other , and with the impenitent. /z/ Much of the " preacliiiig " of the New Testament was unquestionably of this sort . To such labor were the apostles sent out by our Saviour , who sanctioned his instructions by his own divine example . Paul , with all his crushing public responsibilities , could testify to the Ephesian elders , that he had labored among them both " publicly and from house to house ; " and appeal to them as witnesses of his own fidelity , in the memorable and most emphatic words , " E-emember , that , by the space OF three years , I ceased kot to warn every ONE , night and day , AVITH TEARS . " By such labor preeminently have imgans and " tnen far frmn God , in all circumstances and periods of time , been brought to attend on the public means of grace , and join themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit among the natives of Ceylon , in connection with the American mission , the Hev . Mr. Winslow states , that " there were few cases of permanent conviction , in which religious impressions were not cherished by much patient labor of the missionaries or their assistants , in conversmg and praying icith i ? idividuals alone . It was this repeated and personal application of truth , which principally took effect . " This class of efforts was a grand means of the /q/ unparalleled success of the ministry of Baxtee , at Kidderminster . " If I had true love to souls , " said Hene , y MarTYN , when contemplating a foreign mission , " I should lo7ig and labor for tliose around me , and afterwards for the conversion of the heathen ; " and often did he " redeem time from study , from recreation , and from the intercourse of friends , that he might enter the abodes of misery , to arouse the unthinking slumberer , or administer consolation to the dejected penitent . " " Our views , " said James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not be confined to the end of our preparatory course . There are many opportunities now of doing good . The call from many a lowly cottage is , ' Ccnne over and help t is . ' ' " Again : " Resolved , that I will , the Lord being my helper , think , speak , and act as an individual ; for as such I must live , as such I must die , stand before God , and be damned or saved for ever and ever . I have been waiting for others ; I must act as if I were the only one to act , and wait no longer . " If adding another example of the steadfastness of aim , self-denying perseverance , skill , and success with which a humble Christian discharged the same duty - connected , through the grace of God , with a most blessed and triumphant death - /z/ shall have any influence in encouraging other Christians thus to labor for God and the souls of men , the publication of this little work will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed that there does not appear the slightest indication that the subject of this sketch anticipated the publication of any memorial of himself . Of many of the most interesting scenes of his life he left no record whatever , except incidentally in hasty letters to his friends - evidently so intent on securing the results as to forget the record of them , or so con stantly occupied as to have no time to prepare it . Almost all his communications here inserted have been abridged and condensed , with slight changes in the phraseology , while the sentiment is scrupulously retained . /q/ /z/ Harlan Page was born in Coventry , in the county of Tolland , Connecticut , July 28 , 1791 . He was the only son of pious parents ; always sustained a good moral character ; was taught by his father the trade of a house-joiner , and received a good common education . In May , 1813 , he married Miss Mary Kingsbury , who was to be the helper of his spiritual course till his death , though at the time of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by him , which has come to hand , is the following , addressed to Rev. E. T. W. , who was then his minister . " Sabbath morning , Oct. 17 , 1813 . " Rev. and dear Sir - Your prayers , I trust , have been heard . My dear companion hopes she has accepted of the Saviour , and devoted herself and her all to him . But I am yet in the gall of bitterness , in opposition to God - my anguish last night was almost insupportable . I could see my Saviour nailed to the cross , bleeding and dying for /z/ sinners . I could see him with open arms , saying , ' Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . ' I could pray , but this only increased my pain . I fear the Holy Spirit will leave me to hardness of heart and blindness of mind . do remember me in your prayers , for the prayer of faith availeth much . " Your affectionate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his sins was such at this period that he frequently left his work to retire and pray ; and as he rode to and from a neighboring town where he was engaged in business , he often felt constrained to stop and go into the grove to plead for mercy . He soon engaged in instructing a school , where , after dismissing his pupils , he often remained for meditation and prayer . He was thus engaged in solitude one evening , when his sense of his lost condition as a sinner became so intense that he felt that he could not again leave the throne of grace till the controversy with his Maker was closed . There , in the darkness of midnight , and under the guidance , none can doubt , of the Holy Spirit , he consecrated himself to his Redeemer* , not merely in the confidence of pardon and acceptance , but with the determination to live and labor to promote his glory in the salvation of the perishing. /q/ " When I first obtained a hope , " he said on his dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls . 1 2'i'ci'yed , year after year , that God would make me the meajis of saving souls On Sabbath , March 6 , 1814 , he and his companion , with twenty others , publicly professed their faith in Christ , and joined the visible church . Only three days after this we find the date of an interesting and faithful letter , addressed to a relative who had long been hardening himself in sin and resisting the strivings of the Holy Spirit . He seems to suppose his friend to be perverting the doctrine of his dependence upon God , as'an excuse for wilfully continuing in sin . He first quotes the objection as it is strongly stated by Baxter in his Call to the Unconverted , together with the whole of Baxter 's reply . He then presses the same considerations in his own language , supporting them by numerous commands and promises from the Bible , and adds , " Were you in a boat just above an awful cataract , already feeling the force of the impetuous current , would you not endeavor to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing : God must save me without my own exertions , if I am saved at all ? ' Why then will you not strive to Page . 2 /z/ escape a more terrible destruction - the eternal , inconceivable horrors of a lost soul ? " You allow that a change of heart is necessary ; and will not be offended with my plainness . Could I but see you earnestly engaged for your salvation , how would my heart beat for joy ; how would I give thanks to the eternal God . " Dear sir , do consider and picture to yourself the dying hour . Then you must see your danger . Will you then say that , when in health , you could not attend to the salvation of the soul ? Will you not rather exclaim , ' that I had a few days more to live , that I might prepare to die V " Do not say you can not pray . Do you believe m the joys of heaven and the torments of despair ; and will you not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you from the other ? Turning away from God and heaven , I am sure your own reason must convict you of madness and awful presumption . Your affectionate friend , /z/ In the summer of this year God saw fit to discipline his servant by a very severe , protracted , and painful illness , by which he was brought to hold intimate converse with death , and taught to sympathize with the suffering . His sickness is thus described in a letter to an aunt , dated . Coventry , October 18 , 1814. /q/ " About the 20th of May I was attacked with fever , which continued two or three weeks ; and left me with an affection of the liver , attended with severe pain , which baffled the skill of physicians . It continued for eleven weeks , when a swelling began to rise on my back , which was exceedingly painful , and was at length opened by Dr. W. , who was obliged to make a deep and long incision in the live flesh . I have been chiefly confined to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes , " Ex2oerie7ice , more than observation , I find , teaches our need of divine support in affliction . With it we can endure the most piercing pain , and rejoice with thankfulness ; and even in the immediate prospect of death , no terror alarms . The spirit , in a near view of eternal glory , forgets the pain , and longs to soar on high . " The grand lesson which he felt that this sickness taught him was , that he m.ust devote the life God had preserved more faithfully to him , in labors for the salvation of all to whom he had access . His next letter which has come to hand was addressed to a pious female relative m sjnritual darkness , and was designed to aid her in selfexamination . He inquires whether she had neglected prayer , indulged in any known sin , been remiss in efforts for the spiritual welfare of those /z/ around her , or in any known duty ; and entreats her to return to her heavenly Father , and consecrate herself anew to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next is to a young lady who had been under serious impressions while a member of his school , urging her not to delay repentance , but come with all her heart and embrace the Saviour . The next to a young friend who had professed Christ , but was exposed to temptations from thoughtless companions . The next , bearing date September 3 , 1815 , is addressed to one who was a playmate of his childhood , but of whose conversion , at M. , New York , he had heard , requesting a particular account of his religious exercises , and especially that he would address a letter to his former acquaintance in Coventry , who continued out of Christ , and remember them in his prayers . " Since you were here , " he says , " we have been visited with the gracious outpouring of the Spirit , and nearly fifty have been added to the church ; but alas , there are yet many promising youth who neglect offered mercy ; and who , if sovereign grace do not interpose , must sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great is their danger , and long for their salvation . Do write to them ; it may be God will make you the instrument of salvation /q/ to their souls . They respect you , and should you address them , they may listen to your warnings and come to Christ . Do also pray for us and them . God is everywhere present , and will hear the prayer of faith . " Two days after , we find a letter addressed to E. L. , a young lady for whose salvation he had labored during her residence of a few days in his family , and who was under the strivings of the Holy Spirit . " The language of Jehovah is , ' The soul that sinneth , it shall die . ' There is not one of Adam 's lost race who has not forfeited eternal life by his sins . But there is one refuge , and one alone . Jesus Christ can save us ; and he is ready to receive every returning sinner , and make him an heir of eternal joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , till you have obtained pea'ce with God . The billows of his wrath roll just beneath the steps of all the unconverted . Delay not a moment . No future time can be more favorable . Call upon God without ceasing ; and if you perish , perish pleading for mercy . Let nothing divert your attention . If you grieve the Holy Spirit , his gracious influences may never return ; and you - 0 , overwhelming thought I - must sink where hope can never come , where mercy never gains admission . A few Christian friends are praying for you daily . Nothing but /z/ love impels me to write . Will you inform me what progress you are making , and what are your unshaken resolutions ? " With affection and esteem , /z/ To the same . " Monday Evening , Sept. 11 , 1815 . " Friend E . . . . - Are you yet without hope ? Gloomy and dejected , do you yet go mourning with out one ray of heavenly grace ? If so , your situation is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your former state of thoughtlessness . You say you desire more pungent and heart-piercing convictions - to be awakened from your dangerous stupidity . Call upon God to place your sins before you ; to humble you in the dust for them and to show mercy to a guilty , repenting , returning prodigal . All you have to do is to cast yourself unreservedly , with all your sins , upon the mercy of Christ ; to be deeply humbled for them ; and with faith in the Redeemer 's blood , take him as your only hope and portion . Never can you make yourself more acceptable to him . He only can clothe you with his own righteousness . He is ready to receive you Go then , dear friend , in the best manner you are able , and cast yourself into his arms with all your guilt . /q/ " ' There is a mercy-seat Sprinkled with blood , where Jesus answers prayer ; There humbly cast yourself beneath his feet , For never needy sinner perished there .

Are they safe ? Alas , they are on the brink of perdition . " Faint not while you have life . Fear not enemies . Fight the warfare of faith , and you shall win the glorious inheritance of the blessed . " With affectionate regard , your friend , /z/ The result of these faithful efforts , through the divine blessing , maybe gathered from the following extract of a letter to a Christian friend , dated , " Monday , sunset , Oct. 30 , 1815 . " I have joyful news to tell you - news which has made heaven glad . Our friend E. appears to be enjoying as much happiness as mortals are allowed this side of eternity .

The Saviour was pleased to make you the happy instrument of showing me my sins , and bringing me to partake of his love . " His own vieivs of Christian duty at this time may be gathered from the following extract of a letter addressed to this young convert , Novembei /z/ " Let us , E. , cast our eyes around on the poor , thoughtless , dying impenitent . How should we supplicate the throne of grace in their behalf . But this is not all . We must tell them of theii danger , and point them to a bleeding Saviour , " An excuse is made by many Christians , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they say they have not the talents for addressing the impenitent and conversing with them on the subject of religion . But are the simple truths of the gospel so dark that only the learned can understand them ? Are the words . ' He that believeth shall be saved , but he that believeth not shall be damned , ' so obscure that we /q/ can not properly impress them upon others ? Is the road to perdition so plainly described in the Bible , and can we raise no warning voice to the throngs who travel it ? Are the happiness of the righteous and the everlasting torments of the impenitent so clearly described , and can we see friends around us crowding their way to despair , with our lips closed in perpetual silence ? The truth is , our faith in eternal realities is weak , and our sense of duty faint , while we thus neglect the salvation of our fellow-beings .

" The recent afflictive event and an earnest desire for your eternal salvation constitute all the apology I need offer for now addressing you . But what shall I say ? Whom am I addressing ? a humble follower of the blessed Jesus , or one who has no interest in him ? If the former , how happy are you . If the latter , how awful , how tremendous are the divine denunciations against you , unless you renounce the world and accept of offered /z/ mercy . Of late you have abundantly needed some kind hand to support you . " Were your beloved father to speak to you from another world , how impressive would be his lan &#9632; guage .

Sleep not upon the brink of perdition . Awake ; arise ; prepare to meet your God . Delay not ; for the day of the Lord is at hand . ' While on the bed of death , he uttered , in broken accents , the words , ' Repent , repent . ' May this providence lead you faithfully to examine your heart , and see if you are prepared to follow him . God 's design in this affliction is , doubtless , that you may come to him as the only source of real consolation ; that you may be humble and prayerful , and better fitted to be useful in life and happy in heaven . May you all have divine support . Accept these lines as an expression of affection and sympathy , and an earnest desire that they may be instrumental of some good to vour immortal soul .

Early in December he commenced a letter to his Christian brother at M. , New York , which shows the deep interest he then felt in the spiritual welfare of many individuals , as well as of the church generally . He complains of his own languid affections ; states that there were then no revivals of religion in all the eastern portion of the state ; that Christians generally seemed to have become languid and formal , and the impenitent to be " unconcerned , while the wrath of heaven is impending over them . " " R. , " he says , " when in conversation , pleads , as do many others , the ungodly lives of professors of religion . He ' rather thinks that if he lives a moral life and prays in secret , he is on the road to heaven as well as man who make so much ado about religion . ' " As to Mrs. , I am not now particularly acquainted with the state of her mind . She is very reserved in conversation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unconverted , and even many who profess to be the disciples of Christ . How criminal is our neglect to improve every proper opportunity in conversing on the most important of all subjects . /z/ " L.

His wife , in the late revival , almost ventured to indulge a hope ; but she is now more reserved on religious subjects .

" A.

" E. , " above alluded to , " has lately been brought to experience the boundless love of the Saviour , and her happiness in him seems to be almost without alloy .

A few individuals seem to be aroused , and the prospect seems /q/ a little more favorable .

" Satihiday Evening . This day I have endeavored to observe as a day of humiliation , fasting , and prayer for the outpouring of the Spirit .

" As I entered the sanctuary , " he says , " joy beamed in the countenances of numbers , while others seemed borne down with a heavy load Solemn silence reigned , interrupted only by occa sional sighs and tears . Every eye was fixed , and every ear listening as to a message from the Lord . When the service closed , several remained to converse on the subject of their salvation . " They dispersed for a little time , and at sunset the youth were seen assembling in groups , till the room was filled with near two hundred immortal beings . All was silent as the house of death . The most profound attention evinced that the Lord was there . When the exercises were closed , and the blessing pronounced , not one moved to leave the house .

None apneared indifferent . Solemnity , sorrow , or joy was depicted in every countenance . The audience were seated , and nearly all in the house were addressed individually in reference to their own personal salvation . None wished to avoid being questioned , or being warned that unless they repented of their sins and fled to Christ by a living faith , they must be lost . " This account Mr. Page embodied in an anonymous paper sent in with others to be read in the " Biblical School " in Coventry , in which a large number of youth united for the study of the Bible , and mutual intellectual , moral , and religious improvement . " Our minister , " he adds , " has seen among an other people anxious souls flocking to Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a crowd of inquirers , as he turned his thoughts to his own flock - his church cold and languid - the youth thoughtless and gay , pressing on their way to eternal despair .

' Shall we suffer him to go mourning all the day over so many hurrying to perdition ? Shall we /z/ suffer ourselves to be lulled in security , and thus be eternally ruined ? 0 , it is time , it is high time to awake . " Having received a fresh supply of tracts , he immediately enclosed tvio of them to impenitent friends in notes , of which the following is one : To L. s . " June 22 , 1819 .

I know the joy you will feel at the repentance of sinners in Coventry . When I wrote you last , all was gloomy , except the prospect that God was about to place over us a spiritual guide . He has been indefatigable . For a time , all applauded , but none seemed to be moved . " A meeting of the church was called , when all /q/ the male members were questioned with regard to their feelings . All confessed criminal coldness and want of spiritual life . The question was then put , ' Are we not called to make some special exertions , that the work of God may be revived ? ' This was acknowledged , and it was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , another meeting was called , which ' all who felt anxious for a revival of religion were invited to attend .

' Members of the church and others attended , and the meeting was full . The time was spent in exhortation and prayer , and some signs of life appeared . " The next week a similar meeting was held , when all who desired it were conversed with individually , and it appeared that some were inquiring . A work of grace was then progressing in B. , and had now entered our borders . " A few of the church appear to be engaged . They found that they had wandered far , very far from God .

" Mr. Page always regarded a season of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as the harvest-time of souls ; and it is hard to say whether his holy joy in God , his amazing sense of responsibility , his importunate prayers , or incessant efforts , most abounded . /q/ He seems to have been so intently engaged in promoting the work , that he made only a few brief notices of what was passing , with his pn . Among these is a list of seventy-nine individuals who in that revival obtained hope in Christ , sixtysix of whom were added to the church . On the 9th of August he thus addressed a young woman whose case he seems to have considered almost hopeless : " An affectionate regard for your immortal interests has induced me to write a few lines , though I know not that they will be welcome or beneficial .

" Who then will be an the Lord 's side ? Will you not come as a humble penitent , and cast yourself at his feet ? Will you not now , by faith in Christ , become a friend of God , and an heir of glory ? /z/ " May I not hope that you are now determined to break your league with sin and the enemy of souls , before the impending storm of God 's wrath shall fall upon you , when the only answer to your despairing cry shall be , for ever , for ever , for EVER ? do not let a deceitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth millions of worlds , and which must live eternally in the joys of heaven or the agonies of hell .

In our recent interview , I learned that you have been often affectionately reminded of the necessity of an immediate attention to the concerns of eternity , but yet that you are living without hope , and with your affections still supremely placed on earthly good . " My feelings were not a little excited while in the house of God to-day , in contemplating the final separation of those who are connected by the dearest earthly ties - one to descend to the gloom of everlasting despair , the other to rise to immortal life and glory . I knew that you had had a religious education ; that a thousand prayers of pious /z/ friends had been offered in your behalf ; and that a devoted wife was pouring out her intercessions to God , that you may not be separated in the future world . " Why , sir , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this forgetfulness of God ; this aversion to a holy life , and to the Saviour of sinners ? I can not believe that your enlightened understanding will allow you to barter your soul for the trifles of earth . " Men act in view of motives . Permit me to ask , do you not find them sufficient to induce a compliance with the simple and reasonable requisitions of the gospel of Christ ? How long , sir , will you withhold the best affections of your heart from him who is ' the Chief among ten thousand , and altogether lovely ? ' How long will you put far away the evil day , and slumber on the verge of ruin ? How long will you , dear sir , reject the Redeemer of mankind and his offers of eternal life ? God grant that your heart may answer , ' Not a moment .

Are there no souls on the way to death ? I hoped to hear that you were enjoying a fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit . The Lord Jesus is just such a stay as you now and always need . Your companion you will find , sooner or later , to be only a broken reed ; but Christ is a safe refuge . " We have some favorable tokens for good here .

Health more feeble , and obliged to resort to medicine . In addition to my bodily infirmities , I find great languor in my spiritual affections . for a more ardent desire to be instrumental in promoting the glory of God . May I not , blessed Jesus , leave myself with thee ? Wilt thou /q/ not guide me and lead me back to thy fold , and make me faithful the short time I have to continue on earth ? Thou knowest my weakness , my instability , my dim vision of eternal things , and my ingratitude . Pardon my wanderings , revive my languid affections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes the little journal he kept of his brief stay in Jewett City ; and we regret to say he has left behind him nothing further in the shape of a iour7ial . Had he continued to make and preserve even such hasty notices of his efforts from day to day , and the blessing that followed them , it is only known to God how extensively the record of them might have been blessed in inciting others to duty . On the last page of the journal we have a memorandum of Books out , including Baxter 's Call and a few works of kindred character , the loaning of which , as he judged them adapted to the state of particular individuals , was one of his accustomed means of usefulness . From another memorandum it appears , that while he was performing the labors of love above recounted , he worked fifty-seven days , at seventyi%ve cents a clay . Here was a mechanic performing his daily task on hire , establishing and suslaining a religious meeting at the boarding-house on Wednesday evenings , a meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise , and though he went about three miles to attend public worship , throwing his efforts into a Sabbath-school at 5 P. M. , and instructing a class ; devoting Sabbath evenings to meetings and family visitation ; conversing with the sick , the careless , the anxious , and those indulging a hope ; distributing tracts ; endeavoring to awaken an interest in the benevolent operations of the day ; keeping a brief diary ; abounding in prayer ; and adopting , with others , incipient measures , which proved successful , for the formation of a church , and the settlement of an evangelical pastor . Many a professed Christian , as he goes out on a journey , or to tarry among strangers , " leaves his religion behind him . " Not so our brother : " I hope , " was his language , " that God has sent me here to advance his causeP The friend with whom he lodged says , " Religion was always first in his mind . If he entered a family , after the usual salutations , this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go out into the highways , and wherever he found those of suitable age , however far from God they might seem , would gain their attention , and , if possible , bring them in . Six or eight wild boys from twelve to seventeen years old were thus induced to attend , were led /q/ to see their ruin by sin , and brought hopefully to Christ . Some of them became teachers in the school . One of them , a little before the death of Mr. Page , expressed an earnest desire to see him ; and said that but for his efforts he must have been , to all human view , an eternal outcast . The meetings in the boarding-house were continued about a year after he left us , and the saving influences of the Holy Spirit descended upon them . " The gentleman whom he addressed by letter , July 15 , publicly professed Christ , and frequently spoke ol Mr. Page 's faithful efforts for his salvation . A daughter of one of the families he visited , lamented on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " said she , " that I could see that Mr. Page . that I had regarded his warnings I " At the close of the evening he often spent much time in his chamber before retiring to rest , sometimes till a late hour , doubtless wrestling with God in prayer for the individuals with whom during the day he had been conversing . We now return with our brother to his peaceful home , where his health for several weeks continued feeble , and forbade his returning to labor at Jewett City as he had intended . But it appears , that though in " much debility of body , ' ' and f &_r; a tim.e " unable to converse much , " he d 'd no ' t ' /z/ linquisli the one prime object of his life . On the 18th of August he thus wrote to C. H. H , a young lady who had been for some time anxious for her soul . " According to your own confession , your case is deplorable indeed . Convinced of the necessity of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still choose the way to death . But stop ; is C a in the way to death ? can it be possible that she has lived three months sensible of her danger , and knowing her duty , without casting herself , a guilty rebel , at the foot of the cross ? remember , the Saviour will not always call . Continuing to reject him , the day of your calamity is at hand . The eternal sorrows that shall come upon you make haste . Think again of his melting invitations : ' Look unto me , and be ye saved . ' ' Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters . ' Slighting such calls , and abusing such privileges as you enjoy , must you not deserve and receive an aggravated doom ? If these were the last words I could ever speak to you , I would say , Haste , throw yourself imtnediately on the mercy oj God in Christ .

September 5th , he transmitted , for publication in the Guardian , a sketch of the interview held with a young lady , July 22 ; his object being " to convince her that there was no obstacle on the iart of God to her coming to him , and that the guilt of her continued impenitence rested wholly and alone on herself . " ' I acknowledge , ' she said , ' that I do love the pleasures of this world ; and that dancing , which is my favorite amusement , is one of the last things T could give up . ' " ' Are you prepared then , ' I asked , ' to risk your eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment ? When so much has been done for your salvation , will you still hazard the tremendous consequences of being ' a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God ? ' " ' However that may be , ' said she , ' I shall continue in my present course till the Spirit of God leads me to think and feel differently . Should I die now , I know I must be lost ; but I can see no way to prevent it . I do not desire to be miserable ; T wish to go to heaven as well as others ; /z/ but what can I do ? The jrayer of the wicked is ' abomination to the Lord ; ' and if I am to be saved , when God sees fit to change my heart he will do it . ' " ' True , ' said I , " the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord , ' he neither accepts nor requires it . He requires the prayer of ' a broken and contrite spirit ; ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him this day , and even this moment , with a spirit contrite and broken for sin . Every moral exercise of your heart , and every act of your life , that are not consistent with supreme love to God , are also an abomination in his sight . And besides all this , your impenitence and your neglect of religion is Tjoior oion choice ; for this you are guilty ; and for this , if persisted in , you will be justly condemned . If you can not plead this excuse at the bar of God , never , I beseech you , make it again on earth . ' " After endeavoring in vain to obtain a promise that she would do so much for her salvation , as for a short season each day to call to mind and confess her sins individually to God , I left her , hoping that the interview would be the means at least of exciting some serious reflections . " I think we see in this example that . impenitent smners have no desire to becoiiie the followers qj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be /z/ happy , but are unwilling humbly to accept of Christ ; and refuse to enae , for his sake , in selfdenying duty . They also impliedly , if not confessedly , cast the blame of their imiienitence on God . " Let every Christian while so many are thus excusing and deluding themselves , be faithful in unveiling to them the real state of their hearts , and showing them their guilt and danger . Let him warn them no longer to reply against God ; show them that their excuses arise from hatred to him and his perfect law , and from their own disposition to justify themselves . And let him add to this frequent and fervent prayer that their eyes may be opened , and that they may cast themselves on the mercy of God in Christ .

Awake now to your danger , while you are in a land of hope . Acknowledge yourself a vile and guilty rebel ; and /z/ remember , that you must repent and believe in Christ , or you can never be admitted to the abodes of the blessed . " There stands appended to a copy of this article the following note , dated 1829 , in the handwriting of Mr. Page : " The young lady above described received impressions from this article which resulted in her hopeful conversion to God . She has since died , trusting in the merits of Christ . " To Miss J. B. " Coventry , September 20 , 1821 . " I hear you have not ijet professed Christ before men .

" And now . Miss J. , can you not do more than you have done ? Is there no Christian female /q/ whom you can encourage ; no impenitent sinner whom you can warn of his danger ; no young friend whom you might hope to bring to the knowledge of the truth ?

" What are your feelings , my friend , as you revert to those seasons ivlien the Holy Spirit spoke to your conscience and brought you in some degree to feel your wretched condition ? Are all serious impressions banished from your mind ? Are the divine influences withdrawn for ever ? Is my friend , who was once trembling in view of her state as a sinner , now thoughtlessly pursuing her course to the world of woe ? I can hardly bear the thought . An immortal being , blessed with /z/ a religious education - a child of many prayers , labors , and tears , continuing to reject the offers of life , and refuse the gracious calls of a bleeding Saviour !

" I have been but little acquainted with the religious state of the youth among us the summer past , having been for some time absent ; and for the last two months my health has been so much impaired that I have had opportunity to converse with but few . But there is reason to fear that many are gliding down to the gates of death .

D. , a young relative , on business ; and that part of the letter being finished , proceeds to express his regret that their personal interview when his friend was at Coventry was so short , and his hope that correspondence may be an acceptable and useful substitute . " A thousand topics of interest , " he says , " present themselves ; but all others sink into insignificance compared with eternal realities . " And now , dear cousin , permit me to did not consider yourself as having experienced that change ' from death unto life ' which the Scriptures represent as indispensable to salvation .

God has said , * I /z/ love them that love me , and they that seek me early shall find me . ' I would affectionately urge you , by all that is solemn in heaven , on earth , and in the world of despair , in a dying bed , and in the day of judgment , to delay the work of preparation for death no longer . Hasten , and flee to Christ as a ruined sinner . Days and months fly swiftly ; all opportunity to make your peace with God will soon be over ; and the soul once lost , is lost for ever . " Do write me , and fully express your feelings . " Your affectionate cousin , " h . PAG-E .

" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no good to converse with N. R. on her state as a sinner ; and you have probably yourself been brought to the same conclusion . " I take my pen to say a few words more to you , trembling lest it should only be the means of hardening you in sin . All motives from this world would lead me at once to desist . But when I look to a dying hour , and a little beyond , into an un changing eternity , I feel irresistibly impelled once more to expostulate with a perishing fellow-sinner . I beg you to receive it in kindness , and as probably /z/ the last lines or words addressed to you personally , which you will ever read or hear from me while fou continue professedly the enemy of God . " And now , what shall I say ? Will you accompany me to that silent room ? Here lies a young lady wasted by disease , and just on Ihe confines of eteraity . Approach her - the paleness of death is on her &#9632; sheek . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldness ? it is but kindred dust . Listen to her tale . Alas , my friend , I am dying - I am dymg . My lay of grace is over . My sands are almost run . In a few moments I shall be enveloped in devouring f re . I have lived in sin , rejected Christ ; and now he hides his face from me , and there is no remedy . 0 , how have Christians plead with me to make God my portion ; but I would not listen . I accused God of injustice , quarrelled with that sovereign love that would have wooed my heart ; resisted the Holy Spirit that was teaching me my lost condition and pressing me to accept of Christ . He called , but I refused ; and now he is withdrawn from me for ever . 0 , my friend , take warning from me . While you have the offers of mercy , flee to Christ . Make haste .

" That you may bid Him a cordial welcome , is the earnest prayer of your affectionate friend , /z/ Early in the autumn of 1822 , commenced another precious revival of religion , which continued for several months , as the result of which , he says , in a letter to his cousin H. D. , near the close of winter , " About one hundred have obtained a hope . Some of the most amiable have found their hearts violently opposed to God ; have even represented themselves as ' devils incarnate ; ' and found peace only in confessing all their awful guilt , and casting themselves alone on the merits and mercy of Christ . " In a subsequent letter to Mrs. A. A. , a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintances who had united with the church . This is all the notice he has left of what he did , or felt - of his prayers , or labors , or success , or thanksgivings , during this blessed harvest of souls , a season in which he rejoiced , as fraught with the choicest of all blessings conferred by a gracious God this side of heaven . A friend , who knew hira well , states that in this revival he manifested a deeper interest , and put forth more glowing and unceasing efforts than ever before . Religious meetings /q/ were held almost daily , and sometimes at different hours of the same day ; and usually he attended them all . Personal conversation icith indimduah , the careless , the inquiring , and the young convert , v/as , in connection with prayer , the prominent means of his usefulness ; and for this , as opportunity ofiered and duty seemed to call , he did not hesitate , at any and all times , to leave his husiness . Though he had little of tlys world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed no man any thing ; " the necessary wants of his family were supplied ; he felt that while the influences of the Holy Spirit were descending the opportunity must be improved to pluck the golden fruit , and that whether he obtained a little more or a little less of this world 's goods was nothing compared with the salvation of a soul . If any would censure his course , let the decision be deferred till the judgment-day . And that he may not then be found almost alone - with a little hand. , who supremely devoted themselves while in this world , first to glorify God in the salvation of souls around them , and after that to make provision for the present life . In reference to Mr. Page 's efforts at this season , the individual to whom his last moving appeal above quoted was addressed , relates the following incidents : " I had long been awakened , but determined to let no one know it ; and rrxade every effort /z/ to escape Mr. Page . At length , near the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ail were indulging a hope except my brother and myself . After conversing with my brother he came to me , and wished me to tell him the state of my mind . I at first said that I was in despair , but from the manner of his reply perceived that he did not give full credit to my assertion . This roused my resentoient , and I at once determined not to speak again while he remained in the room . He pressed me to decide that I would without delay give my heart to Christ , but I was so angry that I would not even answer him . This conversation brought the malignity of my heart more clearly to my OM'n view than I had ever seen it before . I could never have imagined myself to indulge such malice as I then felt towards him , and my misery was that I could assign no other reason for it but his faithfulness . Soon , as I trust , God was pleased to subdue my enmity , and my hatred to Mr. Page was ct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of my blessed Redeemer . A little phrase incidentally dropped by his pastor , as from his windov/ he saw him approaching in company with another , has a significant import : " There comes Mr. Page with another lamb . ' ' Seeing him come in that season of mercy , such a result was readily anticipated . /q/ /z/ NATIVE OF THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS , HOPl - /z/ Though Mr. Page left no written memorial of his efforts , or the state of his mind during the work of grace just alluded to , the deficiency is at least partially supplied in the interesting memoir of Thomas Hamitah Patoo , which he originally prepared . He had often agitated the question whether , even at his age , and with a rising family around him , it was not his duty to go and labor in some humble station among the heathen ; and when Patoo was located near him , he felt that Providence had brought a heathen to his own door , and that he must omit no efforts for his salvation . Patoo had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ships which occasionally touched at his native islands , he resolved to visit America ; and to secure his purpose , jumped on board a ship with her sails spread , just in time to see his afflicted father reluctantly wave his handkerchief as a signal of farewell . He arrived at Boston , and after a varied life of two or three years , and many sufferings occasioned by his own folly , was taken under /z/ the charge of Mr. D. H. , a benevolent gentleman , who , in May 1822 , placed him in a pious family in Coventry , commending him to " the prayers and Christian kindness of the pastor and the whole chm-ch . " " At a pra7je7 ' - meeting at sujirise , in the autumn of 1822 , " says the narrative , " it was observed that Thomas was much affected and wept bitterly . He was made a subject of special prayer , and his conversation at the close of the meeting evidently ehoAved that he was under the strivings of the Holy Spirit . " These impressions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its faithful personal application to himself in private conversation . His distress was such one day , that he left home in the rain , first to find his Christian friend , and then to visit his pastor to obtain some relief . Truth presented took hold of his mind , but he rebelled against God , murmured at the conversion of a young acquaintance , and returned to spend a sleepless night in viev/ of his hopeless condition . On the day following , his anxiety continued unabated ; his distress was such that he could not attend to the business assigned him ; most of the day was spent in agonizing prayer ; till at length the Saviour appeared for him , his burdened conscience was relieved , and he found ueace in believing . His own narrative of the way /q/ in which he was led , expressed in his broken idiom , is a delightful exemplification of the power and excellency of true religion . " Question .

" He had a great desire to unite with the church at the approaching communion , and when the pastor informed him , that at the suggestion of his distant friend , it was thought best that his admission be deferred , he replied with great feeling , " If , sir , you think best , then me wait ; but may be me die soon - then me never own Christ before men . " He adorned the Christian character , loved the Bible , prayed much , especially for his own relatives and countrymen , for the heathen , and the impenitent in Christian lands ; and , like the friend who made him the object of his Christian love and more than paternal regard , and wrote his history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinners to Christ . The statements in the two following communications are full of import , and have an impressive bearing on the immediate object of this work . The first is from a young lady who had long been convicted of sin , and was still cherishing a rebellious heart . " After our friend Thomas indulged a hope , I endeavored , " she says , " to avoid him as much as possible ; but one day , after conversing with my /q/ sister , and expressing much joy tecause she had got a new heart , he turned to me and said , ' N. , why you no give up that had heart ? Why you no come with C. and he a Christian ? Me want ou be a Christian too I ' In order to evade what he said , and prevent his saying more , I repHed , ' Thomas , why did you never speak to me about these things before ? Perhaps , had you been as faithful in talking to me as you have been to my sister , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expression of deep regret , he replied , ' N. , me very sorry me no talk to you before . Me p-ay for you before , and now me talk to you . ' After this , he embraced every opportunity of affectionately urging upon me immediate submission to Christ . " In the height of the revival , when a number of Christian friends were spending the day at our house , feeling no disposition to be with them , I retired to another room , and there stayed meditating on my hopeless condition . It was not long before some one rapped at the door , and who was it but Thomas . He immediately began in the most feeling manner , to entreat me to submit to Christ without delay . ' Christ ready to receive you - all the good Christians want you to comie - angel in heaven ready to rejoice over you ; why vou no come V After conversing in this manner /z/ for some minutes , he was silent . At length , looking at me most expressively , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me pray for you ; me want to pray icith you . ' We knelt , and Thomas poured forth the feelings of his heart in language like this ' mercy , Father , have mercy on us sinners . Have mercy on this friend . Pray this friend may now give up that bad heart to Christ , and not go to hell , ' etc . It was the burden of his prayer , that I might then submit to Christ . I will leave others to judge what were my feelings , to have this heathen , who had but just learned there was a God , on his knees pleading for mercy on me a stubborn sinner , hardened under the meridian light of the gospel . " The other communication to which we have referred is from one now a minister of the gospel , and was made to Mr. Page a few months previous to his death : " The first time I saw Thomas after he thought he had been born again , was on Sabbath , December 8 , 1822 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself lost . It seemed that there was but a step between me and hell . I longed to converse with some one , but I was too proud to tell any one how I felt . ' * Thus situated , Thomas approached me , and began to question me about my spiritual condition /q/ 1 told him I felt that there was no hope for me : I had simied against so much light , and so many strivings of the Spirit . " He proceeded to urge me to immediate submission . ' Why you no give up that had heart ? It viill do you no good to keep it . It will destroy you for ever . Give it up now to Christ . Christ ready to give you a new , a good heart . Me hope me have given my bad heart to him . Me hope me have a new one . 0 , sir , do give up your bad heart . ' ' ' I told him I wished I could , but it was so hard I could not : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . " This excuse did not satisfy him . It only led him to press home with more earnestness the duty of immediately giving up my had heart to Christ . " I felt so distressed , I begged him to pray for me . This was the first time in my life that I ever had made such a request , and the very asking him to pray for me deepened my impressions . It came to my mind immediately , ' What , must you , a gospel-hardened rebel , call in to your help the prayers of a poor Marquesan , who has but just been converted from the worship of idols ? He has just now heard of Christ , and received him as his Saviour ; you have heard of him for years , and have /z/ been slighting his salvation , despising his offers of mercy , trampling on his blood , and grieving his Spirit . ' These reflections were like daggers to my soul . " Thomas promised to pray for me , but left me saying , ' O , si @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This sentence was the most powerful sermon I ever heard ; it contained the eloquence of the Spirit ; and coming in the way it did , with an expression of the most tender pity and concern , left an impression on my mind which , I trust , will never be effaced . I have always considered his earnest exhortation to me at that time , as the principal Qiieans in the hand of God of my conversion In March , 1823 , Mr. Page accompanied Patoo to the foreign mission school , then in operation in Cornwall , Connecticut , where he hoped to become qualified to return as a messenger of Christ to his native islands . On the 30th of March he thus wrote to Mr. Page : " My dear Christdvn Friend - I have received your very kind letter , and am now happy to answer it . One of my brothers writes for me , because I ca n't write well enough yet . I tell him what to write , so the word be some like Thomas . I very glad the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathen where there is no /q/ Saviour . I think they pray for me too , that I be prepared to tell the heathen all about the grea , t God , and our Saviour Jesus Christ . I rejoice a great deal to hear about sinner come to Christ and get a new heart . I hope the good work continue always among you , so I rejoice always . The people here have no revival - no pray enough . I sorry ; I hope we pray enough by and by . We have good many meetings , but no feel . " I hope I go home by and by , and have sinner come to God in my country . Yes , my dear Mr. Page , I go , if I live to be ready . We have some scholars no love the Saviour . I tell them they must be born again or go to hell . I talk to some sinner all about they no come to Christ . I tell them I come aAvay from heathen land , and find a good Saviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Christ . You must pray a great deal for poor sinners in Cornwall school . May be we have a revival here . " I must close now . I think I pray every day for you and all my friends . The great God bless you and make you do good while you live ; and when you and I die , may we meet and shake hand in heaven , and stay always with our Saviour and all who love him . " Your true friend , /z/ This- promising youtli , in the mysterious providence of God , was called , on the 9tli of June following , to join the lamented Henry Obookiah in a better world . As he stood with Mr. Page over Obookiah 's grave , in Cornwall , three months before , he said , with great solemnity , ' May be , I lie here too " He remained steadfast , and in sickness and death gave delightful evidence of divine support . Further particulars may be learned from the memoir , which is published by the American Tract Society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed a Sabbath in Torringfcrd with the venerable father of Samuel J. Mills , whose name is so dear to all the friends of missions . He attended the religious meetings of the congregation ; and feeling a deep interest that the work of God should be revived among them , he , on returning to Coventry , engaged Christians to pray for them , and wrote to the family of Mr. Mills an affectionate letter . In their reply , they say , " We hope we shall ever have reason for gratitude that Providence directed your steps here , and gave you an opportunity to address this people . There seemed to be a general impression that day , that God was about to visit us again . Christians began to feel that they must sleep no longer , and that something must be /q/ done . The next Sabbath evening , though the weather was very unfavorable , five of the brethren called unexpectedly to spend a little season in prayer , and we have not , for many months , witnessed 50 much solemnity . Last evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one instance of awakening was reported . " We mention these circumstances that you may know our state , as you manifested a deep interest in our spiritual welfare ; and to engage a renewed interest in your prayers . " /z/ In the summer of 1823 he had another violent attack of fever , with a renewed inflammation of the liver , by which he was brought , as he and those around him supposed , to the last moments of life . " He was calm , " says one who watched at his bedside , " but did not receive such measures of grace as were imparted to him when God 's time had come for him to die . " Thus did his heavenly Father see fit again to discipline him for further usefulness . On regaining essentially his health , he was induced to direct his attention chiefly to the business of engraving , which led to his being employed for a time by the American Tract Society , then exist ing at Boston , the business of which was chiefly conducted at Andover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1824 , in the museum of the " Society of Inquiry respecting Missions , in the Theological Seminary at Andover , " writing a description of some of the interesting objects before him , for the benefit of the Sabbath-school he had left in Coventry . /q/ To the Members of the First Sabbath-school Class . " Missionary E , oom , Theol . Sem. , Andover . " My dear Friends - " With no less than six gods of the heathen before me , I am now seated to redeem m.y pledge of a letter . One of these gods is from the Sandwich Islands , and was worshipped by Tamahamaha , the king ; and though larger , is similar to the one in New Haven , a picture of which you have seen . " The remainder are Hindoo gods . One from Bengal is in the form of a man , about twelve inches high , painted white , with tinsel around the shoulders , waist , wrists , and ancles , having the appearance of gold and silver , with red and green colors intermingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather , and on its head is a small cap . It would , in short , make a beautiful doll ; yet this is none other than the famous god Vishnu , which human beings like ourselves worship . " The next is Krishnu the god of music , a favorite god of the Indian women . It is about ten inches in height , perfectly black , and with its arms in the position of playing on an instrument . " The other three are brass , five or six inches high , representing the god Vishnu in different incarnations . The head and body are like a man with four arms , while the lower part of one terminates in a fish , and of another in a tortoise . In such Page 9 /z/ odious forms the Hindoos believe their gods descended to the earth . How is it possible that the mind of man can be so debased as to pay homage to such horrid objects ? " I now turn with pleasure to the ollas , or palm leaves , on which are written the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our missionaries in Ceylon . The leaves are about fourteen inches long and two wide , straight and smooth , written very handsomely on both sides , in perfectly straight lines . Perhaps these two gospels fill one hundred and fifty of the leaves , which are connected by strings passing through them , so that they can be opened and read , or folded very compactly together in a small bundle . Another is * Devout meditations in Tamul , ' written on the olla by a native convert of Swartz , and is used as a school-book on the Malabar coast . It was presented by Christian David , from whom we hav had many interesting communications . " I next look at the ear-rings which were given by Catharine Brown to aid the Palestine mission , and were redeemed by some ladies and placed here ; valued at sixteen dollars . Happy would it be , should many of our females cast their useless ornaments into the treasury of the Lord . By this means alone , many now enveloped in pagan darkness might be brought to rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catharine icorked wJdle it was clay , and is now gone to her rest . " I here see also a tivig from a tree over the grave of Harriet Newell . Though her precious dust there moulders in a pagan land , she will never regret - no , never - her sacrifices for a perishing world . " While sitting here , I can not but reflect on the deplorable condition of those who have not the gospel . Contrast our situation with theirs , and it seems a paradise . Let us do all in our power , that the news of a Saviour may be soon extended to every corner of the globe . " I left you , my friends , with regret . I hope you are all making advances in holiness , as well as in divine knowledge . Live not , my friends , as do others . Be eminently devoted to God . Let the lukewarm Christian be reproved when he beholds your life , and the impenitent sinner plainly discern the difference between ' him that serveth God and him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , and at death you shall enter into the joy of your Lord . " A work of grace seems to be silently in progress in this place , and a powerful revival has recently commenced in Salem . Pray for me . " Your affectionate friend , /z/ To a young lady of a family in which he some weeks resided , he wrote the following awakening note : " Sabbath Evenijg , September 19 , 1824 . " My friend M. lives , I fear , alas , without hope , and without God in the world . No title to a heavenly inheritance ; no Saviour to cheer her in sorrow ; none on whom to lean when nature is dissolving ; none to welcome her to the abodes of the blessed I " Is such the deplorable state of the friend I am addressing ? Ah , M. , your prospects are gloomy indeed .

Up , then , M. , and flee for life . There is not a moment to be lost . While you wait , your sins are increasing ; the Saviour is rejected ; the Holy Spirit resisted ; and there is reason to fear he will leave you for ever . Now , what is your decision ? What course , M. , will you take ? Now salvation is offered . The door of mercy is open , after so many years spent in sin . Come , I entreat you , as a penitent prodigal , and cast yourself on the mercy of an injured and bleeding Saviour . " Your friend and well-wisher , " h . PAGE . " /q/ The following is the last letter which has come to hand , written previous to his leaving Coventry : To c . B. " Coventry , Friday , P. M. , Nov. 26 , 1824 . " As I take my pen , I call to mind that once you indulged the hope that you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible church . What , C , is now the state of your soul ? " Am I then addressing an impenitent sinner ? If so , what shall I say ? The exhortations you received while under the strivings of the Spirit , can hardly have ceased ringing in your ears . The threatenings of Jehovah and a long catalogue of sins still lie against you . An opening eternity and a judgment-day are just before you - and here you live on the forbearance of God , with no Saviour to befriend you , and no Holy Spirit to console you ; and all your life , through fear of death , subject to bondage . Your case , my friend , is deplorable indeed ; and in view of it , what will you do ? Will you still give no listening ear to the tender expostulations of a dying Saviour ? Will you continue to grieve that holy Comforter by whose influence alone you can be saved ? Will you not stop , C , and make . the interests of your soul the first object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before it shall arrive the monument of /z/ death may tell the passing stranger , ' Here lies C. B. ' Now is your best , perhaps your only time . Let me affectionately urge you , by all the motives which can be drawn from heaven , earth , and hell , to escape for your life . After waiting so long Christ is still willing to receive you as a humble penitent trusting in his mercy , and in no other character can you ever be saved . Methinks while you read you will come to the resolution , that let others do what they will , you ' will serve the Lord . ' Do you resolve thus ? God and yourself only know . " Affectionately yours , /z/ Mr. Page 's connection with the Tract Society at Boston , led to his appointment as Depositary of the American Tract Society , formed at New York in the spring of 1825 . A few items of his history previous to his leaving his native place , remain yet to be gathered . " During the eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his respected pastor , ; ' he exhibited much decision of religious character , and much zeal and activity in the cause of Christ . Uncontrollable providences only could keep him from the house of God , where he performed a prominent part in his praises , and in the instruction /q/ of the Sabbath-school . Very few sermons were preached on the Sabbath or on weekdays which he did not hear , and the plans of which he did not preserve in writing . In seasons of the special outpouring of the Holy Spirit , he was one of the first to ' hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry-trees , ' and to bestir himself . He was in the conference and prayer-meetings , and his voice was heard in earnest supplication for the conversion of sinners . " He would converse faithfully with the careless , and search out and report to the pastor those who were seriously impressed . In the examination of candidates for admission to the church , not U7ifrequent references icere made to his conversation as a means of av/akening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important instrumentality in the conversion of many sinners . In seasons of spiritual declension , he did not feel that direct efforts for the conversion of men might be omitted ; and though few attended the prayer-meetings , he was sure to be one . If a little company united in concert prayer , or private prayer , he was among them . For a long period , three or four brethren , of whom he was one , devoted one evening in each week to prayer in the meeting-house , where , in secret , and without light for the natural eye , they supplicated the descent of the Spirit . Neither /z/ the members of the church nor the pastor knew of the meeting , till , at the approach of winter , it was transferred to his study ; they received a large accession to their number , were cheered with the special presence of the Comforter , and it proved the commencement of an interesting revival of religion " In seasons of stupidity , brother Page found individuals in whose spiritual welfare he manifested much interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect were not in vain in the Lord . From the time of his conversion so long as a resident here , he was ardent active , and untiring ; this characterizes the man ; and his efforts were ' princiimlly directed to one object , the conversion of sinners A valuable friend , Mr. D. W. , who was very intimate with Mr. Page , says , that at the close of religious meetings , his mind would often become intensehj fixed upon the conversion of some impenitent individual . He would address the individual with great solemnity , urging an immediate compliance with the terms of the gospel ; and as his friend accompanied him homewards , such was sometimes the pressure upon his heart , that they would seek a retired spot , and there , even in the depth of winter , kneel and plead with God for the person 's salvation . His anxiety for individuals was frequently such that he could not rest , but would iABORS AT COVENTRY . 137 leave his business to seek an interview with them , or address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these efforts were so retired that his wife came to the knowledge of them only as he alluded to them in their private supplications to God . " At social interviews , " says the same friend , " when a number of relatives met , and God and the value of the soul seemed to be forgotten , he would sometimes beckon to me , and we would go out , seek a place of retirement , and join in prayer for some perishing sinner ; and then return to the company under the hallowed influence of such an exercise . " Captain T. , a few days after his death , with tears fast flowing down his cheeks , bore witness to his fidelity to souls ; and added , " But for the efforts of Mr. Page and a dear Christian friend of his , my soul , to all human view , must have been lost . " Rev. M. B. says , " I was attending Mr. Page 's school when he became a Christian , and never shall I forget how he talked to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tliat my mind teas first seriously impressed P Mr. D. N. says , Mr. Page 's faithful conversation , as they were on the way to a prayer-meeting , was the means of tearing frcmi him a false hope , and bringing him at length , as he trusts , to the saving knowledire of Christ . /z/ Another estimable friend , Mr. C. T. , says , " His Christian character was unusually even , and unusually elevated . He deeply sympathized vith those in affliction and trials , and was ever ready to minister to their necessities , and contribute to their comfort . But his great object was to boiejit the soul , to bring the impenitent to Christ , and to awaken and quicken the people of God . I have often heard persons in relating their religious exercises say , ' Mr. Page 's conversation first led me to think seriously of my soul and eternity . ' " There was an interesting little meeting , " alluded to above by the pastor , " of which I think he was the mover , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , united in secret for prayer , and which was continued for about two years . They conversed , they wept , they prayed . He encouraged them to persevere , occasionally selected particular individuals as subjects of united prayer , and sometimes would earnestly inquire , ' Is there any thing whereby we can not be agreed in this thing ? Is there any unkind feeling among us ? " What is it that hinders the blessing V And this course was pursued till God appeared in the salvation of sinners . " Many , very many with whom he conversed and prayed were impressed at different times , little being known of his efforts for them till their hopeful /q/ conversion . His anxiety for them was often very great . He was distressed for them . From time to time he would say to a Christian brother , ' Pray for such a one ; ' and it seemed that he could not give over till they were brought to repentance , and sometimes almost that he must sink unless they were converted . *'He loved those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weep and rejoice with them . I have just met a brother who said , ' Were I to recall former scenes , I could tell many times when I have kneeled down alone with brother Page to pray . ' " One consideration that satisfied his mind of the propriety of changing his sphere of effort was , that he could think of no young j-ier son uithin the bounds of the co7tgregatio7i - siiid the young he ever considered as , under God , the hope of the church - whom he had 7wt seriously addressed , either perso ? ially or by letter , on the subject pf their salvation . Many of them had already united with the church , while others had become apparently insensible to the motives of the gospel . AVe have taken some pains to ascertain the subsequent history of the several individuals to whom the moving appeals inserted or referred to above were addressed , and the initials of many of whom /z/ are given ; and though four or five have continued still far from God , and two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faltered in their course , and the subsequent history of several is unknown , yet upwards of thirty are recognized who have either hopefully died in Christ , or still live adorning their profession of faith in him . A reference has also been made to lists of scholars belonging to the two schools in Coventry taught by Mr. Page , one for five and the other for two winters , being one hundred and ninety-five in all , the history of seventy of whom is unknown , and of the remaining one hundred and twenty-five , eightyfour are thought to have given evidence of piety , and six are preachers of the gospel . It is probable that his efforts for individuals were the means of increasing the obduracy of some , and of exciting in others a degree of personal hostility . The danger of both these results he seriously considered , and scrupulously endeavored to direct all his efforts with that kindness and discretion which should give no just occasion for either . But he came to the deliberate conclusion , that if he would be truly faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up his mind to do what the claims of God and of perishing souls required , leaving the results with him . To withhold the truths of the gospel because /q/ they may be perverted , would be to stop the mouth of every minister , and prevent the circulation of the pure word of God itself . " We , " says the great apostle to the Gentiles , " are a sweet savor of Christ in them that are saved , and in them that perish . To the one we are the savor of death unto death , and to the other a savor of life unto life . " Such is the effect of the gospel in every form in which it can be presented , though by " an angel from heaven ; " and in the mind of Him who commanded it to be " preached to every creature , " it constitutes no objection and no excuse for neglect of duty in any one , from the preacher addressing the great congregation , to the Bible and Tract distributer , the Sabbath-school teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his fellow-men for Christ and eternity . /z/ We now follow our brother into a new sphere of action - a plain and humble Christian , a stranger in a large city full of display and dissipation and crima , and with his hands full of responsible labor lor a public institution . Being appointed Agent of the General Depository of the American Tract Society , formed at New York in 1825 , he arrived in that city October 10th of that year . He had a few months before been spending some time in Norwich , Conn. , in drawing and engraving , and was strongly inclined to comply with a request to locate himself there ; but he felt that the opening for usefulness in connection with the American Tract Society was such that he " could not conscientiously decline it . " He had visited the city , and the responsibilities involved with the question whether his family could live on the compensation proposed caused him to pass a NEW FIELD OF LABOll. 143 sleepless night , till the text , " Trust hi the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and verily thou shalt be fed , ' resolved his doubts , and he determined to follow the indications of Providence and commit his way to him . The pressure of duty of which he speaks in the following letter rested upon him henceforward till his death , rendering his future correspondence somparatively brief , and confined to the points of practical interest which had at the moment the strongest hold on his mind . " New York , July 11 , 1826 . " Honored and dear Parents - I can write only A few hasty lines . My time is all so occupied that I can devote very little to friends , far less than I could desire , even to my dear father and mother . " Cousin H. P. left us last week for Troy , on hei way to Vermont . She is an interesting girl . Since she came here , I think there has been a material change in her character . She once thought that she lived in the enjoyment of religion , but grieved the Spirit , and for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable indications in her case . " I have lately taken the superinteTidence of a branch Sunday-school , connected with the Central /z/ church in Broome-street ; the old school to retain one hundred and fifty scholars , and mine to be increased till they are equal , and then add to both . " We have two large and commodious rooms , and hope both schools , if we can get teachers , will soon embrace five hundred scholars . I do n't know but I am taking too much upon me , but the request was so urgent that I could not deny it . With divine influence , it is a great field for usefulness . " I heard that a Wednesday evening prayermeeting was attended in Coventry , and that but three male members were present besides Rev. Mr. C. Alas , how fallen ! Is he not almost discouraged ? Shall there be no ' Aarons and Hurs ' to hold up his hands ? " Your affectionate son , /z/ Just before leaving his family , the young lady above alluded to wrote him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had been living , and her need of divine grace and strength to keep her from falling , and adds the grateful acknowledgment , " I feel , cousin H. , that you have been an instrument in the hand of God of awakening me , and directing me to a throne of mercy ; and could I approach it in an acceptable manner , I know you would be amply rewarded for all the anxiety you /q/ have felt on my account . I beg of you still to pray the Lord to have mercy upon me , to give me a sense of si ? t , to guard me against temptation , and to forgive and receive me . " From Troy she again wrote him a full letter , describing her religious feelings , thanking him for his fidelity , and asking his prayers ; and soon proceeded on her way to Vermont ; but before arriving at the place of her destination , she was called to her eternal state . On the 15th September , one of the officers of the church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The vacancy caused by your removal , " he adds , " is not filled . Many who used to lead in our prayer-meetings are removed ; others have retired , and the efficient , energetic members of the church are greatly diminished ; yet I hope there are some who are mourning over the desolations of Zion . " In a letter from Mr. Page to his parents , December 15 , he gives the following items : " Last evening we had the male and female children of our two Sabbath-schools arranged in the church , each side of the middle aisle , filling the slips from the pulpit to the door ; one hundred and thirty-four boys and nearly as many girls , with forty Page . 1 /z/ teachers , were present . E.ev . Mr. J. addressed them , and commanded the strictest attention . * ' We have at this time a great press of business .

" Sabbath Evening , 10 o'clock , March 11 , 1827 . " My dear Parents - Expecting an opportunity to send to-morrow , I improve a few moments to speak of the goodness of God to us , and of some interesting things which recently occurred . " 0 . E. K. arrived on Thursday . I hoped to heai by him of a powerful revival of religion in Coventry , and that many of my acquaintance were subjects of it ; but I am disappointed . What can be the cause ? Why is not the church awake ? Is any darling sin of more value than immortal sculs ? I will however give thanks , that some have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much affection to them all . " Besides a press of labor at the depository , I have hands full of hisiness more directly connected with the welfare of soids . " In the Sabbath-school under my charge are about twenty teachers , one half of whom were , not long since , without hope . Six of that number , promising young men , now give evidence of piety , and the remainder , I think , are unusually serious . One of the little boys I found to-day to be distressed for his sins , though the scholars in general are very careless . The school to-day consisted of one hundred and sixty-two boys . In the female school there have also been some conversions . " A teachers prayer-meeting hs been held weekly for both schools , and has been very solemn and interesting . At the last meeting about thirty were present . In sustaining this , considerable responsibility rests upon me . " In the cojigregation too , a wide field for effort is open , and there are very few efficient male members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number were deeply affected . There have been several instances of conversion besides those mentioned above . " In the Tract and Bible houses we have lately had a season of uncommon interest . A work of /z/ grace commenced a few weeks since among the young women employed in the two houses in folding and stitching Bibles and Tracts , as the fruits of which we now number about sixteen hopeful conversions . It has been a most interesting and wonderful display of God 's power and grace . On one day seven of them hope that they were brought from nature 's darkness into the light and liberty of the gospel . That was one of the most interesting days of my life . Twice or thrice I was sent for to pray with them , and to take the hand of those who had just been brought to bow at the Saviour 's feet , while with tears streaming from their eyes , they expressed the hope that they had surrendered themselves entirely to Him . Two of these had thought that I talked too severely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the very efforts in their behalf , of which they had before complained . To see those who were brought to hope in Christ clinging around their former companions in sin , and with tears beseeching them to come at once to the Saviour they had found so precious , was enough to move a heart of stone . I could say much more ; but this must suffice . It was indeed the wonderful power of God . This week we design to have a general meeting for all employed in both houses , male and female , and hope God has still greater blessings in store . The /q/ meetings have hitherto been sustained chiefly hy those connected with the societies , and an active Christian who resides near . " I say these things that you may see that J have a field in which I may labor to good ad van tage ; whether I enter it with all my heart is another question . " My love to my dear sister . " Your affectionate son , /z/ We well remember the day above alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's countenance ; and when attempting to pursue his accustomed business , his mind seemed scarcely to know how his hands were employed . His inmost spirit seemed on fire with love to souls , and joy and exultation in the triumphs of divine grace . " Never before , " said he , " have I so sensibly felt the presence of the Spirit , or the force of those words , ' Stand still , and see the salvation of the Lord . ' " In a letter to his parents , August 21 , 1827 , he expresses great alarm at the prevalence of iniquity and infidelity in the city , and mentions that a club of infidels regularly assembled on Sabbath evening , in a spacious room , where their principles were inculcated in every alluring and deceptive form upon the minds of hundreds . /z/ " Pray for us , " he proceeds . " Were it not that the Lord of hosts is jealous for his own glory , we should have nothing to expect but to see the wicked triumph .

We need now forty missionaries with the zeal of Paul , to proclaim God 's truth to these perishing multitudes . But no persevering energetic means are yet adopted to obtain any The facts concerning the infidel meetings above referred to , Mr. Page at this time carefully collected and published in the religious papers , as an incitement to Christians generally to redouble their exertions . One of the four individuals who so long met in concert for private prayer at Coventry , writes to Mr. Page , August 25 , that he had just attended a prayermeeting at his father 's , where his children were present on a visit , and adds , " While pleading for them , my heart was very much enlarged ; I seemed /q/ to climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the many , how many precious seasons I had spent in retirement with you and my two other friends , in pouring out our supplications especially for our children , I seemed to ' travail in birth ' for them , till Christ should ' be formed in them ' the hope of glory . " To this letter he replied as follows : " Thursday Evening , New York , Sept. 13 . " My dear Brother - Your very kind and fraternal letter almost overwhelmed us . You know , my dear brother , the tender chords of a parent 's heart , and the thrilling sensations produced Avhen they are made to vibrate by the efforts and prayers of Christian friends , who feel for the salvation of our children . As you described the scene at my father 's , and showed me my dear brethren pleading for the souls of my children , I could only weep with gratitude , that some supplications had arisen for them from those who stood near the mercy-seat . You will , I trust , remember them still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little praying circles .

" Your affectionate friend and brother , /z/ Under date of November 4 , 1827 , we have a letter from Mr. J.

Mrs. H. was residing in the family of Mr , Page , and had written to her husband of his fidelity in warning , instructing , and praying for her , and of the joy and peace she then had in believing in Jesus . Mr. Page had also written him to confirm the joyful tidings . The deep emotions of the husband are poured out in a full sheet .

This to me is all unknown .

Last Thursday was observed by a number of us as a day of fasting and prayer . There has been one instance of hopeful conversion to-day . " An estimable and pious young lady , Miss B. , has informed the writer , that on bacoming acquainted with Mr. Page , in 1827 , he soon inquired if she was " a professor of religion ; " and again , if she * ' had an interest in Christ ; " if she " thought it desirable ; ' ' if she " had sought to obtain it ; " if she " had renounced the world , and resolved to live for the glory of God ; " could she " give him the reason why she had not .

The work of grace in our congregation is gradually progressing . Thirty-five were present at the last inquiry-meeting , and several have recently indulged hope , some of whom are teachers in my school . " Last evening we had a meeting , which all in the Bible and Tract houses , male and female , were invited to attend . It was very full and solemn . The day was observed by the females in the two houses as a day of prayer , and of special thanksgiving to God for what he has done for them the /z/ past year ; it beiiig just one year from last evening that the first prayer-meeting was attended with them .

" At this time , his pastor being ill , and there being an urgent call for ministerial labor , it was proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coventry , and labor a few weeks in the city . In endeavoring to induce the church with which he had formerly been connected to yield to his request , Mr. Page thus wrote , February 28 : " I do believe , that could the good people of Coventry come here and see for themselves the great want of such labor as Mr. C. could bestow - could they see the thousands here going down to the grave and to perdition without instruction , and so many as there are among us solemnly affected in view of their sins , I am sure they would be willing to make any sacrifice that the great work of salvation may not be retarded . There is another world than this . Pastor and people can not be /or ever together on earth - death will sunder the strongest ties ; and in heaven how must it enhance the joys of the blessed , that by means of their willing sacrifices here , multitudes have been prepared to unite with them in songs for redeeming grace . I /q/ iiope the dear brethren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray over it , and be prepared to say , ' The will of the Lord be done . ' " The following extract from a letter to his friend A.

What mean the interesting movements of the last half-year ? When I look at them and view the hand of God in them my heart warms , and I anticipate Avith astonishment the still more wonderful operations of his hand . This is indeed an eventful day . Every enterprise for Zion prospers . What would once have occupied an age , is now performed as in a day .

" Blessed , thrice blessed , " he says , " was tlvat hour , when the Lord directed my steps to the Sabbath-school , where I formed a friendship with one which I hope will continue to all eternity . Yes , dear brother , it was your kind voice that was the instrument in the hand of God , of arresting a thoughtless icretch aid leading him to the Saviour .

No parent , or husband , or brother can then help you . Prayer mU cease to be availing . The Saviour himself will be against you .

If there is one im'penitent individual within the circle of our influence , whom we have not done all we can to bring to Christ , let no time be lost , let us do our duty to that soul .

" His pastor having visited Europe for his health , Mr. Page , June 14 , transmitted to him a narrative of what God had done for those employed in the /z/ Tract and Bible houses , hoping that it might be used as an incitement to efforts for those similarly employed for the kindred institutions in London . In this communication he states that more than one hundred young women were then employed in the Tract and Bible houses , and that of these God had brought " hetiveen fifty mid sixty hopefully into his kingdom . One of them was convicted by means of the truths which caught her eye while folding the tract , * Day of Judgment .

Every day at twelve o'clock , the females of each of the two houses devote a part of their recess , in their retired rooms , to prayer and praise ; and on every Thursday evening we have a general meeting for prayer and conference , conducted by three or four brethren , the binder and printer of the two Societies cordially taking part in the same . " A few days after this he states that the seamstresses employed by Mrs. J. , residing not far distant , had also joined in the meetings of the Tract and Bible houses ; that he had personally conversed with several of them , and ih.2it five of them had obtained hope in Christ .

Although absent in body , I do not forget our friends in the Societies ' houses . God has done much , yet there remaineth more to be accomplished , and we , as coworkers , have much land yet to possess . May He who has hitherto helped us still be our guide and stay , and then , if our faith fail not , we have nothing to fear . Tell our dear sisters in Christ to persevere like good soldiers of the cross , counting nothing too dear to part with for him .

Five of these were among the seven mentioned March 11 , 1827 , as having obtained hope in one day ; and thirty-six gave by request each one a written narrative of her own religious exercises . It is an interesting fact , that though Mr. Page knew that those for whom he here labored were connected with different religious denominations , he neither knew nor wished to know to which most of the individuals respectively belonged .

They were at our meeting this evening , borne down with a sense of sin ; and as I spoke to one of them , she sohbed aloud . God has been in our meeting to-night . An awful solemnity has pervaded it .

I begged him , for his wife 's sake , and for his own soul 's sake , to seek an interest in Christ . He grasped my hand , and could hardly let me go . Miss C. appears to be wide awake in religion - a changed creature indeed .

Besides the routine of his official duties , he attended the prayer-meetings at daybreak ; visited many individuals at intervals during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a short prayer with them , and giving them the instruction he thought best adapted to their state ; almost every evening he was in a religious meeting , and generally expending all the powers of his mind and heart for the eternal welfare of some individuals he there met ; the spiritual welfare of his own children and household , and of more than two hundred teachers and scholars in his Sabbathschool , pressed upon his heart ; and the full measure of his powers was employed , that , while the Holy Spirit was descending , not a sheaf of the spiritual harvest should be lost . His mind and his movements were rapid . The chain of co7imunicationfrom his own to others ' hearts was bright /q/ His feelings were thrown out into a prayer-meeting or a Sabbath-scliool , or in visiting families or individuals , almost instantaneously , as soon as his lips were opened ; he accomplished very much in the space of a day ; and in the ardor of his efforts , while having a spirit of prayer , and seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him coolly to sit down and calculate whether his strength of body could long endure the continual drafts made upon it . A few days hence might be the season for relaxing his endeavors ; but now was the season of effort , and tliat now was , with him , almost perpetual . As the warm season approached , and brought with it accumulated labors for the society he served , he found that his incessant effort had exceeded his bodily strength , and occasioned a renewed inaction of the liver , accompanied by a slight bleeding at the lungs , which nothing but repose could restore , and which for several weeks confined him chiefly to his room . In this state of health , he felt compelled , on May 14th , to tender his resignation as siijperintendent of the Sahbath-school , to the duties of which station he had consecrated his vigorous and perseveringefforts for nearly five years , and with the most encouraging success . Among the means of usefulness in this sphere , Page . 12 /z/ he had formed a Sahbath-school Tem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experiment had then been made ; and he had at length the pleasure to have enrolled the names of thirty-two teachers , and onehundred and eighty mnle pupils , as subscribers to the temperance pledge . Finding that many of the boys were j'ofane , he also made assiduous endeavors to correct that evil ; frequently calling on all to give testimony by rising , whether they had sworn during the week , and using all possible means to induce them to reverence the name of God . His report on this subject states , that whereas three-fourths of the boys had formerly been profane , he had reason to believe that only a few hardened individuals persisted in the sin . The sins of lying and of Sabbath-breakiiig among them , he also labored perseveringly to correct ; and frequently held meetings of such as were serious , at his own house , for conversation and prayer . Especially did the religious welfare of the teachers , many of whom , in the earlier part of his connection with the school , were not pious , engage his ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent , thirty-tico male teachers hopefully embraced Christ and united with the church , nine of whom have entered on a course preparatory to the ministry . Another teacher , Mr. R. 0 . D. , /q/ whose heart was knit with his in this labor of love , became a preacher of the gospel , and consecrated himself to the work of a missionary in India . Though devoting his efforts more immediately as superintendent of the large male Sabbath-schcol , the female school was also under his general supervision . In a communication to the female teachers at the time of his resignation , he says , " I would gratefully acknowledge the loving-kindness of our God , in permitting me to be associated so long with such a band of Christ 's friends ; and allowing me to witness the hopeful turning to him oi from fifty to sixty m- more teachers , connected with our two schools , and several of the scholars , all of whom I hope to meet at last in the great assembly of the redeemed in heaven . " As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , he repaired to Coventry , where he spent several weeks of rest from every effort beyond the degree of exercise on horseback and otherwise , which was essential to his most rapid restoration . During this season of relaxation , he amused himself by drawing sketches of various scenes in the place of his nativity , among which he did not omit the humble dwelling where he had spent near thirty-four years of his life , and where , at the period of his death , his aged parents still resided . The /z/ sketch is a fac-similc of the house , the joiner 's shop , and the surrounding objects . After his return to New York , at the request of one who had often attended the meetings in the societies ' houses , he copied it into her album ; and as the claims of poetry were alike unheeded by both , he threw underneath it the following lines : " Here , a child , I sinned and strayed j Here , the Saviour disobeyed ; Here , I felt his chast'ning rod ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reference to his illness , he wrote to Mrs. Page , " We have great occasion to speak of the goodness of God to us . We have hardly as yet been called to ' run with the footmen . ' Let us see to it , that we secure a divine helper to sustain us when called to ' contend with horses , ' and meet the ' swellings of Jordan . ' " A letter to a relative , October 11 , contains the following passage : " Has M. indeed done all he can do ? Let him then fall at the feet of Jesus , and tell Him so . Let him tell him that he would love him , that he would submit to him , that he would be sorry for his sins , that he would be an obedient child ; but he cannot. 0 , how unwilling the sinner is to confess all the guilt which the word of God imputes /q/ to him , and to acknowledge himself justly condemned .

" Let it be your first object - for without this , all other acquirements will be in vain - to be a humble , holy , consistent Christian , till death shall separate you from all earthly scenes and responsibilities . " By uniform kindness and propriety of deportment , endeavor to merit the love and respect of all . Never indulge a spirit of retaliation . Yield a cheerful obedience to the requisitions of your instructors ; join no combination for resisting authority ; and mingle with no companions whose reputation you would not wish to share . " Be careful of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment for yourself or the /z/ world ; govern your appetite , have regular hours for sleep and exercise . Do not place too much confidence in a vigorous constitution ; it will not long be trifled with with imp-anity . " The Bible should be your daily text - book ; and according to the request of your mother , endeavor also to read every day a portion of Baxter 's Saints ' Rest , or some kindred author , and to form your life by such models . If your studies will permit , always have some useful book in a regular course of reading . " In your religious duties , as in every thing else , system will be necessary . Let nothing prevent your holding communion with God , on your knees in your closet , at least tv/ice every day . Meditate there , as well as read and pray . Daily prayer with your room-mate should be maintained , if agreeable to him ; but let not this be made a sub stitute for closet prayer . Unite yourself with a select circle for social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the exercises when requested . In hearing preaching , guard against a spirit of criticism . Let the Sabbath be to you a holy day . Remember it as God would have you , " Keep constantly in mind , that the object of your education is to prepare you to do the greatest possible good ; and try to be useful every day . /q/ Think much of Christ , and commit your all to him . Go on , my son ; aim to be eminently holy and eminently useful ; and may the Holy Spirit guide and cheer and bless you . " Make confidants of your parents . None will sympathize with you like them . They will soon sleep m the dust .

" Having resigned the superintendence of the Sabbath-school , he labored , as he regained his health , to promote its interests by visiting to obtain scholars ; and about the beginning of the year 1832 , commenced instructing du female Bible-class ; and also yielded to earnest solicitations by assuming the superuitentlence of the sy stern of Christian effort in connection with tract distribution hi the Fourteenth icard containing not far from three thousand families , in which work he had the cooperation of thi:ty-six male and female tract visitors . They had not long pursued this enterprise , when he clearly saw , that as little more was done than // to present a tract monthly to each family , there was no such direct , faitlifid , ' personal , and perseverijig effort and ivrestling pi-aijer for particular individuals , as duty to God and the souls of men demanded . At the meeting of his fellow-laborers in January , he therefore laid the subject solemnly and earnestly before them , depicting the spiritual wants of the ward , and the condition of hundreds of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who , unless reached by their efforts , would probably never have the offers of salvation pressed on their attention . He urged their obligations to God and the souls of the perishing ; and then inquired of each distributer , whether there were not in his district some one or more individuals for whom he felt that there was special encouragement to labor , and to whose salvation he would direct his own devoted efforts and prayers , till he should have evidence of conversion or that the door of useful access was closed . It was made a subject of prayer and heart-searching with each distributer , till one fixed his mind on one individual , another on two , and another on three or more ; and by the thirty-six distributers eightyeight individuals were thus selected as special subjects of their prayers and affectionate endeavors for their salvation . This gave them , as will be readily conceived , a /q/ new impulse in their Avork . They saAv a distir.ct object before them , important as eternity , and yet one in Avhich they could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avent to the throne of mercy . They AAent to the subjects of their affectionate solicitude , and their mouths were filled Avith arguments . Access Avas easy . The Spirit of God seemed to have gone before them , and to go with them . His duties as superintendent did not prevent him from taking a portion of this Avork regularly upon himself . An instance of the encouragement he met is recorded in the folloAving letter . To Mrs. Page . " New York , June 21 , 1832 . ' Last evening I closed up our efforts in the tract distribution for this month , and gaA'e in my report . A fcAV hours before the meeting , I found that a district of seAenty-eight families had not been supplied ; and to complete the distribution for the Avard , undertook to supply it myself .

They hoped they had surrendered themselves to him on the preceding evening . They had opened to each other freely the feelings of their hearts ; and had that morning erected the family altar , and were now determined to live together as fellow heirs of the grace of life . " The husband of the woman who was thought last month to give evidence of conversion , is now also rejoicing with her , and they appear to be walking together in wisdom 's paths .

Most Christians- who have remained in the city , have exhibited a delightful trust in Christ as their all-sufficient refuge . Frequent occasions have oflered , and been improved , for faithful conversation and prayer with those who were not accustomed to pray ; and I can not but hope that the efforts of tjp season will result in the salvation of some precious souls . The tract on Cholera has been distributed throughout the city , and almost universally received with thankfulness .

As I have not the satisfaction of seeing you all at our regular meetings , 1 had determined to visit you at your own places of /z/ abode , that we might quicken and encourage each other , and unite in imploring the blessing of God on our great and responsible work , but hitherto the Lord has prevented me . " Now , my dear friends , as you value the immortal soul , and the favor of our divine Leader , I would urge upon every one of you to enter on your duties Ijith new zeal , new hopes , and new confidence in God . Endeavor to fix in your mind what it is to live for ever in heaven or in hell .

How many , if you do your duty , may you meet at last on mount Zion , who shall bless God for ever that you found them when lost and wandering from him . " Fix it in your mind that you must not be satisfied , unless through your agency sinners are brought to repentance ; nor rest till you see each of your districts as a well-watered garden , and the reviving and saving influences of God 's Spirit operating in every family . I know that in some districts there are many things discouraging , but you . must adopt the language of Paul , ' I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .

" And now , my dear father , as flesh and heart fail , I trust God is ' the strength of your heart , ' and that your hope in him , through Christ , is steadfast . I know that to the impenitent sinner the near approach of death and eternity is an unwelcpme theme , but not so to the saint . It is his delight to think and speak about home - that home which Christ has gone to prepare ; and thougn you and my dear mother may have almost finished youi // journey here , I hope neither of you regret that its end is so near ; but that you can wait calmly and patiently till your change come , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the billows of death .

But I feel assured that God has sent these chastisements in mercy , and hope they will bring us all nearer to him . The family send love , and may we all meet at last in the kingdom of our Redeemer .

" The state of things in our church is more than commonly interesting . Nearly fifty attended the inquiry-meeting last evening . " Your affectionate father , /z/ May 30th , he says , " W. F. departed this life yesterday , and his brother G. is almost gone . Their tender-hearted father said to me , that he had rather bury them both in a day , and have all his anticipations of their speedily entering the ministry cut off , than to see one of them twenty-four years of age in health but impenitent .

" Again , he says , " We have had an interesting Page 13 /z/ church prayer-meeting this evening spent in conversing with the members . We have sadly declined , and some are beginning to feel it . " I am now so pressed with business on all sides , that I can hardly find time to write even a few lines . " In December , he says , " Those engaged : n tract labors throughout the city , have just observed a day of fasting and prayer . The meetings were full and solemn , morning and afternoon ; and in the evening a sermon was preached from , ' Ye are the salt of the earth , ' showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt for the salvation of those around him . " We have commenced meetings again in the bindery of the Bible house . On Friday evening about eighty were present , and a deep solemnity was apparent . " " Saturday Evening , January 25 , 1834 . " My DEAR Parents - The Lord has in great kindness thus far preserved our health the present winter , for which I know we are not sufficiently thankful . There is an uncommon interest in religion in several of the churches , in some of which it is hoped from thirty to sixty have been converted to God . " Monday Morning , Jan. 27 . Since the above date , we have passed through scenes which will never be eflaced from my memory . On Saturday /q/ evening , C. and A. , " ( a niece , ) " returned from meeting about nine . Nothing was said , and all were seated , when A. broke the silence by sobbing in great distress for her soul . The Holy Spirit had set her sins in order before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible and blessed Agent was present ; and only C. could restrain his tears . I asked the sobbing child what was the cause of her distress . She replied that she was a great sinner against God . I endeavored to present Christ clearly to her mind as the Saviour of sinners , and show her her duty to humble herself at his feet , and yield herself without delay wholly to him . We all knelt and committed her case to God with strong crying and tears . It was hard to 3ease pleading till we had evidence that she had surrendered herself to Christ . But there seemed a reluctance to yield up all for him . After further conversation and prayer , Mrs. Page and myself re tired to our chamber , where we again plead for her and the other children before God , and committed ourselves to rest . " About one o'clock , A. came to our bedside , saying , ' I hope I have given my heart to Christ . I have been a very naughty girl . Do forgive me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you wish to have me . ' " On Sabbath morning , W. , " ( a nephew , ) " was // alarmed in view of his sins . When he came from church at noon , he was overwhelmed . The family were all in tears . We all fell on our knees and spent an hour in prayer , W. still sobbing and begging for mercy . " These scenes afiected C. The most solemn attention to the concerns of their souls was manifested by him and W. at the meetings in the afternoon and evening , and during the remainder of the day ; and now both are hoping in Christ , and seem resolved to serve him alone . I hope for them with trembling . Time will determine whether the work is genuine . God grant that they may not be deceived . It will be wonderful grace indeed , if these three children , from eleven to twelve years old , have all been born again ; but it is such grace as God in Christ can bestow . My dear parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us , may be such as shall stand the test of the final day . " Your affectionate son , /z/ About this time an urgent application was made to him to unite in forming and sustaining the " Brainfrd church " in a very destitute part of the city - afterwards located in Rivington-street , and then in the Second avenue . He felt the force of the request ; for he had well considered the moral /q/ desolations of the city , and prayed and wept over them . To his mind no duty was clearer or more important , than that members of the older churches , filled to a great extent with professors of religion , should separate , as fields of usefulness open , and go out to form new circles of religious influence . And if it was the duty of some , and others did not enlist in the enterprise , why should he not go himself ? True , his health was already enfeebled , and the additional labor might crush him ; but he was not accustomed to spare himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the call of duty . This transfer of his field of labor made it necessary that he should resign the superintendence of the tract distribution in the Fourteenth ward , which he did on the 12th of February ; " having felt , " as he said , ' &#9632; ' &#9632; WMre and more fully convinced of the comIdleteness of the plan of the tract mission , if but faithfully carried out by praying , self-denying , a7id devoted Christians . ' ' In a scrap which he seems to have prepared as a memorandum for an address to tract distributers or missionaries , perhaps on their day of fasting and prayer in December , 1833 , the following facts appear : From March , 1829 , to January , 1832 , only faur cases of conversion were reported from the Fourteenth ward , three of which were by a blessing o /z/ the reading of tracts . Little more was done tliar to present them from door to door ; spiritual lift was wanting ; and the laborers were becoming disheartened . Of the eighty-eight individuals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved steadfastly to pray and labor , more than thirty were reported in February , as at least in some degree anxious for their souls , and three of the number as rejoicing in God ; in March , /ozr ; in April , six ; in May , three ; in June , six ; and tivelve in the subsequent months ; making in all thirty-fmir hopeful conversions from that ward within the year 1832 . Of this number three or four were awakened by reading the tracts , and others apparently by means of the prayers and exhortations of the distributers Many of the poor and afflicted people of God , for saken by the world , had been found and comforted some backsliders reclaimed ; and the gospel mes sage delivered to numbers who continued to disre gard it . Many interesting instances of the blessing of God on these efforts are alluded to in the memo randum ; and it is stated , that almost all of them are the cases of individuals who were scarcely reached by any other means of grace . The separation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happily and usefully connected , was indeed trying ; but he went to the /q/ new field of labor with the prayers and kindest wishes and sympathies of his brethren . " All the time he was with us , ' ' says the pastor , * ' he was a man of kind and peaceful spirit ; always grieved at dissension in the churches , and laboring to promote a spirit of love . " He was always prompt in action . What ho undertook we knew would be done , and well done ; and he was ready to any work to which the great Master called him - not shrinking from self-denial , nor asking to be excused . In our meetings of religious inquiry , he was a safe and faithful laborer . Often would he seem to fix his heart intensely on the salvation of some individual ; and as he saw the prospect of good , would labor with him till the hour was gone , and then accompany him to his home , still toiling to remove obstacles from the mind and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe their salvation , under God , to his faithful and persevering labors , in the prayermeeting , in the Sabbath-school , in the Bible-class , and especially to his personal conversation and guidance in the Christian course . His eye was single . He had one definite object before him : it was not fame , or family , or ease , or pleasure - but to lionor Christ in the salvation of men . This singleness of purpose made him skilful and prompt in adopting means , and was the grand secret of his success . /z/ " He left us to go to a new and unbroken field , where the toil of gathering a church was all to be borne anew ; but he felt that he was consecrated not to one particular church , but to Christ ; and must go , and that cheerfully , at his bidding . Wi'th four such Aarons and Hurs to hold up his hands and cooperate with him , any faithful and qualified minister would be strong , under the blessing of God , for building up a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , Mr. Page again assumed the responsibilities of su'perlntendent of the Sabhatli-school ; and put forth his devoted energies to bring the gospel , by all practicable means , to bear effectually on the sur rounding population , old and young . His labors for the Tract Society were undiminished ; and it was scarcely to be expected that the constant pressure of his varied and ceaseless efforts , and the exhausting excitement of mind continually connected with them , should not bring back that derangement of the vital organs from which he had repeatedly suffered . Under date of March 25 , he thus writes to his parents : " These tabernacles of clay are wearing down , and will soon be demolished . How little should we depend upon them . If we are God 's children , we have in prospect a more glorious body , where /q/ all is filled with the fulness of God . Let us look much to it , and patiently wait for it . " His strength was sustained till the results of the year in his department were prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary season had subsided , when he found himself exhausted , was obliged to remit his exertions , and at the advice of his physician , spent several days at Saratoga springs , but with no improvement to his health . He returned to the cit ) ' ' , and gradually declined till about the first of August , when it became apparent to himself and others , that his earthly labors , except from his dying bed , were closed . A brief letter to his son , June 4 , concludes with these words : " Now I have done . Let no good resolutions be forgotten or neglected . Hemember , remember duty - God - Christ - - judgment - heaven - hell . " Your affectionate father , " H. PAaE . " To his daughter he wrote from Troy , June 23 , on his return from the springs , " I trust I had some special consolation last evening , in committing myself , my family , and all our concerns into the hands of that Redeemer whose long-suffering and mercy are without measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we should not desire /z/ him to change his mode of discipline in any of details . " Two days later , he writes , " I have for some time been depressed in body and spirit , have felt many anxieties and solicitudes , and had but little communion with God . I think , however , that within a few days I have had a satisfaction in resigning all my concerns to the disposal of Him , who , I am confident , will pursue the best possible course of discipline , though often demanding strong faith , when the reasons of his dispensations are so entirely concealed . In order to be ripened for heaven , I need a great deal of purification by the Holy Spirit . Of his labors in connection with the " Brainerd church , " the young clergyman who commenced ministerial labors there , says , " His influence , while the Lord continued him with us , was excellent . He was always engaged - always spiritual . His zeal seemed to suffer no declension ; it savored of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful tact in conducting our prayer-meetings and making them interesting - always diversified , and yet always solemn . His remarks , though simple , were never commonplace . The point and S2nrit of them appeared to have been premeditated , and they were generally well adapted to the character and condition of those present . In superintending /q/ the Sabbath-school , he would in a remarkable degree fix the attention of the children . He had also a happy talent for addressing strangers on the subject of personal religion ; and after our meetings would almost always single out some individual , and engage in close personal conversation . Several persons were in this way brought under conviction of sin , and some will have reason to bless God to eternity for his persevering faithfulness . His loss we feel deeply . He loved those with whom he had here been laboring , and prayed for us on his dying bed . Our members were very much attached to him , and constantly and fervently prayed that his life might be spared , could it be consistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he gave the least attention , was to look at the annexed sketch of one of the scenes of the labors of David Brainerd . He had visited the spot , and drawn the sketch , and Dr. A. , having engraved it on wood , called to present it , and see if it had his approbation . " I will look at it ; but I have done with every thing here . " " You can cast your eye upon it now , and look at it again , perhaps , when you are stronger . " " No ; I shall never look at it again . My work here is all done. /z/ It may not be unimportant to bring together some of the cltaracteristics of his efforts to honor Christ in the salvation of individicals , as illustrated in the preceding history . It was the burden of his heart , and the puoyose of his life . When engaged in his usual business , the religious welfare of persons with whose state he had become acquainted , was generally pressing on his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before he died , he almost always had by him a Tnemorandum of the names and residence of a feiv i7idividuals with whom he was to converse . On these he would call , as he went to and from his office , or religious meetings ; and if 7io names ivere on this list , he felt that he was doing little good . He also uniformly had in his hat more or less awakening tracts , that he might present as he should judge them adapted to the state of those he met . Not unfrequently he would seize a few moments from his usual occupation , to go out and address some individual ; and when the business of the day was closed , he hastened to some meeting /q/ or otler religious engagement for the evening . It is believed that an entire month has frequentlyelapsed , during which he did not sit down for an hour , even in the bosom of his own family , to relax his mind or rest . Every evidence of good accomplished gave him new joy , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt that , under God , the eternal joy or woe of immortal souls depended on his fidelity . Each evening and each hour brought its duties which he felt could not be neglected or postponed . The present duty was still before him ; and though " faint , " he was still " pursuing . " His labors on the Sabbath were not less exhausting than on other days ; and he doubtless thus failed of obtaining that " compensation for toil " which the animal constitution requires , and which is essential to a long life . When urged , at the close of a day of fatigue , to spare himself and spend the evening at home , he would say , " Do n't attempt to persuade me away from duty . I have motive enough within myself to tempt me to enjoy repose with my family , but that will not save souls . " A little previous to his last sickness , as he returned from church coughing , he was asked if Jie had not spoken too much in the Sabbath-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could I help it , when all eyes were /z/ fixed , and the children seemed to devour every word I said ? " It was not uncommon , at different periods of his life , for him in sleep to imagine himself addressing the impenitent ; and to wake in a high state of excitement and in tears , occasioned by the deep sympathy he felt for their perishing condition . It is also known , that when he saw no manifestations of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit , he would be , at times , in deep distress - would wrestle mor &; abundantly in prayer , renew his efforts to arouse Christians to duty and awaken the impenitent ; and more or less conversions were almost always the result . In short , it was not the great object of his spiritual life himself to be happy in religion but rather by persevering labors and holy self-denial , like the apostle who testified that he died daily , to glorify God in winning souls to him . He ardently desired to devote the whole undivided efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of providing for the support of his family prevented it . He had the most clear view of the necessity to every man of being born again . As soon as an individual came into his presence it seemed to be the first question of his mind , " Js this a friend or an enemy of God ? " The next thing was , if impenitent , to do something for his conversion ; or if /q/ a Christian , to encourage him in duty . Whatever else he saw in an individual , he felt that it availed him nothing unless he had received Christ to his heart by a livmg faith . This he felt and urged to be the sinner 's first , great , and only duty in which he could be acceptable to God . This was exem plified at a meeting of his Sabbath-school teachers , when he called on each to know whether he thought he had a well-grounded hope in Christ or aot , and recorded their several replies . Among them was an amiable young merchant , A. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the kingdom of God . " Have you a hope ? " he tenderly inquired . " No , sir , " was the reply . " Then I'mto put down your name as having ao hope ? " " Yes , sir . " * ' Well , I write down your name as having no hope . " The young man pondered on this decision and record of his spiritual state , was troubled , and soon came to our brother , saying , " I told you to put me down as having no hope , but I ca n't say that . " He is now a member of the church , and a decided supporter of all her institutions . He brought his efforts to bear upon individuals , and followed up impressions made . All the tri- /z/ umphs of the gospel he knew consist in the conversion and sanctification of individuals and he was not satisfied with merely praying and contributing for the salvation of the world as a whole , or having a general impression made on the minds of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be turned from sin to God . Not unfrequently he would observe in the congregation a person unknown to him , who seemed to give solemn attention to divine truth , ascertain who he was , and seek a personal interview ; and in all CASES , if he left an individual to-day in an interesting state of mind , he would endeavor to see him again to-morrow , and follow up the impression at brief intervals till there was no longer encouragement , or he had evidence of true conversion . He had a clear sense of obligation , both in the sinner to beli*eve in Christ , and in the Christian to devote all his powers to God . He felt , and labored to make others feel , that if any one neglected duty the guilt was all his own ; that God was ever ready to receive the returning prodigal ; and that if any withheld their hearts , or aught they possessed from him , in the day of judgment they would ( e speechless . This sense of obligation he urged with unabating fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and immediately carried out in an entire consecration to God . /q/ " Brother , " said he to a lovely Christian who vatched with him , " when you meet impenitent Binners , do n't merely say calmly , ' Friend , you are in danger ; ' but approach them with a holy violence , and labor to ' pull them out of the fire . ' They are going to perdition . There is a heaven and a hell . " As a brother from Boston to whom several of his letters were addressed , had called for a few moments in his last illness , and was about taking leave , he asked the dying man if he had any particular thought on his mind to express as he bade him farewell . " Ah , I can say nothing , " he replied , " but what has been repeated over and over ; but could I raise my voice to reach a congregation of sinners , I would tell them , ' their feet shall slide in due time ' - they ' shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christ . " He not only endeavored to alarm impenitent men , but to bring them to a decision that they will be the Lord 's . While in his native town , he was absent one evening till so late an hour that his wife remonstrated with him for unreasonably tasking his own health , and separating himself from home . " I have spent this time , " said he , " in trying to persuade your poor impenitent brother to give his fieart to Christ . " That impenitent brother was Pase. 14 2i0 LIFE OF HARLAN PAGE . soon brought to accept of mercy , pursued a course of tlieological study , and is now serving God in the ministry . On another occasion , while residing in the city of New York , he had gone to a religious meeting and returned late in the evening , when he was reminded of the danger that his protracted efforts might he more than he could ultimately sustain . " I have been standing this hour , " was his reply , " at the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of the teachers of his Sabbathschool , " and trying to persuade him to submit to God . " AYithin a few hours the young man found peace ; he soon resumed his studies which he had been pursuing for other ends , and he became a devoted minister of Christ , first at the West , and then in one of our principal Atlantic cities . A letter from this young clergyman , received as these sheets Mere going to press , thus confirms this brief statement . " The name of brother Page Avill ever be associated in my mind with all that is worthy of imita tion in the Christian character . By the persuasions of an acquaintance , I was induced to engage as teacher in his Sabbath-school , and though I was then destitute of faith , he welcomed me and won my confidence and love . Very soon he began to address me with the utmost apparent tendernes /q/ and anxiety in reference to my own salvation . His words sunk deep into my heart . They were strange words , for though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first ichofor nine or ten years had taken me by the hand and kindly asked , ' Are you a Christian ? ' Do you intend to be a Christian V ' Why not now V Each succeeding Sabbath brought him to me with anxious inquiries after my soul 's health . On the third or fourth Sabbath he gave me the tract , ' Way to be Saved , ' which deepened my impressions . At his request , I also attended a teacher 's prayer-meeting conducted by him , where my soul was bowed down and groaned under the load of my guilt . At the close of the meeting Mr. Page took my arm as we proceeded on our way to our respective homes , and urged upon me the duty and privilege of an immediate surrender of my heart to Christ . As we were about to part he held my hand , and at the corner of the street , in a wintry night , stood pleading with me to repent of sin and submit to God . I returned to my home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my chamber before God , and entered into a solemn covenant to serve him henceforth in and through the gospel of his Son . God was pleased , I trust , by his Holy Spirit , to seal my vows . If I have since had any Christian joy , or done any thing to advance the cause of Christ , it /z/ is to be attributed to the divine blessing on the faithfulness of brother Page . " He expected success from God through the blessing of the Holy Sj ) irit in answer to prayer . He felt that humble , self-denying effort , made in God 's strength , he ivoidd oivn and bless , but that for this he would be " inquired of " by his people . He LOVED PRAYER . Besides prayers at social meetings with the families and individuals he visited , and on special occasions frequently recurring , he regularly not only conducted family worship accompanied by singing , but every morning and evening prayed with his companion as they retired and rose , and also poured out his heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when in his native place , he often retired to a consecrated spot in a grove near his father 's house . If one of the household were about to take a journey , the family assembled and commended each other to God , which was frequently done on other occasions of special interest . His prayers were usually short and fervent , and confined mainly to those topics which pressed with special force upon his mind . At all times , prayer seemed to be a privilege , and the throne of grace a resting-place and a solace to his heart . There is no doubt that it was by continual and fervent prayer , that he imbibed that glowing sense of eternal /q/ things , that love to souls and that heavenly unction which were at once the spring of his fidelity , and , under God , the ground of his success . So anxious was he that there should be more prayer in the churches , and such were his hopes that if the duty were properly presented , it would be felt and practised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited as his own , in paying fifty dollars as a premium for a tract on prayer - himself drawing out minutely various hints to guide those who might write ; and it was by this means that the excellent tract , No. 271 , on the obligations , nature , benefits , and occasions of prayer , was procured . In his mind there was no jarring conflict between perfect obligation on the part of man , and perfect dependence in his relations to God . He knew both were revealed , momentous , eternal truths ; and left all embarrassing questions of their consistency to be settled by God himself . It was enough to hear God speak and to obey . He prayed as if all the efficiency and praise were God 's , and labored as if duty were all his own . His sense of dependence threw him on his knees , and his sense of duty summoned him to effort ; and prayer and effort , and effort and prayer were the business of his life . Slessed day to the church , when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in every Christian 's heart . He was unifoiin and iiinvearied . I know not who has made or heard the charge of inconsistency in his Christian character . Those who knew him best , best knew how supreme in his heart was the business of glorifying God in the salvation of men I have well considered the assertion when I say , that during nine years in which we were associated in labors , I do not know that I ever passed an interview with him long enough to have any interchange of thought and feeling , in which I did not receive from him an impulse heavenward - an impulse onward in duty to God and the souls of men . No assembly , even of professed Christians , from which the spirituality of religion was excluded , whether met for social enjoyment or in furtherance of some benevolent design , received his countenance ; nor was he satisfied with what too justly seemed the strange anomaly of excluding Christ from the hours of social intercourse , and then , as it were atoning for the sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular which it seems important now to mention , is his fruitfulness in DEVISING EXPEDIENTS FOR DOING GOOD . Of this point the history of his life is but an exemplification . As the father of a family , he labored for the /q/ spiritual welfare of all his household , especially for the early conversion of his children . Of thirteen individuals who resided in his family at different times in the city of New York , twelve became deeply anxious for their salvation . One of these was a Roman-catholic , whose attention to family worship was forbidden by her priest ; one who was hopefully reclaimed from her backsliding , has since died ; and six others gave , and so far as known still give , evidence of saving conversion to God . Of his fidelity to his children , the testimony contained in the following expression of filial gratitude from his son , in transmitting by request the letters he had received from his father , will be excused . " In reviewing the letters I received from my father , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my temporal and eternal welfare ; and Oh , for some of that ardent desire for the salvation of souls to bear me forward in duty , which impelled him onward , till he ceased his toils on earth and entered on his rest in heaven . " I can not refrain from bearing testimony to my father 's fidelity to my own soul . Well do I remember his endeavors in my early childhood to lead me to the Saviour - his prayers , his entreaties , and the anxiety with which he followed me year after /z/ year , while under the paternal roof and when away , till he could speak to me no more . His kind voice I shall no longer hear . His affectionate smile of approval , or tears shed over my waywardness , I shall no more see . His kind intercourse with the members of his family wo shall no more share . He Avill no more call us around the hallowed family altar , and lead us in the hymn of praise and in pouring out the soul to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holier sphere , enjoying the smiles and presence of his God and Redeemer . Pray for me that I may have grace to follow his example as he followed Christ , and at last to unite in his songs . " The above pages have sufficiently shown in what varied forms he rendered himself useful , as the teacher of a day-school , and in the relations he sustained to the Sabbat i-school cause , and to the tract cause ; in Bible classes and in religious meetings ; to families and to individuals . The variety of efforts he made with his pen is equally striking . Not only did he address moving appeals to individuals , but if a thought occurred which he judged to be of general interest , he embodied it in a few paragraphs and sent it for insertion in some religious paper ; and even if he inserted a scrap in an album , he improved the opportunity to direct the reader 's mind to Christ . /q/ In the temperance cause he enlisted with a whole heart as early as 1823 ; rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its forms , and throwing an influence in a thousand ways to extend the temperance reformation . Many pious young men were by him sought out and directed towards the ministry . To the cause of missions , both in our own and pagan lands , he was steadfastly devoted . He not only turned his eye away from the accumulation of property as the object of his life , but felt the duty and claimed the blessedness to his own soul , of imparting for the cause of Christ a portion of what he had . On his dying bed , he mentioned to Mrs. Page , that five dollars , which before his sickness he had subscribed to a benevolent object , remained unpaid . " We have consecrated it to God , " said he , " and I had rather it would be paid . You had better pay it , and trust him . " His familiarity with the character and religious bearing of all the Tract Society 's publications , and with the general state and wants of the community , rendered him skilful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were designed ; and also in giving an impulse and a wise direction to the feelings and efTorts of Christians who were continually calling in the transa ( ? . tion of business . /z/ And ill all , it abundantly appears that he felt that the efficiency was alone with God ; and mingled continual prayer for the gift of gifts , the accompanying influences of the Holy Spirit . Is it wonderful that God should bless his efforts ? That in each church with which he stood connected , individuals , when relating their religious experience , should be heard referring to his faithful endeavors as the means of bringing them to Christ ? That a revenue of souls should have been gathered from the place of his nativity ; that thirty-tivo teachers were brought publicly to profess Christ , from one of his Sabbath-schools , and that nine of them have set their faces towards the ministry ? That thirtyfour should hopefully have been gathered by him and his fellow-laborers from one ward of the city ; and thsitffty - eight , in connection with his efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to join themselves to the people of God , from the Tract and Bible houses ? That individuals should come to his dying bed , and thank him with tears for his fidelity to their own souls ? Is it wonderful , that in speaking to her who was soon to be his widow , of his early departure , and looking back on his work on earth as ended , he should , with the solemnity of eternity on his countenance , say , " I know it is all of God 's grace , and nothing that I have done ; but I think I have had evidence /q/ that more than one hundred sotds have been converted to God through my own direct and personal instrumentality ? " Look at the influence of such a Christian life on a large scale . Suppose every Christian labored , I do not say with such talents , hut with such a heart to the ivork . Suppose there were ten such Christians in every evangelical church throughout our land , and that God should equally bless their labors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they search the highways and hedges , and by God 's grace compel the ungodly to come in . How would they instruct the rising age . How would they hold up the hands of faithful ministers . How would the Holy Spirit be shed down in answer to their prayers . How would their influence penetrate through every vein of this great community ; and how soon would living piety here pour its influence on every benighted land . Such a light as would then shine could not be hid . It would illumine the world , and Christ wojld come and possess the nations . /z/ It remains only to linger a little wliile with our brother in the chamber of death . " We do not look to his dying bed for evidence of his good estate . This we had in his life . Nor have we to record what occurred in the hurry and excitement and delirium of dying . He was let down to the grave by a gradual process of four months ; and contrary to almost all example , gave up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while in the full and perfect exercise of his mental powers . It can not be said that death had to him no terrors . This enemy did not come and steal him away unawares ; nor were the powers of his mind blunted by disease or medicine . The king of terrors presented himself as if he would challenge divine grace to gain a victory . He showed him usefulness closed , a dependent widow and children , agonizing bodily pain , and his soul about to appear before God . His disease was in the vital organs , and a continual cough gave alarming evidence that it was seating itself upon the lungs . About six weeks previous to his death , Dr. M. W. , one of the skilful /q/ and pious physicians who gave him their gratuitous counsel and aid , made a careful examination with the stethoscope ; and as a faithful friend , informed him that his lungs were ulcerated , and he must die . " He received the announcement , " says the physician , " calmly ; as a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds , but that he had a home in heaven . ' ' To a heart so spiritually alive , the scene before him was unutterably solemn and momentous . He wished clear evidence of his union to Christ , that should leave no question of his interest in him ; and to have a constant and lively senie of his i7nmediate presence . Nothing short of this could meet the urgency of his case ; and this , for some days , he did not attain . " About six weeks before his death , " says a kind brother who called on him with a Christian friend , " we found him in much mental distress . He said he had been endeavoring to examine his past life , but it was all a blank . ' Oh , ' said he , ' I have done nothing for Christ . " What an unprofitable life have lived . How can one be a Christian who has done no more to prevent his acquaintance and even his own household , from going down to hell V We repeated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were precious promises , but he could not appropriate them to himself . /z/ " A few days after , " says the same brother , " we called on him again ; and found that the desire of his heart was granted . Christ was with him ; and his emphatic language was , ' It seems as if I never knew before what it was to love him . ' He appeared to feel that he had obtained a new view of the love of Christ , which he was anxious to communicate for our benefit . * I have been following him , ' he said , ' all along as the evangelists record his history - how he healed the sick , how he fed the hungry , cast out devils , comforted the sorrowful , and at last died for i ' ) oor sinners ' ' - when his weeping prevented utterance . ' Oh , who can help loving such a blessed Saviour ? ' " ' I think I have evidence of love to Christ , ' he soon added , ' from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how my heart goes out towards all the dear brethren who love Christ , and are trying to save poor sinners from hell . Brother A. , and brother B. , and brother ; that the Lord will make them more faithful and more useful . Do , brethren , ' said he to us , ' be faithful to souls . It will be time enough to rest by and by . ' " Again he said , " Should I go into a meeting and see a Christian with his eyes filled with tears , and his heart glowing with love to souls , pleading with sinners to come to Christ and live , should not I love him ? And when Christ comes and weeps /q/ over poor sinners , and says , ' Jerusalem , Jerusalem , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not , ' shall not I love him ? I know I love that Christian brother that would feel so ; and do n't I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " The cloud returned no more till his spirit took its upward flight . The writer having been sometime absentfromthe city , sat by his bedside alone , expecting it might be the last interview with him on earth , when the following conversation , almost word for word , occurred " I have thought a great deal of you in my absence , brother Page ; and when I come here and find you so low , it is very affecting . How wonderfuUy God is dealing with us . He has seen fit to take away both of my children ; you are sinking ; and your son , by falling from an upper window , has very narrowly escaped death . " " Yes , " he replied , in slow , feeble , and tender tones , " God mingles mercies with afflictions . I want to thank him for preserving Cyrus ' life . It is a great mercy . " " It is wonderful , " I added , " that God often cuts down those who seem most needed . Brother Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great breaches on . the church . " /z/ " 0 , brother H. , " said he , as if he could not bear the allusion to himself as having been specially useful , " I am nothing ; and have done nothing . I ' m nothing but a poor sinner . I ' m a blank , and less than a blank . I hang on the mere merits of Christ . " " Has it not been a great trial to give up your v/ife and children , and all your work here ? " " It has been a trial to give them up , but not my great trial . I wanted a clear sense of the presence of Christ in my heart . For some time 1 could not get a clear view of him ; and it was not till I followed him all along from the manger to the cross , that I seemed to get a clear view of him as just the Saviour I need , and bring him home tO ' my heart . I ' ve given all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' s all done . What I want now is a sense of the presence of Christ ; and I think he is with me , and sustains me . " " I rejoice that it is so ; and may his grace carry you through . I want before you die to thank you brother Page , for your uniform kindness during the nine years we have been laboring together ; and especially for the help you have given me in the spiritual life . " " 0 , brother H. , do n't thank me . I ' ve done nothing , and been nothing but a poor miserable sinner . I do n't want any thanks . " /q/ ' * I have always felt , " I added , " that you have essentially aided me in the Christian course . " " Ah , I ' ve often felt wrong , and done wrong . I want you , brother H. , to forgive all you have seen amiss " " I have nothing to forgive . I wish rather to confess my faults to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , brother H. , I ' ve come short in every thing " - bursting into a flood of tears . The scene was full of instruction . I could scarcely avoid the impression that I was conversing with his spirit already sanctified for heaven . To see one who had lived such a life thus abasing him self ; to see him shudder at the intimation that he had been specially useful ; to hear him say , amid the solemnities of dying , " I am nothing , and have done nothing ; I ' m a blank , and less than a blank ; I have done wrong and felt wrong , and cast my soul alone on the blood and righteousness of Christ , " opened a new vieiv of heaven , and made me feel , that whoever arrives at that blessed abode , whatever his life has been , however much he has labored for Christ and the souls of men , will there prostrate /z/ ' jrOD ALL , ALL THE GLORY , FOR EVER AND EVER . " You must feel some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what I can for them . " Page . 15 /z/ " I do n't want any promises . God will take care of them . " " I have hoped that it will be in the hearts of friends aromid us to contribute something for them . " " It ca n't be expected that any thing like what would support them could be raised . But I give all that uijT * ' I understand you have expressed a desire that your body be removed to Coventry . If so , I hope I may accompany it . " " Ah , I 've no concern about this poor body . All will be done right about it . " About this time a friend from his native place visited him , and asking if he had any message for his parents and friends , he said , " Yes : " Tell my aged parents not to despond because God has taken me first , for he will be their stay and support , and soon we shall meet where parting will be no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in Christ . " Tell sister L. , I expect soon to meet her in heaven . " Tell my former pastor , that I remember with gratitude the instructions received from his lips . " On the following Sabbath , as the writer called on him , he said , " I wanted to have gone home to-day ; but they are trying to keep me here My /q/ work here is all done , and I want to be with Christ . " " Do you not look back now with peculiar pleasure on your direct personal efforts for the good of souls ? " " I look upon perso7ial conversatioji mid prayer %oith individuals as among my most successful endeavors , and hope I have done some good . But it is not me . It is all of grace in Christ . There 's nothing in me but sin . I 'm nothing - nothing - less than nothing . Brother H. , I have been a great sinner . " " Is it the sins of your heart that trouble you chiefly " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood - and youth - and all my life - the chief sinners . But ' it is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . ' " " Do you feel that it is your choice now to go ? " *'Yes , ifitis God 's will . " " Should he please to restore you , would you not be willing to remain here and labor a little longer ? " " yes , I think so , if it was his will . But my work on earth is all done . I want now to go and be with Christ . Prophets and apostles and martyrs are there , and many pious friends are there ; /z/ I feel that I should like to meet them . Christ will be there , and we shall he like him , and see him as he is ; that will be enough . " " Is it not wonderful that Christians do not live in a nearer view of death ? " " yes ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel how short this life is . " Some time previous to this conversation he had adjusted all hisearthly concerns , reviewed his will , arranged his papers , given advice respecting his family and his burial , and thenceforward he seemed to feel that his work here was " all done , " and to Welcome nothing that did not immediately pertain to the exchange of worlds . The daily paper had for weeks been put aside as having " nothing of Christ in it , " though not without expressing his belief that ere long the daily papers shall carry to their readers messages of salvation ; and when his family were reading to him from religious papers he would sometimes stop them , saying , " Is thore any thing there for a dying man 1 If so , read it . " He relished nothing but what was eminently spiritual , and regretted that he had not treasured more of the Bible in his memory . The twentythird Psalm and the last chapter of Revelation were very precious to him . At one time he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from /q/ the Bible : I ' m starving . " Again , as a clergyman came in , he said , " Do look out some hymns that express a great deal of heaven . Many of the hymns seem tame . They are pretty poetry , but do not present the joys of redemption and the glory of Christ . When I have a clear view of Christ my fears vanish , and I can trust myself wholly in his hands . " It was remarked by those most familiar at his bedside , that not one impenitent acquaintance visited him whom he did not seem to have warned . The tenor of his language to them was , " I have said all I can say . I can now add nothing new . My work here is all done . " Finding that his life was continued longer than he expected , he said , " I thought my work was done , but I find it is not . I must strive to urge Christians and sinners to duty from this dying bed . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently separated himself came in , he said , " You will allow me to speak freely as a dying man . Are the dear brethren of the church awake ? Are they laboring for souls ? If I were to be raised up from this dying bed , would you not feel that I ought to be faithful ? And is the duty less yours than it would be tyiine V More than once he said , " The millennium will never come until Christians are more awake to /z/ duty . " And again , " 0 for a holy ministry ; a ministry devoted to the salvation of souls I I ca n't bear to have so much time wasted in controversy . If all would devote themselves to the salvation of souls , how many might be saved from eternal burnings . " The principal of a large female school coming in , he entreated her to be faithful to the souls of her pupils , and urged the momentous consequences should they be converted to God . She was much affected , and begged him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate prayer for her and all committed to her charge . He observed that the number of the impenitent who visited him was comparatively small ; and when one with whom he had conversed retired , he said , " how the impenitent dread a dying bed . " As a Christian friend , on seeing his strength so reduced , expressed his regret that he left the church with which he had been so long connected for the new enterprise , he said , " There were motives pressing upon me that I could not resist . I felt that one at least of the officers of that church ought to go ; and hard as it was to tear myself away from the dear brethren , I do not regret it . There are some praying souls there , and I feel that God will bless their efforts for that destitute part of the city . " /z/ His Utterance in disturhed sleejJ continually indicated what the burden of his life had been . Generally it was prayer , or an appeal to Christians or the impenitent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unconscious utterance . " Lord , reveal thyself to us . Show us thy glory . " At another time he exclaimed with great earnestness , " Dear brethren , ivhere are you ? where ARE YOU ? Are you in the light of God 's countenance ? Are you in the light of the Sun of righteousness /z/ Again , as if he were addressing the impenitent , " ' Noiv is the accepted time ; now is the day of salvation , ' why will you not turn and give your hearts to God ? Why will you go down to hell ? " Again he said , with melting tenderness , as if some effort of his had been unavailing , " Poor girl I she has rejected her Saviour , and her soul must be lost . " The visit of J. H. T. , his fellow-laborer in the Tract and Bible houses , was peculiarly gratifying . He greeted him on being so near home ; they conversed on the dealings of the Lord with them and the glories of eternity , and bade one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet again never to separate . Again he said , " A death-bed is a precious place , /z/ when we have the presence of Christ - then to wake to a glorious immortality . God does not send one imnecessary affliction . " Again , " I feel as if I had got half-way home . I can not bear to stop . It Avould he a pity to have the flesh return on these limbs again . " Perhaps sacred music was never a source of more spiritual benefit or enjoyment in the chamber of sickness and death . For some years he led the devotions of the sanctuary , and in his earlier days was accustomed to play on the bass-viol and the flute . In his latter years , he made singing stHctly a devotional exerche - a point the practical bearing of which on the Christian life can not be too much urged . He used it as such at social meetings , and uniformly made it a part of family worship . Providence kindly so ordered it that Mr. F. , a Christian brother accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who to his love of music joined a tender sympathy with the sick and dying . At the request of Mr. Page , he sung a few appropriate selections ; and finding they were as a precious balm to his heart , tendered his services to come in daily and as often as he desired . The impression made upon the mind of the dying man was so strong , that he would anticipate his return with great interest . " I expect Mr. F. soon , " he would say to his family , " and I want you all to be /q/ here . " When he arrived he would inquire for each absent member , unwiUing that the singing should commence till all were present , and then anxious that all should join in the praises of the Most High . After singing one day , he said , " How sweet ; and if the music of earth is so sweet , what must he the music of heaven , where all the heavenly hosts unite their voices - ten thousand upon ten thou-sand ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My faith looks up to thee , " as set to music in the " Spiritual Songs , " took precedence of all others . The music of the first was composed by Mr. Hastings of New York , and of the other by Mr. L. Mason of Boston , who have consented to their insertion at the close of the volume , as it may be gratifying to some readers , and perhaps be the means of adding consolation to some other departing friend . The hymn beginning , " How sweet the name of Jesus sounds , " as set to music in the same work , was also peculiarly precious to him , and one that he often repeated . At one time he asked for the reading of the hymn , " When languor and disease invade , " etc. , and as the fifth verse was read , said with emphasis , " Yes , " Sweet to lie passive in his hands , And know no will but his . " /z/ On one occasion , as they were singing from the seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value I resign , " " he repeated the verses , " says one who was present , " with a tone and animation more than earthly : " Lord , ' t is enough that thou art mine : I shall behold thy blissful face , And stand complete in righteousness . " " As he repeated the fifth verse , with inexpressible ardor and solemnity , we felt almost that we were already transported to those blissful regions ; /z/ / shall be near - and like - my God . " " I wonder , " he said , " that singing is not more used around the bed of the sick . It seems to me admirably adapted to cheer and comfort them . " He expressed an earnest desire that all his family should learn to sing . " Then , " said he , " you can have a little heaven here below . " Again he said , " 0 how can the churches be so indifferent to the praises of the sanctuary - the very employment of haaven I how can Christians sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven ; it is heaven on earth . " As he was apparently slumbering , his infant son struck the strings of a bass-viol that stood in the room : " My little son , " said he , " is that you ? Do that again . Papa loves to hear that . " /q/ On hearing an organ as it passed in the street he said , " That sounds sweet . I am becoming very fond of instrumental music : I suppose there will be a good deal of it from the golden harps of heaven . " At one time , with much effort , he sung the line , " Rise , my soul , and stretch thy wings ; " but not having strength to proceed , stopped , saying , " 0 when shall I go home ? How long must I be burdened with this body ? The Lord knows how much suffering I need to prepare me for his kingdom . " In all his sickness he exhibited surprising tenderness of spirit . He could not bear the thought that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who were not engaged in the service of Christ . If he had manifested the least impatience , he would pray God to forgive him , beg his wife to forgive him , and often express his gratitude for the kindness he received in the most affecting manner . Frequently he wept in view of the long-continued and gratuitous attentions of his stated physician , Dr. J. C. B. As he had been ministering to his necessities one day , and had led in prayer and retired , he said with tears , " How good to have some one to carry you up into heaven ; " adding , after a pause , " When I think of his prolonged and unwearied kindness to us , my heart swells with emotions which I can not utter . " /z/ He was continually endeavoring to relieve the sorrovvs of those around him . " When he saw her weeping who was soon to he a widow , he summoned his utmost efforts , and urged his most ardent supplications to God , that she might have divine consolation ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and given him and herself and her children and her all to God , to he disposed of according to his pleasure , he expressed great joy and gratitude . " God will take care of you , " said he ; " I am sure of it . Only trust in God , and he Avill provide for you . His promises to the widow and the fatherless are precious . The Bible is full of them . " His tender dread of sin continued to the last . A dear Christian friend says he regards the night he watched with him as one of the most privileged seasons of his life . They had many short and delightful interviews . Towards morning he said very seriously , " Have you seen any thing , brother , in which you think I have sinned to-night ? " " Nothing in particular , " was the reply . " Twice , " added the faithful , affectionate brother , " you spoke of the pain occasioned by your labored respiration , and perhaps expressed a little impatience . " He immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earnest prayer that he might be purified from all sin . /q/ After violent coughing , he said , " My children , you see this is suffering . It is for 5m . " At another time he said , " The Bible speaks of perfection . I feel no perfection . I am all sin . Christ is perfect , and his blood cleanseth from all sin . " Again he said , " Sometimes I so earnestly desire to depart , that I feel as though I could not wait ; but I want you to persuade me not to feel so . I fear it is wrong . " Equally undiminished was his sense of his U7iicorthiness . As one , now a brother in the church , had wept at his bedside , and thanked him for his faithful efforts in arresting him in his downward course of sin , he said , " I know not what to do with such scenes - there ' s a great deal too much ascribed to man . " His eldest son having been absent , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when he arrived , clasped him for many minutes in his withered arms , and bestowed upon him a father 's richest counsels and blessing . This had been , for some time , the only remaining earthly favor he had to request . He wished to have all his children once more together , and to give them his dying counsels . A few days before he died , after a paroxysm of coughing , he said , " I was in hopesto depart ; but /z/ I must wait a little longer . How long probably before another ulcer will fill ? when shall I awake in thy likeness ? " Again he repeated the words , " Home , home I " and prayed , " for a free and full discharge . Lord Jesus , come quickly . Why wait thy chariot wheels so long ? I dedicate myself to thee . may I have the victory . come quickly . Come , Lord Jesus , come quickly . " A little before his death , as all his family were around him , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered utterance scarcely possible , he addressed a word to each . " I want you all , " said he , " to be a bundle of love . " To Mrs. Page : " Though a thousand miles apart , you may be serving God here - and I in heaven . " To his eldest son : " I want you should be a holy man - an active , living Christian . " To his daughter : " Stand fast . Be steadfast in the faith . Wander not from God . Be wholly his . " To a younger son : " be a Christian indeed , my son . " To the infant : " Love God . Learn what he is - what heaven is . " To a niece ; " I have been committing all my family to God . Love God . Pray to him daily . " Then he prayed , " I thank thee for suffering . I /q/ deserve it . How much I deserved death , eternal death I DeUver me from a lonor series of sufferiiifs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not complain nor dictate . Remember thy handmaiden . Remember her in her trials . Thou knowest the supports she needs - grant them fully . May she be willing to commit me to thy hands . Bless this daughter and all these children , and all their concerns . I COMMIT MYSELF TO THEE , JeSUS , SaVIOUR OF SINNERS . THE INFINITE LOVE OF ChRIST I I /z/ This is the legacy he left to a lonely widow , and four fatherless children . This , his testimony to the 7natchless grace of God , abounding , through Christ , to one who had no merits of his own . This , his moving persuasive to every child oj God to abound in duty . This , his voice of warning and entreaty to rebel sinners , saying , " Be ye reconciled to God . " The mercy and kindness of a covenant God , to whom he committed his family with such implicit trust , claims here to be recorded in the fact , that soon after his death , a few Christian friends assembled and commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was raised to /z/ $2,000 . As the subject was mentioned to a pious mechanic , he said , with the tear standing in his eye , " I want to give something . Here are ten dollars . But for Mr. Page , I should probably have Bunk into a miserable eternity . " He was asked to relate the circumstances , and thus replied : " On New-Year 's day , 1827 or 8 , which was Monday , I reflected that I had never attended a monthly concert of prayer in this city , and determined that for once I would go . I went early , found only the sexton in the room , and sat down . Soon there came in a plain man , who spoke very pleasantly to the sexton , and then coming and sitting by my side , after a kind salutation , said , ' I trust you love the Saviour ? ' The question instantly filled my eyes with tears . / had been ' preached to at arms ' length , all ony days in New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever a Christia7i thus kindly a7id directly put such a question to my heart . " We conversed considerably together , in the course of which , at his request , I gave him my name and residence . The next day he came into my shop , and brought me the tract , ' Way to be Saved , ' which he thought I should like to read . He called again and again . I became interested in him , and the next Sabbath joined his Sabbath-school ; was brought , as I hope , to Christ , and soon united with the church . "
