This , C. professed , was to her a new idea ; and Henry who admitted that he had always thought the Africans a much injured people , and who protested that he felt very little respect for those people who sometimes place the Af rican on a level with baboons , acknowledged that the idea of literature and science associated with an African name , was as novel to him , as it was to Caroline . You do not mean , Pa , Henry inquired , that any con siderable number of Africans have discovered genius , or been distinguished for the cultivation of their minds ? Caroline declared that she did know a single instance , unless it be that of Phillis Wheatley , who lived in Boston , sixty years ago , and wrote some very pretty poems .

Mr. L. , on the other hand , intimated that he had great reason to rejoice that his children gave him so much evidence of their affection and respect , and so much promise in their dutiful , and upright , and ever amiable deportment , of future respectability and usefulness and happiness .

WELL , my son , Caroline and I are waiting for you , that we may take up the subject of our last evening s conversa tion , said Mr. L. , after a little conversation with C. on va rious topics , while Henry seemed to be busily engaged in turning over the pages and examining the contents of a large folio which lay before him in the adjoining room . 4 1 am ready , Pa , said H. ; I was looking at what is said under the word " Africa , " in the Encyclopedia Brittanica . Caroline and I have been examining one book after another a great part of the day , to satisfy ourselves from which of the sons of Noah the Africans are descended . The Old Testament has been Caroline s chief book of refer ence , whilst Calmet , and Brown , and others have been searched by me , I confess , without much benefit . Caroline was confident that their father could give them * more information on the subject in one half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s study . Mr , L. remarked , * I think we proposed , last evening , to /q/ Africa , by whom originally settled . glance first at the history of the African race : the question you were agitating , then , in respect to their origin , is the first to be considered . 1 On this point , we must refer to a period which profane history does not reach , but on which the word of God sheds its holy light , teaching us that Africa was planted by the descendants of HAM , the son of Noah . 1 Ham , you will recollect , had four sons . Of these it is generally agreed , that Gush settled in Lower Egypt , and that from him were descended the ancient Ethiopians , known to us as the Nubians and Abyssinians , and embracing also those unknown nations inhabiting the equatorial regions of the African continent . Hence , " Cush " is the name applied in the Hebrew Bible to Ethiopia , embracing also in its fre quent application Africa in general . Mizraim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancients as the Thebais , Hermopolis , Memphis , and Delta of the Nile ; but bet ter known to us as parts of Upper and Lower Egypt , some times called in the Hebrew scriptures " the land of Ham , " oftener " Mizraim . " From him also were descended the inhabitants of Golchis , the ancestors of the warlike Philis tines . Phut , another son , peopled Lybia and Mauritania , embracing the kingdom of Fez , the Deserts , Algiers , and other portions . From these , with such additions as emigra tion and frequent conquest have given , it is probable that all the nations of Africa , however divided , mixed , or dispers ed , originally came . Henry suggested , You have not mentioned Canaan , telling us where he settled ; I suppose , from the omission , that he settled in Asia , in the country called by his name ? Yes : Canaan , the youngest son of Ham , settled in " Canaan , " so called after him , which is sometimes called /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and is also familiarly known by us as the " land of promise , * and is also called " Palestine . " A colony of Phoenicians , known in scripture as Canaanites , settled at Carthage , and probably spread themselves over other portions of Africa . Caroline here referred to an impression on the minds of many , that Africans generally are descended from Canaan ; and that they are therefore doomed to perpetual slavery by the curse which Noah denounced against him , Genesis ix . 25 27 . She thought she had heard advanced , or had somewhere read a sentiment of the kind . Henry thought that they who suppose this , should have better reasons than they have for considering the Africans descended from Canaan , before they make such an applica tion of the words of Noah . He was requested by his father to read the passage : " Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall lie be unto his brethren . Blessed be the Lord God of Shem , and Canaan shall be his servant . God shall enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shem , and Ca naan shall be his servant . " 1 That , observed MY . L. , is truly a remarkable prophecy . It is supposed , by Commentators , to have been recorded for the encouragement of the Israelites in warring with the Ca naanites . The passage is attended with some difficulty in the minds of many , who , to obviate that difficulty , read the original , " Cursed be Ham , the father of Canaan ; in which case you see that Africa would , beyond doubt , be affected by the denunciation . And if it have not this meaning , it may indeed be difficult to see the propriety of applying the curse to Africa at large . /q/ The curse explained . It was very natural that both Caroline and Henry , who had been giving their close attention to the instructions of Mr. L. , should here ask , for they did not see , * why any should change the reading of the translation so as to make the curse rest on Ham ! The difficulty , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper application of the denunciation , Mr. L. explained , referring them to the 24th verse of the same chapter , which verse immediately precedes the denunciation , and reads as follows : " And awoke from his wine , and knew what his younger son had done unto him . " Henry now saw , at once , the difficulty . His younger son ? H. exclaimed ; * Ham was Noah s second son , was he not , Pa ? 4 Yes ; it appears that Ham was the second , and not the youngest , as they suppose is implied by the term in the original translated younger . But the way in which Ham is introduced in connexion with the subject of Noah s intoxi cation and exposure , ( " find Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told it to his two brethren without , " ) has led some to infer that Ham was the youngest . At the same time , the frequent mention of Canaan , in connexion with the transaction , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal ; and , by them , the expression , " knew what his younger son had done , " is thought to refer to Canaan , the grandson . Ca naan , they suppose , first discovered Noah s situation and told it to Ham . Be all this as it may , the history of this painful trans action , is full of serious instruction . You see a very strik ing contrast between the conduct of Ham in exposing to his brethren Noah s disgraceful fall , and their commendable de- /z/ The curse fulfilled . portment in doing what they could to conceal their father s infirmity and guilt . It is very evident that Ham could lay claim to none of the finer sensibilities of our nature if judged by this one act . His behaviour was exceeding unamiable and reprehensible ; and he must have felt the rebuke to be deserved , when his own father was inspired to predict the consequent oppression and slavery of his posterity . And Canaan , if guilty , as has been supposed , was as severely re buked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the family which should descend from himself . The example of Shem and Japheth on the occasion , is worthy of all commendation ; and a blessing belongs to those who imitate their amiable deportment , as a curse as suredly awaits all who copy in their spirit or conduct the pattern of Ham and Canaan . To your inquiry , Henry , whether the prediction of Noah has been evidently fulfilled in the descendants of Ham or Canaan , I would reply , that if we are to consider the curse as resting on the descendants of Ham generally , we may see its fulfilment in the wrongs which unhappy Africa has suffered in the oppression and servitude to which her children have so long been subjected . The history of Af rica for a long period , has been for the most , one of deep suffering , ignominy , outrage and crime ; a tale of sorrow broken by few intervals of happiness or of rest . It has been justly remarked of the whole continent that it " has lain , like some huge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bosom , while every rep tile of evil omen and hateful form has preyed undisturbed on its palsied extremities . " At the North of Africa , " the conflicting interest and crooked policy of Europe permitting an organized system of piracy ; " Egypt , from the days of Cambyses , a tributary province , and prey of the rapacious /q/ The curse fulfilled . Mameluke ; in Abyssinia , the lamp of Christian truth glim mering in its socket , and casting its flickering beams on a degraded and brutalized population ; ignorance and barbar ism consolidated and established by Mahometan influence in the South of Africa ; at the Cape of Good Hope , human nature degraded and oppressed ; and on the West of Africa , the slave factory and slave ship doing their accursed work and sweeping into distant and hopeless bondage unhappy thousands , Africa may truly be said to have had the very dregs of bitter affliction wrung out to her . But what , Sir , if the denunciation of Noah is considered to be against Canaan and his posterity alone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their history a re markable fulfilment . The devoted nations which God de stroyed before Israel , were descended from Canaan ; and so were the Phoenicians , and the Carthagenians who were sub jugated with dreadful destruction by the Greeks and Ro mans . The descendants of Canaan , as a general knowledge of the outlines of history will be sufficient to show , have been subjected to those of Shem and Japheth through many generations . The whole posterity of Ham then appear to have been signally the victims of misfortune and oppression ? 1 They certainly have , my son . I have been running my eye over this Commentary , said C. on the passage of scripture to which we have referred ; shall I read a sentence ? Bishop Newton , you will see , Pa , takes it for granted that the curse denounced is upon Ham and all his descendants , /z/ Slavery unjust . * Read it , Caroline . Caroline reads the sentence she proposed : " The whole continent of Africa was peopled principally by the de-/ scendants of Ham ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country lain under the dominion of the Ro mans , and then of the Saracens , and now of the Turks ! In what wickedness , ignorance , barbarity , slavery , and misery , live most of the inhabitants ! and of the poor Ne groes , how many hundreds , every year , are sold and bought , like beasts in the market , and conveyed from one quarter of the world to do the work of beasts in ano ther ! " * But , Pa , even if the whole race of Africans are em braced in the curse , it does not therefore afford a vindication of slavery , or excuse for the cruel oppression of the African , does it ? * No , Caroline : God has not , as I think , authorized us to enslave Africans , whatever authority may be claimed for Israel to drive out , and scatter and destroy the idolatrous Canaanites . The covetous desires and barbarous practices of those who seek to enrich themselves with the products of the sweat and blood of Africa s unhappy sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native country , are with out apology . * Nor , whether the prediction and denunciation of Noah affect Canaan and his descendants alone , or Ham and his posterity generally , is it to be supposed that Africa is there fore either the lawful prey of violence and outrage , or that she is doomed to perpetual degradation and wrongs . Admit ting that the prediction has been remarkably fulfilled , whe ther on Canaan , or Africa generally , and that however wicked the oppressor has been , he was a scourge in the hand of /q/ Africa not always to be oppressed . God , fulfilling a just decree , and an important prediction in volving the authenticity of a portion of the sacred volume ; still , neither are the oppressors therefore innocent , nor are we to suppose that the oppressed are never to cease to be the victims of the denunciatory decree . The same Scrip tures which , turning to Africa , appeal for one testimony of their truth to the fulfilment of the curse , are , we should re member , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which says " JEthiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God " This prediction and promise must be fulfilled , nor can all creation stay the Almighty arm that will be uplifted to break the rod of her oppressors , Africa will be free . Her chains will fall . /z/ Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto God . /z/ " How are we astonished when we reflect that to the race of Negroes , at present our slaves , and the object of our extreme contempt , we owe our arts and sciences and even the very use of speech ; and that in the midst of those nations who call themselves the friends of liberty and humanity , invo luntary servitude is justified , while it is even a problem whether the un derstanding of Negroes be of the same species with that of white men . " Volney. 1 WELL , Pa , I suppose you remember the encouragement which you gave us that you would resume the interesting subject of Africa this evening ? said Caroline , as sh ? saw her father lay aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the well known signal to the chil dren that the hour of leisure was come . * You closed the conversation , this morning , with reference to that important prediction of Scripture , " Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God : " are we to understand the Prophet who utters this , to have reference to Africa generally , or to the descendants of Gush , the grandson of Noah only ? * The word Ethiopia in our English Bibles , it is true , is Cush in the original Hebrew ; but the term seems to have a more extended application than the names of either of Ham s other sons . Cush , or Ethiopia , is a name by which Africans in general have been known . Whether it is be cause the race of Africans are mostly descendants of Cush , /q/ Colour of Africans . which I think highly probable , that this term is more used , I am not able to determine ; but such is the fact Ethiopia is a term of extensive application . Henry having here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , Mr. L. replied , There can be no doubt that this people were black as long ago as the days of Jeremiah ; and , if we are to credit Arabian testimonies , ages before . Jeremiah asks , " Can the Cushite ( Ethiopian ) change his skin ? " Ethiopian is a name derived from two Greek words denoting the colour of the skin , ( */$ , to burn , and # , the countenance that is , burnt-face , on account of the Cushites dark complexion . 1 What , asked Henry , was the complexion of the ancient Egyptians ; were they black also V 1 Heroditus , who , you know , is called the father of histo ry , says , speaking of the ancient Colchos , since called Mingrelia , whose inhabitants were originally Egyptians , and co lonized when Sesostris , king of Egypt , extended his con quests in the north , " For my part , I believe the Colchi to be a colony of Egyptians , because , like them , they have black skins and frizzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have long been a mixed community of Copts , Arabs , Greeks , Armenians , Turks , and Mamelukes . The Copts are supposed to be the representatives of the ancient Egyptians , and prove their origin by a striking resemblance to the paintings and sculp tures of the ancient temples , and to the mummies . They are generally described as of a dusky complexion , dark and curled hair , thick lips , and scanty beard . In some features , they differ from the Negro race on the western coast of Af rica , and in the interior . There are , indeed , slight shades of /z/ Different tribes of Africa assimilated . variety which distinguish all the different tribes of Africa . It may not be necessary to enter on a particular description of each . However diversified may be the different tribes , there can be no doubt of their common origin as descendants of Ham , if we except those who have from time to time mi grated from other portions of the earth ; nor can there be any reasonable doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the appropriate term or representative of the African race in general . Commentators differ , it is true , in respect to the countries which were originally included under the name Ethiopia ; Michaelis supposes it to include African Ethiopia and Southern Arabia ; Gesenius says it is to be confined in its application to Africa alone . Rosenmiiller contends that it embraces all countries whose inhabitants were black . There is , certainly , a striking accordance of complexion , language , manners , customs , &c.; by which the inhabitants of the south and west of Africa , and all those who are known to be of Ethiopian extraction , are assimilated . 4 The complexion of Africans is caused by climate , is it not , Pa ? 1 1 suspect , Henry , that neither the African complexion , nor features , can be ascribed wholly to climate ; but must be referred to native variety at first , perpetuated by intermar riages among the same race . 4 Just , I suppose , as a part of the same brood being white and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalists tell us , by pairing together those of the same colour ? said Henry . Caroline here remarked , that Mr. Bruce , the traveller . /q/ Tradition respecting Gush Obscurity of the early hislory of Africans . says , he found in Africa a tradition which had been handed down from time immemorial , that Gush was their father , and that he actually dwelt there ; but this was in Abyssinia . The tradition purports that , soon after the flood , Gush , the grandson of Noah , with his family , still terrified with the re membrance of the flood , and fearing a repetition of the same calamity , dared not remain in the plains , but travelled until he came to certain mountains in Abyssinia , and there settled . It says , further , that there Gush and his people , ( with inde scribable labour , requiring arts and instruments utterly un known to us , ) formed themselves commodious and wonderful habitations , composed of solid granite and marble , which dwellings are now entire , and will remain so till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding the low countries , they advanced along the different ridges and chains of mountains across the whole continent of Africa . * The more Henry and I examine into this subject , how ever , the more difficult it seems to determine satisfactorily and beyond the possibility of contradiction , which , if either , alone , of the sons of Ham , is entitled to the honour of being considered the principal progenitor of the African race . We have felt great curiosity , since our last conversation , to find from the books the arguments which go to show that the Africans , as the descendants of Canaan , are suffering their present degradation in fulfilment of the curse pronounced by Noah . Our examination only renders " darkness more visi ble . " One author quotes from Procopius , if I recollect , who says , that when the Canaanites were driven from their coun try by the Israelites , they first retreated into Egypt , and gradually penetrated the continent of Africa , where they built many cities , and spread themselves over vast regions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em brace the whole northern part of Africa , or the Barbary /z/ Gush and Canaan . States . This author says , that in the ancient city of Tongis , founded by them , were two great pillars of white stone , near a large fountain , inscribed with Phoenician characters , " We are people preserved by flight from the robber Jesus , ( Joshua , ) the son of Naver , who pursued us . " Another author says , " in the time of Athanasius , the Africans con tinued to say that they were descended from the Canaanites , and when asked their origin , they answered Canani. " * All this , said Mr. L. , is in corroboration of the position which 1 have taken . Admitting that the Canaanites mingled with other tribes in Egypt and all along the coast of the Me diterranean to the Strait of Gibraltar , still we must look for the peopling of the vast interior of Africa , and the west and south , from another source . It is almost a matter of demon stration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such is the geographical situation of the country , as you will see at once by the map , that the natives bordering the Mediterranean coast , are separated from the rest of the con tinent by an almost boundless and impassable wilderness the Lybian desert and the great desert of Sahara , which , to gether , extend across the continent from the west of Egypt to the Atlantic ocean . The deserts are an ocean of sand , and in some places eight hundred miles in breadth . This , the only highway to the south and interior of Africa , was occupied by the Cushites , who had nothing to prevent them from spreading into all regions south now occupied by the Negro race . It makes but little difference , however , from which of the grandsons of Noah the natives of this , that , or the other part of Africa are descended . There is intellect among them all . They have had their distinguished men in every tribe , so far as we have known any thing concerning the different tribes , /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and there is , and can be no impediment , no anathema of hea ven , no forfeiture of their right as men among men , which can justify their being torn from the scenes of domestic life , from country and home , to spend their days in bondage . There is nothing , and can be nothing to annul and defeat the decree which sounds from the throne of the Eternal , " Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God . " ( I have no doubt , Pa , that the view which you have taken of the subject is correct . I think it is , on the whole , of very little importance whether most of the blood of Gush , or Ca naan , of Mizraim , or Phut , runs in the veins of the present population of Africa . It seems that they have been higher than they now are in the scale of intellectual and moral at tainments , and they may yet rise again for aught we know . I have the impression , Pa , that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people of other countries ? Yes , my daughter , very little , comparatively . Bruce , Ledyard , Park , Riley , Bowdich , Denham , Clapperton , Laing , the Landers , and numerous adventurers have from time to time added to our store of information ; but still com paratively little is known . To penetrate far into the heart of Africa has been found so difficult and arduous a perform ance , that it has been but very partially accomplished . Still , enough is known of Africa in respect to her ancient glory , and her present susceptibility of mental and moral impres sions , to authorize the expectation that she may be raised to a high rank of moral worth , and of intellectual respectability . That continent which , notwithstanding her present de gradation , is pronounced in history by common consent the birth-place and cradle of civilization and of the arts and sciences , can not always , must not long be shrouded in dark ness , and borne down by oppression . Seeing what Africa /z/ Africa s ancient glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what she may yet be , our sympathies must enkindle towards her . It can not be otherwise than that they will . 4 The Cushites , or Ethiopians , let me tell you , established the first regular police which history records . The first great city described in history was built by them . They surrounded it with walls , which , according to Rollin , were eighty-seven feet in thickness , three hundred and fifty feet in height , and four hundred and eighty furlongs in circumfer ence . And even this stupendous work they shortly after eclipsed by another , of which Diodorus says , " Never did any city come up to the greatness and magnificence of this . Pyramids , obelisks , and mausolea still stand , as if in mocke ry of the very credulity of man , a memorial of that spirit of daring enterprise and skill which made Egypt the mother of science , and , for a time , the mistress of the world ! " * It is a fact well attested by history , that . /Ethiopians once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all Asia . And it is said that even two continents could not afford field enough for the expansion of their energies . " They found their way into Europe , and made the settlement on the western coast of Spain , called from them Iberian Ethio pia . And , says a distinguished writer , " wherever they went , they were rewarded for their wisdom . " That very light which long since blazed before the world in Greece and Rome , and which now rises to its noon-day splendour , under the auspices of Christianity , in Europe and America , be it remembered , my dear children , was kindled on the dark shores of Africa . When I think of these things , my spirit stirs within me , and I am almost impatient to see that light reflected back on Africa again yes , the light of science combined with the glorious light of the gospel of Christ . /q/ Great reverses often in the history of nations . /z/ " Cruel as death , insatiate as the grave , False as the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that yawns below , Is he who toils upon the wafting flood , A Christian broker in the trade of blood .

I shall certainly think more of that much injured quarter of the globe for the time to come , and shall abhor slavery more than ever . What strange reverses there are in the history of man ! We should never suppose from any thing that is seen in Africa now , that she was ever distin guished for any thing but ignorance , barbarism , and bru tality .

They came oppressed , their noble spirits broken down , the whole man subdued by the extinction of the last ray of hope , severed from all on earth most dear , and stepped upon these shores loaded with chains , and , it may be , bleeding with stripes ; and they were held in this " land of the free , " in cruel bondage among a people of strange tongue placed on a level with the most degraded of the miserable tasked and it is possible , for it is often as serted , lashed to quicken them in their heartless toil : but notwithstanding all , they have discovered still , under all these almost insupportable causes of depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty mind !

Henry here mentioned that he had * lately read an account of one such African , called PRINCE Mono . I saw it , said he , in an old number of a file of the Episcopal , or Phila delphia Recorder . Annexed were some remarks of the late Rev. Dr. Bedell , of that city , who also certified to the truth of the article , he having known Prince and often conversed with him at the south . Mr. L. recollected the case of Prince Moro very well ; and was able at once to refer to a number of the Christian Advocate , where was found recorded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , at which place Prince resided , the following outlines of his history : /q/ Prince Moro . " Aboutthe year 1808 , a South Carolina planter purchased a gang of slaves , among whom was a man of a slender frame and delicate constitution , who was not able to labour in the field , or had not the disposition to do so . His health failing , he was considered of no value , and disregarded . At length he strolled off , and wandering from plantation to planta tion , reached Fayetteville , was taken up as a runaway , and put in jail , where he remained some time . As no one claimed him , and he appeared of no value , the jail was thrown open that he might run away ; but he had no dispo sition to make his escape . The boys amused themselves with his good-natured , playful behaviour , and fitted up a temporary desk , made of a flour barrel , on which he wrote in a masterly hand , writing from right to left , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also noticed by some gentlemen of the place ; but his keeper grew tired of so useless a charge , and he was publicly sold for his jail dues . " His purchaser , a gentleman living about thirty miles from Fayetteville , finding him rather of a slender make , took him into his family as a house servant . Here he soon became a favourite of the inmates of the house . His good conduct in a short time put him in possession of all his master s stores , and he gradually acquired a knowledge of the English lan guage . His master being a pious man , he was instructed in the principles of the Christian religion , which he received with great pleasure ; and he seemed to see beauties in the plan of the gospel , which had never appeared to him in the Koran ; for he had been reared and instructed in the Mahomedan religion , and it was found that the scraps of writ ing from his pen were mostly passages from the Koran . It would seem that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been far in the interior of Africa perhaps Tom- /z/ Prince Moro. buctoo or its neighbourhood . At all events , his intercourse with the Arabs had enabled him to write and to speak their language with the most perfect ease . " Some of the Africans pretend to say he was what they call a l pray-God to the king , by which may be understood , a priest or learned man , who offers up prayers for the king of his nation , and is of his household . His dignified de portment showed him to be of a superior cast his humility , that of a peaceful subject , not a despot . In his person he is well formed , of a middle size , small hands and feet , and erect in his deportment .

If I should return to my native land , the fortune of war might transport me to a country where I should be deprived of the greatest of all blessings , that of worshipping the true and living God , and his Son Jesus Christ , whom to worship and serve is eternal life . " Pa , said Caroline , with eyes glistening in moisture , * the /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so kindly , and instructed him , must have felt amply rewarded and greatly happy to find this poor Mahomedan become an humble fol lower of the Lord Jesus ? And it would seem almost as if Cowper had written expressly to suit the case of Prince , speaking the very feeling of his heart , and almost his very words , in those lines , " My dear deliverer out of hopeless night , Whose bounty bought me but to give rne light ; I was a bondman on my native plain , Sin forged , and ignorance made fast the chain ; Thy lips have shed instruction as the dew , Taught me what path to shun , and what pursue ; Farewell my former joys ! I sigh no more For Africa s once loved , benighted shore ; Serving a benefactor , I am free , At my best home , if not exiled from thee !

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. , which was sent to some of our literary in stitutions . Prince belonged to the Foulah tribe . i A more interesting case still , said Mr. L. , is that of the Moorish Prince , ABDUHL RAHAHMAN , who was sent out to Liberia , a few years since , by the American Colonization Society , but who died soon after his arrival in Africa . He was a slave in this country nearly forty years , and then ob tained his freedom . He was born in the city of Tombuctoo , in 1762 . His uncle was a king . His father was governor of Footah Jallo for a time , and then on the colony becoming independ ent , was king of Footah Jallo . Prince , after completing his education , entered his father s army , soon rose to distinction , /z/ Abduhl s Father and Dr. Cox . was appointed to the command of an army , and marched against the Hebohs , a tribe at the north of Footah Jallo , He entered their country to punish them for destroying ves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade . Having put the Hebohs to flight , and set their towns on fire , he commenced his retreat ; the Hebohs rallied , however , and by a circuitous route and rapid marches , intercepted him , and ambushed themselves in a narrow defile of a mountain through which Prince was to pass . The consequence was , that Prince and a part of his array were made prisoners , and sold to the Mandingoes , and finally sold by them to a slaveship , on the coast . 4 Prince was brought to this country , and sold to a gentle man residing at Natchez , Mississippi . During the whole time of his bondage , Prince was never known to be intoxi cated or guilty of a falsehood , or of a dishonest or mean ac tion . He submitted to his fate without a murmur , and was an industrious and faithful servant , intelligent , modest , and obliging to all . His manners are represented as not only prepossessing , but dignified . Though born and raised in affluence , and now reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude , and carried still " A noble raein . " The story of his life , which is eventful and interesting , we have from his own mouth , corroborated by a train of circumstances and events which , in their order and develop ment , are truly remarkable . * Dr. Cox , late a distinguished physician in Natchez , was , in his early days , a surgeon on board a ship which visited the coast of Africa . Dr. Cox , in one of his excursions on shore , got lost , and the ship sailed and left him . In his wanderings , Dr. C. came to Footah Jallo . The people saw /q/ Prince and Dr. Cox . him , and ran and told the king , of the " white man . " The king ordered Dr. C. to be brought to him . Prince accom panied the Dr. to his father s house , where he was hospita bly treated , and during a long and painful sickness , was at tended with the utmost kindness and humanity . After his recovery from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host and attendants , to the sea-shore , where he found a ship and returned to this country . Prince had been six teen years a slave in this country when Dr. Cox removed to Natchez , and he and Prince met and recognised each other in the streets of that city . 1 Prince s account of Dr. Cox s residence in his father s family , and of his interview with Dr. Cox on their first meet ing in Natchez , is deeply affecting . Prince says , that when Dr. Cox was brought to his father , " he was asked where he was going ? The Dr. said he did not know where to go he was lost the ship had left him and he had a bad sore leg , which he had wounded in travelling . My father told him he had better go no further , but stay with him , and he would get a woman to cure his leg . It was soon cured . My father told him to stay as long as he chose . He remained six months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to his own country . He said yes* My father said , what makes you desire to go back , you are treated well here ? He answered , that his father and mother would be anxious when the vessel returned without him , thinking he might be dead . My father told him , * whenever you wish to go , I will send a guard to accom pany you to the ship . Then fifteen men were sent with him by my father for a guard , and he gave the Doctor gold to pay his passage home . My father told the guard , that if a vessel was there , they must leave the Doctor , but must not go on board the ship ; and if there was no vessel , /z/ Dr. Cox endeavours to free Prince . Prince s account of his capture . they must bring the Doctor back . They waited some time , and then found the same vessel in which he came , and he went on board . " * Prince- continues , " After that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been there sixteen years , Dr. Cox removed to Natchez , and one day I met him in the street . I said to a man who came with me from Afri ca , Sambo , that man rides like a white man I saw in my country . See , when he rides by ; if he opens but one eye , that is the same man . When he came up , hating to stop him without reason , I said , * Master , do you want to buy some potatoes ? While he looked at the potatoes I knew him , but he did not know me . He said , Boy , where did you come from ? I said , from Col. F. s . He said 1 Col. F. did not raise you ? Then he said , You came from Teembo ? I answered , yes . He said , your name is Abduhl Rahahman ? Then springing from his horse he embraced me , and inquired how I came to this country . Then he said , Dash down your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode quick , and called a negrowoman to take the potatoes from my head . Then he sent for Gov . W. to come and see me . When Gov . W. came , Dr. Cox said , I have been to this man s father s house , and they treated me as kindly as my own parents . The next morning he tried to purchase me , but my master was unwilling to sell me . He offered large sums for me , but they were refused . Then he said to master , If you will not part with him , use him well . After that , Dr. Cox died , and his son offered a great price for me . " Prince s own account of his capture is also interesting . When returning from the country of the Hebohs , it seems , he was unapprehensive of any enemy being near , and , he says , " We dismounted and led our horses until we were half /z/ Prince is carried to W. Indies and JM. itchez. , way up the mountain . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard the guns , and saw the peopledrop down . I told every one to run until we reached the top of the hill , then to wait for each other until all came there , and we would fight them . They followed us , and we ran and fought . I saw that this would not do . I told every one to run who wished to do so .. I said , I will not run for an African . I got down from my horse , and set down . One came behind , and shot me in the shoulder . One came before and pointed his gun to shoot me , but see ing my clothes ornamented with gold , he cried out , That ! the King . When they came to me , I had a sword under me , but they did not see it . The first one that came , I sprang forward and killed . They knocked me down with a gun , and I fainted . They carried me to a pond of water , and dipped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and then pulled aft " my shoes and made me go on barefoot one hundred miles , and led my horse before me . As soon as my people got home , my father raised a troop , and came after me ; and as soon as the Ilebohs knew that he was coming , they carried me into the wilderness . My fa ther came and burnt their country . They carried me to the Mandingo country , on the Gambia , and sold me , with fifty others , to an English ship . They took me to the Island of Dominica ; after that , I was taken to New Orleans , then to Natchez. " 4 Prince was educated a Mohamedan , but was friendly dis posed to the Christian religion , admiring the precepts of the Bible , but asserting that Christians do not follow them ! 1 After the liberation of Prince , whilst preparing for his re turn to Africa , he visited Hartford , Connecticut , and there found an aged African who had been a soldier in the army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cor roborated many particulars which I have now related con cerning Prince . /z/ Remains of Africa s former glory . /z/ " Breathes there the man , with soul so dead Who never to himself hath said , This is my own , my native land !

O , here she comes Well , Caroline , you are not wearied , I hope , with the sub ject of Africa ? 4 Pa , indeed I am not . I am always glad to see the hour return when we may resume the subject . The case of Prince Moro , which you mentioned to us , last evening , was truly interesting . It seems greatly desirable that he should have lived a few years after his return to his native land , al though , at his time of life , it was hardly to be expected by him or his friends that he would live long in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should live . The ways of Providence , however , although mysterious , are wise . It is said that Prince Moro , on his return to Africa , returned also to the Mahometan faith . If so , he might not have essentially aided the progress of the christianization of Africa , had his life been spared/ /q/ Africa destined to rise . Travellers in Africa . * It seems to me , Pa , that the continent of Africa presents to the mind a singular combination of character , taking- into view her whole history that is , the little that we know of it ? It certainly does : she has been the very focus of litera ture and refinement , and also has afforded the very worst specimens of barbarism . We see there the greatest ignor ance and debasement , and yet even now find evidence also of something like attention to learning , and hear from tra vellers of an interior where are magnificent cities , and the splendours of wealth and power . 1 The history of Africa s better days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the hope that she may again recover her elevation , notwithstanding all that seems most discouraging . It has been said that to the burning his tory of Ancient Greece , more than to any other cause , Mo dern Greece is indebted for any spirit of liberty and im provement with which she may , of late years , have appear ed inspired . Africa may yet find motive to action , in the thought of what she has been , whilst her past history may be the means of enlisting the sympathies of the world in her behalf . There is enough , certainly , in her history , to throw suspicion on the frequent charge of natural inferiority of her children . Douglass , in his work on Missions , says , " There are three agents which will soon be entwined with the issues of all human affairs , and are " the very hinges on which the moral world will speedily turn . The three things in which the present age excels the ancients , are the Inductive Phi losophy , Printing , and Universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , as soon they will with energy , we shall see at least , the living will see in Africa a new world. * /z/ Truth and Kit-lion united in travels . 1 1 wonder , Pa , what degree of credit we are to give to the accounts of travellers in Africa . If they have not in dulged the imagination very freely , we all have a great deal to learn yet respecting Africa s present state ? * I suspect my daughter has been reading a little more re specting this people of " obtuse intellect , " since we turned our thoughts in these conversations to the subject ? * I have . I have been looking over such works as I can find . Denham and Clapperton s Expedition I think is very interesting . I have also been looking into Bruce s Travels , and Riley and Adams . In answer to your question All recent discoveries seem to vindicate the veracity of Bruce , although , while he lived , it was his fate to be doubted , contradicted , and even ridi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Riley and Adams are doubtless entitled to some credit ; but may not , in all respects , be considered so good authority as Denham and Clapperton. * Africa has been the scene of much fiction in times past ; the unexplored region of all that is wonderful . The colour of her inhabitants her vast and impenetrable deserts and the fate of those who attempted to explore her interior , have served at the same time to inflame the curiosity and quicken the imagination . Hence , vague reports of paradisaical beauty and wonderful fertility , oases , in oceans of sand , the inac cessible abodes of the blest ; and rumours of supernatural wonders seen by travellers more fortunate than others ; all which are to be regarded as mere fiction . The accounts of later travellers have drawn upon the imagination less , and are to be considered as authentic . * We have , without doubt , very imperfect ideas as yet , of /q/ Africans not naturally indolent. the amount of Africa s population , her resources , or her comparative mental energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I mistake not , become the fruitful source of amazing interest , and the scene of wonderful develope* ments. * From all that can be gathered from the reports of tra vellers and from our own observation , do you not think , Pa , that we are justified in the inference that the Africans are naturally an extremely indolent race ? This accusation has been preferred against them , and probably with greater truth than usually pertains to asser tions of those who would deprive the race of every good quality , mental or social : but even this charge is , I suspect , somewhat exaggerated . All people , of every nation and colour , are indolent , ex cept as stimulated to labour , activity and enterprise by the spirit of property , utility , or pleasure . " The best of men have ever lov d repose . " The Negroes of Senegal are remarkably industrious . Since the suppression of slavery there , their villages are rebuilt , and re-peopled , and there is the show of a com mendable spirit of enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have motive to industry . The Abbe Gregoire says of the inhabitants of Axiaim , on the Gold Coast , and also of those of the country of Boulam , that " they are industrious . " " Those of the country of Jago , " he adds , are " celebrated for an activity which en riches their country . Those of Cabomonte and of Fido are indefatigable cultivators ; economical of their soil , they scarcely leave a foot-path to form a communication between /z/ Causes of indolence , and incentives to vice . the different possessions . They reap one day , and the next day sow the earth . " * In many parts of Africa there is such luxuriant abund ance of all that is necessary to the sustenance and comfort of its inhabitants , that indolence follows as a matter of course . Besides , they are often exposed to continual inroads from their enemies ; and where nothing is certain , save their con stant liability to surprise , capture , or death , the same evil follows the people are indolent , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see in our own country , whether natives of Africa , or descendants of Africans , have acquired indolent habits through the force of circumstances ; but no thing , surely , is to be inferred from this fact to the dispar agement of Africans more favourably situated . " Quis enira virtutem ampleciitur ipsam Prernia si tollas ? " * It has sometimes been supposed that this portion of the human race are also more inclined to vicious habits gene rally , and unruly passions than others . If this were true , it might grow out of the circumstances in which they are placed . Ignorance and crime are nearly allied . And were there no other cause , habits of indolence would beget all other evils . The poet has shown some knowledge of hu man nature and also of sound philosophy , who said , " O mortal man . who livest here by toil , Do not complain of this thy hard estate : That , like an emmet , thou must ever moil , Is a sad sentence of an ancient date ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For , though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail , And curse thy star , and early drudge and late ; Withonten that would come an heavier bale , Loose.life , unruly passions , and diseases pale . " /q/ African bravery . Henry Diaz . The Africans are not only generally considered consti tutionally indolent , but cowardly , are they not , Pa ? The Portuguese historian , Borros , says that Negroes are , in his opinion , preferable to Swiss soldiers , whose re putation for bravery has generally stood high . In 1703 , the blacks took arms for the defence of Guadaloupe , and " were more useful than all the rest of the French troops . " At the same time , they bravely defended Martinico against the English . The honourable conduct of the Negroes at the siege of Savannah , and at the taking of Pensacola , is well known . During the Revolution , when incorporated with the French troops , they shared their danger and their glory . 1 You probably recollect the mention of Henry Diaz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Negro , and once a slave . He became colonel of a regiment of sol diers of his own colour . He was talented , sagacious , and brave . In battle , struggling against vast superiority of num bers , and perceiving that some of his soldiers were discour aged and began to give way , he thrust himself into their midst , and crying out , Are these the brave companions of Henry Diaz T his speech and example inspired them anew with courage , and the enemy , who supposed themselves vic torious , were attacked with an impetuosity which forced them to retreat and finally to capitulate . * In 1745 , in the midst of his exploits , this brave man had his left hand wounded by a ball ; and in order to spare the delay of dressing , he caused it to be amputated , saying that each finger of his right hand was worth a left hand in combat . /z/ Bravery and other qualities . Moral traits . the force of habit is still strong notwithstanding any light which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am fast rising above prejudice . 1 Africans are capable , I doubt not , of every noble trait of character ; and those qualities which are the greatest orna ment to humanity , are often exhibited by them to our admi ration . 1 You recollect the anecdote which Mr. Newton tells of a Negro whom he , one day , accused of imposture and injus tice ? The Negro , with wounded pride , replied , " Do you take me for a white man ? " Proyart , in his history of Loango , asserts that if the Ne groes who inhabit the coasts , and associate with white men , are inclined to fraud and other vices , those who have not had intercourse with the whites , are humane , obliging , and hos pitable . Wadstrom , who boasts of their friendship , thinks their sensibility more mild and affecting than that of the whites . Captain Wilson , who lived among them , speaks highly of their constancy and friendship ; they shed tears at his departure . Goldberry inveighs against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly called savage , among whom we find men of probity , models of filial , conjugal and paternal affection , who know all the energies and refinements of virtue ; among whom senti mental impressions are more deep , because they observe , more than we , the dictates of nature , and know how to sa crifice personal interests to the ties of friendship . Robin speaks of a slave of Martinico , who , having gained money sufficient to purchase his own freedom , purchased with it his mother s . Mungo Park says , the most horrible out rage that can be committed against a Negro , is to curse his father or his mother , or to speak of either with contempt . " Strike me , " said a slave to his master , " but curse not my /q/ Louis Desrouleaux . Glance at Africa s interior . mother ! " Park speaks of a negress having lost her son , and finding consolation in the fact that he had never told a lie . Cassaux relates , that a Negro , seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the child of this monster , that it may not learn to imitate his conduct . " Stedman says , " several Maroons " had been condemned to the gallows : one had the offer of his life , on condition of his becoming the executioner of his fellows ; but he refused . The mas ter ordered one of his negroes to perform the office . " Wait , " said he , " until I get ready . " He then went into the house , took a hatchet , and cut off his hand . Then , re turning , he said to his master , " Order me to be the execu tioner of my comrade ! " * There is an interesting anecdote of Louis Desrouleaux , which I will here repeat . Desrouleaux was once a slave . His master , who was possessed of great riches , had been engaged in the slave-trade . He became poor and returned from France to St. Domingo , where his slave , Desrouleaux , had become free , and had himself acquired a fortune . Pinsum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who professed for him great friendship when he was rich . Desrouleaux heard of his old master s misfortunes , hastened to find him , supplied him with honourable lodging and board , and then proposed to him that he would be most happy living in France where his feelings would not be mortified by the sight of ungrateful men . On Pinsum re plying , I can not find subsistence in France , Desrouleaux asked , if an annual income of fifteen thousand francs would suffice ? The Frenchman wept with joy the Negro signed the contract , and the pension was regularly paid . Before we close this conversation , I must just refer to one specimen of the interior of Africa , their splendour , arts , in industry , genius , regard for braveiy , &c.; which has been fur- /z/ The Soliraa camp . Solima song . nished by Lieut . Laing , of the British Navy , who , under instructions from the Governor of Sierra Leone , went on a mission far into the interior . It relates to his visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different chiefs by whom he was well re ceived , Lieut . Laing came to a place called Koukundi , a vil lage of farms belonging to the people of Melicouri . Here he remained during the night , and early in the morning en tered the town itself , which was walled round , with port holes for musquetry , and was impregnable . The country in the neighbourhood was abundantly productive , and in a high state of cultivation ; corn , barley , rice , cassada , and cotton growing in great profusion . Lt. L. says he passed several hundred acres of such cultivation . * The next day , he proceeded to the camp which was about eight miles distant , north , and about three hours S. of Fouricaria . Immediately on his approach , the drums and other warlike instruments were in motion , and soon about 12,000 people were assembled in a large square , in the centre of the savannah on which an immense army was encamped , and Lt. L. communicated the object of his visit , which was to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand with the neighbouring nations . King Yaradee , who is one of the most warlike of the Af rican monarchs , he found surrounded by his brave chiefs , under an ample tent , seated upon the skin of a lion . The king kindly invited Lt. L. to take a seat by his side . The following song , in their own language , was then sung by a minstrel : /z/ " A stranger has come to Yaradee s camp Whose bosom is soft and is fair ; He sits by the valiant Yaradee s side , And none but the valiant sit there . /q/ Solima Song . Like the furious lion Yaradee comes And hurls the terrors of war ; His enemies see him , and , panic-struck , flee To the woods and the deserts afar . By the side of this hero , so valiant and brave , Sits the stranger whose skin is so fair ; He lives on the sea , where he wanders at will , And he knows neither sorrow nor care . Then look at the stranger before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; The last note of my harp swells to Yaradee s praise , While I gaze on the stranger so fair . " The Solimas are great singers . The great deeds of the Solima chiefs , as well as the history of their wars , are hand ed down to posterity by means of Jelle or singing-men , in songs composed much after the manner of Ossian . Those lines are very sweet , said Henry , and the scene must have been very imposing . The Africans are sweet singers , said Caroline ; * but I acknowledge the time has been when I thought them capa ble of sound only not of sentiment , /z/ Scripture testimony to African learning . /z/ " From Guinea s coast pursue the lessening sail , And catch the sounds that sadden every gale .

But pause not there beyond the western wave , Go , see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , heroic spirit bleeds , And from his nerveless frame indignantly recedes . " Rogers . I HAVE been thinking , Pa , said Caroline , that it is a fact somewhat remarkable , that perhaps the first intimation which we find in ancient history of great learning among any people , is that which in Mosaic history points us to Africa . Moses , you know , it is said , was skilled in all the wisdom of the Egyptians ! 4 You have , indeed , referred to a striking and decisive evi dence of the greatness of African attainments at a very early period . We have conclusive and irresistible proof of their quondam greatness also in their works of art , many of which , such as pyramids , obelisks , and mausolea , still stand , as if in mockery of the very credulity of man , a memorial of their spirit and skill . Many will say , however , that the ancient Egyptians were a very " different race of beings from those tribes which /q/ African manuscripts . Tribes discovered . have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in some respects different , the reference to them is suf ficient to invalidate the sweeping declarations of many in re gard to Africans universally ; there are , however , proofs of former greatness and of present susceptibility of great im provement , and of high advances in genius and learning among other portions of the African race . Mr. Thompson , late Governor of Sierra Leone , in a let ter to a distinguished gentleman of Massachusetts , published some time since , says , that he brought from Africa manu scripts sufficient to convince him that the interior of that great continent is even now in a vastly higher state of civili zation and improvement than the residents on the coast have any idea of . Has it not been said that a tribe has lately been disco vered in the interior of Africa who are Christians ? Yes : missionaries of the London Church Missionary Society for Egypt and Abyssinia , found , a few years since , a tribe never before visited by Europeans , who appeared to have much in their faith that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , if I recollect , they are represented as having no knowledge of the Saviour . They believe in ONE GOD ; and they teach that every per son receives reward or punishment according to his life , in a future state . They have also a notion of the existence of an evil spirit , or devil . The history of the deluge is preserved in their traditions . Good angels they consider the guardians of good people . They are strict in the moral instruction of their children . But after all , they can hardly be entitled to be called Christians , so far as I have been able to form an opinion . /z/ Large cities . Black has sometimes been regarded as the colour of beauty . You have spoken , Sir , of some large cities visited by Lt. Laing , or other travellers : do you suppose that such set tlements are common in the interior ? All who have travelled at all in central Africa , have found there very populous and highly cultivated countries , in which were large cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . To these marts resort all the people in the neighbourhood , as in our own country to our larger cities and towns , and caravans as well as single merchants from the most remote regions . I suppose , Pa , that the people in Africa have no idea that their colour is regarded by other nations as a blemish , and that they are therefore perfectly satisfied with themselves in that respect ? Indeed , they are , well satisfied . Whiteness , when first beheld , is shocking to them ; they attribute it to disease . A charitable old Negro woman who afforded Park a meal and a lodging , on the banks of the Niger , could not refrain , even in the midst of her kindness , from exclaiming , " God pre serve us from the DEVIL ! " as she looked upon him . And it is said to have been a common subject of regret among the girls at Bornon , that Denham and Clapperton were ivhitc. 1 Oh ! Pa , you are jesting , I know . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been said as you represent , but Henry here remarked that Heroditus has said that " the Ethiopians excel all other nations in personal beauty : If Mack be a mark of beauty , Caroline , he mischievously remarked , you would stand but little chance of making /z/ /q/ Domestic slavery in Africa . conquest by your colour , of an ebony Ethiop , or of making the best market of yourself in Africa . i Indeed , Henry , I think I should not repine . But to be serious , continued Mr. L. , when the blacks have taken precedence of the whites in civilization , science , and political power , no prejudice has appeared to exist against the colour . The black Prince , Memnon , who served among the Trojan auxiliaries at the siege of Troy , is constantly spoken of , by the Greek and Latin authors , as a person of extraordinary beauty . He is qualified as the Son of Aurora , or the Morning . The prejudice against the colour of the blacks , many contend ( and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I freely acknow ledge my own views would lead me to treat with great dis approbation any plea for amalgamation , ) has grown out of the relative condition of the two races . Caroline here inquired , Have not the Africans many slaves among themselves , in Africa ? If I recollect , Mr. Clapperton says the domestic slaves are numerous . There is a great deal of domestic slavery in different parts of Africa ; but it has been asserted that , for the most part , slavery , except as slaves are taken to be sold to the slave-merchants on the coast , is a different thing in Africa from what it is among us . I know not that it is said that the slaves are treated better than with us ; but it is thought that they are there viewed more as members of the family to which they are attached than as slaves . Still , I am in clined to think that this is a gloss which a comparison would not justify . Henry suggested , at this point , that slavery is bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &lt; Nothing , /z/ How slaves are taken . said he , I am sure , can make amends for the loss of liberty nothing , I mean , that man can offer . Mr. L. had no doubt there has been many an instance of that which Montgomery has so finely expressed , " The broken heart which kindness never heals The home-sick passion which the Negro feels When toiling , fainting , in a land of canes , His spirit wanders to his native plains , And neath the shade of his paternal trees , His litile lonely dwelling there he sees , The home of comfort . " 4 1 have seen it stated , said Henry , * that in some parts of Africa they hunt for slaves for transportation just as they would hunt for wild beasts . It is said that in Bornon , for instance , replied Mr. L. , * where the slave trade is carried on to an immense extent and is the principal traffic , the mode in which slaves are pro cured is very summary : A caravan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there are no slaves on hand they must be procured . The Sultan immediately col lects his forces , marches into the country of some harmless tribe , burns their villages , destroys their fields and flocks , massacres the infirm and old , and returns with as many able bodied prisoners as he can seize . Sometimes 3,000 have been obtained in a single " ghrazie , " as these expeditions are called . The way in which slaves are obtained is some what different in different parts of Africa , and yet is very similar in all . The family all exclaimed , How horrible ! Mr. L. resumed , * The horrors of the slave-trade in AfHorrors /q/ of the slave trade . rica are great . Distressing , however , as is the situation of the captive when first " before his eyes The terrors of captivity arise , " his sufferings are greater in what is called the " middle pas sage " that is , during the voyage , if he be shipped to a dis tant land . And if they be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Desert , their sufferings are repre sented as even greater . 4 Driven by Arab merchants to the North of Africa , through the deep and burning sands of Sahara , scantily sup plied with water , they sink in great numbers under their suf ferings . Denham and his companions saw , in their journeyings , melancholy proofs of the horrors attending this " mid dle passage " over land . They at one time halted near a well around which were lying more than one hundred hu man skeletons , some of them with the skin still remaining upon the bones . " They were only blacks " said the Arabs when they observed the horror of the travellers , and then began to knock about the limbs and skulls with the butt-ends of their guns , Denham says they counted in another place one hundred and seven skeletons . In other instances , they passed sixty or eighty skeletons a day scattered along over that dreary waste ! . About the walls of El-Hamar , they saw many , and among the rest , the skeletons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to death , for these skeletons lay with their fieshless arms still clasped around each other . Caroline felt a little faint , but after a few moments inter ruption , begged her father to proceed . She had no doubt it was owing to the heat of the room . Mr. L. , with some he sitancy , continued : /z/ Sufferings of the captured in the middle passage . While , says Denham , while I was dozing on my horse , about noon , overcome by the heat of the sun , I was sudden ly awakened by a crashing under my feet , and found that my steed had stepped on the perfect skeletons of two human beings , cracking their brittle bones under his feet , and by one trip of his foot separating a skull from the trunk , it rolled on like a ball before him . O horrid barbarity ! Poor Africa ! exclaimed Caroline ; 1 what has she suffered ! I do not wonder that that wretched continent has been represented as a widow , sitting beneath her own palm-trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refusing to be comforted ! * And are they exposed to much suffering on the western coast , when taken to be sent on ship-board , to be conveyed to other lands ? asked Henry . Yes , their sufferings then are great , and frequently insup portable . At the lowest estimate , it is said that an average of one hundred thousand of the African race have been seized every year , and borne across the Atlantic to supply the West Indies and the Brazilian market alone . The wars attending the capture of such a multitude , make Africa , of course , a field of blood , and a scene of great affliction . And then , said Caroline , the separation of relatives and friends , occasioned by the forced removal of the captured , I have no doubt breaks a thousand hearts ; O it is shocking to humanity ! And how painful is it to think that much of the distress which Africa has endured , has " been occasioned , perhaps , by our own countrymen ; or , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this boast ed land of liberty , have been held out to unprincipled men to procure slaves and bring them hither !

Yes , my daughter , it is indeed a deep stain upon our honour a dark blot upon our country s glory . It is such a stain as no Christian nation should tolerate .

" Very good , my son , and very appropriate . We are in deed a peculiar people . As a nation e have hitherto enjoyed unexampled prosperity .

Slavery must cease , and /q/ The evil must be removed . we must do what we can to redress the wrongs we have done , or our country is ruined . 1 We may have able statesmen , a faithful administration , the physical strength and resources of our country may be our boast , and we may pride ourselves on the valour of our armies and the gallantry of our navy ; but without a sacred regard to the immutable principles of justice , all will be of no avail .

The age finds all within the vortex drawn , The strength of current far too great to stem By feigned indifference . Something must be done ; and the considerate feel and acknowledge the fact .

And I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst the discerning , but one opinion in respect to the advantages of colonization . In respect to the means most proper to be employed , said Mr. L. , there is a difference of opinion ; but reflecting men generally , as I said before , are beginning to feel , more than ever , that something must be done . No one who looks at the subject with a candid eye can , it seems to me , doubt either the expediency of encouraging the colonization of our coloured population in Africa , or the desirableness of the abolishment of slavery in our land . Connected with this subject are great questions , involving great considerations , requiring the wisdom which is from above , and calling for a spirit of prayer , meekness , and great forbearance . Already are there thrown around the subject difficulties and embar rassments which ought to have been avoided , or rather I /q/ A right spirit needed . would say , ought never to have been created . A wrong spi rit and unwise measures will only increase the evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very many are actually afraid to look the evil full in the face .

A change is taking place . /z/ " We are required to devise some means whereby the political evil which we have inherited may be corrected , and a foul , unseemly stain washed from our national escutcheon . Duty to the coloured population of our country calls loudly for it duty to ourselves demands it . " Gov .

Selfinterest , I should think would furnish to the Southern peo ple most pressing motives to immediate and vigourous action in freeing our land from the very last remnant of slavery . The public are awakening to the importance of the sub ject , replied Mr. L. , and begin to feel more than formerly the urgency of the case . Every passing month , the cause of Africa s unhappy children , is finding new and ardent friends who feel that the duty which ve owe ourselves , our country , and the world , can only be fulfilled by listening to the cries of the oppressed , and loosing every band that chafes the limbs or the souls of our coloured brethren . A mighty change has taken place , and is still increasing . In this subOur /q/ whole country has one common interest . ject the non-slave-holding States as well as the South have a deep interest . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not see that we should be in any danger , Pa ? 1 We might not be in any personal danger , my son ; but is not the South as well as the North our country ? are not the noble-hearted Southrons our brethren ? and are they not every way worthy of our warm affection and respect ? They are indeed part of ourselves . If personal danger were the only cause of alarm , we surely could not be indifferent spectators of a scene of revolt and its dreadful consequences . Our interests are interwoven , and bound together by many ties . Our intimate friends and connexions are scattered over the Union , and ourselves , or our children may be on the very centre of the crater , when the volcano shall burst . 4 There are other considerations , however , which should not be viewed with indifference . Such is the genius of our government , that if one member suffer , all the members suffer with it . Frequent collisions of feeling , clashing of sentiment , and contentions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds of brotherhood . The existence of slavery in our land , has more than once been the fertile theme of political strife in our national coun cils , the rallying point of contending parties . It has already engendered much bad feeling , and what will be its final result is the subject of much anxious speculation and the cause of unpleasant forebodings . To be united , and prosperous , and happy , for any length of time , we must be one in sentiment , one in action , one in character . The tariff question did much to provoke unpleasant feeling between the different parts of the Union did it not , . Pa ? /z/ Slavery is the bane of our peace and unity . Tariff and anti-tariff views and the like , have had less to do in producing the commotions which have convulsed our country at different times , than many are aware of . It was an evil hour when slavery was introduced to this otherwise favoured land . Its unhappy influence has been gradually developed until its curse has become tremendous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of our country ; still , it has an influence indirect , which more than all things else contributes to mar and jeopard the peace , the welfare , and the permanency of the Union . c The fact is , SLAVERY is the bane and the ruin of one por tion of our land , and the advantage of FREE LABOUR and in industry has exalted the other portion . The natural conse quence is , a morbid sensibility and ever wakeful jealousy on the part of the depressed ; and an increasing desire for greater gain and aggrandisement , on the part of the other . Yes , it is slavery that sinks the South ! Says one of her own distinguished citizens , " See the wide-spreading ruin which the avarice of our ancestral government has produ ced , as witnessed in a sparse population of freemen , desert ed habitations , fields without culture ; and , strange to tell , even the wolf , driven back long since by the ap proach of man , now returns , after the lapse of an hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Their lands worn out , in a great measure , under the ungrateful cultiva tion of slaves ; the population of freemen declining , or wending their westward way ; and those interests neglected which would have been cultivated by a free , white , and working population , the South feels but too sensibly every effort which other sections make to sustain themselves , as if oppressive of her whilst , all the time , the evil , the root of the evil , is SLAVERY ! The South has injured , and is yet crushing herself , by cherishing an evil which will soon bus /q/ Slavery depresses the South . Is unprofitable . found to be more than can be borne . She can not rise whilst the evil remains . She feels it ; and the other States see it to be so . It is a subject , however , that can hardly be dis cussed at all in its various bearings without eliciting sectional jealousy , or party severity , and enkindling mutual animosi ties , although it is an evil that convulses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You consider slave labour then as unprofitable , Pa ? There are individual exceptions , undoubtedly , in which the slave dedicates himself to his master with the most zeal ous and generous devotion ; but generally that labour we should suppose most profitable , in which the labourer knows that he will derive the profits of his industry ; his em employment depending on his diligence , and his reward upon his assiduity . There is every motive to excite to exertion , and to animate to perseverance . Therefore , where the choice exists to employ , at an equal hire , free , or slave labour , the former will be decidedly preferred , because it is regarded as more capable , more diligent , more faithful , more worthy of confidence . Where capital is unable to command the free labour that is required , as has been sometimes the case in the first settlement of some parts of our country , it may there purchase that of slaves . 4 Then slavery was introduced into this country on ac count of the difficulty of procuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it , Sir ? Yes ; the first guilt of the introduction of slavery into this country is chargeable upon England ; and the circum stances are such as show conclusively that where free labour can be had , avarice , which knows the way to wealth even better than philosophy itself , prefers free labour . When /z/ Introduced by Kngland . Policy of England . England introduced slavery into her American Colonies and Islands , she had as much free labour at home as the land holders wanted to employ ; and it has been on this account , and this only , that the poet was enabled to say , " Slaves can not breathe in England ; if their lungs Receive our air , that moment they are free ; They touch our country , and their schackles fall . * The fact is , the respiration could go on well enough in those parts of her dominions where free labour was not to be obtained . In America was a widely-extended territory , with a soil and climate adapted to the raising of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co lonies an immediate and productive source of revenue , which vas the settled policy of England , and on which she placed great reliance , ( monopolizing at the same time all her colo nial commerce , and taking care to increase that commerce as much as possible by increasing the productions of the soil , ) an immediate supply of labour was necessary . As an ex pedient to provide for her colonial wants , she commenced filling her colonies with African slaves 1 She would not tolerate slavery at home , and yet would provide for , and locate the evil among her distant children , who , consulting their immediate profit , and regardless of future consequences , at length fell in with the slave-policy of the mother country . The same causes which induced England to prohibit slavery at home , and yet pour slaves into her colonies , it may be remarked , led Spain and France and all the Euro pean powers , who were supplied with free labour at home , but had infant colonies in the West Indies or America , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New World to popu late with labourers by the emigration of free men , aud the /q/ Slavery retires South can not be supported on barres soil . natural increase of population , slavery was resorted to as a more speedy method of introducing labour . It was intro* duced to the colonies only , because free labour was not to be had there ; and not into the mother country because slave labour can not compete with the free where the employer has his choice . How inappropriate then the praise which Cowper be stows on his native country , in the lines that follow the quotation which you just now made : " That s noble , and bespeaks a nation proud And jealous of the blessing . " If slave labour be so unprofitable , and if the naturally rich lands of the South become , in process of time , barren under its culture , it is not strange that slavery should have retired first from the Northern and Eastern States . Slavery is a tax that poor soils and cold climates like ours can not endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , is more than the productions of the soil would bring in return . Yet cold countries and comparatively unproductive soils are cultivated by free labour to advantage ? * Yes ; Switzerland , Scotland , and New England , are striking examples of it . The freedom and character of the labouring population , make these countries populous and wealthy , although nature has by no means been liberal in her gifts to either of them . Introduce there a system of slave labour , and pauperism and famine would be the inevit able consequence . It has been well remarked that " free and slave labour move in opposite directions from the same /z/ Occasions much anxiety . point of departure ; and , while one is regularly diminishing the capacity of the earth for production , the other is con stantly nourishing and invigorating its powers . " It is an opinion of no recent date , but ancient as slavery itself , that the labour of bondmen is gradually destructive of the soil to which it is applied . I can appreciate now , said Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The slave system inflicts an incalculable amount of human suffering for the sake of a wholesale waste of labour and capital . " I have been told that the slave population of the South is a great check upon the enjoyments of life , and a source of constant apprehension and of very frequent alarm . It seems to me that if I lived at the South , I should have the bloody scenes of St. Domingo and the Southampton massa cre haunting my fears continually . I can not say that I ever felt alarmed on account of per sonal exposure at the . South , although I resided there , many years , in the midst of a slave population chiefly . I confess , however , I now conceive the danger greatly increased . Your mother was once obliged , in company with a multi tude of other ladies and their children , to flee , in the night , several miles into the country , at a time of threatened insur rection . In some parts of the Southern States such causes of fear and momentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa , that the circumstances of the Southampton insurrection are recollected by you : will you give us some account of it . I have forgot its detail , although I retain the impression which it made . The leader of that insurrection was a Negro , was he not ? * It would neither be pleasant nor profitable to dwell on /q/ Great vigilance necessary . that most melancholy catastrophe . Suffice it to say , it was planned by a Negro , by the name of Turner . He communi cated his plans to a few kindred spirits , who with ready minds and hands engaged in the work of preparation . The minds of others were gradually prepared for the intended event . When the work of destruction commenced , they armed themselves with hatchets and axes . Turner ascended by a ladder to the upper part of his master s house in the silence of night , and passing down stairs , opened the outer doors of the house to his followers , and told them the work was now open to them , Turner himself giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mistress as they lay asleep in bed . Turner , in his confession , said that his " master sprung from the bed and called his wife , but it was the last word ; another blow laid him and his wife both dead . " The murder of the family , five in number , was the work of a moment . " Not one of them awoke , " said Turner . He continued , " There was a little infant sleeping in a cradle , that was forgotten until we had left the house and gone some distance , when Harry and Will ( two accomplices ) returned and killed it . We got here four guns and several old mus kets , with a pound or two of powder . " They then pro ceeded to the next house , a mile distant . They there shot a man whom they met in the yard . It was now day-light . The family in the house took the alarm , and fastened the door . With one stroke of an axe the door was broken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed them , one with a single blow of an axe , the other , Turner said , he " took by the hand and with a sword struck her several blows over the head , but the sword being dull , another Negro despatched her with an axe . " At another house , after hav ing murdered all the family but the lady and her daughter , Turner said that one of his associates " pu lied the lady out /z/ Insurrectionary alarms . of the house , and on the steps severed her head from her body with a broadaxe . " " Miss , " he continues , " when I discovered her , had concealed herself in the corner formed by the projection of the cellar-cap from the house . On my approach she fled , but was soon overtaken , and , after repeated blows with the sword , I killed her by a blow on the head with a fence-rail. " * In this way they proceeded until more than sixty per sons , men , women , and children , fell a sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go through with a rehearsal of all the circumstances . I have not a heart for it . What has been related , nearly in the language of Turner himself , will serve to give one some faint idea of the horrors of a Negro insurrection , and of the dangers against which the ut most vigilance is necessary to guard the lives of multitudes . 1 1 have here a letter from a gentleman in Georgia , which will perhaps enable you to form a more vivid idea of the sen sation produced in every southern town , when an insurrec tion is apprehended . The letter was written some time since , not to myself , but to Mr. . Will you read it , Henry ? Reads . " The papers from this state have no doubt apprised you of the excitement which prevails here about our black population .

I had retired when the alarm was given , but we immediately got up and dressed , and were soon after joined by Mrs. , with her infant , pale as marble . I closed the door , and urged them to be quiet , and remain in the house ; but it was useless go they would others were gone , and they would not stay to be murdered . Finding reasoning lost , I opened the door and out we sallied your humble ser vant with a half naked babe in his arms , and two women by his side , scudding with as much speed as a Baltimore schoo ner , under a full press of canvass. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has subsided , but I do not think we are safe one hour . The very elements of destruction are around us , mingling in all our relations , and w r e know not at what moment the storm may burst over us .

" O slavery ! said Caroline , * I hardly know which situa tion is more distressing that of the slave-holder , or his bondmen. /z/ Slavery attended with anxieties . /z/ " What day passes by without the occurrence of some event , or the wit ness of some scene , which draws from every feeling heart a sigh or a prayer for the complete fulfilment of all the most sanguine hopes of the friends of colonization ?

I thought that you , at least , Caroline , retired from the subject last night well satisfied with a residence in a non-slave-hold ing state , and congratulating yourself , perhaps , that you could lay your head on your pillow without the apprehen sion of being aroused before morning by the cry of " an in surrection ? " Indeed , Pa , I have thought much of the South ; more , perhaps , because I was born there ; and I acknowledge that I have often wished to see the land of my infancy and ear liest childhood , especially when I have heard you speak so honourably and feelingly of the kindness and hospitality of the South , and so affectionately of the many warm friends we have there . I have myself formed a very exalted idea of the warm-hearted friendship and genuine hospitality of the South . I also think I should like their pleasant winters , and should relish their summer fruits . Still I can not say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of all circumstances , anxious to take up my residence , even for a few months , in the midst of so much anxiety and alarm as I am sure I should feel in any place surrounded by a population composed , in a great proportion , of slaves . I want to have nothing to do with slaves . I can adopt Cowper s declaration with all sincerity : " I would not have a slave to till my ground , To carry me , to fan me while I sleep , And tremble when I wake , for all the wealth That sinews bought and sold have ever earn d . No : dear as freedom is , and in my heart s Just estimation prized above all price , I had much rather be myself the slave , And wear the bonds , than fasten them on him . " * Pa , said Henry , are not the laws of slave-holding states very severe in respect to the slave ? I have read some very cruel enactments , as they appeared to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or soon after it , the legislature of Louisiana adopted very severe re solutions , in respect to slaves , and ordered all free people who had lately come into the state , to leave it within sixty days . * I would offer no apology for slavery , my son ; but it is conceded by all that its very existence seems to require some provision for its maintenance . In my own view , the neces sity for severe enactments , shows slavery to be a great evil . It is pleaded by the people of the South , that rigorous laws and those which seem to some cruelly severe , are made ne cessary by " the interference of strangers . " The resolu tions , for instance , to which you refer as having passed the Louisiana legislature , were adopted a few days after the ar rest in New Orleans of four free persons of colour engaged in circulating " Walker s Appeal , " called more commonly /z/ Dangerous publications . The South must be vigilant . both at the South and the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to endanger the lives of the whole white population of the Southern country , wherever it should obtain circulation among the blacks . Even in Boston , although there was no law which took cog nizance of the act , the municipal Judge referred to that pub lication in his charge at the opening of the next court , as one of highly reprehensible character , and he regretted that the laws had not anticipated the offence . In Georgia , too , about the same time , the legislature thought it necessary to impose a quarantine of forty days on all vessels arriving with free coloured persons on board , and to oblige the captains of such vessels to carry away again all such persons ; and they also enacted that the circulation of pamphlets of evil tendency among domestics , be considered a capital offence . The same law makes it penal to teach free persons of colour , or slaves , to read or write , and prohibits the introduction of slaves into the state for sale . These enactments also were in consequence of a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous character which was found to be in circulation in Savannah . Other severe legislation has taken place in these and other states from time to time , for similar reasons . It is , to say the least , truly an unfortunate state of things which re quires such security . Pa , I can hardly regard any one as a good citizen , or considerate man , who would throw these publications , as so many firebrands , into the midst of a slave population . I should think it would be like casting coals of fire into a ma gazine , said Caroline . * These laws , Mr. L. further remarked , * are chiefly of recent date ; and it was to be hoped that the causes which flUNXvEBSITl /q/ The South must be diligent . led to their adoption and seemed to render them necessary , would cease to operate , and that these laws would be altered or repealed . The evil complained of , however , it is said , has continued to exist , and that too accompanied with aggra vated circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst also appeals have been made by several of the states through their legislatures to the nonslave-holding states , asking them to legislate on the subject , so as to make punishable in all the states the issuing of such publications as strike at the peace and security of other parts of the Union . Congress has also been occupied in much unprofitable discussion growing out of the present state of things , whilst from one part of the country , petitions have flowed in upon the two houses for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia ; and from another , efforts have been made to subject the Post-office establishment to such regulations that a supervisory power shall exclude from the mails all publications deemed incendiary , and also to secure from our national legislature a pledge that the United States has no authority touching the question of slavery even with in their own domain , the ten miles square in which our capitol is located . 1 The greatest circumspection should , doubtless , be ob served for the safety of the South , or the consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many valuable lives , both among the whites who may be the victims of an insurrectionary movement , and the blacks who would fall in its suppression . Have we reason to suppose that an insurrection of the Negroes at the South will ever be permanently successful ? It was , I believe , at St. Domingo ? It can not be attended with permanent success , so long as /z/ Insurrectionary attempts ruinous to the blacks . the Union endures . Mr. Clay has correctly remarked , " It would be speedily suppressed by the all-powerful means of the United States ; and , it would be the madness of despair in the blacks that should attempt it . But , if attempted in some parts of the United States , what shocking scenes of carnage , rapine , and lawless violence might not be perpe trated before the arrival at the theatre of action of a com petent force to quell it ! And after it is put down , what other scenes of military rigour and bloody executions to punish the insurgents , and impress their whole race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping the blacks in ignorance , it seems to me , is greatly to be regretted . It is . I can not myself , however , believe in such neces sity . The slave and the free should both be instructed . In what way instruction should be given may be a matter of in quiry . This subject may be regulated according to what shall appear safest and most equitable in respect to all con cerned . But to withhold moral and religious instruction from any human being , is altogether unjustifiable . To be stow generally that instruction also which prepares for the enjoyment of freedom , I think also is both duty and good policy . If the slave remain a slave , I can not think that entire ignorance is necessary ; and if he is ever to be free , it is cer tainly necessary that he should be instructed . 4 1 think I have heard you say , Pa , that you have given instruction to slaves and that no objection was made by their masters ? I have myself instructed several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction to be given , to many more . I do not mean religious and moral instruction only either . I /q/ Slaves should not be kept in ignorance . have myself heard a slave at the South recite from the Latin and Greek Classics . That slave was also acquainted with the Hebrew . 1 have seen Negroes at the South admitted to equal privileges in some of the first literary institutions . I know many slave-holders who disclaim the idea that it is ne cessary to keep slaves in ignorance ; and I know not a few benevolent masters and mistresses , who , either in person , instruct their slaves , or cause others to do it under their di rection . This , it is true , is not according to the letter of the laws , if according to the spirit of the government in the slave-holding states . Jealousy and fear , perhaps I ought to say common prudence , have caused severe laws , which pre clude the instruction , lawfully , in some instances , of both bondman and coloured freeman . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under certain restric tions . But I believe that any man in whom the community may have confidence , might pass his life very usefully at the South in the instruction of Negroes , bond and free , with the entire approbation of the whites , notwithstanding all pre sent legal enactments , there being little disposition to enforce the letter of the law except in necessary cases . Of what use then are the enactments ? The slave-holder , perhaps , will tell you that these enact ments enable the Southern community of whites to keep the power in their own hands , against all who would exert a dangerous influence ; but that they were never designed to operate except as a preventive of insurrectionary plans and incentives . 1 You think , Sir , that the laws in regard to blacks in the Southern States would be of a very different character , were it not for the indiscreet measures of men who , professing to /z/ Kindly feelings of the South . befriend the slave , endanger the safety of both whites and blacks , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multitude of facts to which I might refer facts of no doubtful character in support of that sentiment . It is an opinion also which I have heard ex pressed by intelligent blacks at the South , who generally most heartily deprecate any interference in their concerns , by citizens of non-slave-holding States . Their situation is made extremely trying oftentimes by such interference . Still I would by no means impugn the motives of any class of the true friends of Africa . Aspersions are often cast , no doubt most unjustly , on the motives of a portion of the ad vocates of universal emancipation . Incendiaries and evil disposed men there may be among them ; but indiscriminate censure is generally wrong . Why , Pa , do not the slave-holding States unite , and rid themselves of the evil at once ? I am sure they might do better than continue to cherish an evil so fraught with dan ger and solicitude/ My daughter , they feel , ( and I have no doubt that under existing circumstances , the conviction is honest , ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some ima gine . There is , the Southron will tell you , a relation be tween the owner of slaves , and the unhappy beings who are thrown upon him , which is far more complicated , and far less easily dissolved , than a mind unacquainted with the whole subject in all its bearings , is apt to suppose a rela tion growing out of the very structure of society . Go , for instance , to the slave-holder , and propose to him to emancipate his slaves . He feels the evils of slavery as strongly , and probably more so than you can feel them /q/ Difficulties of emancipation . and who will say that he has not as much benevolence in his heart as we in ours ? The laws of his State , framed ac cording to the dictates of the best judgment of legislators , forbid emancipation , except under certain restrictions , which are deemed absolutely necessary to prevent pauperism , and wretchedness , and crime , and utter ruin : and here are hu man beings dependant on him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation he did not voluntarily as sume . He was born the legal proprietor of his slaves , just as much as he was born the subject of civil government . This fact is often sneered at ; but it is fact notwithstanding . And it is his duty , and a duty which he can not well avoid , to make the best provision for them in his power . Too fre quently , it would be just as humane to throw them overboard at sea , as to set them free in this country . Moreover , if he turn them out to shift for themselves , he turns out upon the community those who in all probability will become , most of them , vagabonds , paupers , felons , a pest to society . He will tell you that as a Christian , as a patriot , as a philanthro pist , as an honest man , and humane friend of the blacks , he finds insuperable obstacles to the accomplishment of what you propose . He will tell you , perhaps , that it is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , are precisely of this state of mind . I acknowledge that I have had my northern prejudices ; and those prejudices were strong they stirred within me indignation and almost revenge . But I would now indulge in no sweeping anathema against the South . I have been , for years , in a situation to see the tremendous evil of slavery as it is . I can therefore sympathize with the slave-holder who regrets the necessity which , in a measure , compels him to hold his fellow-men in bondage , whilst at the same time I abhor slavery with my whole heart . I can bear witness /z/ Duty to slaves does not always require emancipation . also to the humanity of slave-holders in the Southern States , so far as my acquaintance and observation has extended . It has far exceeded the feeling which I have usually found in dulged towards blacks , in my native New England , or in the Middle States . The specimens of ill-treatment of slaves with which the world is served up , now and then , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , and which seem to be but too well suited to the taste of a large portion of the community , are a wretched caricature , and as unfair specimens of the general treatment which slaves receive , as would be the assassination and murder of an in dividual in this State , held up as a sample of Philadelphia morals . A much kindlier feeling , I am satisfied , is indulged towards blacks at the South , than at the North . /q/ Properly in human flesh a revolting thought . /z/ " Frown indignantly on the first dawnings of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest , or enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts . " Washington . is a way , Pa , said Caroline , on the conversation being resumed , which some people have , of talking of slaves as " property " which is exceeding grating to my ears , and at which my mind always revolts . 1 As to that , my daughter , said Mr. L. , if any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unqualified right to hold his fellow-men in bondage without any regard to the circumstances and necessity of the case , the whole civilized world , and the laws of Christian nations which have pro nounced the slave trade to be piracy , are against him . It is not often that we hear any man attempt to justify slavery in the abstract , or that we find one who looks upon his slaves in precisely the same light in which most people regarded them when the slave-trade was legitimate , There are , I know , exceptions to the generally correct and Christian sentiments and declarations of distinguished men at the South on this subject . I have not forgotten the painful sensations with which I have read some remarks that have fallen from the lips of a few individuals . A Governor of South Carolina , in a message to the Legislature of his /z/ Sentiments of Southern men . State , a few years since , said , " Slavery is not a national evil ; on the contrary it is a national benefit . * * Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of much consequence , in a philosophical point of view , whether it be voluntary , or involuntary . " A Governor of the same State has recently used still stronger language in vindication of slavery . But such sentiments , I am inclined to consider as an anomaly , on the whole , and not a fair representation of the views of the South ; much less can they receive the approbation of the American people . The man who can utter them is far behind the age in which we live . * I recollect also an address delivered in South Carolina , a few years since , by one of her distinguished sons , in which the speaker maintained that slavery , as it exists in the Southern States , is " no greater , or more unusual evil , than befals the poor in general ; that its extinction would be at tended with calamity to the country , and to the people con nected with it , in every character and relation ; that no ne cessity exists for such extinction ; that slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the de nunciation pronounced against the second son of Noah ; that it is not inconsistent with the genius and spirit of Chris tianity ; nor considered by St. Paul as a moral evil . " * I have also noticed the recent remarks upon the floors of Congress , of certain Southern gentlemen ; and read seve ral addresses lately delivered in various slave-holding States , some of which take the ground that slavery " is sanctioned by the religion of the Bible , " as well as justified in law ; and one declares " solemnly and emphatically , " that " if any man at the South makes but a movement towards eman- cipation equal or partial immediate or remote , he is faith less to the duty which he owes to his State faithless to the duty which he owes to his God . " /q/ Sentiments of Southern men . Another specimen of Southern views on the subject , may be found in a debate which I have before me , that oc curred not long since in a synod of the Presbyterian Church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the domestic relations , ( meaning to include slavery , ) stand upon precisely the same ground in Scripture . " The REV . DR . H. expressed his astonishment at the views presented . He " could not agree by any means , that the relation of master and slave is precisely the same as that of husband and wife . No , nor at all the same . The one is a natural relation , ordained of God , and sanctioned by Him for the happiness of man ; but the other had its origin in injustice and wrong and is never sanctioned in the Bible ; unless al lusions to it as an existing relation and a tolerated evil are so misinterpreted . But because it is an existing relation . does it follow that it has a basis like that of the relation of husband and wife ? God forbid ! The relations differ widely and essentially , not only in their nature , but also in the fact that one is permanent , and the other continues only by the strong necessity of the ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precise similarity in the relations , either in their natural basis , or their perpetuity . I , for one , can not consent to any phraseology which looks that way . It is unscriptural and false . I maintain that slavery con tinues only by necessity ; and that it OUGHT TO BE ABO /z/ The REV . DR . B. , who is a distinguished Professor in the Union Theological Seminary , was somewhat opposed to the views of his distinguished friend . He " denied that the relation is unlawful ; it is recognized by Scripture . The apostles treated it as a relation morally right , considering all the circumstances . Nor can any thing be done to coun- /z/ Sentiments of Southern men . teract the incendiary efforts of fanaticism , until ve take scriptural views of this subject , and maintain them from Scripture . It is also impossible to do much for the ex tensive religious instruction of the slaves themselves , unless they are made to understand that their masters have a scriptural right to maintain their authority . The public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own section of country . But it is a fact established by Scripture , that the master has a moral right to retain his re lation to his slaves . There are , however , reciprocal duties for each to perform , which are too commonly and fearfully neglected . " Another learned DOCTOR of divinity , the President of Hampden Sidney College , did " not think it necessary to take such ground . The truth is , that slavery is so much involved in the very texture of society , that immediate de struction is an utter impossibility . Even supposing the existing relation to be sinful , yet the abolitionists are so wild in their mode of action , that they never can succeed . No thing can be done in the way they are attempting . They do not seem to consider consequences at all , or to reflect that the subject has intricate relations , and many troublesome po litical and social bearings . On a certain occasion , it is said , an eagle caught up an innocent lamb , and was flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligent bird was convinced of its injustice ; and , desirous of making imme diate reparation , it let go its hold , and dashed the lamb s brains out ! Such is abolition benevolence ! " 4 The REV . MR . L. insisted with much earnestness , that it was " necessary to take the ground assumed by Dr. B. , and by the paper read . The churches expect a full expres sion of sentiment on the part of pastors ; and it will not do to give the subject the go by , in the way intimated by the /q/ Sentiments of Southern men . last speaker . It is not enough merely to denounce the abo litionists , and to say that they were wrong . We ought to give the reasons of our difference of opinion , and to let them know that we maintain our existing relations with the slaves , because the Bible gives us authority to do it " The REV . MR . S. thought " the paper which had been read goes too far . It extenuates slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , not from Scripture , but from circumstances . Slavery is a moral evil , and ought to be done away as soon as possible . Bet ter contend for immediate emancipation , than for perpetual servitude . The actual degraded condition of the African race is the only reason why slavery ought not to be abolish ed this very hour . Ethiopia must one day stretch forth her hands unto the Lord , and my prayer is , that that time may speedily come ! Life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , are the right of all ; and can only be taken away by the claims of a harsh and stern necessity . Something ought to be done at once , and effectually , for the amelioration of the condition of the slaves . But let not this Synod , even in ap pearance , assume principles which justify the perpetuity of slavery . " The REV . MR . W. said , " that to his mind two things were perfectly clear : 1st . The relation of master and slave is justified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that relation . 2d . Our Saviour and his apostles never intended to interfere with the civil relations of society , except by the silent influence of religion upon the heart and life . Whenever an attempt has been made to force mankind , in anticipation of the preparation which can only be effected by the gospel , harm has always been done . I can not but think that the views expressed in the paper are , in the main , correct . " /z/ Sentiments of Southern men . The REV . MR . T. , another Professor in the Theologi cal Seminary , would " never interfere in a political way with any matter . But would touch the subject in a scrip tural way . This is a Bible question . Slavery has bearings upon very important actual duties in life , for which the Bible provides . The ultimate influence of the gospel will change the order of society ; but it will be only when all parties are willing that the change should take place , and then who will complain ? The Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set every thing right in society . If any think slavery will be eternal , I differ very much from them . Nor does the paper , which has been read , contain any sen timent implying a desire to perpetuate slavery " 1 The REV . MR . A. , now one of the Secretaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , believed " that rash and bold assertions have unsettled the minds of many Christians in reference to slavery . " He was for adopting a circular letter , giving a scriptural view of the subject . " The Bible , no doubt , tolerates the existing re lation , in view of the circumstances of the case . " 1 W. M. ESQ. , a distinguished lawyer , and elder of the church , remarked that he was " by no means satisfied with the spirit and principles of the paper . To say that slavery stands upon precisely the same ground with the other social relations , is to my mind very far from being precisely true . " " Such views leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sin . For if the Bible sanc tions it , the thing is morally right ; and if morally right , we are under no obligations to remove it . But is this scripture ? Must we sit still , and do nothing for the removal of this cry ing evil ? Must we wait for some miraculous interposition of divine agency ? With the Bible in our hands , no one /q/ Sentiments of Southern men . can doubt that slavery is inconsistent with its spirit and its precepts ; and we are bound , therefore , to aim at emancipa tion . Lord Chatham once said , that he would never come into parliament , with the statute book doubled down with dog s ears to prove that liberty was the birth-right of British subjects . Nor will I , cried Mr. Maxwell , come into this Synod , with my Bible doubled down in dog s ears , to prove that slavery is wrong . No , sir , I will not undertake such a work of supererogation ! One need read but the first chap ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong . How was man created ? With dominion over the soul and body of his fellow-man ? No ! There was no slavery in Eden . Nor would there have been any to curse the earth , unless Satan had prevailed in the temptation . It is prepos terous to go to the Bible to defend slavery . Its universal spirit is against the institution , gloriously against it ! But some have said , that although slavery is wrong in the abstract , yet circumstances have made it morally right . This phraseolo gy , sir , I object to . That which is once wrong , can never become morally right . It never can become right in such a sense as releases us from obligations to attempt the removal of the original evil . It never can become morally right , in the common acceptation of the phrase . The most we can say of it is , that it may be tolerated on account of an impe rious and dreadful necessity . To say that slavery is moral ly right , would be a virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst I deny that slavery can be said to be morally right , I maintain the existence of a necessity , which palliates , under the circumstances , the temporary continuance of the relation . But mark ! I found my position not on Scripture , nor on the moral lawfulness of slavery ; but simply on the fact of a necessity . To illustrate my idea : Killing a man in the abstract is wrong , just as slavery is . And yet 1 may /z/ Sentiments of Southern men . kill a man in a particular case of self-defence . Circum stances justify me ; self-preservation is the valid plea . And yet I may wilfully kill no man , if 1 can avoid it . I am bound to use every means to release myself from the neces sity of taking the life of a human being . So it is with slavery . I have no right before God or men to keep my fellow man in bondage , except in view of the peculiar exi gency . I may not rest satisfied while he is deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort for his deliver ance ; and unless I do my best to get rid of the necessity , I am guilty of the sin of unjustifiable slavery just as much as in other circumstances , I would be guilty of unjustifiable homicide . But if I am aiming at emancipation , and doing that which is just and right to my slaves , I may , during the interval preserve my authority over them . It is the dic tate of self-preservation , as well as the impulse of benevo lence , to do so . " We must try to get rid of slavery . We have no right to cling to our slaves , under the delusion that the Scripture justifies the system as morally right . By colonization we can rescue many from their servile degradation . And if any other rational plan of emancipation is practicable , we are under obligations which no man may disregard with impu nity , to embrace the occasion , and let the oppressed go free . " In regard to immediate abolition , " said Mr. M. , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assem bly . It is a scheme of destruction and ruin . It is casting off the slave to let him sink . It is adding death to injustice , murder to oppression . God forbid that we should add this to our sins ! " But whilst I condemn the immediate abolition scheme , I can not sanction the principles contained in the paper which has led to this discussion . Such principles , instead of IranSentiments /q/ of Southern men . quilizing Christians , would only disturb them the more ; be cause their consciences will not stay tranquillized . SLAVE RY IS ABHORRENT TO THE ENLIGHTENED CONSCIENCE , aild all efforts to give it false peace , would , in the end , only increase its agitations . I am satisfied that Southern Christians will not receive such principles ; let not the Synod of this ancient commonwealth sanction any principles which seem to justify slavery , especially from Scripture . Let us tell the world that we abhor the system , and only justify its continuance amongst us by an imperious necessity , which our feeble hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sume a position , favourable even in appearance , to the per petuity of human bondage ! " 1 have thus occupied your attention by this debate at some length , because I think it but a fair expression of Southern views and feelings generally on the subject of slavery . I need hardly say that the proposition which gave rise to the debate was rejected . * There are , it is to be supposed , some whose rashness is greater than their judgment , who recklessly assert principles which would find few advocates among the virtuous or consi derate any where ; but I am persuaded that there is a more correct sentiment prevailing at the South among the enlight ened and influential part of the community than is generally supposed , and perhaps than might be inferred from this de bate . Otherwise , we might have less hope for the slave , and greater fear for our country and be led to endorse in despair the words of the poet : " Yet , yet , degraded men ! the expected day That breaks your bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , ask you still to bleed , And holy men give Scripture for the deed . " But to show what have been the sentiments of the South /z/ Views and feelings of distinguished Southrons. on this subject , still more clearly , and what are the views which we may expect still to prevail , I will also refer to other instances . 1 Sa ) T s one who has stood high in the public confidence at the South , " Almost all masters in VIRGINIA assent to the proposition , that when the slaves can be liberated without danger to themselves , and to their own advantage , IT OUGHT TO BE DONE . " He adds , " If there are few who think otherwise in Virginia , I feel assured there are few such any where at the South . " It was the language of PATRICK HENRY , " It would re joice my very soul , that every one of my fellow beings was emancipated . As we ought , with gratiude , to admire that decree of heaven which has numbered us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of holding our fel low-men in bondage . " Said ZACHARIAH JOHNSON , in the same debate before the legislature of Virginia , when the distinguished Patrick Henry uttered the above , " Slavery has been the founda tion of that impiety , and dissipation , which have been so much disseminated among our countrymen . If it were to tally abolished , it would do much good . * * The princi ple ( of emancipation ) has begun , since the Revolution ; let us do what we will , it will come round . " * Gov . RANDOLPH , in the same debate , approved the hope " that those unfortunate men , held in bondage , might , by the operation of the general government , be made free . " * JUDGE TUCKER , in 1795 , wrote " The introduction of slavery into this country , is , at this day , considered among its greatest misfortunes . " In 1803 he wrote " Will not our posterity execrate the memory of those ancestors , who , having it in their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entailed a curse upon all future generations ? /q/ Southern views . What a blood-stained code that must be , which is calculated for the restraint of millions held in bondage . Such must our unhappy country exhibit , unless we are both wise and just enough to avert from posterity the calamity and reproach which are otherwise unavoidable . " * Mr. JEFFERSON asks , " Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure , when we have removed their only firm basis , a conviction in the minds of the people , that their liberties are the gift of God ? " JUDGE WASHINGTON , in a speech before the Colonization Society , expressed the decided hope that colonization " would lead to the slow , but gradual abolition of slavery , " and " wipe from our political institutions , the only blot which stains them .

MERCER remarks , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner consistent with the rights , interests , and happiness of society , ought never to be abandoned . " * W. H. FITZHUGH , ESQ. , who proved the sincerity of his remarks , by the liberation of all his slaves , and by a liberal provision for them in Liberia , bears this testimony " Slave ry , in its mildest form , is an evil of the darkest character . Cruel and unnatural in its origin , no plea can be urged in justification of its continuance but the plea of necessity the necessity which requires us to submit to existing evils , rather than substitute by their removal , others of a more serious and destructive character . There is no rivetted attachment to slavery prevailing extensively , in any portion of our coun try . Its injurious effects on our habits , our morals , our indi- /z/ Southern views . vidual wealth , and more especially on our national strength and prosperity , are universally felt , and almost universally acknowledged . " WILLIAM GASTON , of North Carolina , formerly a distin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court of that State , in an address before a literary and philanthropic society in the University of North Caro lina , in 1832 , says " On you will devolve the duty which has been too long neglected , but which can not with impunity be neglected much longer , of providing for the mitigation , and ( is it too much to hope for in North Carolina ? ) for the ultimate extirpation of the worst evil that afflicts the southern part of our confederacy. * * Disguise the truth as we may , and throw the blame where we will , it is slavery which , more than any other cause , keeps us back in the ca reer of improvement . " * * " How this evil is to be en countered , how subdued , is indeed a difficult and delicate inquiry . " * COL . DRAYTON , of South Carolina , in the course of an elaborate speech in Congress , not long since , sketched a pic ture of slavery , and a brief of the views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Dray ton was ever regarded as not only a man of distinguished talents , but as remarkable for his candour , excellent judgment , and ho nourable feelings . " There was not a person who more deeply commiserated slaves than he did ; but while their pillows are planted with thorns , their masters do not repose on downy beds . The miseries extended to the whole circle of society in which they move . He spoke from actual experience of these miseries . Could he destroy the evil , no zealous fanatic would more easily try to extirpate it than his fellow-citizens of the South and himself . None know more the misery of slavery than those who hold slaves . /q/ Misrepresentations and unkind remarks . " Slavery is indeed a bitter draught , and though thousands are made to drink of it , yet still it is a bitter draught .

Let not such a mistake prevail . It is the interest of the master to ameliorate the condition of the slaves as much as he can ; and those mistaken philanthropists who , without understand ing the situation of that part of the country , intrude their ef forts at amelioration , only make the condition of the slave more wretched . No one can administer successfully to a disease who is ignorant of its character . No one can beneficially prescribe , who is ignorant of the effect of the medicine he administers . The citizens of the South know how far to go with safety to themselves , and he who ignorantly interferes , converts intended benefits into serious injuries . The Southern citizens know , but they suffer none others to interfere . Interference they consider as an injury , and are disposed to resent it as an insult . When gentlemen talk of government having a right to interfere , they speak without proper consideration . " Such are the opinions of gentlemen of eminent talents , all of whom are , or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all , have been extensive proprietors of slaves . It certainly becomes us to be open to conviction , and willing to receive the truth . It is a great misfortune , grow ing out of the actual condition of the several states , some being exempt from , and others liable to , the evils of slavery , that they are too prone to misrepresent the views and wishes of each other in respect to it . In some publications , Pa , said Caroline , * which Henry /z/ Severity of remark unwise . and I have been looking over since these conversations began , we have seen some very unkind remarks respecting the South , calculated to wound the feelings of her citizens deep ly , and exceeding severe on some of the gentlemen whose language you have quoted .

Whoever the writer was , he is deserving of reprehension . His course will rivet the chains of slavery , not loose them . It were well for our country , and better for our coloured population , especially for the slaves , if , in regard to this whole matter , every citizen were to cherish kindly and cha ritable feelings .

The government , finding the trustees resolved firmly not to concur with what they thought unjust , took away the charter by which no law could be passed without our consent . " Oglethorpe. 4 GOOD morning , my daughter good morning , Henry , said Mr. L. , as he entered the parlour , quite early in the morn ing , shall we now , although earlier than our usual hour for conversation , turn our attention again , for a few minutes , to the subject of Africa s wrongs , and the unfortunate relation to her children , into which our country has been introduced by the policy of England , and the cupidity of her traders in human flesh ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family prayer . Caroline and Henry were both pleased with the proposi tion . Will you tell us , Pa , said Caroline , at what time slaves were first brought to this country , and where they were sold . I shall be gratified to be more familiar with the facts that assure us that our country is not respon sible for the original introduction of slavery to the western world . /z/ Virginia opposed to slavery . It will give me pleasure to gratify your wishes in this respect . The first shipment of slaves to our country , was on the very year that the " Pilgrim fathers " of New Eng land , as the first settlers of New England are called , first stepped upon Plymouth Rock , and thirteen years after the first settlement on the James river . The ** cargo ! " was landed at Jamestown , and sold to the planters of Virginia . It consisted of twenty Africans from the coast of Guinea , brought to the colony in a Dutch vessel , under the sanction and by the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other slaves which soon followed , individuals lent themselves to the op pression of Africa s unhappy children , it is due to the colo nial ancestry of Virginia to say that they , at a very early period , earnestly remonstrated against these importations . Their appeals to the British crown , were loud and frequent , but unsuccessful . They had no voice in the government under whose laws slavery was introduced , and no control over its decisions . Therefore I have said that we are not responsible , as a nation , for the introduction of the trade . The origin of slavery in our land is to be referred to the agency of a foreign government , and the evil of slavery con sidered as an incumbrance connected with our English in heritance . It should be mentioned also to the credit of Virginia , that the legislature of that colony , at an early period , enact ed laws to counteract the evil , by imposing restrictions on the introduction of slaves ; and that it is , at the same time , a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that those measures of the colony were discounte nanced , and the laws which the legislature enacted , rejected by Government as injurious to the commerce of England . Thus slavery , with all its unhappy consequences , was entail- /z/ The first Slave-ship. ed upon the colonies to promote the supposed interests of England . It should be understood , moreover , that this very conduct of the British crown , is a grievance set forth in the Declaration of our Independence among the causes of the Revolution . 4 Do you recollect , Caroline , said Henry , those lines by Mrs. Sigourney , entitled The First Slave-ship ? I do not ; but I should like to hear them . I admire Mrs. S. s poetical genius ; and take the more interest in every thing from her pen since she is the acquaintance and very esteemed friend of our dear mother .

" Oh ! it makes my heart bleed , said Caroline , to think of the evils of which that first slave-ship was the precursor to our country ; and of the wrongs which - from that ill-fated hour that the cruel Dutchman found a market for his injured fellow-men , have been so unsparingly meted out to Africa by citizens of this highly-favoured land . How I wish the purchase had never been made . " Were the Dutch the first people who engaged in the traffic , Pa ? 4 No , Henry , slavery existed in Africa , long before the transportation of slaves from Africa to this or to any country . /q/ Foreign traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the slave of Potiphar ; and the Egyptians , you know , Henry , enslaved Is rael , said Caroline . When I think of these things , the thought occurs sometimes , that it is possible that Africans may again have their day of prosperity , and the whites , who are now their oppressors , may in their turn become slaves . It is too near the dawn of a happier day , I trust , for such apprehensions to be realized ; but , my daughter , if such an event were to occur , think you there would not be one mind among us in regard to the evils of slavery ? The pre judices which now blind the minds of many , that they can hardly see any injustice in slavery , would all be removed . * The practice of holding slaves , I was remarking , exist ed in Africa , long before slaves were transported thence to foreign countries . The Moors of Spain and Portugal , pro bably acquired the practice from the Mahometans in the North of Africa ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the practice of employ ing and owning slaves soon prevailed among both the Por tuguese and the Spaniards , and then among other nations . 4 The commencement of the traffic in African slaves , by foreign countries , was probably in the year 1454 ; when Henry , King of Portugal , under authority from the Roman Pontiffs , took possession of several islands and harbours on the coast , and from thence making descents on the swarm ing villages of Africa , seized the unsuspecting inhabitants and carried them into slavery . It would seem , from what little of the history of the slave-trade I have been able to trace , that in 1481 , the na tives having become terrified by the frequent depredations committed upon them , retired into the interior . Their in vaders finding it difficult , therefore , to obtain slaves in so /z/ Slaves introduced into Hispaniola. great numbers and so expeditiously as they desired , a treatywas made through the influence of bribes and presents , be tween the traders and African chiefs , the chiefs engaging to furnish subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man-stealing , treachery and distrust , misery and ruin , have been , thenceforward , the consequence ; and slavery has been the systematized business of the several tribes . 4 The Portuguese have the credit , in history , of com mencing the unhallowed traffic , and of introducing slavery into this Western world . In 1508 , slaves were carried into Hispaniola , or Little Spain , as it was called by Columbus ; now St. Domingo , one of the West India Islands : and in the year 1517 , slaves were introduced into the Brazilian colonies in South America . It is said that the project of transporting slaves from Af rica to the New World , was first suggested by Bartholemi de Las Casas , a Catholic Priest . Previous to this time , ad venturers to the Western continent and the Islands along the Atlantic coast , had , with extreme cruelty , reduced to servi tude the confiding and unoffending Indians , the natives of the soil . The cruelty with which they treated the Indians , unaccustomed to such usage or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is supposed that when the Spa niards discovered the Island of Hispaniola , there were on it , at least a million of inhabitants , ( Las Casas thinks there were three millions , ) formed into kingdoms , and each go verned by sovereigns called Caciques . Such was the cru elty shown them by the Spaniards , that they were reduced to sixty thousand souls , in the short space of fifteen years ; and from the year 1508 to the year 1517 , they were further reduced by brutal oppression from sixty thousand to fourteen thousand ! /q/ Origin of slavery in America . * A formal decree of the King of Spain had authorized this oppression of the natives , declaring " that the servitude of the Indians ( was ) warranted by the laws both of God and man . 1 * A part of the system of cruelty carried on against these poor Indians , said Caroline , * was the hunting of them with blood-hounds , was it not , Pa ? * It was ; and these , I am sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respects a good and great man . Finding the natives determined to resist the oppressions of his soldiery , he determined in their extinction , and went forth against them with all his strength . The historian says that a " part of the force employed by Columbus on this occasion consisted of blood-hounds , which made great havoc among the native Indians . " Las Casas says , in relat ing subsequent events in Cuba : " In three or four months , I saw more than seven thousand children die of hunger , whose fathers and mothers had been dragged away to work in the mines . I was witness at the same time of other cru elties not less horrible . It was resolved to march against the Indians , who had fled to the mountains . They were chased like wild beasts , with the assistance of blood-hounds , who had been trained to the thirst for human blood . " * *The circumstances attending the introduction of dogs into the South American continent and islands , and their subsequent wild state , are thus described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here the curious reader may , perhaps , inquire , how so many wild doga came here . The occasion was , the Spaniards having possessed these isles , found them peopled with Indians , a barbarous people , sensual and bru tish , hating all labour , and only inclined to killing , and making war against their neighbours , not out of ambition , but only because they agreed not with themselves in some common terms of language ; and perceiving the domi nion of the Spaniards laid great restrictions upon their lazy and brutish cus- /z/ Origin of slavery in America . You recollect the revolting description which Lord Byron gives of the fierceness and rapacity of these animals , when they have once acquired a fondness for human flesh : " He saw the lean dogs beneath the wall , Hold o er the dead their carnival , Gorging and growling o er carcass and limb They were too busy to bark at him , From a Tartar s skull they had stript the flesh , As ye pull the fig when the fruit is fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The hair was tangled round his jaw . " 4 Las Casas , with the support of other ecclesiastics , de voted his life to endeavour the amelioration of their condi- toms , they conceived an irreconcileable hatred against them , but especially because they saw them take possession of their kingdoms and dominions ; hereupon they made against them all the resistance they could , opposing every where their designs to the utmost ; and the Spaniards finding them selves cruelly hated by the Indians , and nowhere secure from their treach eries , resolved to extirpate and ruin them , since they could neither tame them by civility , nor conquer them with the sword . But the Indians , it being their custom to make their woods their chief places of defence , at present made these their refuge , whenever they fled from the Spaniards ; hereupon those first conquerors of the New World made use of dogs to range and search the intricatest thickets of woods and forests , for those their implacable and unconquerable enemies ; thus they forced them to leave their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milder usage would do it ; hereupon they killed some of them , and quartering their bodies , placed them in the high-ways , that others might take warning from such a punish ment ; but this severity proved of ill consequence ; for , instead of frighting them and reducing them to civility , they conceived such horror of the Spa niards , that they resolved to detest and fly their sight forever ; hence , the greatest part died in caves and subterraneous places of woods and moun tains , in which places I myself have often seen great numbers of human bones . The Spaniards , finding no more Indians to appear about the woods , turned away a great number of dogs they had in their houses , and they finding no masters to keep them , betook themselves to the woods and fields to hunt for food to preserve their lives ; thus , by degrees , they became un acquainted with houses and grew wild . This is the truest account I can give of the multitudes of wild doga in these parts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic for the purpose again and again . He braved all clangers , and shrunk from no fatigue in their behalf , but unceasingly urged the claims of the op pressed Indians , at the Spanish court . * In his sympathy for one class of his fellow-men , how ever , Las Casas forgot or disregarded the rights of another class . From at least mistaken motives of humanity , he finally proposed to the Emperor , Charles V. , a project to import slaves from Africa , representing that the warm cli mate of the South would be congenial to their natures , and that thus the labours of the surviving Indians might be greatly relieved . This project , unfortunately , was adopted , and laid the foundation of African slavery in the Western World . * The condition of the poor Indians , however , was by no means bettered . The Bishop of Chiapa , I mean Las Casas , had the mortification to find the chains which it was the ob ject of his life to break , ri vetted more firmly , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Indians in slavery ! The final and mournful history of these poor Indians , has been written , in one sentence , by the biographer of Columbus . Says Irving , " They have long since passed away , pining and perishing beneath the domination of the strangers , whom they welcomed so joy fully to their shores . " 4 The error of Las Casas , is one into which even good men , of ardent temperament and philanthropic minds , may sometimes fall , impressed with the importance of a subject which enlists the best feelings of human nature . They may take too limited and partial a view of the subject , and lose sight of important connexions and incidental circumstances , in their devoted attention to the single object which absorbs their immediate sympathies . /z/ The plea of political necessity often abused . Caroline here suggested , It would be extremely unfortu nate if by any imprudent , or misdirected zeal , we should be guilty of a similar error , in attempting to better the condition of the enslaved Africans in our land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country greater evils than we are striving to avert . This , I should infer , is feared by some . You , I think , intimated , some time since , that harsh and cen sorious language , and coercive measures , have that ten dency. 4 We can not , with propriety , or with good hope of safety or success , be indifferent to consequences ; or refuse to take counsel of circumstances , in determining the best way of promoting any cause , however good . Nothing , surely , is to be gained by indulging in contemp tuous , acrimonious , or threatening language , towards our Southern brethren , in regard to slavery . They , it is to be presumed , know as well as we , the tremendous evils of slave ry , and are far more deeply concerned than we in an appli cation of the proper remedy . The course which is some times taken in regard to this subject , is not fraternal , and therefore neither politic nor wise . Language that is calcu lated unnecessarily to wound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling , sentiment and action , on this important subject , should be carefully avoided by the good people of the Eastern and middle sections of our country . Besides , it should be considered that no measures can tend to the ultimate benefit of the slaves , in which the slave-holders do not generally and heartily concur . The best interests of slave and master are probably more identi fied with each other , and involved together , than is generally imagined . There are circumstances which render entire and immediate emancipation ruinous to both master and /q/ Must not take advantage of our own wrong . slave ; and there are circumstances which are felt also at the South , that render it greatly desirable to the master that slavery should end . At the same time that I make these remarks , I must also say that no pretence of political necessity , can plead a valid excuse for those who would perpetrate any wrongs whatever . The butchery by wholesale , ( for it was little better than wholesale butchery , ) of the poor Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of political necessity . And in the same plea , almost every public crime which has disgraced our race , and made the world an arena of strife , a field of blood , has found its constant defence . That whole policy I would repudiate , and utterly detest . There may be circumstances , however , which render it an imperious duty , doubtless , in aiming even to redress the wrongs that have been done , to inquire seriously and prayer fully into the best manner , and the most probably successful means of redress . Many in our land profess to find them selves precisely in this situation in respect to the slave-ques tion . The evil , say they , is entailed upon our country as a heavy curse ; and how to bring about its final removal in a way that shall be best for the slave , and best for the coun try , is a question of most difficult solution . By all , its im portance is confessed to be great . In the view of many of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicateness which causes the deepest anxiety . In my own view , it is a question which may well task the wis dom of the wise , and give ample scope to the benevolence of the humane . Why , Pa , to plead for perpetuating slavery on the ground that our own interests require it , since the system is esta blished , would be to take advantage of our own wrong 1 . i /z/ A consummation devoutly to be wished . I hope that slavery will soon , be viewed by all as an evil that calls loudly for redress , and that our country will yet unite in some measures to free our land from the reproach of slavery , letting the oppressed go free . I feel great confi dence , since these conversations began , that this consumma tion so " devoutly to be wished , " will be brought about . The subject has assumedin many important respects , an entirely new aspect , in my humble view . The evils of slavery magnify , and the " quo modo , " as Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we contemplate the extinction of the evil . But slave ry , it appears to me , must cease ; Christians can not , must not cease to pray and labour for its extinction . CONVERSATIONS ON SLAVERY . Ill All Christendom has been engaged in the trade . /z/ " It is the very madness of mock prudence to oppose the removal of a poisoned dish , on account of the pleasant sauces , or nutritious viands which would be lost with it . " Coleridge , * IN our last conversation , we noticed briefly the commence ment of the African slave-trade . The English and other na tions in succession followed the example of Portugal and Spain , and engaged in the horrid traffic . More than three centuries , until lately , some of the Christian powers of Eu rope have been engaged in it ; and , for more than a century and a half , it was prosecuted by all Christendom , without hesitancy or remorse . The English , the Dutch , the French , the Spanish , the Portuguese , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The French Guinea-Company contracted , in 1702 , to supply the Spanish West Indies with 38,000 Negroes , in ten years . In 1713 , a treaty was made between England and Spain , for the importation of 144,000 Negroes , in thirty years . From 1768 to 1786 , one hundred thousand slaves were annually exported from Africa . In 1786 , England alone employed in the traffic 130 ships . 1 Some have estimated the whole number of slaves ex ported from Africa since the origin of the trade , at nearly 20,000,000 . Certain it is , that the most potent nations of /z/ Africans have been led to identify Christianity with cruelty and perfidy . the earth , have seemed to vie with each other in this fiend ish work . * And yet , Pa , these nations call themselves civilized and Christian ! 1 Yes , it is a painful reflection , as it is an indelible re proach , that for so long a time , the intercourse of Christian nations with Africa , instead of imparting the blessings of civilization and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa and debase its character . The Africans surely can not have conceived a very fa vourable impression respecting either our religion or our humanity ? 4 The treatment which they have received , it is said , had caused them to identify Christianity with perfidy and cruelty , until recent efforts were made to colonize Africa with free men , and to civilize and christianize that dark continent by means of colonization . Mr. Newton , who , you know , re sided for a time in Africa , and was engaged in the slavetrade when the world seemed to be blind to the iniquity of the traffic , says , that such has been the influence of the slave-trade , in cherishing among the unfortunate Africans the vilest passions , enkindling among them intestine wars waged for the purpose of obtaining captives , and inciting them to betray and kidnap one another , that instead of the influence of Europeans being favourable to piety , " the best people in Africa are those who have had the least intercourse with Europeans ! " The Africans , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often , when charged with a crime , they will say , " Do you think I am a white man ? " /q/ Classification of slaves . * I suppose that most of the slaves brought from Africa , are captives taken by one tribe from another , in war ? Mr. Clarkson , I think , divides the slaves into seven classes . The most considerable class consists of kidnapped , or stolen Africans . In obtaining these , every species of in justice , treachery and cruelty are resorted to . This class , Mr. C. supposes , embraces one half of the whole number transported from Africa . The second class consists of those whose villages are set on fire and depopulated in the dark ness of night , for the purpose of obtaining a portion of their inhabitants . The third class consists of those who have been convicted of crimes . The fourth , of prisoners in wars that originate from common causes , or in wars made solely for the purpose of procuring captives for slaves . The fifth , such as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as have surrendered their liberty by reason of debt , or by other imprudences , which last , however , are comparatively few in number . Are they taken principally near the coast , or are they from the interior ? * They are sometimes brought a distance of a thousand miles ; marched over land in droves , or caufles as they are called , secured from running away , by pieces of wood which yoke them together by the neck , two and two , or by other pieces fastened with staples to their arms . * They are then , I suppose , carried to the " slave-fac tories , " and there sold in order to be shipped ? 1 Some are carried to what are called slave-factories ; others immediately to the shore , and conveyed in boats to the different ships whose captains have captured or purchasi /z/ How secured and sold . Horrors of the passage . ed them . The men are confined on board the ship , two and two together , either by the neck , leg , or arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments , the men occupy ing the forepart , the women the afterpart , and the children the middle . The tops of these apartments are grated for the admission of light and for ventilation when the weather is suitable for the gates to be uncovered , and are about three feet three inches in height , just sufficient space being allotted to each individual to sit in one posture , the whole stowed away like so much lumber . Poor creatures ! said Caroline , * how wretched they must feel , to find themselves in this situation , confined for trans portation to a land of strangers and to a house of bondage to scenes of ignominy and perpetual servitude . They must indeed feel wretched beyond expression . O how hard is the human heart ! It is said that many of them whilst the ships are waiting for their full lading , and whilst they are near their native shore which they are no more to set foot upon for ever , have been so depressed , and overwhelmed with such unsupportable distress , that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become deranged and perfect ma niacs , or have pined away and died with despairing , broken hearts . Horrid ! Are they kept in the confined situation you have described , during the whole passage , allowed no exer cise nor access to the fresh air ? I should think they would atfdie , Pa ? In the day-time , in fair weather , they are sometimes brought on deck . They are then placed in long rows on each side the ship , two and two together . As they are /q/ The middle passage . brought up from their apartments , a long chain is passed through the shackles of each couple , successively , and thus the whole row is fastened down to the deck . In this situa tion , they receive their food . After their coarse and meagre meal , a drum is beaten by one of the sailors , and at its sound the Negroes are all required to exercise , for their health , jumping in their chains as high as their fetters will let them ; and if any refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they comply . This jumping , the slavemerchants call " dancing . " I have read frequent accounts of these cruelties , said Henry ; and have understood , as I think you also told us , that the poor slaves suffer most in what is called " the mid dle passage : " that is , I suppose , the whole time they are on board ship after they sail ? Yes . It is the whole passage from the time the ship weighs anchor until she arrives at her destined port . On the passage , the situation of the slaves is , indeed , doubly deplorable , especially if the ship have a long passage , and is very full . A full-grown person is allowed , in the most commodious slave-ships , but sixteen inches in width , three feet three inches in height , and five feet eight inches in length . They lie in one crowded mass on the bare planks , and by the constant motion of the ship , are often chafed until their bones are almost bare , and their limbs covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , and the air they breathe so poisoned with pestilence by the feverish exhalations of the suffering multitude , that nature can no longer sustain itself . It is no uncommon occurrence , to find , on each successive morning , some who have died during the night , in consequence of their suffering and confined situa tion . A large proportion of those who are shipped , die be- /z/ Africa as she was . fore they have crossed the ocean . Many also die soon after completing the voyage , from what is called " the seasoning ; * that is , in becoming acclimated in the country to which they are carried . Poor Africans ! My heart bleeds at their sufferings , said Caroline , whose eyes now suffused with tears ; their home was , no doubt , a " sweet home " to them as much to them , as ours is to us ; and , perhaps , they were once as happy . It is said that when the slave-holders first visited the western coast of Africa , replied Mr. L. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with villages , or thickly settled towns , which swarmed with inhabitants . Simple in their manners , amiable in their dispositions , in quiet enjoyment of the profuse bounties of nature , they are represented as exceeding happy . They were not civilized ? interrupted Henry . * No , said Mr. L. , * they were not civilized according to our ideas of civilization ; but they were a comparatively in nocent , unoffending , contented , happy race . It was not until slave-dealers introduced among them every thing that could please the fancy and awaken the cupidity of uncivilized men , that they were at all prone to interfere with each other s happiness . By the more than brutal cruelty of white men , quarrels were fomented , tribe was set against tribe , and each supplied with the means of mutual destruction . 4 What proportion , Sir , of those who have been torn away from their home , are supposed to have died on the passage , or before their " seasoning " was over ? There must have been an amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horrors of the trade . Of 100,000 Africans supposed to have been torn away by the hand of violence from their native clime , annually , one third are supposed to have died on the passage and been consigned to a watery grave . Another third are sup posed to have died from " the seasoning , " or from broken hearts . So then , Henry , said Caroline , turning to her brother , dreadful to think ! upwards of 60,000 out of the 100,000 torn away from Africa every year , die almost immediately , in consequence of hard usage and the change of climate ! * Yes , continued Mr. L. , more than 60,000 , probably , die every year , in a few months after the galling chain of slavery is fastened upon them . Not a few of these , as I said before , die of broken hearts not all from changes of climate , and hard usage . A multitude of the murdered sons of Africa , will , ano ther day , appear at the bar of eternal justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean alone , a vast army will appear when the sea shall give up its dead , crying for vengeance against their inhuman destroyers ! It would be very easy to harrow up our feelings by re ference to well-authenticated facts which show the cruelties attending the trade . If it were not already late , I would cite one instance , as a sample of the estimation in which human life is held by those miserable men who are engaged in the trade . As it is , I will defer it until to-morrow , /z/ Cruelties of the slave-trade. /z/ " Forth sprang the ambush d ruffians on their prey ; They caught , they hound , they drove them far away ; The white man bought them at the mart of blood , In pestilential barks they cross d the flood ; Then were the wretched ones asunder torn , To distant isles , to separate bondage borne , Denied , though sought with tears , the sad relief That misery loves the fellowship of grief . " Montgomery , THE family were now together , and Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , seeing her fa ther at leisure , reminded him that at the close of their last evening s conversation , he had * promised to give them in the next conversation , facts showing the recklessness of slave-dealers in respect to the lives of their unhappy cap tives . The case to which I designed to refer , as exemplifying the estimate in which the lives and happiness of their misera ble victims are held , by the still more wretched , because guilty beings , who bring the poor Africans from their native land , to suffer in chains , and then to toil for strangers , and finally to die in bondage , is that of three slave-vessels cap tured some years since by the Dryad frigate . The account which appeared in the English papers was as follows : /q/ Extent of the slave-trade in later years . " The Fair Rosamond and the Black Joke , tenders to the Frigate Dryad , have captured three slave vessels , which had originally 1100 slaves on board , but of which they suc ceeded in taking only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosamond had captured a lugger with 160 Africans , and shortly after saw the Black Joke in chase of two other luggers . She joined in the chase , but the vessels succeeded in getting into the Bonny river , and landed 600 slaves before the tenders could take possession of them . They found on board only 200 , but ascertained that one hundred and eighty slaves , manacled together , had been thrown overboard , of whom only four iv ere picked up " 0 , shocking ! a day of retribution surely must come for such hard-hearted monsters , such murderous fiends . Why is it that the Christian world have ever tolerated such dreadful crimes , such worse than barbarous cruelty ? It must be that Africans have not been regarded as men ; and yet I should suppose such cruelties would hardly be practiced towards mere animals , by humane persons . Are not the cruelties attending the slave-trade , much less now than formerly ? It is said they are as great , and probably greater now than they have been at any former period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic by the planting of colonies on the coast , and the vigilance of our own and of the Eng lish government has been somewhat increased , in order to detect and capture vessels engaged in the trade ; but the slave-ships are numerous , and are said to be crowded to ex cess , and the mortality is dreadful . In 1824 , 120,000 was ascertained to be about the number exported from the coast of Africa that year , and a list of the names of 218 vessels , believed to be engaged in the traffic , was given . In the year 1827 , no less than 125 vessels sailed to Africa for slaves , /z/ First cost of slaves . Domestic distress . from Cuba alone . Previous to the establishment of the co lony at Liberia , 2,000 slaves were exported annually from the single points of Cape Mount and Montserado. 1 Do you know , Pa , Henry inquired , what is the average cost of slaves in Africa , to those who engage in the trade ? * The prime cost of the miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Havana for between two and four and six hundred dollars each , is , I think , to those who engage in the traffic on the coast of Africa , a little more than one dollar " a log ! 1 as is expressed in the inhuman jargon of the slaver , a log meaning a human body . * My mind , Caroline here remarked , is continually re verting to the awful scenes of the first apprehension of the poor African , and of his adieu to his native land . Mr. L. thought that it would be impossible for our live liest conceptions to portray the feelings of the poor slaves at those moments , or to tell the awful amount of that load of grief which continues for a long time to weigh down their hearts . We may imagine them turning their weeping eyes towards their native shores , at their departure , and associate with that last lingering look thoughts that overwhelm the mind ; we may think of the unutterable desolation of the fond father or mother torn from the children of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents into hopeless exile ; the pangs of separation between husbands and wives no more to meet this side the grave ; but we have only a very inadequate idea after all of the bitterness of that cup of wo which they have to drink to the very dregs ! It is difficult for us to bring such scenes , and such griefs , to our own doors and bosoms , and measure the sufferings of others /q/ Affecting case of an African Chief . by what would be our own , placed in a similar condition . We are so accustomed to think disparagingly of the blacks , that our sympathy does not expand on this subject as on oc casions where there is actually less to move our feelings . We have acquired a habit of looking upon Africans as not susceptible of like emotions with ourselves , and when their miseries are the theme , there is comparative indifference . We associate with the black skin a want of sensibility which observation and facts will by no means justify . " Fleecy locks and black complexion Can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection Dwells in white and black the same . * You recollect , probably , the affecting case of the African chief captured and brought in chains to the Rio Pongas for for sale , some years ago ? He was brother of Yaradee , the king of the Solima nation . His noble figure , and daring eye , and commanding front , bespoke a mind which knew no alternative , save freedom or ruin . He was exhibited for sale like a beast , in the market place , still adorned with ornaments of massy gold , as in the days of his glory . The tyrant who had seized and bound him , and now offered him for sale , demanded an enormous price of the chief or of his friends , as the condition of his being released , rather than sent in bondage to a far country . The warrior offered large sums for his redemption , but his owner refused to listen to the proposals . At length , distracted by the very thought of his degradation , tears stole from those eyes that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut his hair , which had long been permitted to grow , and which was platted with peculiar care , in which wedges of gold were concealed ; and these treasures he laid at the feet of his keeper to obtain a ransom . All , however , was in vain . /z/ The African Chieftain . The wretch who held him was inexorable . He gave the chief to understand that he should take care of the gold , and get as much gold for him as he could besides . Dark despair settling upon the soul of the noble captive , " then burst his mighty heart . " In a moment , as if by an instant stroke from on high , his faculties were shattered . Unable to sus tain himself under the workings of his wounded spirit , he be came a furious maniac ; and then suddenly withered and pe rished ! He had never trembled recollect the story , said Henry , and I recollect some lines which appeared soon after the occurrence , entitled /z/ " And must this mighty spirit yield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bloody Held Where valour sinks in death ?

" Sir William Jones . AGAIN we will turn our attention , for a short time , if you please , my dear children , to the slave-trade . Has not public opinion undergone a very great change , Pa , in regard to the slave-trade within a few years ? inquir ed Caroline . The change has been great , indeed , said Mr. L. Once there were hardly a few to be found to make any effort whatever for Africa s relief . She was bleeding at every pore , but none commiserated her distress . She saw and there was none to help she looked , and there was none to drop even the tear of pity over her miseries . Public opin ion has been changing silently but rapidly in Great Britain and America for many years . Every passing year , the re volution in sentiment , has been more and more apparent . In 1776 , whilst the sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 132 living slaves had been thrown /q/ Abolition of the trade by the Congress of the U. S. and other nations . overboard from a vessel engaged in the trade , DAVID HART LEY , a member of the British Parliament , laid upon the table of the House of Commons , fetters that had been used in confining the unhappy victims of this traffic on board of slave-ships , and moved a Resolution , " That the trade was contrary to the laws of God and the rights of man . " In 1787 , the Constitution of the United States fixed a period for the abolition of the trade , which by act of Con congress became a law in 1808 , prohibiting the farther introduc tion of slaves into the States . In 1807 , Wilberforce made his first motion in Parlia ment for the abolition of the slave-trade , which motion was renewed annually in Parliament for twenty years , until at length it was enacted that after March , 1808 , no slaves should be imported into the British dominions . On the 2d day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of the United States , the first section of which enacts , " That after the first day of January , 1808 , it shall not be lawful to import or bring into the United States , or the territories thereof , from any foreign kingdom , place , or country , any negro , mulatto , or person of colour , with in tent to hold , sell or dispose of such negro , mulatto , or person of colour , as a slave , or to be sold at service or labour . " At length , the Dutch , the Spanish , the Portuguese , and the Brazilians made enactments against the traffic . France also denounced it , and Austria declared that the moment a slave touches an Austrian ship , he is free . At the Con congress of Vienna in 1815 , the sovereigns there present , and the States represented , pledged themselves to the suppres sion of the trade . And on the 23d of March , 1830 , the prosecution of the slave-trade ceased to be lawful for the citizens or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ The iradenot materially suppressed . The late universal emancipation of slaves by the British government in their West India colonies , which took effect , August 1 , 1834 , is another most important step in the de velopment of a right feeling in relation to this subject , and I can not but hope , notwithstanding all unfavourable circum stances , that a very few years will have brought to pass all that we would claim of freedom , for slaves every where , and for the continent of Africa . But if I have understood you , Pa , you have said that the slave-trade is yet carried on extensively ? I am sorry to say that it is , Caroline , notwithstanding the obligations of laws and treaties to the contrary . When the United States , in connexion with England , declared the slave-trade to be piracy , and forbade the further introduction of slaves into their possessions , the friends of humanity indulged the hope that a death-blow was about to be given to the traffic . Other nations , by important mea sures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused great disappointment . I have before stated some of the slavery statistics , showing the state of the trade in 1824 , and in 1827 . From a document which I have seen , it also appears that from 1820 to 1831 , no less than 322,526 slaves were imported into the single port of Rio Janeiro alone . By very recent documents , it appears that the abo minable traffic is still carried on to a considerable extent in Brazil . The fact that the trade is now generally denounced , and declared illegal , and although it be declared by every Christian government piratical , will not alone be sufficient to destroy , or even materially to lessen the trade . Armed vessels may be sent to cruise off the coast , as they now do , to capture the slave-ships ; but experience proves that no squadron will be likely effectually to prevent /z/ Something more must be done . the trade , without the aid of settlements of civilized and christianized communities along the coast . Thousands of little rivers , and bays , that indent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships into their shallow waters , whilst they afford lurking and hiding places for those con cerned in the traffic and well acquainted with the geography of the country , or enable the slaver being pursued , to elude the search . Tf any one factory , mart , or haunt , be broken up , word is immediately sent by the traders into the country , that slaves must be brought to some less frequented and un suspected part of the coast which is designated , and there they are received with impunity , the traders with their ves sels lying concealed perhaps under the woody banks of un known winding streams . * It has been supposed , therefore , that colonies established along the coast are indispensable to the entire extinction of the trade . Twenty or thirty colonies scattered along the coast , it is said , would put an end to the trade effectually and for ever . The native chiefs of Sherbro district , through a strong desire to be shielded from the ravages of the slavetrade , presented one hundred miles of coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is stated that all the coast in the vicinity of that place is now cleared of slavefactories and slave-vessels . Several native chiefs in the vi cinity of the Liberian colony have desired arrangements to be entered into with them for the security of that part of the coast , and are hoping for as favourable results . The NewYork and Pennsylvania colony at Bassa Cove , it is antici pated , will be an efficient coadjutor with those already named , in extending a Christian influence in Africa , and in hastening the day when the traffic in human flesh and blood will end . /z/ Colonies along the coast npcessary. lonies like those that now exist , along the whole coast ? It would , I suppose , be a great work but is it not worthy of great effort ? * Many are hoping and praying and labouring for such a result , Caroline . I shall have occasion to refer to this sub ject again in a future conversation . It will be consistent with the plan which I have proposed for these conversations , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it exists in our own country . * We have seen how slavery was introduced here , at an unfavourable moment , the planters consulting their imme diate profit and regardless of future consequences and so fall ing in with the policy of England , and how slavery was still forced on these colonies in spite of remonstrance , the final welfare of America being an object of minor impor tance compared with the increase of the commerce of the mother country , and the immediate supply of the English treasury . * In 1772 , the Assembly of Virginia went so far as to set forth , in a respectful petition to his Majesty , the King of Great Britain , the inhumanity of the slave-trade , and to sug gest that it might " endanger the very existence of his Ame rican dominions . " This warning is the more remarkable , inasmuch as it came from the first colony the English ever had in America , and one already involved in the evils of slavery ; and it was yet more remarkable in the event for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a part of the dominions of the monarch who would not deign even an answer to the petitioners . The warning were prophetic , if we might judge alone from the event . 4 Virginia , I have seen it suggested by one of her orators , /q/ Virginia s early efforts against slavery . * prides herself " that she has ever pursued the same course in relation to this matter , said Henry . Virginia certainly deserves credit . During her colonial existence , when it was the determined policy of England to introduce as many slaves as possible into Virginia , her House of Burgesses passed no less than twenty-three acts tending to suppress the horrible traffic in slaves ; all which acts were negatived by the king ! In the original draft of the Declaration of Independence , one of her most gifted sons , Mr. Jefferson , inserted a heartstirring passage , charging the conduct of the king in putting his veto on these enactments for the suppression of the slave-trade , as a crime , aggravated by Lord Dunmore s en deavouring to stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause was stricken out finally , because it was ascertain ed that it could not obtain the assent of all the States . * In 1778 , as soon as Virginia found herself in a situation to do it , although in the midst of a civil war , she made the African slave-trade punishable by death . And it was at her instance also that the act of Congress was passed , declaring it piracy , subjecting the offender to capture and punishment in any court of any nation which should pass the same law . So far has Virginia the merit of having maintained her claims to " the noble , the humane , and the adventurous for the right . " Nor does she now fall behind any State in the Union in her professed abhorrence of slavery , and in a pro fessed and apparent desire to see the country free from slave ry s stain . Virginia , in common with the rest of the South , sees , or thinks she sees difficulties in the way of immediate and universal emancipation , which we in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appreciate ; but we can hardly avoid giving her credit for uniformity of practice , honesty of /z/ Other States followed Virginia s example . purpose , and a true desire to see slavery extinct in our land . 1 It was the movements of Virginia in the correspondence which she authorized between her Governor , ( since Presi dent Monroe , ) and Mr. Jefferson , then President of the United States , a copy of which is before me , attested by William Wirt , then clerk of the Virginia House of Dele gates , which led to the formation of the American Coloniza tion Society , and to the founding of civilized and Christian colonies in Africa/ * Did none of the other States , at an early period , adopt measures in relation to this subject ? Yes , Henry , Virginia was earliest in setting the example for the exclusion of imported slaves ; but a duty on the im portation of slaves was laid by New-York , in 1753 ; by Pennsylvania , in 1762 ; and by New-Jersey , in 1769. 1 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abo lition of slavery , which has the merit of being the earliest legislative proceeding of the kind in any country . All the States north and east of Maryland , have since passed similar laws . 1 At a very early period , the free-holders and inhabitants of the counties of Somerset and Essex , in New-Jersey , pre sented similar petitions to that of Virginia in 1772 , to the Governor , Council , and Representatives of the Province , against the slave-trade . The inhabitants of the city and county of Philadelphia also petitioned their Assembly against the slave-trade , citing the example set them by the Province of Virginia , in petitioning the king " from a deep sensibility of the danger and pernicious consequences which would be attendent on a continuation of the iniquitous traffic . " . * On the adoption of the Federal Constitution , Congress /q/ England has abolished slavery . Claims more honour than is due . was authorized to prohibit , at the end of twenty years , the importation of slaves into any part of the United States ; which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No slaves , then , have been legally brought into the United States since the year 1808 ? said Caroline . I wish Congress had felt authorized to go one step further , and had fixed a time for the abolition of slavery in our land . We should not then be the reproach of the nations . Eng land especially , I notice , is severe in her allusions . England , Mr. L. remarked , has of late appeared dis posed to do what she can to retrace the wrongs she has oc casioned in her West India colonies . It were well if she could undo all the evil she has done . It has always been easy for her to make enactments in relation to her distant colonies ; but I fear that placed in precisely the situation in which by her reckless avarice she has involved us , the poor slaves might find as tardy justice at her hands as she charges upon us . Legislation for the government of others , is des patched sooner and with much less difficulty , than when the enactments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Britain should neither be reproached in this matter , nor utter reproaches against others . Reproach uttered by her against this country , comes from her , surely , with peculiar ill grace . She has done well , I hope it will be found , both for Africans and for her West India colonies in directing emancipation . We will commend her for the good done , and pray that all her influence may favour the cause of Af rica for the time to come . Her example , it may also be hoped , will influence us to love and good works . Let her remember , however , that it becomes her to be very sparing of reproaches in her allusions to us . Caroline here said she would acknowledge that her pa triotism tempted her to covet for her country , the honour /z/ England s example . which England enjoys of being first in the work of univer sal emancipation , notwithstanding these reproaches . 4 That is intended as a cutting remark , Caroline , said Henry , which we were noticing this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , is an Englishman : " Shall the United States the free United States , which could not bear the bonds of a king , cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing ? Shall a Republic be less free than a Monarchy ? Shall we , in the vigour and buoyancy of our manhood , be less energetic in righteousness , than a kingdom in its age ? " * There is much point too in those lines of Whittier , said Caroline : " Shall every flap of England s flag Proclaim that all around are free , From farthest Ind to each blue crag That beetles o er the Western Sea ? And shall we scoff at Europe s kings , When Freedom s fire is dim with us , And round our country s altar clings The damning shade of Slavery s curse ? Go let us ask of Constantino To loose his grasp on Poland s throat And beg the lord of Mahmoud s line To spare the struggling Suliote . Will not the scorching answer come From turbaned Turk and fiery Russ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and ask the like of us ? " Mr. L. thought we should take an enlightened view of the subject , and not be too much influenced by the sound of words , whilst regardless of the real facts and circumstances of the case ; but , feeling fatigued , proposed they should now defer the conversation until to-morrow ; and , said he , as the bell rung for the domestics to come in to evening prayers , 1 we will remember Africa , and remember our country too , in our devotions. /q/ The government of the U. S. can not legislate for individual States . /z/ * We have found that this evil has preyed upon the very vitals of the Union* and has been prejudicial to all the States in which it has existed . " James Monroe . 1 WELL , Caroline and Henry , I have another hour for Afri ca and if you please , we will resume the subject of our Both responded at once , With pleasure , Pa. * Is it not generally supposed , Pa , Henry inquired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in good faith interfere with the question of slavery in the several States where slavery exists ? * I believe that it is generally agreed among statesmen , said Mr. L. , that the time and manner of abolishing slave ry within the limits of individual states , must be left to their own voluntary deliberations . The federal government , it is conceded , has no control over this subject : it concerns rights of property secured by the federal compact , upon which our liberties mainly depend . It is a part of the collection of po litical rights , the least invasion of any one of which would , of course , impair the tenure by which every other is held . An unconstitutional interference would , therefore , be most disastrous in its results . /z/ Rights guaranteed by the constitution . * When the federal compact was formed , the entire aboli tion of slavery was a favourite object with many ; but they knew that this point , or the Union , must be surrendered . As much as they loved liberty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no other alternative but to leave it as they found it , existing at the South , or fail of the great desideratum of an union of the States . A com promise was therefore effected . The South conceded that in twenty years the slave-trade should be abolished ; and the North conceded that the CONSTITUTION should secure to the South a representation in Congress of three-fifths of their slave population , and that each State should be bound to sur render to the citizens of other States such fugitive slaves as should be found within their limits . In addition to which , it was provided that the United States shall interpose , on re quisition of either of the States , to protect its citizens against domestic violence . These principles are fully recognized by the constitution , and as good citizens , we are bound to re spect them , so long as they remain a part of the constitu tion . In the amendments to the constitution , the effect of these provisions is confirmed , by the declaration that all powers not conceded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , by the constitution , remain in the separate States . Hence , it is inferred , that as the constitution gives no control on this subject , the regulation of domestic slavery , which was the exclusive right of the Southern States before the constitution , remains with them , as one of the powers not transferred to the United States . The legal construction is , therefore , that the South who hold slaves , retain the right of exclusive regulation over them , which right the United States can not touch . The constitution , as it now stands , renders it as improper , /q/ A dissolution of the Union would follow an infringement of the constitution . it is contended , and as unavailing , for the non-slave-holding States to attempt to interfere with the regulations of the Southern States touching their slaves , as it would be for us to attempt to regulate the arrangements of the British House of Commons , or the doings of the French Chambers . And if the United States can not , under the constitution , interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . any single State do so . 4 This is , I believe , a fair state of the case , nearly in the precise language which has been sometimes employed by distinguished civilians on the question of State rights/ * May not the constitution be amended ? * 1 It may ; but an amendment in this matter , would , doubt less , result in a separation of the States . We , then , have no means of reaching the evil we propose to remedy . The South will become to us a foreign government , and we shall have no means of influencing the Southern States in regard to their slave population , more than we now have of influencing legislation on this subject in the island of Cuba . The question , therefore , seems to be , shall we have a union of States , or shall we shipwreck the whole on the question of slavery ? Many suppose that , in this dilemma , we should exercise a spirit of forbearance , and do as our patriotic forefathers did in their determination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this position from the well known fact that there is an increasing disposition at the South to be rid of the evil of slavery , and because they hope that the time is very near when there will be some happy , united , harmo nious and final movement on this subject . Many also be lieve that a disposition on the part of the North to interfere ki this matter , has been the greatest obstacle in the way of ai /z/ District of Columbia . general movement in the South , and most injurious to the slave , whose condition it is the object of such interference to improve . 4 As Congress have control over the District of Columbia , I see not why slavery may not be abolished there * The United States , it is true , may enact such laws as may seem expedient for the government of the District of Co lumbia . Many regard it as a dark reproach upon our nation that , by the laws of the United States , the slave-trade is permitted to be carried on there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal mart of the slavetrade in the Union , " and that the public prisons of the District , are used for the benefit of the slave-traders , " slaves being confined in their cells for safe-keeping , until the drove , or cargo , of human beings can be completed ! " But even this reproach , which has been declared on the floor of Congress , by a distinguished Representative from New-York , " unchristian , unholy , and unjust ; not warrant ed by the laws of God , and contrary to the assertion in our Declaration of Independence , that * all men are created equal , " others contend is perpetuated by injudicious move ments , which make the question of slavery so deeply ex citing , that the matter can not at present be discussed with the desired success , and with safety to the Union , or benefit to the slave . But , Pa , said H. , we can not but be interested , deeply interested in the subject , although it is a question that affects the South , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and must also allow that it afflicts our whole coun try . It is a national blot , inconsistent with our professions , and the constant occasion of alienation between different por tions of our country . /q/ The South too sensitive ; the North too censorious. 1 For my part , Henry , said Mr. L. , * I feel more than ever inclined to view all the States as one united whole , and hope that , as a whole , they will long be consecrated in the affections of every patriot . " This is my own , my native land , " is a sentiment we should all feel , and expresses a feeling which I am sure true patriots will love to cherish . 4 But I really think , Pa , said Caroline , &lt; that the South are quite exorbitant in their claims , if they require us to be either indifferent to slavery , or silent and inactive when we think duty to our country , our Southern brethren , or to the slave , calls for decision and action . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great degree of sensitiveness on this subject at the South , and they may , in some instances , seem to require too much : but I also think that , situated as they are , they have much to awaken their suspicions ; and that although they can not reasonably expect us to be indifferent either to their situation , our country s good , or the slave s best interests , and probably do not claim this of us , we are bound to support the constitution , and to respect the rights which it secures to a portion of our fellow-citizens composing a part of the Union notwith standing . It appears to me that we are also bound by the spirit of the constitution , as well as by Christian principles , and the feelings of humanity , to abstain from all inflammatory publications whose direct tendency is to excite insurrection , and which are an infringement of those rights which the con stitution acknowledges and guarantees . An opposite course may justly be regarded as injurious , not only to the whites , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By /z/ AH are interested , and prudent measures must be pursued . publications or movements tending to excite insurrection , we drive the holders of slaves to extremities to enactments and to rigorousjreatment of the slaves ; even , as we have seen , shutting from them the light of life , and withholding the or dinary means of instruction that is , if all their enactments are meant to be strictly enforced . * I suppose that Caroline , * said Henry , * refers to an arti cle we were noticing this morning , in a Southern paper , which asserts , that " the North has nothing to do with this subject of black population , and all their solicitude about it , is meddling and officious . " 1 The evil is ours as well as theirs . The multitude of blacks which the severe legislation of the South drives into the free States , alone attests that we have a share in the evil . The reproaches which are cast upon our national honour , tell us that we have something to do with slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our land , and often seize upon the very heart of this great republic , and anger our national discussions , and give a character to important events and measures , show that we may not be indifferent to the slave question . It has been remarked by a distinguished scholar , that " diseased members affect the entire physical system . Soundness is to be restored to the limbs , not by excision , which would both destroy them , and hazard the entire body ; but by a general return of health , and a genial circulation to the whole . " * Another reason why I consider the evil as ours , is that the guilt of slavery is ours . We are too ready to appro priate it all to our Southern brethren : but we have no power or right thus to wash our hands . From the North have gone ships and seamen and traders in human flesh , that have been polluted by the inhuman traffic , and the " pieces of sil  --  /z/ /q/ /z/ The guilt of " slavery chargeable on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apportioned at the North . In the North were the forges which framed fetters and mana cles for the limbs of oppressed and unoffending Africans . It was the iron of the North that pierced their anguished souls : and overgrown fortunes and proud palaces at the North still stand , reared from the blood and sufferings of unhappy slaves , which tell that the North have shared largely in the accursed spoils . 4 Besides , there is little room for boasting on our part , when it is considered that the different physical features and agricultural productions of the South and North have , as we have every reason to believe , more than the force or absence of proper moral feeling , banished slavery from the one , and perpetuated it in the other . Had New-York , NewJersey , Pennsylvania , or even New-England produced cotton , rice , indigo , and sugar , it is not improbable that slavery would have continued in these States and increased its numbers here to this very hour . The same may be supposed , with out uncharitableness , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi . There can be no good reason , I conceive , why , by fair argument , by our best influence , and by our pecuniary re sources , we should not aim to promote the cause of patriot ism and humanity , in civilizing and converting Africa , and in rendering mutual benefits to the oppressed among us , and to our beloved country .. Nor should this be regarded by the South as unrighteous interference , or unkindness . Great wisdom , however , is to be used in this matter . It was you , Henry , if I recollect , who were repeating , a few days since , some lines as an appeal to the North . Will you repeat them now , as they are not an unappropriate con clusion of this part of our discussion ? /z/ Appeal to New-England . They were written by Mrs. Sigourney , and are entitled /z/ " When injur d Afric s captive claim , Loads the sad gale with startling moan , The frown of deep , indignant blame , Bends not on Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalding tear , Our daily board with luxuries deck , And to dark slavery s yoke severe Our fathers help d to bow her neck .

But if , with Pilate s stoic eye , We calmly wash when blood is spilt , Or deem a cold , unpitying sigh Absolves us from the stain of guilt ? Or if , like Jacob s recreant train , Who traffic d in a brother s wo , We hear the suppliant plead in vain , Or mock his tears that wildly flow ; Will not the judgments of the skies , Which threw a shield round Joseph sold , Be roused by fetter d Afric s cries , And change to dross the oppressor s gold ?

The debt which we owe to Africa , is , indeed , a national debt ; and we are all interested in its liquidation . If , instead of mutual recrimination , South and North , East and West , could combine their wisdom and benevolence to devise ways and means for the ultimate and speedy removal of the evil , and if there could be mutual confidence between the different sections of our country in respect to this matter , I see not why the legislatures of the several States then taking the lead , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofler that national atonement which every consideration of justice and humanity would commend , and which would reflect bright honour on the generation that should do the deed .

Why , Sir , is it necessary that the South should move first in this matter ? * I know not that there is any other necessity in the case than that of expediency and propriety . It appears to be a point universally conceded by statesmen , that the con tinuance , or removal of slavery , is solely within the power of the domestic legislation of the State in which it exists . It is very evident , therefore , that we can accomplish nothing by any measures on our part , except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any measures on our part of a coercive nature , or calculated to disturb the domestic ar rangements of the South , would be a violation of our political cal contract and of good faith . 1 But , Pa , you do not think that the subject of slavery ought not to be discussed even publicly if we please ; and that no arguments should be used by us with our Southern brethren to encourage and persuade them to correct views and early action in respect to a final and general emanci pation ? * Certainly not . Dr. Channing , whatever discrepancies are found in his recent work , has clearly expressed my views on this subject : " Slavery ought to be discussed . We ought to think , feel , speak , and write about it . But whatever we do in regard to it , should be done with a deep feeling of responsibility , and so done as not to put in jeo pardy the peace of the slave-holding States . On this point public opinion has not been , and can not be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To instigate the slave to insurrection is a crime for which no rebuke and no punishment can be too severe . * * It is not enough to say , that the constitu tion is violated by any action endangering the slave-holding portion of our country . A higher law than the constitution forbids this unholy interference . Were our National Union dissolved , we ought to reprobate , as sternly as we now do , the slightest manifestation of a disposition to stir up a servile war . Still more , were the free and the slave-holding States not only separated , but engaged in the fiercest hostilities , the former would deserve the abhorrence of the world , and the indignation of heaven , were they to resort to insurrection and massacre as means of victory . " 4 The right of discussion is sometimes claimed in a sense which is far from reasonable ; and there is often in connex ion with this claim a disposition to go beyond the law for a rule of action , and to justify that which the law and public opinion condemns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present day , to set all rightful authority at defiance , under the dangerous pretence that the end jus tifies the means .

As slavery " has existed , in all time , in the fairest regions of the earth , and among the most civilized portions of mankind , " so it has been recognized and sus tained by law . " Our own government , not long since , made a claim on Great Britain for the value of the property of citizens of the United States in some hundred human /q/ Rights guaranteed . slaves . The principle was admitted by the English nation ; the amount to be paid was referred to the arbitration of the Emperor of Russia ; the claim was allowed , and the money received and distributed to the claimants for their loss of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our constitution ; and the fact is recognized , and the existence of such property acknowledged as often as a runaway slave is taken , on the application of his master , in the non-slave-holding States . " Our Supreme Court , re ferring to the period when slavery was recognized here by law , has in numerous instances adjudicated important rights on the doctrine that where slavery does exist or has existed by the law of the land , such law did admit , and must now be deem ed to admit , the existence of property in human beings , " Property is thus considered " the creature of municipal law ; " and , indeed , property of no kind exists without law . The laws may be unwise , impolitic , unjust , and cruel ; but still they have their effect ; and although " arguments may very properly be urged to prove that the laws ought to be changed , " yet no action can be tolerated in society which , while the . laws stand , goes to make them " inoperative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws so long as they remain .

It is an indubitable fact , in my own view , that such may , through the force of circumstances , become the state of so ciety , that great moral evils may be tolerated when the con viction is clear that acts of prohibition would produce evils far more extensive and much more to be deprecated . So deranged and disordered , or complicate , by the practice , or misfortunes , of a former age , may become the very texture of society ; and so peculiar the relations which as a people we sustain to each other , that an immediate and entire cor rection of the evil may be impracticable , and that therefore neither individuals nor society are bound to attempt it .

It neither seems to me right to interfere with the Southern relations , nor to resort to vio lence to suppress the liberty of speech . /q/ The Federal compact . * The acts of illegal violence and shameful outrage which have grown out of the excitement kindled on this subject , in whatever part of the Union , can not be too strongly de plored , nor too severely censured . Why , said Caroline , did not our fathers , when our in dependence was asserted , and its acknowledgment obtained from the mother country , make provision for the final eman- cipation of slaves , in the Constitution ? On this subject , Gov .

That no Union could have been formed , on any other basis , is a fact of historical notoriety ; and it is asserted in terms , by General Hamilton , in the reported debates in the NewYork Convention for adopting the Constitution . " This compact , " Gov . E. continues , " expressly recog nizes the existence of slavery ; and concedes to the States where it prevails the most important rights and privileges connected with it . Every thing that tends to disturb the relations created by this compact is at war with its spirit ; and whatever , by direct and necessary operation , is calcu lated to excite an insurrection among the slaves , has been held , by highly respectable legal authority , an offence against the peace of the commonwealth , which may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor at common law .

" 1 It is not strange , Sir , that the South are unwilling that strangers should intermeddle with this part of their domestic concerns . Reasons are obvious to my mind now , which did not present themselves before . * We all know with what tenacity mankind are wont to cling to the possession of whatever is called property .

It has been calculated that putting down the estimate at one half the lowest value put upon this species of property at the South , that is , at 250 millions only , instead of 800 millions ; the relinquishment of this amount by about four millions of freemen , would be equivalent to a tax of more than one hundred millions of dollars on the six New-Eng land States ; and divided , it would be upwards of thirty-six millions of dollars for the State of Massachusetts alone ; and four and a half millions of dollars would , if the amount were assessed , fall upon the city of Boston . If the amount were divided , the whole United States , North and South , agreeing to pay the amount by a general assessment for the indemnity of the slave-holders , which I think would be just , the quota for the city of Boston alone would be nearly one million and eight hundred thousand dollars : and the State of Massachusetts must contribute seventeen millions /q/ Difficulties of emancipation . and a half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remarks on Dr. Channing s Slavery , who makes this cal culation , " I have all reasonable faith in the generosity , the spirit and the nobleness of my fellow-citizens , but if it were asked of them to take this immense amount and pour it as a votive gift into the ocean , or gather it and burn it on their lofty hills as a beacon-fire in honour of freedom and to re lieve the Southern slaves from their bondage , who ventures to believe he would live long enough to see the consumma tion of so much moral glory ? * * * If here then , where there is such an abhorrence of slavery , where there is so much high principle , where so many think it morally wrong , there would be found some difficulty in obtaining a contri bution large enough to purchase ease to our own con sciences , by relieving the country of this iniquity , what may be expected in the slave districts , where there is no such feeling , and of whose freemen we ask not to contri bute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce themselves to want their families to beggary and their country to ruin ? " * Still , / hope , said Caroline , that we may live to see the day when our whole country will be ready to engage unitedly and harmoniously in this good work/ *I would fain indulge the hope , said Mr. L. , notwith standing all that is now most discouraging . We must re member , however , that if slavery is to be brought to an end in our land , in a way that shall be honourable and not de structive of our national existence , it must be by the consent of the South . A dissolution of the Union and civil war , perhaps a servile war also , would be the inevitable conse quence of any coercion on the part of the non-slave-holding States . /z/ The south tenacious of its rights . * To return to the motives which influence the South I was going also to mention an idea prevalent at the South , that a portion " of the land is susceptible only of slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fine fields would be desolate . " This idea , whether correct or not , is doubtless one of the obstacles in the way of abolition . Another difficulty is found in the fact that , for the want of sufficient incentives in this country to effort and virtue , the emancipated slave generally becomes a nuisance and pest to society ; and general emancipation without colonization would despoil the whites at the South of the land of their fathers , and drive them from it ; or in a short time render the South one " great prison-house " in a far different sense from what it is at present , if not a scene of butchery , mas sacre , and blood . But besides these considerations , the South has become extremely sensitive of its dignity and jealous for its alleged rights ; and will not allow the least interference in respect to this question . They will not suffer dictation or instruction , and they will scarcely listen to reason or allow discussion . Indeed , the South may be considered as having pronounced its decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within its borders , except as subject to restrictions which the South may see fit to impose . The reason assigned for this is , that they will not " by any affectation of liberality , endanger their social system . " Claiming to be sovereign and inde pendent States , in respect to this part of their domestic eco nomy , they are fairly resolved to resist all encroachments upon their prerogative ; regarding it wrong for one State , or individuals in that State , to interfere with , or in any way in terrupt or endanger the domestic relations of another State , as it would be for a foreign power to interfere in the domes tic concerns of our common countrv . An interference of the /q/ All foreign interference inadmissible . latter kind would stir our whole country to indignation .

The same view is taken by the South of any interference in the North ern States with their domestic relations . Nay , they go fur ther , and insist that inasmuch as " our constitution was a compromise , in which we agreed that each State should in its own domestic affairs be sovereign and independent , " so " it is the highest infraction of all moral principle to violate the obligations which our contract imposes upon us .

The talented editor of the U. S. Gazette has well remarked , that one can scarcely read of these proceedings , without being re minded of the remark ( doubtless , ironical remark ) of the distinguished but eccentric John Randolph , when some antislavery measure was proposed in Congress " I will hurry home and flog Juba . " The effect is , that as movements are made at the North , which are regarded by the South as pre judicial to their interests , they proceed at once to " flog Juba " in other words , pass laws and keep up an espionage grievously oppressive to the coloured people .

" * But , Pa , is it not a fact , said Henry , that , if all in the non-slaveholding States were of one mind in reprobating slavery , and supposing it proper for them to do so , were dis posed to insist that the South shall emancipate their slaves ; the slave-holding States are not so much in the minority that it would be possible for the demand to be enforced ?

You have intimated in former conversations , said Caroline , that there is a disposition among good people at the South , notwithstanding the power with which their laws have in vested them to prevent interference on the part of strangers , still to treat their slaves as rational beings , and to give them suitable moral and religious instruction .

The instruction in this and other schools in the county , is oral , of course ; but it was gratifying to see how great an amount of knowledge the children had acquired in a few months .

" Of the religious condition of the slaves in South Caroli na , a clergyman in that State writes : i " I am able from authentic information to say , that of the Jive hundred and eighty thousand , which compose the en tire population of this State , about sixty-seven thousand are members in the Baptist , Methodist , Presbyterian , and Epis copalian churches . Of these communicants more ihm forty thousand are slaves . The whole slave population is 315,000 . It is easily seen , therefore , that of the white population about one-seventh are church members . It is proper these facts should come into the estimate of the religious condition and prospects of our slaves .

We would rejoice to help you if we could : but if we can not HELP YOU , we will LET YOU * At the convention of the diocese of the Episcopal church in South Carolina , in 1834 , a committee was appointed to take into consideration , and report upon the subject of the religious instruction of the blacks , at the next convention .

In compliance with this request , a pastoral letter from Bishop Bowen was published , containing much valuable and appro priate counsel in relation to the subject , urging attention to the religious instruction of slaves as the imperative duty of every master , and uniting with the committee of the convention in recommending measures for its due performance . The letter says , the persons by whom the work of instruction should be undertaken are , " 1st . The clergy with their assistants in Sun day schools . 2 . Lay catechists usefully employed in the primitive ages of the church , and now rendered absolutely necessary by the small number of clergy . 3 . The proprie tors of slaves 01 their agents or overseers , with the assistance of their families . The method recommended is : 1 .

The proprietors of slaves are urged to personal labours for their spiritual improvement , and each one is recommended in relation to the measures pro posed , to ask himself before God , is not this my duty ? And then let him pursue it , convinced that however great his discouragement may be at first , by the blessing of God great good must ultimately result .

" I might multiply proofs of a disposition prevailing ex tensively at the South in all the States to give to the slaves religious instruction , and all practicable religious privileges . I think the general feeling on this subject is greatly misap prehended in the non-slave-holding States . The evils of slavery are great , but they ought not to be magnified either by representing the slaves as deprived of all religious pri vileges , or their masters as destitute of Christian benevolence and the feelings of humanity .

As colonization gains ground , the freedom of untold thousands , it is to be hoped , will be secured , and Africa gladdened yet more and more with the light of civilization and Christianity .

I will endeavour to re peat it , although I can not give it the interest and effect pro duced by his recital . /z/ Anecdote . Slavery overruled for good . * " Among a number of slaves who had been re-captured by a British ship , and sent into Sierra Leone , was a little boy named Tom , who had by the slavers been separated from his father and mother , and who became an object of the particular regard of the missionaries at that station . One day , after the hour of instruction had passed , the voice of this little boy was overheard in a retired place , which one of the missionaries happened to pass . The missionary at first thought Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on listening was surprised and overjoyed to find him ear nestly engaged in prayer . To attempt to give the precise language of his broken petition , might make it ridiculous ; but the following is the substance of it , as related by the missionary , as nearly as can be recollected : O God , me glad de wicked man take me ; me glad King George s big ship take de wicked man ; me glad me brought here , where de missionary learn me to know God , and de way to heaven . O God , me have one great favour to ask . Me pray God send more wicked man to take my father and mother . Me pray God send more King George s big ship to take de wicked man and bring my father and mother here , so they may learn the way to heaven , and father , mother , and Tom , all go to heaven together . A few days afterwards , Tom was seen upon the shore , anxiously gazing upon the bound less ocean . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me see if God hear prayer ; me pray God send my father and mother here ; me see if God answer Tom s prayer . Day after day , full of faith and hope , Tom paid a visit to the sea side . Long he waited for an answer to his prayer of faith , and his father and mother came not . Yet Tom confided in the faithfulness of the God whom the missionary had taught him to know and love , till one day , when many months had expired , he came running to the missionary , /q/ Christian colonies a means of evangelizing the heathen . clapping his hands , and exclaiming in an extacy of joy , 1 God answer prayer Christ hear Tom s prayer the big ship coming to bring my father and mother ; O Tom glad God hear his prayer . A British ship had , strange as it may seem , made its appearance , and soon after landed a party of slaves re-captured from the wicked man , among whom was Tom s father and mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline , and make the wrath of man to praise him . I have under stood , Pa , that the colony at Sierra Leone , although not so favourably situated as that in Liberia , is prosperous ; and that the church mission at Sierra Leone has been greatly blessed . Mr. L. replied , If I recollect , the number of communi cants at the church missions in Sierra Leone is between 400 and 500 ; attendants on public worship , 3,000 ; day scho lars , 1,200 . The divine favour , in an increasing degree , appears to be vouchsafed to the missionaries . It is also said that the Wesleyans have penetrated 300 miles up the Gambia , and have established a mission in the centre of the Mandingo and Foulah tribes . Number of members " in society , " about 800 . In no year has so much been done for African colonization , as during the last , and to give a permanent foundation to the colonies . I believe , Sir , said Henry , that the plan of spreading the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beginning to be thought much of ? It ap pears to me that the success of the missions to Africa will have the effect to recommend it greatly . /z/ Christian colonies a means of evangelizing the heathen . Said Mr. L. , the Rev. Mr. Abeel , missionary to China , has remarked , " that the opinion is gaining rapid currency , especially among foreign missionaries , that colonies , Chris tian colonies , are demanded in the enterprise of evangeliz ing the heathen . Possessed of the proper spirit , their influ ence is incalculable . The power of a righteous and holy example , irrespective of all other benefits , would give to communities of this kind the relative importance of a sun to the dark spots on which their light would fall . They would present to the heathen in an embodied form , the lovely and attractive feature of Christianity . They would exemplify the practicability of those lessons which the gospel incul cates , and show their incomparable superiority over all their own tenets and practices . The arts and customs of civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the useful trades and occupations among us could be em ployed for the benefit both of the colonist and of those to whose best interests they had devoted themselves . Added to these , and perhaps superior to them all , would be the direct modes of bringing truth in contact with the minds of the heathen , which the members of such colonies might employ , and which might be multiplied in proportion to the number of adult colonists . Oral teaching the distribution of books the instruction of the young in seminaries of every variety from the infant school through all the inter mediate departments to the colleges and even theological institutions , would employ all the time of some , and the leisure hours of others , to the greatest advantage . One or dained missionary could keep a hundred assistants engaged , though their labours were the most signally blessed . That which engrosses the missionary is the simple elementary instruction in Christianity , which any layman could perform with equal propriety and effect . Formal preaching , and the /q/ Christian Colonies . administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the children of such colonists were sanctified to the great work in which all around them were employed , their services would be incalculable . The language would come to them by intuition and in its perfection . " /z/ Freedom alone will not elevate the blacks . /z/ " T is liberty alone that gives the flow r Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume ; And we are weeds without it . All constraint , Except what wisdom lays on evil men , Is evil ; hurts the faculties ; impedes Their progress in the road of science ; blinds The eye-sight of discovery : and begets In those who suffer it , a sordid mind , Bestial , a meagre intellect , unfit To be the tenant of man s noble form . " Cowper . * AFTER all , Pa , it appears to me , said Henry , that it is more than freedom that is necessary to raise the African in the scale of being , and make him respected and happy . How many Negroes there are in this country that are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Emancipation , it seems to me , is but a small part of the duty to which hu manity calls us. * Yes , Pa , snid Caroline , I have thought that the blacks , even at the North , are generally very degraded and misera ble ; and I have been told that the free blacks at the South are even more grovelling and abandoned in their morals than the slaves . 1 It is true , my children , that whilst there are in the United States 300,000 persons of African origin who have the name /q/ Strange that they are not even more depraved. of being free , they are generally wretched . But we should remember that is because invincible prejudice is continually pressing them down , and paralyzing all the energies of their nature . There are circumstances which seem to check and utterly forbid , in most cases , every rising emotion of ambi tion . They have , in truth , neither home , country , or motive to effort . Let the white man be similarly situated , genera tion after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , in the lapse of time , he and his descendants are not wretched , their thoughts grovelling , and morals aban doned. * Why , as to that , I do not think the blacks are more de graded than many whites . I have heard it remarked , that at the South even the slaves consider it a degradation to as sociate with the lowest class of whites . 3 * It has been said that , at the South , there are three great classes the respectable whites , the negroes , and the igno rant , or vicious and degraded whites ; the last being lowest on the scale of respectability and moral worth . At the South , the line of demarkation is more clearly drawn between the respectable and the degraded , than in the Northern States . The white man who , at the South , can not find a comfortable support , and maintain a respectable standing in society , is generally obnoxious to the suspicion of other causes of po verty and degradation than misfortune ; whilst there is far greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . * To return to your remark , about the unhappy condition of the free blacks . We admit that it is correct ; but let me ask if it is not strange that the blacks are not even more de graded than they are . I do not think that either free or slave will suffer in comparison with the whites , allowing for all /z/ No stimulus to effort , and opportunity for distinction . the circumstances which have led to the present condition of the blacks . The free , however , it must be confessed , are ge nerally more sunken to a level with the brute , than the slave . They are , as a whole , exceeding corrupt , depraved , and abandoned . There are many honourable exceptions among them , and it is often a pleasure which I enjoy of bearing tes timony to these exceptions ; but the vicious and degraded habits and propensities of this class , are known to every man of attentive observation . 1 The characters of men for active industry , enterprise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than is generally supposed , upon the circumstances in which they are placed . Among the causes which , probably , ope rate most powerfully on the character , is early encourage ment . The child who is taught to expect and attempt great things , is most likely to imbibe a generous spirit of enter prise . It is the encouragement , the hope of attaining to some degree of excellence or measure of prosperity , which is wont to develope genius and make the man . But what hopes are before the minds of the children of our coloured population , as motives to aim at an elevated standing in so ciety ? What honourable employment to which the genius might happen to be suited , can be promised ? To what cir cle of friendship and respectability , whose cultivated minds and purity of morals may operate as a stimulus , can the chil dren of a coloured skin be introduced ? Can the parents of those children , affording powerful motives in their own suc cess and example , point to the successful merchant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , or divine , and say , you have the prospect of rising , with equal industry and merit , to a level with those ? Alas ! they must , at best , be hewers of wood and drawers of water . The bar , the pulpit , the legislative hall , the circles of refinement , and /q/ Can not rise or he happy , here . respectability , and honour , are shut to them , by that which is irresistible the force of public sentiment . They are de nied , by invincible prejudice , the advantages of other free men , and no talents however great , no piety however pure and devoted , no patriotism however ardent , can lift them above this cruel fate . They hear the accents , they behold the triumphs , of liberty ; but they can not enjoy it as do we . In all the walks of life , in every society , on every path which lies before others to honour and fame and glory , a moral in cubus pursues and fastens upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their condition is worse than that of the fabled Tantalus , who never could grasp the fruits and water which seemed within his reach . And when they die , Memory o er their tomb no trophies raises . " Their degradation is the natural consequence of their un fortunate situation , and not the result of any inherent de pravity in their natural constitution , or of deficiency of men tal faculties . They are capable , I verily believe , ( and I hope that by observation and by reading , if not by our conversations , this conviction will be fastened on your mind , ) of the finest sen sibilities as we are ; as capable of appreciating and enjoying the endearing relations and blessings of life ; as capable of self-government , and eminent attainments in knowledge , use fulness , piety , and respectability . But do what they will , there is here , comparatively , only one prospect before them . This is true in respect to the free Negro , and it can not be sup posed to be otherwise in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly hope , under such cir cumstances , that they will ever be , in this country , what they /z/ Claims of the American Colonization Society . should desire to be , and aspire after . And this is the reason , I suppose , why so many who appear to feel for their unhap py condition , are in favour of their colonizing in Africa ? 4 It is for this reason , and also for others in connexion the benefits that will result to Africa from such an enterprise , and the best interests of our own country that African co lonization is warmly advocated by many . The object is thought to have powerful claims to our best and warmest wishes , and untiring efforts , whether we consult the best in terests of the free blacks , the slaves , the whites , or the many millions scattered over the dark continent of Africa . * I do not see why they should desire , under such cir cumstances , to remain , or why any should oppose their loca tion on a more genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of their forefathers ? *I am by no means a party man , in respect to this subject , and I hope not on any subject ; but I acknowledge that the AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY has claims to my high re gard and best desires for its success and prosperity . There is much need , doubtless , of that wisdom which God imparts to them that seek it , to direct in this matter , for great inte rests are involved , and the question is exceeding complicate in its bearings . There is need also of a spirit of meekness , and kindness , and forbearance , in its discussion . You feel confident then , Pa , that the blacks , if coloniz ed , will do well in their fathers native land ? 4 1 can have no reasonable doubt on this subject . Place them where they may call the land their own , where , to use the language of a distinguished and eloquent statesman of another country , " they will stand redeemed , regenerated , /q/ Prejudices against Africans . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and they will commence a new life . Many who were fully sensible to the humiliation of their condition here , are at this moment worthy and independent citizens in the country of their forefathers . It seems cruel that remaining in this country , they are destined to be for ever proscribed and debased by our pre judices ; and yet , for all that we can foresee , such must be the consequence unless public sentiment undergoes an entire change . At the South , the African is held in physical bondage ; at the North , prejudice consigns him to a moral debasement , by which he can not but feel that he is deeply injured . It is a painful subject and who shall determine where the line of duty shall be drawn ? If we refer to the Scriptures , a diversity of sentiment remains even among good people , for they differ in their interpretations and con structions of duty . I know that I have what are called pre judices , and still I think I am sincerely disposed to befriend the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some friends of Africans , at which my mind re coils and this I suppose is what is denominated prejudice/ * There appears to exist in the breasts of white men in this country , generally , a prejudice against the colour of the African , which nothing short of divine power can remove . How far this difference between ourselves and the blacks should influence our intercourse with them in political life or in respect to the sociabilities of the friendly circle , I shall not here assert . I have my own views on this subject . It becomes me , however , to admit that some great and good men have gone to wide extremes on this question . Dr. Philip , the able and distinguished missionary in South Af rica , of the London Missionary Society , in a letter to a be- /z/ Distinctions on account of colour . nevolent association of students at the Princeton Theologi cal Seminary , says , " It gives us a frightful view of human nature , that the injuries we have done to that race of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that that hatred should be evident in proportion to the cruelty and injustice they have suffered at our hands . " * * * " As our children , it is hoped , " he continues , " will be more inno cent of the crimes committed against Africa , than we are , so we hope they will cherish towards Africa a more kindly feeling than we . There was no prejudice against colour when Egypt was the cradle of literature and science , nor in the days when the Grecian and Roman republics were in their glory ; and these prejudices will , most certainly , pass away , as the principles of the gospel prevail . " 1 1 believe the same prejudice does not exist , in the same degree , in other countries , does it , Pa ? 4 It is a singular fact that we republicans are , in this mat ter , far more exclusive in our feelings than our monarchical neighbours . In England , it is common to see respectable and genteel people , open their pews when a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody thinks it a degra dation to have a coloured traveller sit at the same table . 4 1 have heard a well-authenticated anecdote , which illus trates the different state of feeling in the two countries on this subject . " A wealthy American citizen was residing in London for a season , at the time the famous Prince Saunders was there . The London breakfast hour is very late ; and Mr. Saunders happened to call on the American while his family were taking their morning repast . Politeness and native good feelings prompted the good lady to ask their guest to take a cup of coffee ; but then , the prejudices of society /q/ Less prejudice in other countries . how could she get over them ? True , he was a gentleman in character , manners , and dress but he had a black skin , and how could she sit at the same table with him ! His skin being black , it was altogether out of the question , although it is possible a black character is not always so great a diffi culty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ! So the lady sipped her coffee , and Prince Saunders sat at the win dow , occasionally speaking in reply to the conversation ad dressed to him . At last , all others having retired from the breakfast table , the lady , with an affected air of sudden re collection , said , I forgot to ask if you had breakfasted , Mr. Saunders ; won t you allow me to give you a cup of coffee ? I thank you , Madam , was the reply , with a dig nified bow , / am engaged to breakfast with the Prince Regent , this morning . " /z/ Free Mark* more degraded luan nhives. /z/ " It is not easy to discern any object to which the pecuniary resources of the Union can he applied , of greater importance to the national security and welfare , than to provide ibr the removal , in a manner consistent with the rights and interests of the several States , of the free coloured popula tion within their limits . " Gen. Mercer . * IN our last conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . The circumstance that there are so few blacks that , with their freedom , avoid poverty and vice , nobly resisting the natural tendency of their con dition , has led some to suppose that however undesirable in itself slavery may be , the blacks generally gain little , and in most instances , are great losers , by emancipation ! 4 It has been asserted that , of free blacks collected in our cities and large towns , a great portion are found in abodes of wretchedness and vice , and become tenants of poor-houses and prisons . As a proof of the tendency of their condition , the following striking facts among others , ascertained a year or two since , have been mentioned : In Massachusetts , where the coloured population is small , being less than 7,000 souls , ( only l-74th part of the whole population , ) ICT 3 about l-6th part of the whole number of convicts in the state-prison are blacks . In Connecticut , l-34th part of /q/ Alarming proportion ot crane among 1 ree blacks . the population is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victs . In New-York , l-35th part are blacks ; C7 CI&gt; l-4th part of the convicts in the city state-prison are blacks . In New-Jersey , the proportion is l-13th coloured ; and of the convicts l-3d . In Pennsylvania , l-34th part of a popula tion of more than a million of souls , is coloured ; and more than one-third part of the convicts are black . I need not pursue these illustrations of the degradation of the free blacks in the non-slave-holding- States . It ap pears from these statements , which I find in the First Annual Report of the Prison Discipline Society , that about one quarter part of all the expense incurred by these States for the support of their institutions for criminals is for colour ed convicts . The bill of expense in three of these States stands thus : that is , the expense for the support of coloured convicts for the specified number of years preceding the re port from which this schedule is made , is in Massachusetts , 10 years , - - $17,734 Connecticut , 15 " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109,166 in one prison . /z/ JC7* This sum was expended in an average of less than eighteen years , on convicts from among a population of only 54,000 coloured persons . * Illustrations , borrowed from the criminal statistics of the South , would place this matter in a far more unfavourable light . References to the expenses for the maintenance of paupers , would give a similar result . * Another consideration , and one of great weight with our Southern brethren , in leading them to deprecate the exist ence and increase of a coloured population in their midst , is the contaminating influence which this class spread among /z/ Either colonization or slavery necessary for the present . the poor and degraded around them . Prostrate and wretch ed themselves , through the peculiarity of their almost hope less circumstances , they are a source of envy and restless anxiety to the slave , who , seeing them free from domestic restraint and witnessing the facilities with which they are enabled to indulge their various propensities , are tempted , and corrupted , and often ruined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of the law , and the most cruel restraints to which slavery is subjected and hence too the early discouragement , and of late years the absolute prohibition of emancipation except under seve " re restrictions , in the Southern States . I recollect having been very much shocked sometime since at the remark of Gen. H , that " it would have been better for the free blacks had they been kept in bond age , where the opportunity and the inducements to vice would not have been so great . " I did not at the time ap preciate the remark . Such is the opinion of many , who I am sure are no ad vocates for slavery , and who have made sacrifices to their good feelings towards the African , both slave and free . " I am clear , " says a distinguished Virginian , who feels a deep interest in the welfare of our coloured population , " that whether we consider it with reference to the welfare of the State , or the happiness of the blacks , it were better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive such freedom as they enjoy . " The condition of slaves themselves , I suppose , would be much ameliorated by the removal of those that are freed , and I should suppose that no one can doubt that our free black population may find themselves much more favourably located in a community by themselves . /q/ Colonization ameliorates the condition of the slave . I There can be no doubt that colonization has a tendency to ameliorate the condition of the slave ; and that it is well calculated to hasten the time when all shall go free who are *iow oppressed . It has long been a source of regret among many discerning , and well-informed , and Christian people , to my own knowledge , that they can not free their slaves without adding to their wretchedness throwing , as it were , loose on the community so many materials to be manufac tured into every form of indolence , degradation and vice . I 1 suppose , Pa , said Henry , that if the immediate emancipation of the whole slave population were to be ef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be very far from enviable ? 1 It is thought by the South , and by many at the North , that immediate emancipation would render it necessary for the whites to exterminate the blacks , or abandon the south ern soil . The late abolition of slavery in the West India colonies is pleaded as a refutation of this idea ; but those who are best qualified to judge , assert that the emancipation of slaves upon the West India estates , is a very different thing from the immediate emancipation of two millions of slaves in the southern country ; and that , without raising the question of the ultimate effect upon the whites in the West Indies , the banishment of the blacks , or the expa triation or annihilation of the whites would be the necessary consequence in this country . * The duty of immediate emancipation , said Caroline , * would be very plain , I suppose , if the continuance of the system is wrong under any circumstances . The aboli tionists , I believe , view slavery in 11 xiases , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous . suppose it is hardly proper to advise leaving off sin gra dually , as convenience dictates . * The Rev. Dr. Fisk , President of the Methodist Univer sity in Middletown , said Mr. L. , illustrates the conse quence of carrying out the views of our abolitionist breth ren , by the following anecdote : " The eccentric Lorenzo Dow , had by building a milldam across a stream flooded his neighbour s grounds above the dam . They commenced a suit against him , and obtained a verdict in their favour , on the principle that he was invading their rights . This verdict convinced Lorenzo that every moment he kept the water in its present position he was guilty of a legal sin : and on the ground that every man should quit sinning immediately , he at once became a convert to the doctrine of immediate abolition . He accord ingly went to work and forthwith abolished ( or demolished ) his milldam . The immediate consequence of letting off so large a quantity of water at once , was the deluging of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorenzo was taught by a second prosecution and assess ment of damages , that his immediate abolition had led him into a greater sin than he was guilty of before . " We have already noticed , Mr. L. continued , the con dition of the free black population in several of the most highly favoured States in the Union . Let me advert to a few other facts : In the State of Virginia the free coloured people are not less than 38,000 ; and yet of this number , not 200 are proprietors of land ! Again , look at their unwelcome re ception wherever they go , among the whites ; and consider the fact that their presence is regarded as an evil wherever they are . In some States , they are prevented from going by enactments which expose them to a forfeiture of their /q/ Baltimore memorial . freedom if they should dare to set foot upon the soil . Lou isiana , sometime since , required all free persons of colour who had removed to the State since the year 1825 , to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from that State , sought a home in Canada ; but the result is that the Canadians , in their turn , have threatened their expul sion . They are laid under restrictions which can not but be exceeding painful , in most of the States both North and South ; and in none do they enjoy any thing much better than a mere nominal freedom . Various expedients are re sorted to by the State legislatures to free themselves from a free coloured population , by disabilities and other embarrass ments . Every State seems to cherish a disposition to be free from a free black population . The South casts them off the North has no place for them the West pushes them away Canada expels them and where shall they go ? What shall they do ? * They are here insulated from the world ; they have no home of their own ; no community of their own ; no coun try of their own ; no government of their own ; no system whatever , intellectual or moral , in which their individual ex istence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crushed they are , I was going to say , dislocated from humanity . The free people of colour in Baltimore , seem to have taken a correct but painful view of this subject , in a memo rial which is now before me : they say , to the citizens of Baltimore , " We have hitherto beheld , in silence , but with intense interest , the efforts of the wise and philanthropic in our be half . If it became us to be silent , it became us also to feel the liveliest anxiety and gratitude . The time has now ar rived , as we believe , in which your work and our happiness /z/ Baltimore memorial . may be promoted by the expression of our opinions . * * * We reside among you , and yet are strangers ; natives , and yet not citizens ; surrounded by the freest people and most republican institutions in the world , and yet enjoying none of the immunities of freedom .

The protection , .  | /z/ Embarkation of colonists . kindness , and assistance which you would have desired for yourselves under , such circumstances , now extend to us , " &c.; This memorial , of which I have given the greater part , was adopted at meetings of " respectable free people of co lour , held in the Bethel " and African churches , which meetings were composed of " several denominations , from every part of the city . " The memorial is a well written document , and can not be read without interest .

Said a dear friend who soon after laid down his life , on a mission to Af rica , " There is the aged Fantee and Haousian they say I go to encourage the young they can never be elevated here I have tried it sixty years it is in vain could I by my example induce them to embark , and I die the next day , I should be satisfied .

It surpasses every thing that has yet occurred . JNo sooner had your colony been established on Cape Montserado , than there appeared a disposition among the owners of slaves to give them freedom voluntarily and without compensation , and allow them to be sent to the land of their fathers , so that you have many thousands redeemed , without any cost for their redemption .

IT is a settled point , I should think , said Caroline I con sider it as settled in my own mind , at least , that Africans and their descendants can not be so useful or happy as citi zens of this country , as they might be in their fathers native land , Said Mr. L. , ! have been looking over a discourse by the Rev. Dr. Miller of Princeton , which was delivered in 1823 , before the Synod of New-Jersey . The Dr. holds this language , in reference to this subject , which , if you please , I will read : " If liberated and left among the whites , they would be a constant source of annoyance , corruption , and danger . They could never be trusted as faithful citizens ; for they could never feel that their interests and those - of the . whites . /z/ Motives to respectability . are precisely the same . Each would regard the other with painful suspicion and apprehension . * * It is essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances from each other , as to avoid too frequent intercourse . They should be in a situation to live a separate and independent people . If we would consult their temporal and eternal well-being , this must be done ; if we would consult our own interests and happiness , it is equally necessary . " * Again he says , " They could never be either respectable or happy in the midst of a white population . They can never , whilst public sentiment remains what it is , associate with the whites on terms of equality . They may be indus trious and regular ; they may be enterprising and successful in business ; and exhibit talents , knowledge , and wealth ; but after all they can never associate with the whites on terms comfortable to either . They will be treated , and they will feel as inferiors . They can not live under the influence of that sense of character , of those excitements to aim at a high standing in society which operate upon a corresponding num ber of white people . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will confer on them in a greater or less de gree a degraded character . Place any number of human beings , of whatever complexion , in a situation in which they can never aspire to an equality with those around them , and you take away from them one of the main incitements to industry , to honourable enterprise , and to emulation of ex cellence. " * This is indeed but a repetition of the sentiments which I have already advanced in these conversations . Slavery must , sooner or later , cease from among us ; and I pray that the hour may hasten when our country shall be delivered from its scourge and reproach . But the more I contemplate the subject , the more I am convinced that the way which /z/ The foundation of a Christian empire laid . gives promise of greatest and most extensive benefit to the slaves in our country , as well as to the whites , is emancipa tion united with colonization . Nor can I doubt that the coloured people of this country who are already nominally free* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interests of their race and the salvation of their fathers native continent , by planting themselves in some position on the inviting shores of Africa . o But , Pa , they must be prepared by education , and suita ble moral and religious instruction , in order to be good citi zens of any country ? J Certainly . African improvement and colonization should be considered inseparable . Great care must betaken , not to destroy the hope of a rich blessing for Africa by sending thither a people who are not prepared to assist in laying the foundation for a great and cultivated , prosperous and Christian nation . 4 The germ of such an empire , I am happy to say , . has al ready , as I confidently believe , taken root in Africa . The leaven of Christianity is already in the midst of her dark and absurd superstitions . And I have no doubt that before a cen tury has passed away , millions of free and enlightened and Christian people will lift their hearts up in thanksgivings to God on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mesurado ! /z/ History of the American Colonization Society . * It will give me great pleasure to gratify your wishes in this respect . *THE AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY is a voluntary and benevolent association which was formed at Washington , District of Columbia , in the December of 1816 . Who is entitled to the honour of first suggesting its formation and character , I shall not undertake to determine . It has been said , that , as early as 1777 , Mr. Jefferson proposed to the legislature of Virginia to have incorporated in the revised code of that State , a plan for colonizing the free coloured population of the United States . It is said that he proposed to establish a colony in some part of our western country . The project proved abortive . In England , Dr. Fothergill and Granville Sharp appear first to have considered the subject , the latter of whom may be regarded as the founder of the colony of Sierra Leone . The earliest suggestions that I have met with on this sub ject , from over the waters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1783 . It is said that Anthony Benezet , in a letter addressed to Dr. Fothergill , 1773 , proposed to co lonize the Negroes of this country , in " that large extent of country from the west side of the Alleghany mountains to the Mississippi , on a breadth of four or five hundred miles . " Benezet also writes , under date of 4th month 28th , 1773 , " I am like-minded with thee , with respect to the danger and difficulty which would attend a sudden manumission of those Negroes now in the Southern colonies , as well to themselves as to the whites . " In 1785 , a Society seems to have been formed in Penn sylvania , for promoting the gradual abolition of slavery , which received a charier in 1789 ; but it does not appear that this body contemplated the colonization of the free blacks in a separate community . For this Society , however , it has /z/ Society formed , /z/ been claimed by an able advocate for colonization , ( J. R. Tyson , Esq. ) that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . " In 1787 , Dr. Thornton , of Washington , formed a project for colonizing free men of colour , from the United States , on the western coast of Africa ; and published an address to those residing in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , inviting them to accompany him to Africa for the purpose of forming a settlement . He was enthusiastically engaged in the enter prise , and was so far successful that he found a sufficient number of free blacks ready to go ; but unfortunately , his efforts failed for want of sufficient funds , the public mind not being then prepared for any such enterprise of benevolence to afford that pecuniary aid which is so commendably fur nished when any good object presents itself at the present day . In 1789 , the Rev. Dr. Hopkins , of Rhode Island , corres ponded with Granville Sharp on the subject ; and in 1790 , an able article on the subject was published by Ferdinando Fairfax , of Virginia . In 1801 , the legislature of Virginia resolved instructions to their Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , and urge him to institute negotiations with some of the powers of Europe possessed of colonies on the coast of Africa , for an asylum to which emancipated Negroes might be sent . A correspondence followed between Presi dent Jefferson and the Sierra Leone company , and afterwards with the government of Portugal ; but obstacles presented , and that project was at length abandoned . The plan of a Colonization Society , it is generally con sidered , was proposed by the Rev. Robert Finley , of NewJersey . He , it seems , devoted much thought to the subject in 1814 , as also in 1815 . It is also evident that the Rev. /z/ First emigration to Africa . Samuel J. Mills , of Connecticut , was not , at this time , without the conception of the great plan , in his own mind . Some , who assert that they speak from personal knowledge , represent Mr. Mills as the man , who , under God , was at the foundation of this institution . Be that as it may , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greatly efficient in bringing about the desired result . The American Colonization Society was formed , as I have said , in 1816 ; and in the steps immediately preliminary to its organization , are recorded the names of Mr. Finley , Mr. Mills , the Hon. C. F. Mercer of Virginia , and F. S. Key and E. B. C aid well , Esqrs. of Washington . Among those who attended the first meeting , for the organization of the Society , may be mentioned also as conspicuous , the Hon. Bushrod Washington , who was first President of the So ciety , and the Hon. Henry Clay , one of its earliest VicePreside nts . The first emigration of coloured people to Africa , from the United States , was in 1815 , about a year previous to the formation of the American Colonization Society . This expedition was under the direction of Paul Cuffee , a co loured man , and truly respectable , benevolent and wealthy member of the denomination of Friends . Capt . Cuffee , whose home was in New Bedford , Mass. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking with him thirty-eight persons to Sierra Leone , thirty of whom he carried out gratuitously , at an expense to himself of more than three thousand dol lars. * Did you say that he was a coloured man , Pa ? I did ; and very much of a gentleman he was too . His father was a poor African whom the hand of unfeeling ava&lt;-rice dragged from his native home and connexions into /q/ Colonization Agents visit Africa . slavery ; but by his good conduct , faithfulness and perse vering industry , in time obtained his freedom . Paul was poor in his early days ; but was industrious and enterpris ing , by which traits , joined to much practical wisdom and sterling common sense , he at length arose to opulence . He was largely concerned in commerce ; and in many voyages , to Russia , England , Africa , the West Indies , and Southern States , commanded his own ship . A man of the strictest integrity , modest and yet dignified in his manners , of a feel ing and liberal heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , his acquaintance and friendship were valued by many who greatly honoured him , both in this country and in Europe . I remember seeing him often , in my youth . The last time , which I recollect seeing him was as he was passing through my native place , in his own private family carriage , drawn by beautiful white horses , with a coachman of his own complexion , on his way to attend a Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends , of which I have said he was a worthy and highly respected member . In 1818 , the American Colonization Society appointed as agents , the Rev. Samuel John Mills , whose labours and prayers , in the short time that he lived , accomplished much for the glory of God , and laid the foundation for great re sults in the conversion of perishing heathen ; and the Rev. Ebenezer Burgess , now Dr. Burgess , the excellent Pastor of one of the churches in New-England ; and instructed them to proceed to the coast of Africa , by the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable location of a colony . 1 These gentlemen visited all the ports from Sierra Leone to Sherbro , and acquired much valuable information . Mr. Mills , as you know , died on the passage from Africa , leav- /z/ Samuel John Mills . ing the church to mourn the loss of one of the best and most useful of men . You recollect , probably , the just and eloquent tribute to the memory of this man of God , by the Rev. Mr. Bacon of New Haven . Mr. Bacon , you know ; and know also that he is the ardent and faithful friend of Africa . I must , through respect to the memory of the sainted Mills , read to you an extract from Mr. Bacon s discourse . We will then postpone any further conversation until evening , when we will hope to resume the subject . " A young minister of the gospel once said to an intimate friend , * My brother , you and I are little men , but before we die , our influence must be felt on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ship , returning from a dis tant quarter of the globe , paused on her passage across the deep .

It was the body of the man who , in the ardour of youthful benevolence , had aspired to extend his influence through the world . He died in youth ; but he had redeem ed his pledge ; and at this hour , his influence is felt in Asia , in Africa , in the Islands of the sea , and in every cor ner of his native country . " This was SAMUEL JOHN MILLS ; and all who know his history , will say that I have exaggerated neither the gran deur of his aspirations , nor the result of his efforts . He traversed our land like a ministering spirit , silently , and yet effectually , from the hill country of the Pilgrims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errands of benevo lence from village to village , and from city to city , pleading now with the patriot for a country growing up to an im mensity of power , and now with the Christian , for a world /q/ Samuel John Mills . lying in wickedness . He explored in person the desola tions of the West , and in person he stirred up to enterprise and effort the churches of the East . He lived for India and Owhyhee , and died in the service of Africa . He went to heaven in his youth ; but his works do follow him , like a long train of glory that still widens and brightens , and will widen and brighten for ever . " 1 Let me repeat , said Caroline , as a supplement to the truly eloquent extract from Mr. Bacon s eulogium , the po etry of one whom I love to quote , and whose effusions you , Pa , and Henry , both love to hear , and then I will consent to adjourn ; although , I confess , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , for I have become deeply inte rested . * I will hear you with pleasure , Caroline , said her fa ther . Caroline remarked , * They are the lines of Mrs. Sigourney , on reading the Biography of the /z/ " Oh Africk ! raise thy voice and weep For him who sought to heal thy wo , Whose bones beneath the briny deep Bleach where the pearl and coral glow .

" James Madison . MR . L. remarked , at the opening of this conversation , It has occurred to me that , in mentioning the early friends of Africa , I ought not to have omitted mentioning more parti cularly the name of Anthony Benezet . His name will live , whilst virtue and benevolence are respected among men ; and his earnestness in the cause of humanity will be remem bered when the history of Africa s redemption shall be writ ten . Benezet established a free school in Philadelphia for the education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s alley , Philadelphia , and at which John Williams and Peter Harris , interesting youths from the native tribes of Bassa Cove , have been partially educated ; the former of whom has returned to Africa , and the latter , an African prince , is now at Lafayette College , Easton , Pa. , for the com pletion of his education . Benezet was always prompt to plead in the behalf of the coloured race as , to their honour be it told , , have ever been the respectable Society of Friends , /z/ Anthony Benezet. of which he was a member , to feel a deep concern to ame liorate the condition of this unhappy class of their fellowmen . Benezet early caused to be republished in Philadel phia the celebrated tract of Granville Sharp , on the " injus tice of slavery , " and also wrote and published a work on the subject himself , which was republished in England . He commenced a correspondence with Mr. Sharp on the sub ject of slavery in 1772 ; of this correspondence I will give you another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but thou wilt , upon inquiry , find more well-minded people ready to cry thee God speed , in this weighty service , than thou art aware of . The most solid amongst all dissenters , particu larly the Presbyterians , would be well-pleased to see an end put to the slave-trade , and many , to slavery itself . The peo ple of Ifew England have made a law that nearly amounts to a prohibition of the trade , and I am informed , have pro posed to the governor and council , that all Negroes born in the country shall be free at a certain age . The people of Maryland and Virginia , are so convinced of the inexpediency , if not of the iniquity of any further importation of Negroes , that twenty thousand people would freely join in a petition to parliament , against any further import . " Roberts Vaux , in his life of Benezet , says , " During the sitting of the legislature , in 1780 , a session memora ble for the enactment of a law which commenced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had private interviews on the subject with every member of the government , and no doubt thus essentially contributed to the adoption of that celebrated measure . " I will now endeavour to satisfy your inquiry in respect to the object of the American Colonization Society . This can be done in a few words , by referring to the constitution /z/ Object of colonization . itself , of the Society , the first two articles of which are as fol lows : 1 " Article I. This Society shall be called the American Society FOR COLONIZING THE FREE PEOPLE OF COLOUR of the United States . " Article II . The OBJECT to which its attention is to be exclusively directed , is TO PROMOTE AND EXECUTE A PLAN /z/ Is this alone the object of the Society ? said Caroline , I had supposed that it contemplated also the suppression of the slave-trade , and also the final emancipation of slaves in our country . Its whole object , said Mr. L , , * is stated in the second article of its constitution . Other important ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the colo ny , or as consequences of the efforts for colonization ; but this is the one object it has in view . Pursuing this one ob ject , the North and the South may unite in harmonious action . The subject of emancipation it passes by , knowing that this belongs exclusively to the several States in which slave ry is tolerated , and to individual proprietors in those States , under and according to their laws . The subject of the slavetrade is not contemplated directly in the constitution of the Society , for the authority for its suppression is vested only in the government of the nations . Nor does it directly aim at the education and improvement of the blacks in this coun try ; for this must be under the direction of State govern ments , or of State Societies , and no interference in the do- /z/ Colonization generally approved . mestic concerns of any one State , is admissible on the part of inhabitants of another State . At the same time , to use the language of one of its Vice-Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall demonstrate the practicability of the successful removal to Africa , of free persons of colour , with their own consent ; the cause of emancipation , either by States or by individuals , may be incidentally advanced . At the same time , our country will be relieved of a great evil in proportion as colonization succeeds ; those who may remove will find their condition greatly improved ; and by introduc ing knowledge , industry , and religion into Africa , we shall contribute to the suppression of the slave-trade , and to the civilization and conversion of a CONTINENT ! These are ends which will be obtained although the object of the Society is The course which the Society takes , unites a greater num ber of judicious and well disposed persons of every section of our common country , probably , than any other plan could . It is true , there are not a few who object : the slave-holder has , in some instances , indulged the suspicion that an inter ference " with the rights of property , " may be intended ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cast upon the Society his keen est reproaches , alleging that its influence , if not its direct object , is to perpetuate the existence of slavery . These ob jections , however , so diametrically opposite , many advocates of colonization regard as matter of felicitation , rather than otherwise , inasmuch as they evince the wisdom of the plan of operation which is proposed . The virulent denunciations of both extremes of public sentiment , they say , were to be expected by a Society rejecting the hurtful in the views of either , although adopting the liberal in both . Besides , had it been warmly espoused at the first by either , it would haveLafayette /q/ s views of the Colonization Society . been irreconcileably opposed by the other , and would have been itself the dividing line between two great parties , leav ing no middle ground on which the great majority of the nation might stand , as now , and safely urge forward this cause of philanthropy and of patriotism , without compromise of principles , or the violation of the constitution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked , * we know , is approved by many judicious and good men , and I do not see why it should be opposed , or suspected of designing to take any other course than that which it has taken , and still pur sues . " Charity thinketh no evil . " : And Henry said , I wonder how the subject would strike the mind of a man of enlarged views and philanthropic soul , who was in a situation to see it as it is , and to judge without prejudice . I should think now , that the opinion of such a man as LAFAYETTE , would be worthy of regard ; if he ap proved of colonization , or disapproved of it , I should think that his unprejudiced opinion would have influence . Lafayette was a Vice-President of the Colonization So-* ciety , Henry , said Caroline . no , Caroline , said H. ; are you not mistaken ? Yes , said Mr. L , , Lafayette was an honorary VicePresident of the Colonization Society . And we have his opinion , expressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter , dated at " Paris , Oct. 29 , 1831 , " he says , " The pro gressing state of our Liberia establishment , is to me a source of enjoyment and the most lively interest . PROUD AS I A.M OF THE HONOUR of being one of the Vice-Presidents of the Society , I only regret that I can not make myself more use- /z/ Other distinguished men . ful. * * When the Society meet , be pleased to present my wishes , gratitude , and respect . " 4 Who are some of the other officers of the Society ; many of our most distinguished public men ? It has enjoyed both the entire confidence of our most distinguished men , and the high honour of their influence and services as its members and officers . Some of these " are not , for God has taken them ; " others are with us , and long may they be spared to help forward the cause of co lonization , and as ornaments and blessings in the world . The Hon. Bushrod Washington , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was President of the Society after the death of Judge Washington . James Ma dison was its late President . The late Chief- Justice Mar shall and the venerable and lamented Bishop White have been among its Vice-Presidents ; also , Hon. Wm . H. Craw ford and Bishop McKendree . Among its present officers are Henry Clay of Kentucky , John C. Herbert of Maryland , Robert Ralston of Philadel phia , Samuel Bayard of New-Jersey , Daniel Webster of Boston , Gen. Mercer of Va. , President Day of Yale Col lege , John Cotton Smith of Conn. , Theo . Frelinghuysen of N. Jersey , Gerrit Smith of N. York , Bishop Meade of Va. , Samuel Southard of N. Jersey , and- I will not undertake to enumerate more , although I might recollect and mention many others of distinguished eminence in different parts of the Union . The Colonization Society has , indeed , become an object of admiration in different parts of the globe . * I recollect , said Henry , among those whose approba tion , it received , the name of Wilberforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension is correct that it received his approbation , said Mr. L. , " Troja fuit . " It may be considered a mooted point , however , as relates to the final decision of the mind of the philanthropic and lamented Wilberforce . It is asserted that he withdrew confidence from the cause , although he had been the unhesi tating friend and advocate of colonization . In regard to this matter , Dr. Hodgkin , of London , says that " Wilberforce continued to avow his approbation of the Society until near the period of his lamented death , when the exparte state ments of those who knew the importance of his authority , obtained a triumph , the achievement of which confers no ho nour . " The Society has not been without many and distinguish ed friends abroad , however . Lord Althorp , the late learned Chancellor of the Exchequer , and one of the most enlight ened and distinguished noblemen of England , has publicly pronounced the foundation of the Colony of Liberia to be " one of the greatest events of modern times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of African free dom have been greater than those of almost any other man living , is " strongly attached to the Society ; " the Duke of Sussex , Lord Bexley , the Duke of Bedford , the Archbishop of Dublin , and others of the highest standing in society , are officers of a Society denominated THE BRITISH AFRICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY , which has been formed in Great Britain in aid of the colonization enterprise . They consi der the plan of the American Colonization Society as " ad mirably adapted to introduce Christianity and civilization among the natives of Africa , and to extirpate the slave-trade , which the moral efforts of Great Britain and other powers , have been unable to suppress . " I might mention many /z/ Legislative acts approbatory. eminent foreigners who have expressed their decided appro bation of the Society . Auxiliaries are found , I presume , in almost every State of the Union ; are they not , Pa ? * I am not able to specify the number , but I recollect there are State and other auxiliaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New-York , NewJersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , Alabama , Tennessee , Kentucky , Ohio , Indiana , and Dela ware ; and resolutions approving of the Society , have been passed by the Legislatures of most of these and other States , and by most of these also the American Colonization So ciety has been recommended to the patronage of the Ge neral Government . Some of the States have made conditional appropriations from their respective treasuries . Maryland has set a noble example to her sister States by granting $200,000 from her treasury that is , the sum of $20,000 annually for ten years to enable the free blacks of Maryland , if they feel dis posed , to remove to Liberia . The Society has also received the approbation of all prominent denominations , by the acts of their ecclesiastical judicatories , whether assemblies , general associations , sy nods , classes , meetings , or conventions . Episcopalians , Presbyterians , the Dutch Reformed , Methodists , Congregationalists , Baptists , Lutherans , Moravians , and Friends , have thought proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of the Society to the patronage and good wishes of the community . 4 Has the Society considerable funds by which to sustain its operations ? /q/ Funds . * It has almost none , aside from voluntary contributions , which are made from week to week . Its income , however , from these sources , has been considerable , and gradually in creasing from its commencement . From 1821 to 1828 in clusive , the amount of donations was nearly $83,000 . In 1829 , it was upwards of $20,000 . In 1830 , more than $27,000 . In 1831 , rising $32,000 . In 1832 , more than $32,000 . In 1833 , $49,000 . In 1834-5 , nearly $52,000 . A heavy debt which had accumulated upon it , and had like , for a time , to have disheartened its friends and suspended its operations , has , by a better arrangement in respect to its fiscal operations , been nearly extinguished , and its prospects are again brightening . * In our next conversation , we will turn our attention to /z/ Liberia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall see That man hath yet a soul , and dare be free ; A little while , along thy saddening plains , The starless night of desolation reigns ; Truth shall restore the light by Nature given , And , like Prometheus , bring the fire of heaven ! Prone to the dust Oppression shall be hurl d Her name , her nature , wither d from the world . " Campbell . You promised , in our last conversation , said Caroline , that we should this morning hear something of the history of LIBERIA ; and I assure you , Pa , that Henry and I have a great deal of curiosity to satisfy on this subject , so that you may expect to be troubled with a great many questions . Why , Sir , was the district in which the colony is located , called Liberia ? I am much gratified to find that you both take so deep an interest in the subject ; and shall be pleased to hear and to reply to as many inquiries as you may feel inclined to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony , because it is the land of thefree d ; the name being coined from the Latin adjective " liber , " or " libera , " /ree. /q/ Location and chief settlements . Monrovia . * The central point of this colony is Cape Mesurado , or Montserado , which is represented as a most beautiful and commanding site . Liberia is situated about 5 degrees N. of the equator , and 250 miles S. of Sierra Leone , the English colony . It extends along the coast to the length of 150 or 300 miles ; and reaches into the interior indefinitely . Ri vers , some of considerable size , water the country through out . The soil is extremely fertile , and abounds in all the productions of tropical climates . The population , at the present time , is more than 4,000 ; perhaps it may be , as is estimated by some , 5 or 6,000. * The chief city is Monrovia ; so called in honour of the late ex-President of the United States , James Monroe . It is situated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ; and contains about 500 houses and stores a court-house six churches , one Episcopal , one Presby terian , two Methodist , and two Baptist three flourishing schools , one of which has up wards of 100 scholars a tem perance society , numbering upwards of 500 members and about 1500 inhabitants . The houses are generally well built , and of a pleasant appearance . The city is seventy feet above the sea ; and the temperature is mild and agree able , the thermometer not varying more than from 68 to 87 deg. , and the inhabitants enjoying , most of the time , a refreshing sea-breeze . The streets are 100 feet wide , cross ing each other at right angles . The harbour , which is form ed by the mouth of the river , is convenient and capacious for vessels of moderate dimensions . Seven miles north of the outlet of the Mesurado , is the river St. Paul s , on which is the town of Caldwell . This town , after the plan of some American villages , has but one street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planted on either side with a beautiful row of plaintain and banana trees . /z/ Caldwell . Stockton . New Georgia . Caldwell is an agricultural establishment , and is nourishing . It has three churches , three day schools , and three Sunday schools . It is an interesting fact than one of the native kings recently applied at one of these day schools for ad mission of twelve children ; which , however , could not be received as the school was already full . * Between Caldwell and Monrovia is another settlement called Stockton . And on the opposite side of the bay of Stockton , is a settlement of recaptured Africans , called New Georgia , and planted in part , by the akl of our General Government . It contains 500 inhabitants , who , although they were once the miserable tenants , in chains , of the loath some slave-ship , are now living in the enjoyment of the blessings of Christian and civilized life . This place has a church and more than two hundred houses . Mr. Buchanan , Agent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , says respecting this settlement , " The air of perfect neatness , thrift , and comfort , which every where prevails , affords a lovely commentary on the advancement which these interesting people have made in civilization and Christian order , under the patronage of the Colonization So ciety . Imagine to yourself , some two or three hundred houses , with streets intersecting each other at regular dis tances , preserved clean as the best swept side-walk in Phi ladelphia , and lined with well planted hedges of Cassava and of Plum ; a school-house full of orderly children , neatly dressed , and studiously engaged ; and then say whether I was guilty of extravagance , in exclaiming as I did , after sur veying this most lovely scene , that had the Colonization Society accomplished no more than has bqen done in the rescue from slavery and savage habits of these happy peo ple , I should have been well satisfied .

Millsburgh has peculiar advantages , many navi gable streams enabling it to become the commercial medium between the interior and the sea-coast . The land is fertile , and the forests abound with excellent timber . The town is represented as very neat and healthy . " Another considerable settlement in Liberia , is that form ed under the patronage of the Maryland Colonization So ciety , at Cape Palmas . This colony , which now numbers between three and four hundred inhabitants , is advanta geously located for health , and promises to excel in agricul ture . Its inhabitants are represented as temperate , intelli gent , and industrious ; and as giving evidence of mental as well as physical energy , that greatly encourages the confi dent hope and expectation that they will yet occupy an ho nourable rank among the civilized world .

A portion of the colonists are continually and actively engaged in trade , disposing to the natives , of English and American , and other goods v and receiving in return dyewoods , ivory , hides , gold , palm oH , tortoise shell , rice , &c.,; which become articles of exportation and of great profit .

It is healthy , it appears , to acclimated emigrants . When once accli mated , it is said by those who are competent to decide , and who could have no inducement to make an erroneous report , that Africa proves a more genial climate to the men of colour than any portion of the United States .

They found it impossible to obtain at that time a more suitable place , and were compelled , by a variety of untoward circumstances , to make a temporary establishment in the low , un healthy island of Sherbro . While here detained , endea vouring to purchase land , they were attacked by fatal disease , which carried off the agent of the Society and twenty out of eighty emigrants , together with two agents sent out by the United States Government .

It is this : whilst the mortality is to be attributed but partially to causes which can not be controlled , the evil is limited to a single genera tion : but the good accomplished by colonization is to bless all succeeding generations .

The settlement of new places is generally attended with trials by sickness . What is the fact in respect to the now nour ishing state of Louisiana ? The colony of Ibberville was begun to be settled in 1699 , and in the ensuing thirteen years , 2,500 colonists were landed there , out of whom only 400 whites and 20 negroes remained at the end of that time . On the Island of Orleans , where a settlement was begun in 1717 , the early settlers died by hundreds ; and both settle ments were given up once or twice , by those who began them , and commenced anew by other hands . It was so with Jamestown : it was so with Plymouth , although in a northern climate . They were both desolated by sickness , and the mortality was far greater than it has ever been in Liberia .

It is the moral and mental discipline which God would pre scribe ; it is the discipline , of all others , calculated to throw the human mind upon its own resources to try its strength to call into action its powers , and , if there be energy within it or about it , it will be called into action . It tries its strength its patience its fortitude . In fact all the stern er virtues are created by this scheme of colonization .

He knew they were degraded and debased by mo ral and corporeal bondage . And indeed their debasement we clearly learn from their complaints . He put them to the trials which await colonization . He led them through the howling wilderness . He required them to endure fatigue to meet the enemy s onslaught . In the divine wisdom and mercy they were subjected to these conflicts , dangers and terrors , both by night and by day .

It was founded under the most unfavourable circum stances , those who first composed it , coming from a northern latitude , Nova Scotia , or the streets of London . Besides , bad habits prevailed among them , and did more for their de struction than the climate . 4 Another consideration has been one of interest to me , amidst all discouraging reports concerning the health of the first emigrants : if colonies can be once planted along the shores of Africa , and the slave-trade cut off , a vast sacri fice of life will thereby be prevented .

Fifty thousand deaths every year , occasioned by the slave-trade !

And our Saviour has said * It is more blessed to give than to receive . " They who laid the foundations of the colony at Liberia , will tes tify that they have already reaped a rich reward for all their toils . They will unitedly declare that the blessings now theirs , have a value far beyond the price they cost .

A very sensible address is now before me , adopted " at a numerous meeting of the citizens of Monrovia , " in Li beria , which speaks well to the point . The meeting , it seems , was called , and held at the court-house in Monrovia , in 1827 , " for the purpose of considering the expediency of uniting in an address to the coloured people of the United States .

In the early years of the colony , want of good houses , the great fatigues and dangers of the settlers , their irregular mode of living , and the discouragements they met with , greatly helped the other causes of sickness which prevailed to an alarming extent , and was attended with great mortality .

" The advantage in physical constitution which the blacks will enjoy , is one which will give them decided superiority to all other people as occupants of the soil . The puny and sickly colonies of other nations can never compete with them .

A slaver containEarly /q/ trials of the colony . ing thirty-eight Negroes was captured by one of the United States vessels , and brought into Georgia . The Negroes were , according to law , advertised for sale . The Coloniza tion Society , availing itself of the provisions of the law above referred to , applied for the slaves to be returned to Africa , paid as was necessary the expenses incurred on their account , and rescued the victims of piratical cupidity from perpetual slavery . * Cases of this kind having previously occurred , had di rected the attention of Congress to the necessity of provid ing somewhere an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorizing the President to make such regulations and arrangements as he might deem expedient for their safe-keeping , support , and removal beyond the limits of the United States , and also to appoint a proper per son or persons residing on the coast of Africa , as agent or agents , in the fulfilment of such arrangements in respect to all Negroes seized by United States vessels . It was thought that the ends of this act could be better accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society ; and accordingly , the first expedition to Liberia , in 1820 , was by the Colonization Society and the U. S. Government in con junction . The Elizabeth was chartered , and took to the coast two Government agents , one Colonial agent , and about eighty emigrants , the latter of whom were to be employed at the expense of the Government in preparing accommoda tions for the reception of the recaptured Negroes . This expedition , Sir , you have said , was very unfortu nate in their location , which you said was on the river Sherbro : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 200 miles north of Liberia , and 100 /z/ Ashmun s defence of the colony . miles south of Sierra Leone . It was not until 1822 , that a permanent location was obtained at Cape Mesurado . The colony had much difficulty with the natives at its commencement , had it not ? They had ; and perhaps it has been correctly said that no struggle of ancient or modern times surpasses the defence which that little band of colonists made . The lamented Ashmun , forced in opposition to all his habits and feelings , to become a warlike commander , acquitted himself in a man ner that discovered military skill of the highest order . Without ever aspiring to military renown , he shone forth , a hero in arms , whose coolness , firmness , wisdom , and cou rage could hardly be surpassed . 4 The little band of thirty-five African emigrants , about one half of whom only were engaged in action , were threat ened by a host , whose numbers were untold , and destruc tion seemed inevitable .

The result was the natives were successfully repulsed , and the colony was saved from destruction ; whilst such an impression was made on the natives as to put to rest , pro bably for ever , any thought of a similar attempt .. /q/ Ashmun s death .

Do the colonists pay proper attention to education , and have they any considerable literary advantages ?

In 1830 , the Board established permanent schools in the towns of Monrovia , Caldwell , and Millsburgh . They adopted a thorough system of instruction which is now in successful operation . There are two female schools conducted on libe ral principles , one of which was established by a lady in Philadelphia , who sent out the necessary bocks and teachers . It is said that there is not a child or youth in the colony but is provided with an appropriate school . Some of these schools have valuable libraries .

" A distinguished British naval officer , who passed three years on the African coast , published a favourable notice of the colony , in the Amulet for 1832 , in which he bears this testimony : " The complete success of this colony is a proof that the Negroes are , by proper care and attention , as susceptible of . the habits of industry , and the improvements of social life , as any other race of human beings ; and that the amelioration of the condition of the black people on the coast of Africa , by means of such colonies , is not chimeri cal .

A few colonies of this kind , scattered along the coast , would be of infinite value in improving the natives . " Governor Mechlin has said , " As to the morals of the colonists , I consider them much better than those of the people of the United States ; i. e. you may take an equal number of the inhabitants from any sec tion of the Union , and you will find more drunkenness , more profane swearers and Sabbath - breakers , than in Liberia .

They were certainly not of such a charac  - -  ter as to invalidate or discredit the testimony of the many judicious , impartial , and highly respectable persons who have borne opposite testimony . 1 1 should think , Sir , from what you have told us of the number of the churches in Liberia , that the religious , privi leges of the colony are great . /z/ Religious privileges . 4 Much is done to promote the cause of religion in the co lony , and this seems always to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonization Society . The churches in Liberia are generally well supplied with respectable and faithful ministers . In all these churches there are Sunday schools established , to which the most promising young peo ple in the colony have attached themselves either as teachers or as scholars . The Sunday schools are also furnished with libraries . I have in the pamphlet before me , which was printed in Monrovia , the " minutes of the first Convention of the Li beria Baptist Association , " by which it appears that there are in the colony of Liberia six Baptist churches , compris ing about 220 members , located in the different settlements . These minutes represent th Baptist churches as in a flour ishing condition ; and the proceedings of the convention and their circular to the churches , evince talent , judgment , and piety , of a very respectable order . I will give you one extract from these minutes : " Princes shall come out of Egypt , Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God , is the prediction of a holy prophet , uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when we reflect on the midnight darkness , which , from time immemorial , has shroudod this portion of Africa , we hail with rapture , the first dawning of that glorious gos pel-day which is signified in this oracle . * * * * He , with whom a thousand years is a day , and a day a thousand years , works His own sovereign will , and effects His pur poses of grace and goodness , in a manner above the com prehension of men .

But /q/ Religious privileges . we rejoice that these days are going by . The darkness of ages is yielding to the bright rising of the Sun of righte ousness .

" I have here also the " Report of the Liberia Mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church , and the minutes of their Annual Conference in Liberia in 1835 . " This document is full of interest , and displays the same zeal , energy , and ability which you find generally among the colonists . Of the conference , the report says , " The greatest harmony and peace prevailed during our session , arid it is confidently hoped that this little band of ambassadors for Christ have gone to their respective appointments with increasing zeal in the cause of their Divine Master , and holy resolutions to spend and be spent in the blessed work of winning souls for God . * * * Our love-feast and sacramental occasions were attended by manifestations of the Holy Spirit of God , in the quickening of his children , the conviction and conver sion of souls , anil the spread of Divine truth .

May he who giveth the increase , water the good seed from on high , that it may bring forth abundantly to his eternal glory . " It would seem /z/ Religious privileges . by the minutes that the number of ministers of this deno mination in the colony , was , at the beginning of 1835 , twelve ; and the number of communicants upwards of 200 . The report also speaks of the appointment of a missionary " for the interior of Africa , to carry the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ into the dark regions of this benighted land . " The appointment , it is said , seems to be regarded by the members of the conference with the warmest appro bation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a missionary spirit among the preachers . Several are ready to say , " Here are we , send us . We covet the privilege of carrying the gospel to the heathen tribes . " The Report concludes , " If we are to judge from the appearance of the fields around us , which are already 4 white unto harvest , we should conclude that the set time to favour Zion has come , yea , that now is the accepted time , now is the day of salvation . Men and brethren , help ! O help to disenthral poor bleeding Africa from the hellish grasp of the enemy of all righteousness ! Help to promote the moral and religious prosperity of this infant colony , des tined as it is to be rendered the savour of life unto life to this benighted continent ! " * In a number of the Liberia Herald , which is now before me , dated February 28 , 1836 , I find pleasing evidence of the advancement of the colony in all that is good , and of the rich blessings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the fact that a number of natives who had been brought under the influence of the gospel , and had been for some time communicants in one of the Baptist churches , have been dismissed from that particular church to form a new one in a situation more advantageous to their extended usefulness . I will give you the article announcing this event , as I find it in the Monrovia paper : /q/ Religious privileges . " On Sunday , the 7th inst. , thirty-six native Africans , resi dent at New Georgia , late members of the First Baptist Church in this place , having been dismissed by letters , were brought into visibility as a church , in the place of their resi dence . Sermon by Rev. Dr. Skinner , charge and right hand of fellowship by Rev. H. Teague , and concluding prayer by Rev. A. W. Anderson . The exercises of the occasion were truly solemnly pleasing and impressive . They na turally threw the mind back to the period when they who were thus solemnly dedicating themselves to God , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is to chase the surrounding gloom , were in the darkness of nature , without God , without revelation , and consequently without the hope it inspires . These reflec tions seemed to produce a reaction of the mind , and threw it on an immoveable foundation , the promise that Ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto God . On this cir* cumstance , the mind seemed invited to repose , as an earnest of the full completion of the promise , and earnestly to ejacu late , Lord , let thy kingdom come . I must give you one more extract from the same paper . It is a communication from a correspondent of the Herald , in Monrovia , and relates to the dedication of a Presbyterian church : " Mr. Editor , as every circumstance which has any relation to the spreading of our blessed religion in Africa , must have a tendency to give satisfaction to every lover and follower of the religion of Jesus Christ , you will confer a favour on one of your constant readers by giving publication to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to the service of God on the 26th November , I attended , and was happy to find the prin principal part of the inhabitants of this town present on so inte resting an occasion .

It was enough that the pure religion of Jesus Christ was to be inculcated from that sacred pulpit , and , as that servant of God , the Rev. C. Teage , remarked , that where he then stood preaching the dedication sermon , sixteen years past , the Devil s bush stood . What skeptic could doubt that colonization and missionary enter prise had done much good . The service commenced at 11 o clock , A. M. , by singing a hymn selected for the occasion , and reading the 8th chapter of the 2d book of Kings , by the Pastor , Rev. James Eden ; sermon by Rev. C. Teage ; concluding prayer by Rev. A. D.

Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worship of God , where not long since there was no thing to be heard but the savage yell of the native , or the clinking of the poor slaves chains . /q/
