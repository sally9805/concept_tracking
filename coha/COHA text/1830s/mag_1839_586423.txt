txt This document is certainly a*ery able production , and fully merits the high euloginins which were promptly pronounced upom it by the liberal press of England on its first appearance . It* were an ungracious task , and on* for which . we have but little in*-clination , to attempt to discriminate nicely , in bestowing this general meed of praise , between the osteesible and , possibly if not probably , the real authors of the Report . It is well known , indeed , that Lord Durham had attached to his commission , in the most confidential relation of advisers and assistants , two or three gentlemen of most consummate ability , as well as of that enlarged and liberal tone of political sentiment which characterizes the present Radical party of England , and which is remarkably transparent through the pages of this document . O*'ie of whom , Mr. Turton-whose name is unfortunately darkened nevertheless by an act of domestic immorality which no splendor of abilities can ever redeem , in that healthful mural sense of the eommunity which , at the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that public opinion in which public men live , move , and have their being-has recently re*eived from Lord Brougham , in the House of Lords , a testimonial of eulogy to his distinguished abilities and general integrity of character , which , from such a source , is praise indeed . It is impossible , . of course , to ascertain the exact proportions in which the credit of the authorship of this production , which is the general r6svm* an*i sum total of the whole expedition , is to be distributed between the different individuals whose proper office anl duty it was to assist in its production . It is certainly a much abler work , and marked by a much more expansive and liberal view of the principles *vhici*j have been at work to bring the Canadas to their present miserable pass , than , from his private reputation and his actual course as Governor General , we should have supposed Lord Durham capable of . IIo*vever , we have no desire to pry behind the scenes into the mysteries of the coetlisscs and the greenroom ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old maxim of law , that de no*i apparcntibus ct de non cxistcntibus cao*cm c3t ratio ; and will therefore say , the more cheerfully , as we have formerly somewhat strongly expressed our distrust of him , that Lord Durham appearsj by this production , a statesman of a high order , of a strong and * Report on the Affairs of British North America , from the Earl of Durham , her Majesty 's high Commissioner , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c .

It will place him in a very favorable atti ' - tude relatively to the liberal party at home ; and if he should yet turn out to be the iaan for the noble and brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peaceful , civil revolution iii which it is engaged , it will do more than the whole previous course of his public life , to elevate him to that position by proving his competency for it . We have read the Report with the deepest attention , and with great satisfaction at the full and authoritative testimony which it *oears to the general correctness of the views heretofore expressed by the Democratic Review in relation to the Canadas , their pa5t history and future prospects . We by no means regard it as free Trom imperfections , and recognize in it more than one marked trace of British prejudice , and of the " offi*ial " influence by which Lord *Durham was surrounded in the Canad as , and 1ry which his actual conduct in his government , however disposed he may have been to keep hims*If aloof from and above it , was , in point of fac't , substantially controlled . It is easy , however , to take these parts with the due allowance ; and , with suc:h ample materials of facts and sound views as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very " portions in which we can observe the imperfections and errors naturally consequent upon these influences , additional confirmation of the general truths to which , as already remarked , it bears so signal and satisfactory a testimony . In addition to the beneficial influence itis calculated to produceat home , we hope , too , that it - will not be without its useful effect , en this side of the water , i'n putting to shame the flippant ignorance , and the selfish i4libcrality , which have been so disgracefully exhibited , by a large portion of the American press , in their discourses upon the " pretended grievances " of the Canadians , under the " free and paternal gor*crnment " of the English ascendency . But , before proceeding to any remarks upon it , it will doubtless be acceptable to our readers that we should lay before them as brief an analysis and summary of the document itself as will suffice to place them in possession of its s*ibstance ; since its great l'ength ' ( making'a document of a hundred and twenty df @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pdnted ) must make it accessible only to br*t a very fe*v equa'l to the underta'king of encountering a state paper of such formidable dimensions . It has not moreover been reprinTted in this country , strangely enough we must say , considering the political importance of'the document and the interest of the subject to so large a portion of contiguous territory , and the huge amount w*f'Englishtras1i with whic'h we are daily crammed by our ptibiishers. // The Report is divided into several distinct portions , under the following titles : 1st , Lower Canada ; *d , Upper Canada ; 3d , the Eastern Provinces and Newfoundland ; 4th , Disposal of Public Lands* 5th , Emigration ,  --  followed by a general co nclusion , recapitulating the outlines of the groundalready gone over , and developing the plan of re-organization of the colonies which he proposes* as the only possible remedy for the accumulated disorders which have grown out of a long course of misgovernment , dating back from the conquest of the country .. To the whole is added an Appendix , of *ipwards of sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public bodies to Lord Durham on the occasion of his retirement . 1 .. In the portion relating to Lrnver Canada , . the Report sets out with the statement , that the struggle which has so long agitated the Province is not a mere political contest between the people and government , as he had supposed . Bad as the institurons of the Province were , and serious as were those " defects , in the spirit and prac* tice of the administration in every department of the government , that were quite sufficient to account for a great degree of mismanagement and dissatisfaction , " yet for the peculiar and ' disastrous dissensions of this Provir*ce , . he soon became satisfied that there existed " a far deeper and more efficient cause ,  --  a cause which penetrated beneath its political institutions into its social state ,  --  * -- a cause which no reform of constitution or laws , that should leave the elements of society unaltered , could remove ; but which must be removed , ere any success could be expected in any attempt to remedy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says ' Lord IJurham , " to find a contest between a government and a people . I found two nations warring in the bosom of a single State ; I found a struggle , not of principles , but of races ; and I perceived that it would be idle to attempt any amelioration of laws or institutions , until we could first succeed in terminating the deadly animosity that now separates the inhabitan'fs of Lower Canada into the ' hostile divisions of French and English . " He then devotes a large portion of the reoprt to the object of proving and illustrating this position . He says that this national hostility is not a ' mere aggravation of political discontents ; but that all ' the ' particular dissensions that ari'se are but forms of this constant and all-pervading quarrel ; and that every contest is on'e of French and English in the outset , or becomes so era it has run its course . He acknowledges that it is only of late years that this national hostility has assumed its permanent influence ; that " the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their English , while those of some of the most unpopular supporters of the Government denote their French , origin ; and that the representatives , , if n*a of // an actual majority , ( as has occasionally been asserted , ) at any rate of a large proportion of the purely English population , have been found constantly voting with the majority of the Assembly against what is called the British party . " But he considers that such results have been chiefly produced by temporary and local causes ; and that the tendency of the English population has been constantly increasing towards the suppoi* of the Government , the ancient English leaders of the popular party , one by one , falling off from the majority , and every election in the eastern townships adding to the " English minority . " It should here be observed , however , that Lord Durham is not able , even in these townships , " removed , " as he styles them , " from all contact with the French , " to give to the Government party any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurrection , " as he terms it , " of 1837 , has completed the division ; and since the resort to arms the two races have been , he says , distinctly and completely arrayed against each other , no portion of the English population being backward in taking arms in defence of the Government , and no portion of the Canadian population being allowed to do so , from the certainty that they would turn them against it . The report then proceeds to draw a general outline of the long civil struggle of parties , based , as he states , on the ground of this national animosity  --  a ground which both parties , he says , disclaim , as " too revolting to the notions of good sense and charity prevalent in the civilized world . " And Lord Durham undertakes to draw a nice distinction , to which it is very difficult to yield assent , between the means and the objects of the respective parties . The French Canadians , he says , " being a majority , have invoked the principles of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sympathy of liberal politicians in every quarter of the world . The English , finding their opponents in collision with the Government , have raised the cry of loyalty and attachment to British connexion , and denounced the republican designs of the French , whom they designate , or rather used to designate , by the appellation of Radicals . " " The French majority asserted the most Democratic doctrines of the rights of a numerical majority . The English minority availed itself of the protection of the prerogative , and allied itself with all those of the colonial institutions which enabled the few to resist the will of the many . But , " continues the Report , " when we look to the object of each party , the analogy to our politics seems to be lost , if not actually reversed ; the French appear to have used their Democratic arms for Conservative purposes , rather than those of liberal and enlightened movement ; and the sympathies of the friends of reform are naturally enlisted on the side of sound amelioration , which the English minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Province. ** // What is this , but the old threadbare excuse of all aristocracies and *oligarchies for resisting the demand of popular reform ? The instance which he cites in illustration of this assertion , is the Assembly 's refusal to establish registry offices , and to commute the feudal tenures ; yet at the same time he acknowledges that it was among the ablest and most influential leaders of the English that he found some of the opponent*of both the proposed reforms ; that the leaders of the French were anxious to disclaim any hostility to these reforms themselves , the reluctance heretofore exhibited by the Assembly to entertain these questions beins* but the result of the " extraordinary influence " over it of Mr. Papineau ; that the mass of the French population strongly desired them , and that these very reforms were among the prominent objects held out as popular inducements by the leaders of the late insurrectionary move* ments . From these double " inconsistencies " Lord Durham does not derive the inference , that the representations by which he found himself surrounded , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might possibly be unjust ; but merely an evidence and illustration of the favorite idea which he has ( very erroneously in our opinion ) made his point of departure . " I can not but think , " he remarks , " that many , both of the supporters and the opponents , cared less for the measures themselves , than for the handle which the agitation of them gave to their national hostility ; that the Assembly resisted these charges chiefly because the English desired them ; and that the eagerness with which many of the English urged them was stimulated by finding them oppose ( l by the French . " He describes the main body of the English population as enterprising , industrious , intelligent , active , and , though constantly pro* fessing a somewhat extravagant loyalty and high prerogative doctrines , yet as composing " a very independent , but very manageable , and sometimes a rather turbulent Democracy " - " very determined on maintaining in their own person a great respect for popular rights , tind singularly ready to enforce their wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And with respect to the comparative national conditions of the two , he says : " The ascendency which an unjust favoritism had contributed to give to the En*-lish race in the government and legal profession , their own superior energy , skill , and capital , secured to them in every branch of industry . They have developed the resources of the country ; they have constructed or improved its means of communication ; they have created its internal and foreign commerce . The entire wholesale , and a large portion of the retail trade of the Province , with the most profitable and flourishing farms , are now in the hands of this namcrical minority of the population . " He represents the Canadians as " an utterly uneducated and singularly inert popiYlation , implicitly obeying leaders who ruled them by the influence of a blind confidence and narrow national prejudices " - " mild and kindly , frugab industrious , and honest ; very // sociable , cheerful and hospitable , and distinguished for a courtesy and real politeness , which pervades every class of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - " an old and stationary society , in a new and progressive world . " At the same time , he ascribes the responsibility of this state of things , so far as it may be true , to " the continued negligence of the British Government , " which " has left the mass of the people without any of the institutions which would have elevated them in freedom and civilization " - which " has left them , without the education , and without the institutions of local self-government , that would have assimilated their character and habits , in the easiest and best way , to those of the Empire of which they became a part . " There exists among them a remarkable equality of properties and conditions . " A few seignorial families possess large , though not often very valuable properties ; the class entirely dependent on wages is very small ; the bulk of the population is composed of the hard-working yeomanry of the country districts , commonly called hctbitans , and their connexions engaged in other occupations . " Among these he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of education . " " The common assertion , however , that all classes of the Canadians are equally ignorant , is perfectly erroneous " - for , he says , he knows no people among whom the higher kinds of elementary education are really extended to a larger proportion of the population ; so that on a comparison of the two portions of the population it has resulted , even now , that , although the leaders of the British party possess " a practical sagacity , tact , and energy in politics , " in which their opponents are said to be " deplorably deficient , " yet " the greater amount of refinement , of speculative thought , and of the knowledge that books can give , " the Report is forced to admit , " is , with some brilliant exceptions , to be found among the French*****the countrymen and brethren of these much * In this place we take pleasure in recording a passing tribute of admiration to the distinguished accomplishments of a gentleman who has been made the object of a great deal of flippant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press  --  and our readers need not be told to how large * proportion of the Whig press , especially of our commercial cities , this designation is properly applicable . We refer to Mr. PAP1NEAU , who by common consent may be regarded as the representative of the French Canadian population . From some considerable opportunity of knowledge and personal jud*meat , we are fully justified in saying , that Mr. Papi* neau is one of the first men of the times . Amiable , polished , and courteous , his acquisitions are on a par with his eminent natural power and capacity of intellect . It is difficult to start a subject of conversation , in any department of literature , science , or politics , on which he does seem peculiarly qualified to shine  --  and that not l ) y the slightest seemin* effort or decire for display , but as luminous bodies shine , in all directions , simply because such is the law of their nature . His lan ua e is ( in the English , as much as his native tongue ) remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural ; renderin him with the vigorous clearn ess of the tide of thou ht which flows transparently through his conversation , one of the most eloquent and persuasive of speakers . When to these attributes we add // abused Canadians . For this , little thanks are due to the British Government ; but to " the piety and benevolence of the early French possessors of the country , " who founded in the seminuries and colleges established in the cities , and in other central points , institutions of which the well-endowed means have been actively directed , in the hands of the Catholic clergy , to the promotion of education , and whi* turn out every year between two and three hundred highly educated young men . Almost all of these are members of the family of some habitan , selected for superior quickness for a superior education ; who return to their families , and (  --  the military and naval professions , and every avenue of civil ambition , being closed to the colonist- ) contribute to swell the already vastly over-stocked professions of advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds the solution of what he terms " the extraordinary influence of the Canadian demagogues , - Thus the persons of most education in every village belong to the same families and the same original station in life , as the illiterate habitan whom I have described . They are connected with them by all the associations of early youth , and the ties of blood . The most perfect equality always marks their intercourse , and the superior in education is separated by no barrier of manners , or pride , or distinct interests , from the sin*ularly ignorant peasantry by which he is surrounded . He combines , therefore , the influences of superior knowledge and social equality , and wields a power over the mass , which I do not believe that the educated class of any other portion of the world possess . To this singular state of things I attribute the extraordinary influence of the Cnnadian demagogues . The most uninstructed population any where trusted with political power is thus placed in the hands of a small body of instructed persons , in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a community of interests , could generate . Over the class of persons , by whom the peasantry are thus led , the Government has not acquired or ever labored to acquire influence ; its members have been thrown into opposition by the system of exclusion , long prevalent in the colony ; and it is by great simplicity and kindness , both of character and manners  --  a perfect purity of domestic life  --  a rare generosity and philosophic candor towards his opponents , as remarkably transparent in his conversation under circumstances little calculated to foster such a tone of sentiment-an earnest patriotism-an incorruptible integrity , both of private and public character-all the severe virtue ( to quote an expression of one who was no blindly partial judge ) of a Cato , with a mind deeply imbued with the spirit of the liberal political philosophy of the age-we shall not be surprised at what Lord Durham styles " the extraordinary influence " such a man has been able for many years to exert in the Assembly of Lower Canada ; though it by no means follows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make the same individual exactly the man for a physical revolution . It was the remark of a distinguished American Senator , founded on an acquaintance dating many years back , that he had never met with a foreigner so thoroughly conversant with the history , the literature , the principles and the men of our American politics , as Mr. Papineau ; and we may here allude , in passing , to the fact that Mr. Papinean 's opinions fully sustain and sympathize with the general policy of the late and present Democratic Administrations , with which he is very familiar , and especially in the great atm * , gle for a financial reform , vitally important to the best interests , moral and material , of the country , in which both have been so deeply engaged . // their agency that the leaders of the Assembly have been enabled hitherto to move as one mass , in whatever direction tbey thougbt proper , the simple and ductile population of the country . The entire neglect of education by the Government has thus , more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to invest the agitator with the power which he wields against the law and the public tranquillity . " On this subject of education , the testimony of Lord Durham fastens a scalding responsibility on the long course of British Colonial misrule , which has produced a res*lt of general popular ignorance so little in accordance with either the natural tendency or capacity of the native population . That the Canadians are not in fault , is evident from his own admissions . " The people themselves , " he says " are not indifferent , or opposed to such a scheme , " ( the establishment of a general and sound system of education . ) " I was rejoiced that there , existed among the French population a very general and a great desire to provide means for giving their children those advantages which had been denied to themselves , " and " the population of either origin would be willing to submit to local assessments for this purpose . " The following is all the credit which he is able to give the Government for what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of legislation : " I am grieved to be obliged to remark , that the British Government has , since its possession of this province , done or even attempted nothing for the promotion of general education . Indeed the only matter in which it has appeared in connexion with the subject , is one by no means creditable to it . For it has applied the Jesuits ' estates , part of the property destined for purposes of education , to supply a species of fund for secret service , and for a number of years it has maintained an obstinate struggle with the assembly in order to continue this misappropriation . " The following extract sheds a strong light upon the origin and growth of that " national hostility " of which he treats , again casting on the " British ascendancy " a disgraceful responsibility for all the consequences of disorder , with even the mutual errors and wrongs on points of detail which naturally grow out of such civil discussions : Among this people , the progress of emigration has of late years introduced an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as those of the most enterprising of every class of our countrymen . The circumstances of the early colonial administration excluded the native Canadian from power , and vested all offices of trust and emolument in the hands of strangers of English origin . The highest posts in the law were confined to the same class of persons . The functionaries of the civil government , together with the officers of the army , composed a kind of privileged class , occupying the first place in the community , and excluding the higher class of the natives from society , as well as from the government of their own country . It was not till within a very few years , as was testified by persons who had seen much of the country , that this society of civil and military functionaries ceased to exhibit towards the higher order of Canadians an exclusiveness of demeanor , which was more revolting to a sensitive and polite people than the monopoly of power and profit : nor was this national favoritism discontinued , until after repeated complaints and an angry contest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The races had become enemies ere a tardy justice was extorted : and even then the Government discovered a mode of // June , Lord Durham 's Report . distributing its patronage among the Canadians , which was quite as offensive to that people as their previous exclusion . " He then proceeds to illustrate further this point of " national hostility " by the separate education of youth  --  the difference of language , leaving both parties subject to much misconception and misrepresentation of each other  --  the almost total absence of social intercourse between the races  --  the extreme rarity of intermarriages ( though formerly this was not the case )  --  a marked division of society , preventing the conflicting opinions which divide it from coming into direct contact , in political personal controversies-and the total want of combination for public objects . " They can not harmonize , " says the Report , " even in associations of charity . The only public occasion on which they ever meet is in the jurybox ; and there they meet only to the utter obstruction of justice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the bulk of the English population and the " Officials , " as the clique is termed , which has been from time immemorial in possession of the Executive Government ; and he thus states the cause which has thrown them into a singular alliance . The Assembly were thought to exhibit a jealousy of the influx and success of the English ; anti instead of promoting emigration , enterprise and the accumulation of wealth , rather to incline to cast obstacles in their way . The English were for urging on extensive schemes of interual improvement , as the first object to which all the efforts of legislation should direct themselves ; while the Assembly refused to increase the burthens of the country by imposing taxes to meet such proposed expenditures , or to direct to that object any of the funds formerly devoted to other purposes . Some of the works , indeed , which the assembly authorized and encouraged , were undertaken on a scale of due moderation , and successfully perfected . But to the great work of rendering the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa navigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , an invincible repugnance-though , the Report continues : " It is true that there was considerable foundation for their objections to the plan on which the Legislature of Upper Canada had commenced some of these works , and to the mode in which it had carried them on ; but the English complained , that , instead of profiting by the experience which they might have derived from this source , the Assembly seemed only to make its objections a pretext for doing nothing . The applications for banks , railroads and canals were laid on one side until some general measures could be adopted with regard to such undertakins ; but the general measures thus promised were never passed , and the particular enterprises in question were prevented . The adoption of a registry was refused on the alleged ground of its inconsistency with the French institutions of the Province , and no measure to attain this desirable end , in a less obnoxious mode , was prepared by the leaders of the Assembly . The feudal tenure was supported , as a mild and just pro-. vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assurance given by a committee of the Assembly , that some step should be taken to remove the most injurious incidents of their seignor al tenure , produced no practical results ; and the enterprises of the English were still thwarted by the obnoxious laws of the country . " // The Assembly being at the same time in collision with the Exe*utive Government , the latter gladly threw itself on this powerful and energetic minority ; who combined with it from perfectly different motives , and with perfectly different objects , against a common enemy . " The English desired reform and liberal measures from the Assembly , which refused them , while it was urging other reforms and demanding other liberal measures from the Executive Governm*t . The Assembly complained of the oppressive use of the power of the Executive ; the En , , lish complained that they , a minority , suffcred under the oppressive se to which power was turned by the French majority . Thus a bold asid intelli , , ent Democracy was impelled , by itS mmpatience for liberal measures , joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 5overnment which was at issue with the majority on the question of popular ri , , hts . The actual conflict commenced by a collision between the Executive and the French majority : and as ( he English population rallied round the Government , supported its pretensions , and designated themselves by the appellation of " loyal , " the causes of the quarrel were naturally supposed to be much more simple than they really were ; and the extent of the division which existed among the inhabitants of Lower Canada , the number and nature of the combatants arrayed on each side , and the irremediable nature of the dispute , were concealed from the public view . ' And after the armed collision into which the two races have been brought , * with all " the melancholy scenes exhibited in the progress of the contest , or the fierce passions which held an unchecked sway during the insurrection , or immediately after its suppression , " the following is the picture which he draws of the present relative attitudes of the two portions of the population : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country , they brood in sullen silence over the memory oftheir fallen countrymen , of their burnt villages , of their ruined property , of their extinguished ascendency , and of their humbled nationality . To the Government and the English they ascribe these wrongs , and nourish against both an indiscriminatin and eternal animosity . Nor have the English inhabitants forgotten in their triumph the terror with which they suddenly saw themselves surrounded by an insurgent majority , and the incidents which alone appeared to save them from the unchecked domination of their antagonists . They find themselves still a minority in the midst of a hostile and organized people ; ap * Lord Durham calls this collision a " treasonable attempt of the French party to carry its political objects into effect by an appeal to arms . " This , we are satisfied , is entirely unjust and untrue . It is true that events were rapidly ripening towards that consummation , and this whole Report teems with abundant evidence of accumulated misgovernment and oppression on the part of the British ascendency fully to justify the resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bt of insurrection , " to cast off so burthensome and gallihg a thraldom of foreign dominion . But we have amply shown , in our former Articles on this subject , that it is smpoa time Government party that the responsibility of the outbreak of November , 1837 , properly rests , There was no contemplation og and not the slightest preparation for , an immediate " appeal to arms . " This is an all-important point in the consideration of this general subject , and we beg our readers to bear it fully in mind . We have met with no attempts entitled to notice , to controvert the evidence and statements , establishing this point , contained in our former Articles , and therefore are not called upon at present for any further illustration of it , but are entitled to assume it as proved and established . // prehensions of secret conspiracies and sanguinary designs haunt them unceasin*ly , and their only hope of safety is supposed to rest on systematically terrifying and disabling the French , and in preventing a majority of that race from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the province . " * * * * " Never again will the present generation of French Canadians yield a loyal submission to a British Government ; never again will the English population tolerate the authority of a House of Assembly , in which the French shall possess or even approximate to a majority . " And with respect to the mat*rial condition of the Province , he speaks of the tranquillity and happiness of families destroyed-the value of property alarmingly depreciated  --  the improvement and settlement of the country arrested  --  a great diminution of the wealth of the country and of the public revenue  --  the importation of grain for domestic consumption , instead of its exportation as formerly-a general insecurity both of person and property-  --  a paralysis of a large portion of the industry and capital oC the coun try -- and a great diminution of the influx of emigrants , once so con siderable . In 1832 the number of emigrants who landed at the port of Quebec amounted to 52,000 ; in 1837 it had fallen to 22,000 ; and in 1838 it did not amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain of emigration from the Province to the United States . The animosity thus generated , he states that there is not the slightest chance of putting an end to , during the present generation . it has entirely overcome their ancient national antipathy to the people of the United States , and he has no doubt " that an invading American army might rely on the coOperation of almost the entire French population of Lower Canada . " The Report also admits " the growth of an alarming state of feeling among the English population " themselves-  --  a dissatisfaction with home the government , and a jealousy of every measure of clemency or even justice tow*srds their opponents , " as indicating a disposition towards that conciliatory policy which is the subject of their angry recollection ; for they feel that , being a minority , any return to the due course of constitutional government would again subject them to a French majority ; "  --  and notwithstanding the late exasperation of the Canadian loyalists against the American people and government , there is " a strong under-current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the English population are disposed to contemplate with great favor an annexation to our Union , confident that the influx of American emigration would soon give the predominance to the English race , as in Louisiana , and that they and their posterity would share in that amazing progress , and that great material prosperity which every day 's experience shows them is the lot of the people of the United States . " The evils of this conflict of races have been aggravated by the conduct of the Government . Liberal institutions and a prudent // policy would at any rate have softened its character , and brought it more speedily to a more decisive and peaceful conclusion . " Un* happily , however , " cays the Report , " the system of Government pursued in Lower Canada has been imsed on the policy of perpetuating that very separation of the races , and encouraging those very notions of conflicting nationalities which it ought tohave been the first and chief care of Government to check and extinguish " - and thus we again return to Bri*sh colonial misgovernment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of arresting the further dismemberment of the Empire , it became the policy of the Government " to isolate the inhabitants of the British from those of the revolted colonies ; and " to cultivate the nationality of the French Canadians , as a means of perpetual and entire separation from their neighbors , " and at the same time " to break them down as much as possible into petty isolated communities . " The French language , laws , and religious institutions were retained ; all grants of land , even to the refugee loyalists , and the military bounties , were directed to be made in ilef and seigniory , and Canada was divided into two Provinces  --  the settled portioa being allotted to tbe French , and the unsettled being destined to become the seat of British colonization . And " thus , " continues the Report ,  --  " Instead of availing itself of the means which the extent and nature of the Province afforded for the gradual introduction of such an English population into its various parts as might have easilyplaced the French in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority , and recognized and strengthened their distinct national character . Had the sounder pQlicy of making the Province English , in all its institutions , been adopted from the first , and steadily persevered in , the French would probably have been speedily outnumbered , and the beneficial operation of the free iastitutions of England woukd never have been impeded by the animosities of origin. ** The subsequent course of *Government has been calculated to multiply and aggravate the evils of which it thus so carefully planted and fostered the seed . It has been a series of inconsistencies and vacillations , fruitful of the most pernicious conseq*icnces , with alternate concessions to the contending races , irritating both , impairing its own authority , and , by keeping alive the hopes of a French nationality-at the same time that it brought an influx of English emigration into direct contact with it , even in the province allotted to the French , without any pc'ovision for an easy and natural **26;1158;TOOLONG the influences which might , ere this , have brought the quarrel to its natural and necessary termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this which he makes his cardinal idea , in relation to Lower Canada .

This has long been a favorite idea with the Government party in Lower Canada , both as a supposed justifica-* tion of its hostile policy towards the French majority , and as calculated to unite the whole insu*gent population under the banner of Anglo-Saxon nationality , at tYte same time to secure the sympathy and support of the English people and the Home Government . They have succeeded in impressing it upon Lord Durham ; though we must say that , in his elaborate development of this idea , he appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we see the Englishman ' , and the good old English prejudice and pride , which no superadded cosmopolitan liberality , of a political school but little congenial to a proud English aristocrat , can ever overcome , though it may attempt to disperse it . He was the rather induced , probably , to fall in with this idea , as affording a tolerable middle ground from which he might venture to pronounce on the Government party all the severe condemnation with which the report abounds , without carrying with it that full force of personal condemnation which their manifest gross misconduct and misrule would properly deserve . But ingenious as are his efforts to impose upon himself and the British public with this idea , it is apparent , on the face of the report itself , that he is committing the error common to many more superficial inquirers than the author of this document , of confounding between the consequences of misrule and the cause of public disorder . His own partial consciousness of the difficulty of the task of thus persuading either himself or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of this part of the subject . Positive as he declares his conviction to be of the truth of this idea , yet still , after all , he feels compelled to add : " It is impossible to determine precisely the respective effects of the social and political causes . The struggle between the Government and the Assembly has aggravated the animosities of race , and the animosities of race have rendered the political difference irreconcileable . " And again , the implied acknowledgment that the " national animosity " was but the consequence of a long course of oppressive misgovernment , peeps forth in the admission that " that contest has arisen by degrees , " and that it was " not until the development of representative Government had placed substantial power in the hands of the people , that that people divided itself into races , arrayed against each other in intense and eudurino ' animosity. " a Now who is there that is acquainted with the history of Ireland but has seen the same causes producing similar effects to those which we witness to-day in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Government made two classes  --  the oppressed // and the oppressors . " Protestant ascendancy " was the shibboleth there , as " British ascendancy " is the shibboleth in the Lower Province , and the same state of things followed in Ireland that Lord Durham describes to exist in the country he has just left . Protestants and Catholics neither ate together , nor drank together , nor intermarried . They seldom or never met in the same political assembly , nor in the same church , nor in the same social circle , nor at the same charity . In the*ords of the report already quoted , " the only public occasion on which they ever came together was in the jury room , and they met there only to the utter obstruction of justice . " But the moment political and legal inequality began to be removed , this unfriendly disposition also began to disappear , and its continuance steadily keeps pace with the existence of those partial enactments which first engendered it . That difference of race can not be the cause of all the hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turn our eyes on Louisiana . There the same " races " exist , but even Lord D. himself admits that there is no rancorous feeling between them . Why ? Because the law has made no distinction between then . The accident of language is no recommendation or disqualification for office . The same observation will apply to several portions of the Union , especially to Pennsylvania and Ohio , where a large , if not a preponderating portion of the population is German , many of whom do not even speak* the English language . Yet difference of race has never formed the basis on which public justice or public patronage is distributed ; for it has long since been wisely concluded in this country that the authorities have no more to do with the language a citizen pleases to speak , than with the creed he chooses to profess , or the color of the coat he prefers to wear , further than to provide him the means of instruction in that tongue with which he is most familiar , and to enable him to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the language with which he is acquainted . Lord Durham himself is forced to acknowledge , somewhat in contradiction with his first impressions we allow , that the difference of race , on which he harps so much , after all , goes for very little in producing the general disorganization which he has depicted . He says : " It is impossible to observe tbe great similarity of the constitutions established in all our North American Provinces , and the striking tendency of all to terminate in pretty nearly tbe same result , without entertaining a belief that some defect in the form of Government , and some erroneous principle of administration , have been common to all : the hostility of the races beia* palpably insuj/icient to account for all the evils which have affected Lower Canada , inasmuch as nearly the same results have been exhibited among the homogeneous population of the other Provinces . It is hut too evident that Lower Canada , or the two Canadas , have not alone exhibited repeated conflicts between the executive and the popular branches of the Legislature . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , hostile to the policy of the Government ; the most serious diseontents have only recently been // June* , calmed in New Brunswick and Prince Edward 's Island. * The Government is still ' , I believe , in a minority in the lower House in Nova Scotia , i and the dissensions of Newfoundland are hardly less violent than those of the Canadas . It may be fdrly said , that the natural state of Government , in all the colonies , is that of collision between the executive and representative body . In all of them the administration of public affairs is habitually confined ' to those who de not codperate harmoniously with the popular branch of the Legislature , and the Government is constantly proposing measures which the majority of the Assembly reject , and refusing to assent to bills which that body has p*sed . " Our space will not permit us to carry our readers through the historical sketch . which Lord Durham then presents of the rise and progress of the long civil struggle between the Government and Assembly ; * in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , the power properly jnherent in a representative popular assembly , of controlling the public revenue , which it attained , after a long and ( lesperate struggle , in 1832 . Yet still with this came not the slightest control over the colonial Government , or over the nomination of a single one of the public officers by whom the policy of its Legislature was to be carried into execution . The different Governors who came out fell , as a matter of course and of necessity , under the entire control of the established " official influence , " and were speedily brought into angry collision with the Assembly , and thus continues the report : " Thus , every successive year consolidated and enlarged the strength of the ruling party . Fortified by family connexion5 and the common interest felt by nfl who held and all who desired subordinate offices , that party was thus erected into a solid and permanent power , controlled by no responsibility , subject to no serious change , exercisin* over the whole government of the Province an authority utterly tndepo ndent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only means of influencin * , either the Government at home , or the colonial representatives of th' Crown.7 He thus sums up his views of the course and conduct of the Assembly : " From the commencement , therefore , to the end of the disputes which mark the whole Parliamentary history of Lower Canada , I look on the conduct of the Assembly as a constant warfare with the Executive , for the purpose of obtaining the powers inherent in a representative body by the very nature of representative government . It was to accomplish this purpose that it used every means in its ppwer ; but it must be censured for having , in pursuit of this object , perverted its powers of le islation , and disturbed the whole working of the constitution . It made the busi * The discontents on P. E. Island are not yet calmed . The Assembly of that Province passed last February , by a majority of three to one , a report insisting en the necessity of rendering the Legislative Council of the island elective  --  a demand which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of the Canadian constitution . I The Governor and Assembly of Nova Scotia have recently quarrelled on the old subject , money matters . The representatives have , in consequence , been petulantly , in the old fashion , sent about their business . As we write , moreover , intelligence has been received from England , that the Ministry have resolved on disfranchising the a , icient and loyal colony of Jamaica , and have actually brought in a bill to suspend the functions of the Legislature for five years , and to " governs ' the island by royal commissioners in.the interim* // *iess of legislation , and the practical improvement of the country , subordinate to its struggle for power , and , being denied its legitimate privileges , it endeavored to extend its authority in modes totally incompatible with the principles of constitutional liberty . " Whether the Assembly was not perfectly right in this " strug*Ie for power , " and of availing itself of every possible expedient , and of every constitutional form , even to the point of what their opponents would term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we imagine , be two opinions among our readers . The conflict with the Executive Government embraced of course the Legislative Council , of which the majority was always composed of members of the party which conducted the Exectitive Government , and of which Lord Durham frankly admits that its composition was " such *s could give it no weight with the people , " and that it " was practically hardly any thing but a veto in the hands of public functionaries on all the acts of that popular branch of the Legislature in which they were always in a minority . This veto ; " he rather pithily adds , " they used without much scruple . " The instances which he cites of the " systematic abuse of constitutional forms " are , first , an attempt to give the force of law to the resolutions of the Assembly , by declaring the seat of a member who had been appointed an executive Councillor to be vacated , though the Legislative Council had rejected a bill passed by it to operate generally to vacate the seats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly , the habitual practice of " tackino " together , under one enactment , bills which they expected to be thus " vetoed , " with other bills of necessity ; and in the renewal of expiring laws ; - of including in one and the same bill all those acts , and those acts only , which it approved , and compelling the Council and Governors either to accept or reject the whole , without choice or discrimination ; thirdly , the practice of the dispersion of the members to their homes , towards the close of every recent session , so as to break up the quorum without waiting to be prorogued , immediately after sending tip a number of bills to the Council , leaving it no opportunity of proposing amendments , and no option but that of rejecting or confirming by wholesale the measures of the Assembly ; fourthly , the alleged abuses of Legislative power in the distribution of money for works of public improvement , which , in the total absence of local municipal institutions , depend entirely upon the colonial Legislature . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political patronage , and as a menus of obtaining influence over constituencies-hostile counties being tempted or coerced into submission to the policy of the majority by the impossibility of procuring necessary improvements on any other terms . Upon this charge , which Lord Durham does not endorse , he merely remarks , that " whether it be true or false that the abuse was ever carried to such a pitch , it is obviously one which might have been easily and // safely perpetrated by a person possessing Mr. Papineau 's influence in the Assembly . " The grants for education constituted also , it is said , another bold and extensive attempt for erecting a system of patronage independent of the Government . The amount thus dispensed was about ? 25,000 per annum , equal to nearly half the ordinary civil expenditure of the Province . For refusing to renew the act regulating these , and for thus suddenly stopping upwards of one thousand schools , and depriving of education no less than forty thousand scholars , the Legislative Council have been most severely reproached . Lord Durham justifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds by the county members , in whose hands the superintendence and patronage of these schools had been , by the expired law , vested-that there was no accountability-and that , as there existed no sufficient supply of teachers in the Province , they filled up the appointments with persons utterly and obviouslv incompetent  --  and that the whole system was , in fine , a gross political abuse , the appointments being jobbed by the members among their political partizans . We leave it to our readers , without remark , to judge of the sufficiency of such alleged partizan reasons by an avowed oligarchy , engaged in a hostile struggle with the great mass of a people , for thus suddenly , at one general sweep , arresting the education of the whole population against whom they are accustomed to charge their " ignorance " as the head and front of their offending-even conceding their truth , which it ; earnestly denied on the other side . He then proceeds to describe the state of thorough disorganiza .. tion of all the institutions of the Province , consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest for power , remarking that*C The time which should have been devoted to wise legislation , was spent in a contest for power between the Executive aud the people , which a wise Executive would have stopped at the outset , by submitting to a legitimate responsibility , and which a wise people would have ceased to press , when it had virtually obtained it end . " This is certainly very true , while it conveys , at the same time , a severe censure to the Government , and a virtual acquittal of the Assembly from the responsibility of these unhappy consequences of perpetual and embittered civil dissensions ; for Lord Durham throughout fully admits , that the latter never did " attain its end " of compelling the Government to " submit to a legitimate responsibility . " The defective system of Government , from the effects of which the Province is now so severely suffering , commences at the very source of power . " The fact is , " says Lord Durham , " according to the present system , there is no real representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it literally no power which originates and cotAucts the Executive Government . " We ofLen hear of " his // 1839.1 Lord Durham 's Report . excellency the Governor-in-chief , " but " he is in fact a mere subordinate officer , " receiving his orders from another subordinate , in some back office , in some back street in London , who never saw the unfortunate colony over which he is suddenly called to preside , and is " disqualified " for the office be is called on to fill , " first , by want of local information , and very often , " adds Lord Durham , " by an entire absence of all acqu*ntance with the business of civil Government . " From the difficulties of the position in which the Governor is thrown , it naturally " has been the tendency of the local Government to settle every thing by reference to the colonial Government in Downing street . " And the following bears Lord Durham 's testimony to those advantages of colonial Government from a mother country three thousand miles distant , and dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as it is termed , to which so many of the descendants of the authors of our revolution are now surprised and indignant that the Canadians should be so ungratefully insensible : " In every crisis of danger , and almost every detail of local m*itnagemenb " says the report , the colony has felt the mischief of having its executive authority exercised on the other side of the Atlantic . " The emphatic force of the general testimony will preclude the necessity of our giving any of the illustrations of its truth , which will veadily suggest themselves to every reader . A general want of proper responsibility is represented as extending through all the leading branches of administration . The real and sole advisers of the Governor have , in fact , been , says Lord Durham , the Executive Council ; " and an institution more singularly calculated for preventing the responsibility of the acts of Government resting in any body can hardly be imagined . " One of the constant demands of the Assembly has been the responsibility of the executive council , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behold , Lord Durham testifies to theyropriety of the demand , by proposing totally " to alter the working of this cumbrous machine , and place the business of the various departments of the Government - in the hands of competent and responsible* public officers . " There is scarcely any regular administration at all in the rural districts out of Quebec , and two or three other principal placesno sheriffs , mayors , constables , or public functionaries of any kind , except the justices of the peace ; the total disorganization of the militia has put an end even to the officers of militia , who formerly used to be employed ( voluntarily and not very assiduously ) for certain purposes of police ; no municipal institutions  --  the Government even appearing " to have discouraged the American settlers from introducing their own municipal institutions by common assent . " The administration of justice is described as difficult , expensive* // and exceedirrg-ly embarrassed by ill-defined and often conflicting law , and imperfect provision for its proper dispensation . The petty local tribunals of commissioners of small causes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considerably worse than nothing at all . The Executive L*ouncil has been the court of appeals  --  a political , unprofessional , and utterly incompetent body The provisions for the adminis*atioa of criminal justice are quite as bad . The people have not the slightest confidence in it . There is no jury-law now in existence in the Province , and the selection of juries is entirely in the hands of the Executive , through the sheriffs of the judicial districts , political partizans holding lucrative offices under the Government . " The French complain , " says the report , " that the institution of both grand and petit juries have been repeatedly tampered with against them . They complain that when it has suited the interests of the Government to protect persons guilty of gross offences against the French p*trty , they have attained their end by packing the grand jury ; " and they cite some very strong cases , to one of which Lord Durham alludes , oii the occasion of an election riot in Montreal , in 183* , when the troops fired upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unblushingly packed grand jury threw out the indictment which was preferred against the magistrates and officers who ordered the troops to fire , and quashed all judicial investigati&amp;n into the circumstances ! Nor does the discontent of the people , with the ' mode in which this vital institution is administered , stop here " The French Canadians further complain that the favorable decision of a grand jury was of no avail to those who had fallen under the displeasure of the Government . There are several instances in the recent history of Lower Canada , in which an attorney-general , being dissatisfied ' with the conduct of the brand jury in ignoring a billi , either repeatedly preferred indictments for the same offence , be observed that Lord Durham'does not deny or question the justness ' of these complaints , which he certainly would have done , had it been in his power . H'e merely sets off against thena the complaints of the English ' , of the impossibility of getting a just verdict in a political case from a French jury ; though it is conceded that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more proper than their behaviour . " ' It would , indeed , be astonishing if , under all the circumstances , even so far only as they are conceded in this document , the Government even could get a verdict from a French jury in " a political case . " The character of the magistracy also , by whom the primary stages of criminal justice are attended to , is in keeping with that o ' the other institutions of the country . The justices of the peace throughout the colony are named by the Governors , and are almost universally destitute of the popular confidence , " owing to the general // belief that the appointments have been made with a party and national bias . " It can not be denied , the report adds , " that many most respectable Canadians were long left out of the commission of the peace , without any adequate cause ; and it is still more undeniable that most disreputable persons , of both races , have found their way into it , and still continue to abuse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lon*'been anxious to remedy this disorder , by introducing into the Province the system of township government , or municipalities , which have been so long the pride and ornament of the New England States ; but the bills passed by the Assembly during a course of ten years for this oliject ( a fact not alluded to by Lord Durham ) have been invariably thrown out by the Legislative Council . Even some Vermonters , who were anxious to introduce with them into their new settlement these municipal customs , were told of " the impropriety of electing their own officers . " The corporations of Quebec and Montreal have been allowed to fall into ruins , and now ip Lower Canada " there are no county , no municipal , no parochial officers either named by the Crown or elected by the people . " There is , fortunately , no bitterness of religious dissension in the Province . The French are all Catholics , and the Catholic clergy are described as a most valuable social , as well as religious , institution . Their influence is stated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late troubles , in favor and support of the Government . Among the Protestant population there has arisen of late an agitation on the subject of the " clergy reserves , " somewhat similar to that in Upper Canada , which it is highly important to put speedily at rest . And after some not very important allusions to the financial and monetary systems of the Province  --  to the public revenue , which is principally derived from the custom-house , and , till within the last four years , amounted to about ? 150,000 per annum , though now little more than ? 100,000 , ( the permanent expenditure of the civil Government being about ? 60,000 , )  --  to the financial disputes between the two Provinces  --  and to the post-office , from which it appears that a surplus revenue of ? 10,000 per annum is transmitted to England , contrary to the just remonstrances of the Assembly . Lord Durham concludes this first general division of his report with the following remark , which would seem to have been particularly designed for that portion of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance of national well-being , and which has manifested so much righteous indignation against the unreasonable discontents of the Canadians : " For the reasons I have before explained , there is hardly the semblance of direct taxation in Lower Canada for general and local purposes . This immunity from taxation has been sometimes spoken of as a great privilege of the people of bower // Canada , and a great proof of the justice and benevolence of their Government . The description which I have given of the singularly defective provision made for the discharge of the most important duties of both the general and the local govern inent will , I think , make it appear that this apparent saving of the pockets of the people has been caused by their privation of many of the institutions which every civilized community ought to possess . A people can hardly be congratulated on having had , at little cost , a rude and imperfect administration of justice , hardly the semblance of police , no public provision for education , no lighting , and had pavernent in its cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and wear and tear caused in taking any article to market , may probably be estimated at ten times the expense of good roads . If the Lower Canadians had been subjected , or rather had been taught to subject themselves , to a much greater amount of taxation , they would probably at this time have been a much wealthier , a much bettergoverned , a more civilized , and a much more contented people . " We will add no remarks of our own upon the testimony thus borne by Lord Durham to the fearful pyramid of colonial misrule which has been gradually accumulated upon this unhappy Province of Lower Canada . His admissions do not amount to one-tenth of the earnest and indignant charges long vainly urged by the popular party ; yet , even on the mere showing of this report , what descendant of the men of our Revolution can conscientiously blame any extremes of opposition into which a people , thus oppressed and outraged by the foreign dominion of an oligarchical faction , might be goaded . And when it is remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stopping the supplies , " to extort from the " official " faction the very reforms of which the justice and the necessity are now fully conceded , the Home Government undertook to virtually annihilate the colonial constitution , and seize*on the public revenue with the strong hand of power , backed by the bayonet and the cannon , and finally worthily consummated this long career of oppression , by arbitrarily and illegally arresting ( with circumstances of the grossest indignity ) the principal leaders of the popular party , so as to drive the unprepared and unarmed hasty assemblages of the peasantry into a seeming position to justify their sweeping the land with the bloody besom of martial law ; - when all this is remembered , we trust that , for very shame 's sake , for the sake of a decent respect to the memories of the graves of our own sires , we shall hear no more of the heartless and miserable sneers from an American press upon the " unreasonableness " of the complaints and demands of the Canadians , upon their " ingratitude " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon the " *insufficiency of their pretended grievances " to justify their deep and intense abhorrence of British colonial government , and their yearning aspirations after the- independence and repub* lican institutions , of which the contiguity of the United States affords them so constant and stimulating an example . 2 . The second section of the report relates to Upper Canada , and upon this we shall not feel compelled to dwell with so much detail *s we have been induced to do in the preceding pages . The condition // of IJPPER CANADA , where the quarrel , we are told , " is one of an entirely English , if not British population , " is described as , in truth , not much better than that of its sister Province . There we find , in like manner , " an unwise distribution of power , " " financial disputes , " followed by the legitimate fruits of public bankruptcy , irresponsibility in the Government , and the Provinces " entirely ruled by a party , comm*nly designated the family compact , ' " which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common party interests , possessed , as they are , of all the highest public offices-of all the influence and patronage of the Executive . " The bench , the magistracy , the high offices of the Episcopal church , and a great part of the legal profession , are filled by the adherents of this party ; by grant and purchase they have acquired nearly the whole of the waste lands of the Province ; they are all-powerful in the chartered banks , and , till lately , shared among themselves almost exclusively all the offices of trust and profit . " Each Governor , as he arrives , falls into the hands of this Hoiy Alliance of placemen ; and , no matter how anxious he may be to act independently , so general and so absolute is the power of this faction , that he dare not assert his independence of them . " The bulk of this party consists , " says the report , " for the most part , of native-born inhabitants of the colony , and of emigrants who settled in it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of it belong to the Church of England , and the maintenance of the claims of that church has always been one of its distinguishing characteristics . " Against this " tory or official party , " the Reformers repeatedly obtained a majority ; but " at last discovered that success in the elections insured them very little practical benefit , " their opponents constantly retaining the full possession of the Executive Government-controlling the popular body by the veto of their " secure majority in the Legislative Council " - choosing its proper moment for dissolving hostile assemblies , and retaining friendly ones in office through their full legal term of four years , &amp;c . The Reformers finally concentrated their efforts on the one point of introducing the element of responsibility into the constitution of the Executive Council , in this respect exhibiting greater skill and tact than the corresponding popular party in Lower Canada-well knowing " that , if once they obtained possession of the Executive Council , and the higher offices of the Province , the Legislative Council would soon be unable to offer any effectual resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they met with a desperate resistance from the official party . Each party , while in the ascendancy , has been accused by its opponents of having abused its power over the public funds in // those modes of local jobbing before mentioned as practised in Lower Canada , and throughout all the Provinces ; and there has been , in fact , on the whole , a great deal of profusion , carelessness , and misapplication of the public funds in works of internal improvemen t . These two parties were composed , for the most part , of nativeborn Canadians , American sett.krs , and emigrants of a very ancient date . The influx of emigration subsequent to 1825 suddenly doubled the population , and introduced a third class , who were looked upon with considerable jealousy , and by no means admitte ( l to a fair and equal participation of civil and political privileges , by both of the former . The common distinctive characteristics of this third class is attachment to the British connection . They divided themselves off between the two respective parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tory party at home , a large number of the higher class of emigrants , particularly the half-pay officers , naturally arrayed themselves on the side of the official party ; while the mass of the humble order of emigrants as naturally fell into the hands of the popular and reforming party . The first act of Sir Francis Head , on assuming the government of the colony , was to introduce into the Executive Council three new members , of whom two were Reformers , ( Dr. Rolph and Mr. 11 . Baldwin , ) in the place of some of the members who were most obnoxious to the House of Assembly . But in a short time after , as soon as the controlling influence of the " family compact " began to make itself felt on the new Governor , ( which was no difficult task upon the weak and very foolish head of the author of the " Bubbles of Brunnen , " ) the same individuals , finding themselves treated with entire neglect and contempt , unconsulted in the administration of affairs , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their remonstrance being point-blank insulted by Sir Francis Head , were left no other choice than to resign . On the dissolution of the Assembly , and the new election which then ensued , Lord Durham is very frank in putting the proceedings of Sir Francis Head and the Government party entirely in the wrong . He ackno*vledges that that election , by which Sir Francis Head succeeded in reversing the former reforming majority , was a gross fraud upon the people . He says that the issue was so misrepresented that " a great portion of the people really imagined that they were called upon to decide the question of separation from the mother country by their votes , " and thus " the general support of the British it should be remembered that the word is not used here in contradistinction from the Frcnch determined the elections in favor of the Government ; though very large and close // minorities , which in many cases supported the defeated candidates , marked the force which the Reformers could bring into the field , even in spite of the disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the unusual manner in which the Crown , by its representative , appeared to makc itself a party in an electioneering contest . " Some further light is cast upon this " unusual manner " bj the following paragraph a little below : " In a number of other instances , too , the elections were carried by the unscrupulous exercise of the influence of the government , and by a display of violence on the part of the Tories , who were emboldened by the countenance afforded to them by the authorities . It was stated , but I believe without any sufficient foundation , that the government made grants of land to persons who had no title to them , in order to secure their votes . This report originated in the fact , that patents for persons who were entitled to grants , but had not taken them out , were sent down to the polling places , to be given to the individuals entitled to them , if they were disposed to vote for the govermrnent candidate . The Report acknowledges that the pledges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor , and independently of either of the two parties , which had mainly constituted , together with the other influences thus significantly alluded to , to defeat the party of the " Reformers , " soon proved entirely fallacious ; that the present Assembly is in no respect entitled to claim the character of a fair representative body ; and that he " must state that it is the general opinion , that never was the power of the " family compact " so extensive or so absolute as it has been from the first meeting of the existing parliament down to the present time . " Indignant as the whole party of the Reformers ( whom Lord Durham virtually acknowledges to constitute a large majority of the people ) was rightfully made by these events , their dissatisfaction , the Report proceeds to state , " was carried to its height by an act that appeared , in defiance of all constitutional right , to prolong the power of a majority which , it was supposed , counted on not being able to retain its existence after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act to prevent the dissolution of the existing , as well as any future Assembly , on the demise of the Crown . The act was passed in expectation of the approaching decease of his late Majesty ; and it has in fact prolonged the existence of the present Assembly from the period of a single year to one of four . " This state of things brought on the outbreak commonly called Mackenzie 's insurrection , which Lord Durham pronounces " as foolishly contrived , and as ill-conducted , as it was wicked and treasonable . " He considers the general loyalty of the population attested by its defeat , as also , subsequently , " the little disposition that has been exhibited by any portion of it to accept of the proffered aid of the refugees and foreign invaders , and by the unanimity // with which all have turned out to defend their country . " As for its " wicked and treasonable " character , the summary dictum of his British Lordship , to that effect , will hardly outweigh the evidence which his own admissions so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the righteousness of that application of the principle that " resistance to tyrants is obedience to God . " The remark that it was " foolishly *contrived and ill-conducted " ( the accidental mistake of the appoi ? ited day , together with the want of arms for the thousands who flocked to the insurgent standard , is the ample excuse assigned by its leaders ) would seem to supply a better explanation of its failure than that " loyalty " upon which so much stress is laid , and which we are very much inclined to consider , to use a vulgar phrase , a mere humbug . A short distance below , Lord Durham virtually admits that unless the whole subject of controversy is given up to " the Reformers , " - this " loyalty " to the contrary notwithstanding ,  --  they ( viz , the party " which has commanded large majorities in different Houses of Assembly " ) may be " generally and decidedly desirous of separation . " And that his confidence in this " loyalty " was no very certain or deeply fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following paragraph ; which , we must confess , together with the general tenor of the whole document , leaves no doubt on our mind of the truth of the representations constantly made by the refugees , to the effect that there is really a vast majority of the people of Upper , as well as of Lower Canada , anxious for separation , and fully sympathizing with the objects of the Reformers ; and that it is only the present forcible ascendancy of the Executive power which represses the manifestation of that feeling , and gives rise to a delusive appearance of unanimity in the support of the government and the British connection : " It has not , indeed , been exactly ascertained what proportion of the inhabitants of Upper Canada were prepared to join Mackenzie in his treasonable enterprise , or were so disposed that we may suppose they would have arrayed themselves on his side , had he obtained any momentary success , as indeed was for some days within his grasp . Even if I were convinced that a large proportion of the population would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should be inclined to attribute such a disposition merely to the irritation produced by those temporary causes of dissatisfaction with the government of the province which I have specified* and not to any settled design on the part of any great number , either to subvert existing institutions , or to chnn* , e their present connection with Great Britain for a junction with the United States . " And if such was the state of things at the time of the outbreak , the succeeding parngraph scarcely exhibits any very favorable change in public sentiment as pioduced by the subsequent course of events : " It can not , however , be doubted , that the events of the past year have greatly increased the difficulty of settling the disorders of Upper Canada . A degree of discontent , approaching , if not amounting , to disaffection , has gained considerable // ground . The causes of disaffection continue to act on the minds of the reformers ; and their hope of redress , under the present order of things , has been seriously diminished . The exasperations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that trying period , and the use made by the triumphant party of the power thrown into their hands , have heightened the passions which existed before . It certainly appeared too much as if the rebellion had been puiposely invited by the government , and the unfortunate men who took part in it deliberately drawn into q trap by those who subsequently inflicted so severe a punishment on them for their error . It seemed , too , as if the dominant party mile use of the occasion afforded it by the real guilt of a few desperate and imprudent men , in order to persecute or disable the whole body of ther political opponents . A great number of perfectly innocent individuals were thrown into prison , and suffered in person , property , and character . The whole body of reformers were subjected to suspicion , and to harassing proceedings instituted by magistrates , whose political leanings were notoriously adverse to them . Severe laws were passed , under color of which individuals , very generally esteemed , were punished without any form of trial . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press which has been seen to disgrace itself by the fury with which it hus joined in the hue and cry of the British Tory faction of the Canadas , whom the temporary success of combined fraud and force have enabled to place their foot on the neck of a prostrated , oppressed , and outraged people , at least to pay the poor atonement of a blush of s/tame for the dishonor they have cast on the memory of the fathers of our own Revolution , whose motives to rebellion were certainly never equal , in the immediate and galling pressure of the yoke of foreign dominion , to those which , in this very document ,  - -  the official report of the Governor-General - of the Canadasare shown to have impelled the party which has been unfortunately guilty of the crime of failure . The most important practical question on which the various parties have been at issue , is stated to be that of the Clergy Reserves . By the Constitutional Act a certain portion ( the one-eighth part ) of the land in every township was set apart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this denomination the clergy of the Church of England have claimed and enjoyed the sole benefit of the proceeds of the sales of these lands  --  a claim , naturally enough , strenuously contested by all the other " Protestant " sects , as well as very obnoxious to the large body of Catholics in the Province . It is scarcely necessary to say , that the Government party has always sustained the Church of England-that being an essential element of that Tory political creed which , transplanted to the ungenial soil of our North America , has been seen to produce such bitter fruits of mis-government and misery . On the other hand , " a great body of all Protestant denominations , " says the Report , as well as the Catholics , " have either demanded the equal application of those funds to the purposes of all religious creeds whatsoever , or have urged the propriety of leaving each body of religionists to maintain its own establishment , to repeal or dis // regard the law , and to apply the clergy funds to the general purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of education . " And the reader xviii not be surprised to be told that " two bills passed the last House of Assembly , in which the Reformers had the ascendancy , applying these funds to the purposes of education ; and both these bills were rejected by the Legislative Council . " But this was not all . Thou*h the clergy of that church ( confessedly a " small community " - " probably not one-fourth of the population "  --  and relatively decreasing in numerical proportion , with the influx of emigration , as well as being " the church which , being that of the wealthy , can best provide for itself , and has the fewest poor to supply with gratuitous religious instruction " ) were thus an " endowed , " they were not a " dominant priesthood . " But the last act of Sir John Colborne before quitting the Government , in 1835 , was the establishment of the fifty-seven rectories . Spreading over the Province a body of clergymen of this favored religious minority , possessing " all the spiritual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part " in precisely the same position as a clergyman of the established church of England . " He must be a very infatuated admirer of " the bench of bishops , " who will be surprised that this was " resented most warmly " by all the other teachers of religion in the country , thus " degraded to a position of legal inferiority to the clergy of the Church of England ; " that it was , in the opinions of many , a " chief predisposing cause of the recent insurrection ; " and that it is " an abiding and unabated cause of discontent . " " And it is equally natural , " says Lord Durham , " that the English dissenters and Irish Catholics , remembering the position they have occupied at home , and the long and painful struggle through which alone they have obtained the imperfect equality they now possess , should refuse to acquiesce for themselves in the creation of a similar establishment in their new country , and thus to bequeath to their children a strife as arduous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inperfectly escaped . " The Report then proceeds to remark on the unanimity of opinion in the United States in favor of " the voluntary principle " in religion , which has naturally extended its influence , strengthened by " the example " of its success , over the tone of thought prevalent in the neighboring provinces ; and freely admits that " The result of any determination on the part of the British government or Legislature to give one sect a predominance and superiority would be , itmight be feared , not to secure the favored sect , hut to endanger the Loss of the colony ; and , in yindicating the exclusive pretensions of the English church , to hazard one of the fairest possessions of the British Crown . " // He urges the immediate settlement of this question , by leaving it solely to the local legislature . The Catholics , who constitute " at least a fifth of the whole population of Upper Canada , appear to have peculiar additional causes of grievance . " They are not only " wholly excluded from all share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its disposal , " but the detestal*3 institution of Orangeism , chiefly as an active and organized engine of political rather than of religious machinery , has been introduced into the country , and not only tolerated but encouraged by the Government party . On several occasions the election of government partizans has been procured , as it is asserted , by means of " a violent and riotous mob of Orangemen , who prevented the voters in the opposition interest from coming up to the polls ; " and when the Assembly presented to Sir Francis Head an address of remonstrance on the subject , the cool answer received was , simply , that " the Government of this Province has neither taken , nor is determined to take , any steps to prevent or discourage the formation or continuance of such societies . " The administration of justice is not so bad as in Lower Canada ; there is a system of circuits , and still some integrity in juries ; but there are general complaints against " the union of political and judicial functions in the chief justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriffs are appointed ; and for similar reasons as in the Lower Province " the composition of the magistracy appears to be a serious cause of mischief and dissatisfaction . " The Province is also " without any of those means by which the revenues of a country are developed , and the civilization of a people is advanced or upheld . " A very considerable portion of it has " neither roads , post-offices , mills , schools , nor churches . " The people " can seldom acquire wealth , " and " with the exception of the laboring class , most of the emigrants who have arrived within the last ten years are poorer now than at the time of their arrival in the province . " There is little inter-communication , and " no adequate system of local assessment to improve it ; " - " nor can even wealthy land owners prevent their children from growing up ignorant and boorish , and from occupying a far lower mental , moral , and social position than they themselves fill . " So that , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any point of view in the Upper than in the Lower Province ; nor are the acknowledged evils in the condition of the latter to be ascribed to any peculiar cause in the character of the French population , but rather to the general repressive and deteriorative influence of colonial misgovernment under the " paternal and benign auspices " of British Toryism . Carlyle , in his History of the French Revolution , makes the // remark , that misrule always in the end both proves and explodes itself by bankruptcy . Upper Canada presents an unhappy illustration of its truth . The whole revenue of the Province , about ? 60,000 , is hardly adequate to pay the interest of the public debt , upwards of a million-which has been sunk ( with " great inismanagement , and perhaps no little jobbing " ) in public works confessedly unprofitable , and some of which are now " almost suspended from the apparent inutility of coi*pleting them , "  --  a state of things which is ascribed , with what truth we have no means of judging , in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature of the Lower Province . 3 . The other Provinces , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Prince Edward 's Island , and Newfoundland , present on the whole a spectacle in most respects analogous to the unhappy picture which the Report draws of the condition of the two larger ones-though both their sufferings and discontents differ greatly in degree from those of the latter , and though in these there is generally a much stronger sentiment of British loyalty . In New Brunswick the " official party " has had the good sense to succumb with a better grace to the liberal popular party ; the consequence of which is a much greater degree of harmony and tranquillity than in any of the others . But , on the whole , in all of them like causes are found infallibly to produce like effects . " In all these provinces we find representative government coupled with an irresponsible executive ; we find the same collision between the branches of the Government  --  the same abuse of the powers of representative bodies , owing to the anomaly of their position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same constant interference of the imperial administration in matters which should be left wholly to the Provincial governments . " Nearly the whole of Prince Edward 's Island , containing about a million and a half of acres of the richest soil , was alienated , in one day , to absentees resident in London , somewhat more than half a century ago , and the consequence is that only 100,000 acres are under cultivation . The cultivation of the remainder , the absent proprietors " neither promote nor permit . " Major Head describes his journey through a great part of Nova Scotia as " exhibiting a melancholy spectacle of half the tenements abandoned , and lands every where falling into decay . Lands that were purchased thirty and forty years ago at five shillings an acre , are now offered for three . " These provinces contain nearly 30,000,000 of acres . and though among the longest settled on the North American continent , have a population only or about 365,000 souls , giving only one inhabitant for every eighty acres . As if it were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of beggary and wretchedness , they are deprived of the benefit of the very mines of their Provinces . // The valuable coal mines of Pictou having been mortgaged to some jewellers in London to pay the debts of the late Duke of York , ana the rich iron mines of Lower Canada , which could furnish all the colonies with iron ware , having been bestowed , for *a mere nomina4 rent , on one of the favorites of the passing governor of the day . In Newfoundland there has long been the ordinary collision between the representative bod ; on one side , and the ExecLitive On the other . The representatives have no influence0n the compo*. sition , or the proceedings of the Executive government , " and the dispute is now carried on , as in Canada , by impea&amp;hments of various public officers on one hand , and prorogations on the other . " 4 . The fourth section of the Report , which treats of the disposal vI public lands and of emigration , we are compelled by our limits to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uniformity that have prevailed in relation to these subjects have becn a system of mismanagement and a uniformity of profusion . It is needless to enter into its details ; a thorough re.organization of the whole is urged , and its wisdom illustrated by reference to the example of the United States . With respect to the difference of the value of land on the respective sides of the frontier line , arising solely out of the difference of civil institutions , the Report says : " Throughout the frontier , from Amherstbu.r*h to the ocean , the market value of land is much greater on the American than on the British side . In not a few parts of the frontier this difference amounts to as much as a thousand per cent. , and in some cases even more . The average difference , as hetween Upper Canada and the States of New York and Michigaa , is notoriously several hundred per cent . " And the statement that full sixty per ce*nt. of the emigrants into The Canadas from the United Kingdom are said to have removed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces , is amply justified by the following contrasted picture of the two sides of the frontier line , in respect to " every sign of productive indus .. try , increasing wealth , vind progressive civilization . " " By describing one side , and reversina the picture , the other would be also described . On the American side all is activity and hustle . The forest has been widelyj cleared ; every year numerous settlements are formed , and thousands of farms are created out of the waste ; the country is intersected by common roads , canals and railroads are finished , or in the course of formation ; the ways of comnrnnication and transport are crowded with people , and enlivened by numerous carriages and large steamboats . The observer is surprised at the number of harbors on the lakesLand the number of vessels they contain ; while bridges , artificial landing places , and commodious wharves are formed in all directions as soon as required . Good houses , warehouses , mills , inns , villages , towns , and even great cities , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every village has its schriol-houu* aa4 place of public woi hip . Every town has many of both , with its township build-. ings , its bookstores , and probably one or two banks and newspapers ; and the cities , with their fine churches , their great hotels , their exchanges , court-houses and municipal halls , of stone or marble , so new and fresh as to mark the recent existence of the forest where they now stand , would be edmired in any part of the old world . On the British side of the line , with the exception of a few favored spots where some approach to American prosperity is apparent , all seems waste and // desolate . There is but one railroad in all British America , and that running between the St. Lawrence and Lake Champlain , is. only fifteen miles long . The ancient city of Montreal , which is naturally the commercial capital of the Canada* , will not hear the least comparison , in any respect , with Buffalo , which is : a creation of yesterday . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Bides that we shall find the best evidence of our own inferiority . That painful but undeniable truth is most manifest in the country districts through which the line of national separation passes for 1,000 miles . There , on the side of both the Canadas , and also of New Brunswick and Nova*cotia , a widely scattered population , poor , and apparently unenterprising , though hardy and industrious , parated from each other by tracts of intervening forest , without towns and markets , almost without roads , living in mean houses , drawing little more than a rude subsistence from illcultivated land , and seemingly incapable of improving their condition , present the most instructive contrast to their enterprising and thriving neighbors on the Amencan side . I was assured that in the eastern townships of Lower Canada , bordering upon the line , it is a common practice for settlers ) when they wish to meet to enter the State of Yermont , and make use of the roads there for the purpose of , reaching their destination in the British province . Major Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I sent to New Brunswick , states , that when travelling near the frontier line of that province and the State of Maine , now on one side and then on the other , he could always tell on which side he was by the obvious superiority of the American settlements in every respect . " While that these Provinces are not naturally inferior to any portion of the territory on their southern frontier , out of which the young energies of freedom have drawn such splendid results of prosperity , happiness , and national greatness , is attested in the following extract : " It might be supposed , by persons unacquainted with the frontier country , that the soil on the American side is of very superior natui*al fertility . I am positively assured that this is by no means the case ; but that , on the whole , superior natural fertility belongs to the British territory . In Upper Canada , the whole of the great peninsula between Lake Erie and Huron , comprisin* nearly half the available land of the province , consists of gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of inferior land than probably any other tract of similar extent in that part of North Anmrica , is generally considered the best grain country on that continent . The soil of the border townships of Lower Canada is allowed , on all hands , to be superior to that of the border townships of New York , Vermont , and New Hampshire ; while the lands of New Brunswick , equal in natural fertility to those of Maine , enjoy superior natural means of communication . I* do not believe that the universal difference in the value of land can any where be fairly attributed to natural causes . " And again : " No portion of the American continent possesses greater natural resources for the maintenance of large and flourishing communities . An almost boundless range of the richest soil still remains unsettled , and may be rendered available for the purposes of agriculture . The wealth of inexhaustible forests of the beat timber in . America , and of extensive regions of the most valuable minerals , have as yet been scarcely touched . Along the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , be found the " neatest and richest fisheries in the world . The every are to b best fuel and the most abundant water-power are available for the coarser manufactures , for which an easy and certain market will be found .

Lord DurhanzX* Report . of easy intercourse ; and the structure of the country generally affords the utmost facility for every species of communication by land . unbounded materials of agriculture , commercial and manufacturin* , industry , are there . 5 . We come now to the concluding section of this very valuable and interesting document . Thus far it has been describing the disease  --  the next question is as to the remedy . It does not consider the Canadas as beyond sin g to the British empire ; though it considers this as the last eh*ice of doing so . After remarking that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to results of his ( Lord Durham 's ) mission , and to believe that when ( he case is once fairly hut before the mother country , the desired changes in the policy of their government will be readily granted , and that in the meantime they are tranquil , and he believes loyal , he adds , " but I can not but express my belief , that this is the last effort of their alrnast exhausted patience , and that the disappointment of their hopes on the-present occasion will destroy forever their expectation of good resulting from British connection . " He places at once out of the question the idea of retaining , by military force , " a barren and injurious sovereignty " Over them , without applying a ( borough remedy to the root of the causes of disorder . " As the cost increases , " he remarks , " their value will rapidly diminish ; " and , taking into consideration the natural influence of American " sympathy , " ( a feeling which he treats with much more respect than it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own press to do , ' ) lie seriously questions the possibihity , of forcible retention even if it were , either desirable or in consonance with the true greatness of the British Empire , or the civilization of the age . His informants , however , to the contrary notwithstanding , we can assure Lord Durham that he is vastly mistaken in expressing himself convinced , that " the measures he adopted met with a concurrence on #he part of the people of the United States that completely turned the tide of feeling in favor of the British Government . " Neither the Whiig press of this country , nor the travelling gentry who were so fascinated by the condescend .. ing court addressed to them by " His Excellency the Governor Gene* ral , " are the best exponents of the true state of public feeling of the American people . He does ample justice to the good faith with which the Federal Government has exerted itself to maintain inviolate its neutral obligations , while he admits the impossibility of doing so with corn*lete eiThct by any government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general public feeling . lie at the same time intimates that it can not rationally be expected that these efforts should be very long continued , if the British *iovernment does not or can not soon put an end to the state of Things rende nag them necessary ; remarking , very sensibly , that*c:T+ cannotbe doubted that ihe disturbed state ofthe Canadas is aseriousdrawa*k n the prosperityof a great part of the Union . I stead of resenting and // ditional field for their commercial enterprise , these Provinces , in their present sta of disorder , are rather a barrier to their industrial energies . The present state of things also occasions great expense to the Federal Government , which has beenunder the necessity of largely augmenting its small army , on account chiefly of the troubles of Canada . " But the rapid withdrawal of both population and capital , from the Canadas , together with the entire stoppage of emigration , is the greatest evil . Of this he preser*s an alarming picture , so that he considers the horrors and dangers of rebellion and foreign invasioflas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depopulation . " The dissensions which have so long agitated the colonies , having gro*vn out of the constant collisions between the popular Houses of Assembly and the Executive authorities  --  the former desirous of controlling the general policy of the colonial government , and the latter bent on maintaining its high position of independence and unrestrained* enjoyment of all the power , . pride , and patronage of government-Lord Durham 's leading idea , in the application of a remedy , is simply to give up the whole field of contest to the people He says it would be vain , even if it were desirable , to think of organizing their government on any other than the representative principle . The question is not now , he says , upon " the policy of establishing representative government in the North American . colonies . That has been irrevocably done , and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power is not to . be thought of . " This being laid down as the point of departure , . the next step that follows necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially , on the popular control ; inasmuch as in all mixed systems of government the popular will , embodied as a representative Assembly , is after all the mainspring of the machine , and being the strongest , must , in the end , control and . conquer all the other elements of the system toi-tself . This end he propones to obtain , not by making the Exeentive councils elective , which would be utterly inconsistent with the whole theory of the monarchy which he is disposed to preserve unimpaired , and even re-invigorated by wholesome reform ; but by instructing the colonial governor " to secure the cooperation of the Assembly in his policy , , by entrusting its administration to such men as could command* a majority , " - in other words , by transferring to the colonic* the principle and practice which- alone insure harmony in the working of the complex machinery of government at home ; . the Imperial authority abstaining from all interference with the internal affairs of the colonies that should not ( lireetly involve the relations between them and . the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one " Province of Cannda , "  --  the Governor General to be sent from Great Britain , but to carry on his government by responsible heads of department , subject to impeachment , constituting a sort of colonial . ministry or // the British model , and retaining their places only on the tenure of retaining the confidence of the popular branch of the government . He would retain a Legislative Council as a coOrdinate branch of the legislature , though at the same time that he decidedly condemns the present constitution of those bodies , he does not explain on what plan he would remodel them , passing over that point with some ambiguous generalities.4 1-Le is also equally provokingly vague with respect to his " general executive on an improved principle , " unless that " improved principle " be simply that which he has already stated , and of which we have given the substance . The administration of the public lands alone is to be confided to an imperial authority , that being a subject in which the colonies an ( l the mother country have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigration which constitutes one of the chief elements of the value of the latter to the former . All the revenues of the Crown are to be given up to the Legislature , on the concession of an adequate civil list , and the past provisions with respect to the clergy reserves to be repealed . The independence of the judges to be secured , by giving them the same tenure of office and security of income as exist in England . The English principle is also to be introduced of allowing no money votes to originate without the previous consent of the Crown , to guard against the great abuses in the application of surplus revenue , ( road jobbing , &amp;c. , ) which have heretofore taken place in the House of Assembly . A comprehensive system of measures to be also carefully framed to promote emigration on the greatest possible scale , and with the most beneficial results to all concerned . The only other important features that remain to be noticed , in his plan for the re-organization of the Constitution of the Colonies are , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Colonies to consolidate themselves , at their own option , and with the consent of the Canadas , into this union which he proposes to make compulsory in the case of the latter ; and secondly , to organize a complete system of municipal institutions for the country , by " elective bodies subordinate to the general legislature , and exercising a complete control over such local affairs as do not come within the province of general legislation , " - this to be done by an act of the Imperial Parliament , so as to prevent the general legislature from encroac of the local bodies . hing on the powers The principal object of this legislative union of the two Canadas , on the necessity of which so much stress is laid , is this  --  to combine the plan of a fair representative system by electoral districts , as near as may be , in bona-fide proportion to population , with what he considers the indispensable object of saving the English population of the lower Province from that legislative predominance of the French interest which must otherwise result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominance which , in the present state of national feeling on both sides , can never , he argues* be safely entrusted to the one , as it would never be peacefully tole* rated by the other . We are glad to see Lord Durham repudiate , frankly and manfully , all the petty expedients of electoral fraud which have been sug* gested , to give to the British mir*rity a legislative majority , by new and strange modes of voting , or unfair divisions of the country . With respect to these , he says : " If the Canadians are to be deprived of representative government , it would be better to do it in a straight-forward way than to attempt to establish a permanent system of Government on the basis of what all mankind would regard as mere electoral frauds . It is not in North America that men can be cheated by an unreal semblance of representative government , or persuaded that they are outvoted , when , in fact , they are disfranchised . " A mere federal union he considers out of the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada will only use whatever power may be entrusted to it in hostility to the British interest and the British connection . He estimates the population of Upper Canada at 400,000 , the English inhabitants of Lower Can* ada at 150,000 , and the French at 450,000  --  a relative proportion which would give the English a fair and effective majority in a legislative union  --  a majority which would be increased every year by the influx of emigration , and under the legitimate ascendency of which the false and feeble " nationality " of the French would gradually disappear , and the present animosities of the two races subside , though by no means entirely , he thinks , within the period of a single generation . We have now placed our readers pretty fully in possession of the leading ideas and views of this remarkably able State paper , with a slight connecting thread of running commentary . Its importance and interest fully justify the space we have found ourselves com* pelled to bestow upon it , even at the sacrifice , to some extent , of that variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strong as is the testimony which it bears on every line against the shocking misrule to which these very unfortunate Provinces have been so long subjected , under the control of a foreign minority official faction , it is strikingly stamped with internal evidence of its general truth , being the adn*issions of a mind evidently , with respect to the Lower Province , in no slight degree imbued with the pride of British prejudice . How completely it sustains and justifies all the views which have been before expressed by the Democratic Review in relation to the Canadas , it is unnecessary for us to point out . In the actual state of things , this mode proposed of merging the distinctive nationality of the French in the fair and leoitimate a ascendency of a numerical English majority , commends itself // strongly to our approval as the only effective remedy for a great evil which has now an unquestionable existence de facto , thought as before remarked , we consider it entirely a consequence , and not a primary cause , of the disorders of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the slightest difficulty in an harmonious amalgamation of two distinct races , separated from each other by n*other barrier of natural antipathy than mere difference of origin and language . This truth has been amply illustrated by the example of various sections of our own country . And the re-organization of the institutions of the coun ' try on the liberal basis of fair , popular , representative government , will , we are well assured , by remedying the causes of the present antagonist and hostile relation which has gro*vn up between the two , remedy also , speedily and effectively , all their unhappy resultS . XVe see no reason to apprehend any abuse of the power of the English ascendeacy to bear oppressively upon what will then be the French minority ; because , in the first place , that majority will not consist of that local party or faction with which has been waged the contest out of which has grown this embittered national animosity ; but will he formed by the addition of the great masS of the population of the Upper Province , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings generated by it . The 400,000 inhabitants of Upper Canada will swamp the small English minority , as well as the large French majority of Lower Canada . There will appear rather , we have no doubt , a strong disposition to a mutual sympathy between the latter and the " Reformers , " whom Lord Durham admits to constitute a considerable majority of the people of the Upper Province , arising out of their long coma mon struggle in a cause of popular rights , in both cases closely analogous with each other , if not completely identical , in character and objects . And , moreover , the French will constitute so large a minority of the whole , and will be bound together by so peculiar a bond of unanimity of feeling and interests , in which the slightest tendency to any oppressive abuse of the English national ascendency will infallibly merge and consolidate all minor divisions of opinion , that they must hold the real balance of power , ( as is done by the South with us , relatively to the divisions of parties at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling influence in the united Legislature , at least for every purpose of self-protection , if it should ever be necessary . In the second place , they will still have , through the system of municipal institutions proposed , the sole control of all those local affairs in the administration of which alone this sentiment of national animosity on the part of a hostile English ascendency could operate gallingly or oppressively on their immea diate personal feelings or interests-for , after all , it is mainly in // the small municipal details of local affairs that the operation of gov eminent comes most sensibly home to the bosoms and consciousness of men , to the hearth-stone and beneath the roof-tree where the actual man , in the midst of the happy charities of domestic life , may in truth be said to live , move , and have his being ; and where , if he but enjoys the sun-light and the healthful atmosphere of freedom , intangible abstractions of politi* , philosophy , or science , but rarely intrude to mar the quiet contentment of his lot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fitted him . This proposed consolidation of the Provinces we look upon as the first step towards that total disconnection of the colonies from the mother country , which is now evidently close at hand . It will give a consciousness of strength , importance , and distinct compact nationality , which can not long remain content with even the slight dependence to be established by this proposed re-organization . The weakness of division and isolation is now the principal hold which the imperial authority possesses over them ; and as soon as the internal dissensions by which they have heretofore been distracted are remedied by the proposed reforms , ( if , indeed , the British Parliament shall have the wisdom to adopt them , ) which will vest in the people the substantial control of the Government of the country , it is absurd to suppose that this imaginary and ridiculous sentiment of " loyalty , " upon which the British monarchy is nevertheless dependent for its own existence , will have the weight of a feather in the scale against the natural tendency of a country thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . The very checks which Lord Durham proposes upon the freedom of the popular action through the representative assemblies will serve to expedite the separation . We refer to the provision that all money votes must receive the previous sanction of the Crown , to the required concession of an adequate , permanent civil list , and to the reservation of the management and proceeds of the public lands in the hands of the imperial authority . Neither of these will long be tolerated by the people of the colonies , and they will constitute strong inducements to complete the work of separation for which the proposed reform is to lay the foundation . That separation will then take place peacefully and tranquilly , for it is plain that Great Britain could not dream , in that case , of attempting to oppose it by force ; and there can be no doubt that her own manufacturing industry will derive ( precisely as has been witnessed in the case of the United States ) much greater advantage from healthy commercial intercourse with these Provinces , on fair free-trade principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or independently , is quite immaterial , we conceive , to both parties-than she can ever derive from even the slight degree of metropolitan // ascendency over them which , by the present proposed liberal concessions , she may perhaps yet for a short time retain . That the author of this report is not blind to the shadow of the coming events-notwithstanding a few flourishes which he makes in the course of it upon the " loyalty " and " attachment to the British connection , " which he imputes , though with some important reservations and drawbacks , to the peo*le of the colonies-will be sufficiently apparent from the following extract , with which we close this already too protracted article , as equally creditable to his sagacity of judgment and liberality of feeling : I do not anticipate that a colonial Legislature , thus strong and thus self-governing , would desire to abandon the connection with Great Britain . On the contrary , I believe that the practical relief from undue interference , which would be the result of such a change , would strengthen the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only become more durable and advantageous , by having more of equality , of freedom , and of local independence . But , at any rate , our first duty is to secure the well-bein* , of our colonial countrymen , and if ; in the hidden decrees of that wisdom by which the world is ruled , it is written that these countries are not forever to remain portions of the Empire , we owe it to our honor to take good care that , when they separate from us , they should not be the only countries on the American continent in which the An0lo-Saxon race shall be found unfit to govern itself .
