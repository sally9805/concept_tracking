txt AMONG the phrases which within a year or two past have been resounded through the community by partizan zeal , for the purpose of disturbing the reflection and judgment of our fellow-citizens , none perhaps has been the subject of so much senseless declamation as that at the head of the present article . If reliance is to be placed upon the evidence furnished by newspaper paragraphs , dinner orations , and Congress speeches , " the Credit System , " is the veritable horn of plenty from which all the bounties bestowed upon our favored land have been poured forth . The extent and fertility of our territory  --  the variety and value of its staple productions-the indomitable energy of our citizens and the habits of industry and thrift so widely diffused among them  --  the security furnished by our system of self-government against improper restraints upon individual enterprise  --  and the protection for the acquisitions of diligence and economy , guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States in its golden provision that nothing but a sound and equal currency shall ever be made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the CREDIT SYSTEM in promoting the prosperity of the country . The phrase in question denotes something wholly distinct from that mutual confidence and good faith among men , which are the most essential elements of the prosperity and happiness of all communities . These fundamentals of well ordered society require to be preserved equally from violent outrage and fraudulent cupidity . The principal object for surrendering a portion of our natural liberty , and submitting to the restraints of any form of Government , is to afford this protection by placing every individual , however different with regard to strength , cunning , talent , and wealth , equally under the broad mgis of the law . But is the artificial policy , dignified with the name of the " Credit * The credit system of France , Great Britain , and the United States . By H. 0 . // System " as organized in England , and for which such omnipotent control over the right and privileges of every class of citizens has been claimed in this country , intended to promote this security ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency is to subvert that equality of rights which is the foundation of our forms of Government-to sacrifice the physical comfort and the moral welfare of the many , upon the altar of Mammon for the advantage of the few  --  to bestow inordinate power upon the mere shadow of wealth at the expense of J ) errnanent general prosperity  --  to invest combinations of irresponsible in ( lividuals with the monopoly of an artificial measure of value , by which arbitrary control over the subsistence of all other classes is conferred upon them , and they are enabled to modify . pervert , and break down , with impunity , all laws which interfere with their cupidity . By means of secret and concerted arrangements , these soulless combinations are able to practice acts of injustice , vitally affecting the most important interests of those who are unable to resist their power , which no individual could venture to perpetrate without becoming obnoxious to the penal laws . Hence the manifold advantages of capital loaned upon credit for the encouragement of industry and enterprise , are diminished by the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects upon the community-  --  the loan of mere credit and the loan of actual capital  --  the modern " Credit System , " has deeply impaired integrity and good faith , and nearly destroyed mercantile stability . The publication which has more immediately drawn our attention to this subject at the present time , is obviously a piece justicatif to the famous letter of Mr. Nicholas Biddle , addressed through the public newspapers to Ex-President Adams , on the fifth of April last . That notable document spoke for itself in terms so explicit as to require neither comment nor explanation . All the discreet supporters of the Bank of the United States in every section of the Union were struck with dismay at its promulgation-while the people at large , rejoiced that the Cor phoms of the " Credit System " in this country , had cast asi ( le the tricks , preteuces , and newspaper puffery , under which its mana*zement had been previously veiled , and presented its policy boldly beFore the world as an antagonist power to the principles of Government , established by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the insolence of the language xv*s calculated to excite , was smothered by the ludicrous spectacle presented by an aspiring clerk employed by a few capitalists abroad , and speculators at home , strutting forth from behind his desk with his pen behind his ear , and dictating to the Legislature of the State of New York , an ( l to the people of the Union at large , in such a pompous style of military grandiloquence . No great period of time had elapsed , before it was discovered , that this flourish of belligerent phrases , concludiug with // the delicate parallel between the position of Mr. Biddle himselfposted in his broker 's office contriving schemes politically subversive of the best interests of the community , in order to bring profit to his employers , and odium on the Governrnent ,  --  and that of the patriot Jackson before New Orleans fighting the embattled enemies of his country-was a sad blunder . His doctrines on the currency were found also , on examination by some of his friends , to be so much at variance with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " Credit System " than the most powerful attack upon it from whatever quarter . Under these circumstances the publication in question was made by Mr. Carey for the evident purpose of justifying and expounding the leading views of this unfortunate letter . By whom its principal materials were furnished , or under whose direction they were strung together , can not concern the public in the slightest degree . In offering to the consideration of our readers some general views upon the " Credit System " we do not propose to follow the details of Mr. Carey 's book . The character of his facts , a great portion of which appear to have been made to order , will be seen by the samples we shall furnish in the sequel . The credit system of England , of which our own is an humble attempt at imitation , is regarded by many as the most beneficial invention of mod.ern times . The unalloyed advantages derixul floin its operation in the extent of her commerce and manufactures md the vast wealth of many of her great proprietors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many active and influco tial individuals , from views that are not difficult of compieliension are constantly insisting before the American people , that the Ijiriest welfare of the community at large will be promoted , by extentlmniT this system greatly beyond the principles which have been adopted by England . This sentiment appears to be the staple of the publication in question , as well as of the document to which it is evidently a subsidiary . Like most imitators , these advocates of the English system seem to be more deeply enamoured with faults and defects , become incurable by the course of events , than with any of its real advantages . Because England during the long and bloody wars of the French revolution , legalized the suspension of specie paYments , this country according to these high authorities , ought to have pursued the same course in a period of profound peace and universal commercial intercourse , for the purpose of enabling a fe*v gamblers on a large scale , to realize their unrighteous profits  --  and after the suspension had been effected , to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their profligate management . Contracts which had been entered into under the faith and confidence that they would be fairly liquidated , were discharged by a depreciated medium , worth in the market from one-tenth to one-fourth part of the currency // in view of which they had been made , by which all calculation , foresight , and economy , on the part of the community at large , were frustr*ited through the overpowering influence of the banks . The plentifulness of paper currency , and the facility of obtaining accommodations had led to vast numbers of improvident engagements . A sudden contraction of issues rendered it impossible to fulfil them . The misfortunes and consequent distress of thousands upon thousands of meritorious individuals , whose property and means of livelihood , had been suddenly swept away by these flagitious expansions and contractions of the currency , issued and controlled by the banks , were flippantly ascribed to the hostility of the Government ! The results of the experiment of the English government upon the prosperity of her people , were of course , kept out of view . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen , has informed us . In 1828 , Mr. Huskisson stated in the House of Commons in the debate on the national debt bill , that " the bank restriction of 1797 , which had continued for a quarter of a century , bad produced more calamitous consequences-more confusion-more moral and political evils , than any other measure Parliament had ever sanctioned . " In this opinion , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , of that time , Mr. Goulborn , who entertained different views from those of Mr , . Huskisson on most questions of general policy , immediately expressed his entire concurrence . That they were both abundantly justified by the state of things actually produced by this favorite feature of the " Credit System , " will be shown in the proper place . As to the wealth and prosperity which this system is represented to have poured forth upon the English nation  --  the fact , that its operation has concentrated the whole property in the kingdom into a few hands , while the mass of the population have been gradually reduced to a condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of example to the free , prosperous , and independent citizens of the United States , this is by far the most important consequence of the " Credit System . " That such has been the effect of its operation , we have only to refer our readers to a work of the highest authority-MARsHALL 'S STATIsTIcs OF ThE BRITISH ExPIRE . Among the exhibits contained in the seventh volume , may be found a statement , which elucidates this point more conclusively than could be done by any quantity of argumentative deduction . By a careful analysis of the latest population returns , it is shown that all the inhabitants of the three kingdoms amounting to t*venty-four million three hundred and six thousand seven hundred and nineteen , are devoted to a condition of laborious and unremitting exertion for their subsistence , excepting two hundred and seventy-five thousand two hundred and four individuals belonging to the higher classes-consisting of nobility , capitalists , bankers // &amp;c . Of these exclusive favorites of the " Credit System , " one hundred and seventy-nine thousand , nine hundred and eighty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and four , in Wales ; twenty-nine thousand , two hundred and three , in Scotland ; and sixty-one thousand , five hundred and fourteen , in Ireland . Taking the whole together , the result of the artificial state of things brought about by this system is , that nearly one hundred individuals have been brought down to a state of permanent servitude-we will not use the offensive term slavery-in order to maintain each of these unproductive consumers in affluence and splendor ! The details for each county in the three kingdoms , are furnished in the volume in cjuestion , showing the number of persons employed in agriculture , in each of the handicraft trades , in manufactures &amp;c . How well justified was John Taylor of Caroline-one of the most sagacious of the great men of Virginia , during her brightest era of intellectual power , in declaring that the operation of the banking system must inevitably produce a more universal and degrading condition of dependence , than the feudal system was ever able to effect ! In his masterly performance , the " Inquiry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Taylor distinctly portrays the conflict between the principles of the Credit System , and those upon which the vital interests of the people of any free country are based . In precise accordance with his explanations of these consequences , the population of Great Britain and Ireland , are now reduced to a condition far more deplorable than the serfs of Poland and Russia , since the general diffusion of knowledge only serves to render the former sensible of their entanglement in the political spider 's web wound about them by the Credit System , and to convince them that nothing short of revolution can extricate them , by breaking at once these artificial restraints upon their means of comfort . Mr. Marshall has condensed the results of the Credit System of England , into a single sentence at the close of the introductory remarks , prefixed to the sixth volume of his work , published at the commencement of the present year . He observes that- " the progressively increasing privation and degradation of a great portion of the population amid a progressive accumulation of capital ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unparalleled extension of mechanical power , and increased facility of intercourse ; successive alternations of seeming prosperity and extreme depression ; progressively increasing pauperism , and its concomitant crime ; and threatened change of long established institutions-are all circumstances which call imperiously for the most profound consideration and regard of all the friends of social order and integrity of interests . " In full view of such a picture , drawn by a person of great ability and high character , who has devoted many years of his life to the // collection and arrangement of the facts to which it refers ; we find in our principal cities , a voluble , hustling class of individuals , who constantly employ their powers of persuasion to convince the citizens of this free country , that the principles of currency and finance which have led to these results in the land of our origin , is of all others , best suited to ourselves . Their arguments generally remind us of La Fontaine 's fable of the Man and the wild Horse . The convenience and advantages of riding , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of being ridden , are , to reflecting minds not quite so satisfactory , however plausibly and ingeniously set forth . So much pains have been taken to satisfy the people of the United States , that the policy of England on the subject of currency , are based upon just and true principles , that it seems necessary to remind our readers of the source and progress of the modern " Credit System . " Sensible and judicious individuals are often led to adopt extravagant opinions from the want of sufficient materials for forming general and consequential views . The various circumstances which have gradually brought about the corruption of the very lifeblood , which nourishes the body of the community , under which England now labors , ( and to produce a similar result , unwearied efforts have been made in our own country , ) is not only deeply interesting to every reflecting mind , but a brief narrative sho*viug the principal stages by which this system has reached its present magnificence , will serve to explain the condition of English society developed by Mr. Marshall more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the History of England , are aware of the leading circumstances attending the most important occurrence which has befallen that monarchy in modern times  --  the Revolution of 1688 . That great event established for the first time in England , the principle , that all government is a trust for the benefit of the governed , who are not to be regarded , even in a hereditary monarchy , as the absolute property of the King . However this might conflict with the maxims of the fundamental laws , Somers , and the leading Whig statesmen of that day , overturned without ceremony , the doctrines that the King could do no wrong , and that the Royal authority descended by right of hereditary succession , by declaring James II . to have forfeited the crown , and bestowing the Supreme Executive Authority upon William LII. , a foreigner who had married the eldest daughter of the dethroned King . This transcendent invasion of the royal prerogative was imperiously demanded by the grossest measures of misgovernment , as well as the most clearly established designs , concerted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIV. , against the permanent welfare of the people of England . So strong was the feeling throughout the nation against the measures of the King , that // till ranks and parties acquiesced in his expulsion from the throne , though the consequences of this step became subsequently the occasion of violent party dissentions . James sought refuge with his patron in France . The change of succession was the cause of protracted and most expensive wars with that power , based upon the identical pretexts with those between the two countries a century afterwards ; the difference being , that in the last instance , it was France , instead of England , which had ( lethroned her monarch . This contest not only laid the foundation of the present Credit System of England , but was the immediate occasion of the existing condition of that of France , which is regarded with so much antipathy by Mr. Carey . The bulk of the English Nation had acquiesced in the change of succession under the Act of Settlement . But the enormous expenditures , which proved to be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large proportion of the landholders , upon whom , at that period , the weight of taxation mainly fell , to consider the question in a different point of view from that in which it had been originally presented . For the purpose of avoiding the embarrassments which thickened upon the English ministry Jrom this ominous quarter , they adopted various expedients for temporary relief . The principal mode of alleviating the clamors of the land-holders who controlled both Houses of Parliament , against the increase of taxation , was the borrowing a great portion of the increased expenses , to carry on the war , upon annuities which were alone to be discharged by the current revenue . Even the despotic government of Louis XLV. , independent as it was of any recourse to popular assemblies , was obliged to incur vast anticipations of its revenues , from the impossibility of providing by taxation for the current expenditures of the war . During the pecuniary difficulties in which the two Governments of England arid France were involved in different periods of the war , two Scotchmen presented themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the relief of their most distressing malady  --  the want of money . There can be no doubt but William Patterson was the original projector of that ingenious system , which of late has been the theme of eulogy from so many eloquent individuals , as the greatest of human discoveries . The Scotch Darien Company , organized for the purpose of controlling the commerce of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a communication across the Isthmus , and which was the foundation of the famous South Sea scheme , and the Bank of England-both based upon the same general principles , and both devised by Patterson , show that the world was indebted for the invention of the " Credit System , " to him and not to John Law , who was twenty years his junior . This invention has immortalized the two distinguished financiers who // carried into operation , in the respective kingdoms of Great Britain and France , the great modern improvement by which States and individuals are rendered more wealthy and prosperous wholly from the single fact of being plunged into debt and embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maladies , this great remedy is inoperative unless where unlimited confidence is placed in its potency . Whenever faith is implicit and universal , the powers of relief possessed by this system are marvellous indeed . Not*vithstanding the perplexities in which the English ministry of the time were involved , from the vast expenses of the war , they listened with great jealousy and caution to the flattering pictures of ease and affluence drawn by the glowing fancy of Patterson . Both Somers and Godoiphin , who were the soul of the measures for sustaining the Protestant succession , were so deficient in confidence , that not until one million two hundred thousand pounds sterling , in cash , was actually paid into the Royal Treasury by him and his associates , would they consent that the Bank of England should become a corporation . This loan formed its original capital , which in the days of Walpole was increased to nearly ten millions , under circumstances we shall have occasion to explain . The privileges conferred in the first instance on the Bank , were exceedingly narrow , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Walpole the limitations upon its powers were enforced with such strictness , though it furnished from time to time considerable facilities in effecting the anticipations which had already become an important part of the financial policy of England , that no immediate and palpable inconvenience then resulted from its operations to the public at large . It therefore gradually acquired the confidence of the mercantile community , and was thus by degrees prepared to discharge the political functions which were afterwards devolved upon it . But the similar projects of John Law fell upon more congenial soil . They were soon adopted by the French Government , upon a scale of magnificence greatly exceeding the schemes for making money plentiful* which , after his pattern , have been devised in our own time and country . The Royal Bank of France was establishedthe capital stock of which , like that of the Bank of England , and the first and second Banks of the United States , all resting upon the same general principles , was principally composed of the public ( lebt . Paper currency was soon issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity throughout France . Money became such a drug , that the ordinary rate of interest was reduced to two per cent . per annum . More than twelve hundred new coaches were at once set up in Paris by individuals who had realized fortunes by the operations of the Royal Bank . To ensure and perpetuate its success , Royal edicts were issued , ordering all // receivers of the revenue to accept only its paper for the public taxes , and all individuals were expressly prohibited from making any payments of sums above a hundred livres ( less than twenty dollars ) in any currency excepting bills of the Bank . Another measure was adopted for the purpose of preventing demands upon the Bank for coin , and for expelling specie from the kingdom , which surely ought to have reconciled Mr. Carey to the wisdom of French management , as it coincides precisely with his views of the injurious effects of a specie currency . An edict was issued , prohibiting any other corporation or individual , under the penalty of ten thousand livres , from having gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred livres , ( less than one hundred dollars . ) When these measures had been adopted , the scenes witnessed in the Rue Quinquempoix where the Royal Bank was located , rivalled in extravagance any which , within the two or three years past , have been exhibited in Wall or Chesnut street . A dividend of forty per cent . was soon afterwards declared by the Royal Bank , which still held reserved l ) rofits to an amount exceeding one hundred and twenty millions of livres . Its shares now rose to more than twenty times their original cost . For an adequate idea of the avidity which pervaded all classes of society from the very highest to the lowest , for embarking in the Royal Bank , we must refer our readers to contemporary descriptions , which may be found in abundance in the memoirs of several dis . tinguished individuals who flourished at that day . They likewise depict , in terms of execration sufficiently strong against its inventor , the universal ruin which overspread the kingdom when this scheme exploded . The operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philadelphia school-somewhat tinged , perhaps , with the infatuation of which we have seen quite sufficient examples among ourselves under similar temptations , and which always accompanies such speculations among sanguine people-are not only the main source of the want of credit and confidence in all paper currency which prevails , up to the present day , among the people in every part of France , which Mr. Carey censures with so much severity , but this general overthrow of all confidence and good faith , by means of the credit system , was undoubtedly the most powerful of any single cause in producing the French Revolution . The frauds and impositions which men had been enabled to practice upon each other , were aggravated by the general belief of the wanton oppression of the Government , resulting from the practical identity of the Royal Treasury with the Royal Bank . The distress arising from calamities of any kind came therefore to he habitually attributed to the Royal fiscal measures . Under the pressure of immediate want , the people of France ( 11 ( 1 not stop to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King and his ministers , might have produced the high price of bread which occasioned the tumults that brooght on the outrages which overthrew the Government . The people knew that prices had been extravagantly inflated by the connexion between the Government and the Royal Bank-they ac*ording1y attributed the famine , which rendered them desperate , to the measures of the Government . Popular jealousy had become so easily excited by the oppressive consequences of this unfortunate connexion , that even the talents and integrity of such men as Turgot and Neckar were wholly inadequate to satisfy the people as to the correct inaitagement of the public finances . We should probably have felt some surprise at the credulity and extravagance of any people , becoming frantic with rage against their rulers under such circumstances , if the censure to which our own Government has been from time to time subjected , from individuals of high character , had not sufficiently satisfied us , that the connexion of the public finances of any country with the " Credit System , " upon the Law and Patterson model , as was originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of popular feeling under the fluctuations it inevitably produces . The profits derived from the burdens unposed on the people are exclusively enjoyed by the Bank or Banks  --  but the censure which justly belongs to their mismanagement , is as a matter of course wholly thrown upon the Government . Accordingly the publication of Mr. Carey ascribes all the embarassments with which our citizens in every walk of life have been visited within the last three or four years , from the expansions and contractions of the banks , to the measures of the Executive of the Union . Excepting in a single instance , he does not undertake to explain the operation of these ( lestructive measures-and his single specification can hardly be regarded as a fortunate one for his purpose-since he has pitched upon the importation of the foreign indemnities in gold . Now if our memory serves , this importation was expressly desired by the claimants to whom the money belonged , in consequence of that mode of remittance affording them a greater degree of profit than any other , as may be seen by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Session . To charge this measure upon the Executive as an act of hostility to the mercantile interest-nay as the principal and specific act of that kind which could be mustered into the service on this great occasion-appears to be making an appeal to public credulity quite in character with the design of the publication . When the banks , last year , at once refused to discharge their obligations , both to the Government , for the vast amounts of public money held by hem , and to the community at large , this defiance of the laws , subversive of the highest interests // of society , is justified by a pretended necessity arising from the policy of the Government ! After the implicit faith given to such pretexts by individuals , who on most other subjects do not seem to be destitute of judgment and intelligence , we can realize the stupendous influence which the most absurd tales exercised over the inflammable passions of the French people which had been so long repressed by the most rigid tyranny . But to return to our account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , the great question of the Revolution of 1688 assumed a new aspect in England . It was conceded on all bands that James had been guilty while on the throne , of the high .. est outrages upon the rights of his subjects . But now the offender had died , ought the penalty for these enormities to be inflicted on his son and heir-an infant but five months old when his father was expelled from the throne ? At the very foundation of the laws under which the land owners of Great Britain inherited their estates from their ancestors , lay the fundamental prnci pIe of the hereditary succession of the crown . They had acquiesced in expelling James as the only mode of effectually protecting their rights and liberties . But influential individuals among them began to express scruples after his death , as to the right of extending this forfeiture to his heir , and making him the victim of the misdeeds of his father , of which he was equally innocent and unconscious , at the time they were committe ( l . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of the burdens of taxation , which the support of the public credit required under the practice of borrowing , on ruinous annuities , the principal sums necessary to carry on the war . The public feeling became so strong and general on this subject , that no doubt now exists that the last ministry of Queen Anne had determined to bring about the restoration of the Stuarts , but their plans were frustrated by her opportune death . The head of the House of Hanover accordingly ascended the British throne under the provisions of the Act of Settlement . Unacquain ted alike with the language , habits , and views of the people of England , George I. was politically dependent upon the individual he had selected for Prime Minister-Sir Robert Walpole , afterwards Earl of Orford . He was unquestionably a person of great ability and greater dexterity . Those who are curious in parallels between individuals of former times and those of our own day and nation , will discover many points of similarity between the character of Walpole and of distinguished personages among ourselves , whowith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the application of the term to politicians of a former generation-affect to imitate him , by calling themselves WInGS . Plausible and ingenious in his eloquence , unprincipled in his measures , and profligate in his personal habits , he avowed that his // measures for maintaining the Guelph family on the throne were wholly based upon personal corruption . Beyond the disguises necessary to avoid shocking the public sensibility , he evinced a total disregard for all those virtues which , in every age and country , are essential to the preservation of the blessings of good government . The prejudices to which we have referred , as pervading the bulk of the landholders against the ilanoverian dynasty , induced Walpole to organize an efficient influence which , by its general diffusion throughout all ranks and classes , and the zeal and activity of those acting under its impulse , might serve to counteract the power of the owners of the soil . He accordingly arranged the funding system upon a new footing-substantially the same upon which it remains at the present time  --  and adopted various expedients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who produced the bubble mania during the earlier years of George I. The South Sea scheme , resulting from the original plan of Patterson before referred to , soon became so popular that its stock rose to a thousand per cent . above its par value . Among numerous other projects inflated by the financiers of that period , there was one for raising flax in Pennsylvania , the stock of which sold in London for fifteen hundred per cent . Those who may wish to obtain authentic information as to the fancy stocks of that time , may find an ample fund of entertainment and instruction in the third volume of Ma*pherson 's Annals of Commerce . The explosion of these bubbles impaired public confidence to such an extent as not only to have nearly ruined the Bank of England , but to have hazarded the ascendency both of Walpole and the dynasty of which he was the main support . With his usual dexterity , he however succeeded in turning these disastrous results of the Credit System to his advantage , by the pretexts they afforded for increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond what would have been sanctioned by Parliament , but from the necessity of affording relief for the general distress which prevailed . He by this means was enabled to give it new weight and importance as the focus of his schemes of corruption . He then modelled his plans of taxation in such a manner as to raise supplies , as far as possible , from those classes of the community who exercised the least influence in Parliamentary elections . The land tax was lessened from the ratio imposed in the previous reigns , and all money and funded property was wholly exempted from any portion of the public burdens , the weight of which was provided for by customs upon the importation of foreign commodities , fixed at moderate rates , that commerce might not be discouraged , and mainly by assessed taxes and excise duties upon the necessaries of life . By this arrangement , which has become the established financial policy of the British Government , the productive classes are // made to sustain that inordinate share of the expenses of the State , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually pressed them down to their present degraded condition . The measures adopted by Walpole for the purpose of counteract . ing the political control possessed by the owners of the soil , resulted in arraying the whole kingdom into the two great parties , continually referred to in the publications of that period , by the names of the monied interest and the landed interest . The principles which originally separated the Whigs and Tories were wholly lost sight of , when royal prerogative gave way to ministerial influence as the predominating power of government . The credit system was now in full operation in its present shape . Its great engine , the Bank of England , was freed from the greater portion of the restrictions previously imposed , by law upon its management-its capital stock made ample , and its efficient means of control over the business and business men of the kingdom , by alternately exciting hopes of gain , and apprehensions of loss , through the skilful management of paper currency and public debt , had become fully understood by those in power . The preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , require Walpole to task the vast influence which this great machine of Scottish invention , but enlarged , improved , and , in short , newly arranged by himself , was able to exert upon a trading and manufacturing people . But his successors , who did not entertain similar feelings towards the landed interest , pursued a different course . His pacific temper , and love of personal ease , led him to prefer the quiet employment of personal corruption upon influential individuals , whose services he desired , rather than the more ambitious mode of endeavoring to overcome the opposition of the land owners to the Hanoverian dynasty , by holding out great temptations to their leaders as a class . Since his time , how many of the expensive wars into which England has been plunged , have been prolonged from the necessity of providing for the dependent branches of the aristocracy , by the increase of the public establishments , whose officers have always been principally drawn from that class , and to build up fortunes for them by means ofthejobs and contracts growing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the channel to the great depths of corruption , by organizing the credit system  --  but left it to his successors to explore its foul recesses . The great revolution in the ownership of landed property , which the operation of this system has brought about in England , had hardly commenced at the close of his long continuance in power . The expenditure of the war which succeeded his retirement , and of the seven years ' war , bore heavily upon the small proprietors . The increase of taxation occasioned by these wars , combined with the inequality and injustice of the // distribution of its burdens , together with the increase of luxurious habits , inseparable from the prevalence of suddenly acquired , or factitious wealth , soon began to extirpate that ancient race of independent yeomanry who cultivated their own soil , and who had for centuries constituted the bone and sinew of the English nation , and were its strength in war , and its ornament and glory in peace . Year after year these families , most of whom had succeeded to patrimonial farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them derived their titles from the dissolution of monasteries , and many of them from a far more distant era , gradually sunk under the pressure of this system , until at the present time , few of this class can be found extant , in any part of the kingdom . Their small estates have been , by degrees , engulphed by the wholesale acquisitions of the paper-money Lords , as the great capitalists are familiarly termed , and the families of the former owners have been reduced into the mass of tenants , manufacturers , artisans , and paupers , of which the number of the latter is now much greater than of the affluent class . Upon the succession of George III. , in 1760 , the prejudices against the Hanoverian dynasty disappeared . The young King was a native of England , and had been educated under the direction of Lord Bute , in all the mysteries of King-craft approved by the school of the Stuarts . The landed aristocracy , before that time , had largely participated throughout their different branches , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naval establishrneKlts kept up by England in every quarter of the globe ; and some of the most opulent of this class had become interested in her national debt , which at the peace of Paris in 1763 , had already reached one hundred and forty-five million pounds sterling , equivalent to about seven hundred millions of dollars . During the previous wars the mow jed interest and the trading community , had realized vast profits from the loans negotiated , as well as the supplies required to carry on hostilities at home and abroad , which became permanent burdens upon the public resources . The private interests of these predominating classes were , therefore , intimately combined in maintaining the credit system as established by Walpole , upon immoveable foundations ; and from the accession of George III , this system is to be regarded as a paramount princi-. pIe in the practical government of Great Britain , and serves to explain much of its policy that must otherwise be regarded as unaccountable . It does not come within the scope of our present design , to endeavor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly attributed to this system , in originating and fomenting the ruinous contest which resulted in the independence of the United States of America . The continued popularity of this unnatural // war in Parliament , and among the leading classes in England , under the great disasters which it occasioned , may be fairly ascribed , in a great degree , to the lavish expenditure of public money which it produced , and by which it was much aggravated and prolonged . The irresistible temptation for borrowing money to be expended by individuals principally for the benefit of each other , and to be charged upon future generations was found to be so overpowering to human cupidity , that had not the commerce and manufactures of England been brought to the verge of ruin , and the sufferings of her productive classes become insupportable , it seems probable that the very extravagance of the public outlay required to carry on this war , would have induced its continuance for a much longer period . The pretext under which it began , was the necessity of drawing a revenue from America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was the addition of above a hundred millions of pounds sterling to the permanent burdens of the British nation . We are compelled to pass over the instructive lessons upon the results of the Credit System , which the annals of England afford , during the few years succeeding the American war , and come at once to the great epoch  --  the wars growing out of the French Revolution . At this day probably not an individual can be found , either in Europe or America , who has bestowed the attention upon the subject necessary to form an opinion , who will not admit that the necessity for the interference of England with the internal Government of France , which was the sole pretext of the war , was the preservation of the " Credit System . " The alarm which the doctrines , and , above all , the measures adopted by the French people for the subversion of the existing institutions which had impoverished and oppressed them for the sole advantage of the privileged classes , produced in every part of Europe , was nowhere so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial and unequal system of finance and taxation , which we have endeavored to explain . The French people , excited by the transports of their recent liberty , with the innate extravagance of their national character , rioted in excesses , which afforded the only grounds for a war , the main object of which was avowed by Mr. Pitt to be , to prevent the dissemination of French principle .. The flame of war was regarded by the English rulers , as the only efficient mode of neutralizing the contagion which the example and success of the French had produced among the middle and lower ranks in England , under the weight of taxation with which they were burdened . This struggle lasted more than twenty years . As its main object was the support of the Credit System of England , we shall merely glance at its effects upon that system , and upon the people under its control . The outrages in France , which resulted in the overthrow of the von . Iii . NO. xI. - NOv. 0 // monarchy , originated , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . For the purpose of aggravating the calamities of the French people under the vain hope of subduing them by starvation , an order in council was issued by the English Government in 1793 , directing that vessels of every nation laden with breadstuffs , bound to France , should be brought into England . This was the first of these high-handed infractions of nentral rights , which afterwards became so common in the subsequent stages of this bloody contest , and was the occasion of that remai7kable discussion in the cabinet of President Washington , between the Secretary of State , Mr. Jefferson , and the Secretary of the Treasury , Mr. Hamilton , which forms an important era in our own political history . Immense quantities of grain and flour were brought to England by this measure , and placed the Government in a dilemma , to escape from which , its interference with the subsistence of the people began , which has since been pursued to such an oppressive extent , by its corn laws . This importation had created so much alarm among those dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks-of which a greater number were closed by commissions of bankruptcy during that year than had ever before occurred . To avert this in jury , inflicted upon the most important political interest in the kingdom , Government were compelled to purchase and warehouse the imported grain upon its own account . This purchase was iiade by an issue of exchequer bills , which , with the other issues required by the public service , created an amount of paper currency at the close of 1796 , of more than twenty-five millions sterling , independent of the issues of the Bank of England , amounting to about nine millions and one-half , and those of the private banks , estimated at half that sum . The credit of the whole depended upon the stock of the precious metals in the Bank of England , the amount of which , under the practice which then prevailed , was unknown to the public , but which , by the publication of the accounts of the Bank by the Committee of Secrecy of the House of Commons of 1832 , appears to have been but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under engagements of subsidy to Austria and Prussia , for the purpose of carrying on the war against France , amounting to six millions sterling . The French victories in Italy  --  the disturbed state of Ireland  --  the mutiny in the fleet , from the oppressions practised on the s* ilors  --  the failure of several banks in the north of England-and the unsatisfactory temper of the tax-paying population , all together , had produced a high degree of consternation in the minds of the directors of the Bank , who laid before Mr. Pitt , then Prime Minister , a statement of the condition of that institution , shewing the impossibility of sustaining a run for specie should a panic take place , as was then strongly apprehended . During the // few days following , the demand for cash evidently increasing , an order in council was issued , on Sucdav t**e twenty-sixth of February , directing the Bank to suspend specie payments , which was sanctioned by Parliament on the ne. ; t ( lay , making a legal provision that all payments accepted in bank notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors an ( l receivers of the revenues should take hank notes in payment . The principal capitalists , bankers , and merchants , all of whom were deeply interested in support of the existing system , publicly pledged themselves to support the credit of the Bank paper ; and new and severe laws against seditious practices were enacted to prevent complaint on the part of the mass of society , whose wages were not raised , though all prices of commodities and the expenses of living soon became greatly enhanced hy this practical destruction of the standard of value , for the benefit of the higher classes . But notwithstandin* of the severity of the laws against combinations among the other classes-when they saw paraded in every quarter , the statement that three thousand of the principal bankers and merchants of London had combined for the purpose of sustaining an irredeemable paper currency , the profuse issue of which had begun so materially to increase their burdens , they soon found themselves compelled by the great principle of self-preservation to orbanize themselves for the purpose of effecbing a correspondent rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consequences produced such an injurious effect upon the true and permanent welfare of the most industrious , moral , and frugal of the operatives in Great Britain , and have led to the infliction of so many evils upon the the mass of society , became general under this necessity . For a considerable period , as bank notes were freely received in all the most important payments , and the English . gold coin in actual circulation previously , was estimated to exceed twelve millions sterling , very little in convenience was felt from any practical difference in the currency between paper and specie . Up to the year 1800 , the market price of foreign gold and bullion did not exceed an average of seven per cent . premium . From 1800 to 1809 it ranged from ten to fifteen per cent . We take these prices from Wettenhall 's lists , which are regarded as the highest authority on these subjects . Great difficulties and confusion then began to arise in the adjustment of contracts between man and man . Innumerable publications were made on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercantile classes were , that bank notes had not depreciated , but gold had risen in price . In 1810 Mr. homer 's famous Report of the Bullion Committee , brought the whole question before Parliament ; and , after prolone.ed ( lebates , the Ilouse of Commons adopted Mr. Vansittart 's resolutions by an overwhelming // majority-declaring that the notes of the Bank of England were equivalent to the current coin of the realm , and that the high price of bullion was not occasioned by the Bank restriction , nor by any excess in the issues of the Bank . Immediately after this , Lord King , who inherited the views of his great kinsman , John Locke , on the subject of currency , as well as on questions of general  |p0-licy  , notified his numerous tenantry that , having contracted to P*Y their ancient rents in lawful money , he should require of them either gold coin in payment , or a sufficient amount of bank notes to purchase , at the market price , the weight of standard gold necessary to discharge them . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Commons . A bill was introduced making it penal to pass guineas of full weight in payment for more than twenty-one shillings each , and taking away the legal right of distraining for rent from landlords , to whom the nominal sum due should be tendered in notes of the Bank of England . It was , at the same time , proposed to make bank notes a legal tender , but the country having been plunged into unforeseen difficulties already , no one could undertake to predict the consequences of such a step ; and this proposition , after an animated debate , was withdrawn . Among the curious results of this law , as finally passed , was its offering a premium for making guineas lighter than their legal weight . A full guinea could not be offered nor received for more than twenty-one shillings , under a severe penalty  --  but one diminished , was worth at that time , from twenty-eight to thirty shillings , and might be lawfully passed at that value . Afterwards , in 1813 , when gold bore a premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who may be inclined to pursue this highly interesting and most important subject , will find , in the Parliamentary d*bates of that period , a fund of information . In an article of this kind it is impossible for us to thread the labyrinth into which the credit system was involved during this suspension . Among the most important results of the war expressly waged for its support , was the addition of nearly eight hundred millions sterling , or about three thousand six hundred millions of dollars , to the public debt of Great Britain and Ireland , if we include the mockery of the sinking fund , by which the people were so long deluded* During the year 1797 anml 1798 the price of three per cent . stock was as low as forty-eight , and large loans were negociated on public account at this rate , payment being made in bank notes ; for one hundred pounds by which upwards of two hundred pounds were added to the capital of the national debt . Subsequently stock rose to an average of fifty-five to sixty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to , were negotiated . Recently , the price of the same stock has generally been from ninety to ninetyfive ; and the vast profits made by the contractors upon such enor // mous sums from this advance alone , may be understood . I-lad the loans been negotiated at the current rate of interest at the time the money was needed , the holders might have been required to accept the subsequent market rate of interest , or be paid off by a new loan negotiated at the market rate . By increasing the capital instead of the rate of interest , it is placed wholly out of the power of the government of the present day , to relieve the public from any part of the burdens imposed by the improvident contracts made during the war , and leaves no remedy for the evil but invading the capital itself . Profligate as this arrangement may appear , its effect upon the tax-paying population was trifling compared with compelling them to change three thousand millions of dollars of public debt-contracted in paper bearin* , a discount , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of it when paper was upwards of twenty-five per cent . discouut ,  --  into the same nominal amount in gold* This was the consummation of injustice towards those on whom are imposed the burdens of the State . It was , however , only one of the many maumuvres by which money was legislated out of the pockets of the mass of society , into those of the managers of the Credit-System-precisely like that by which Hamilton , by his corrupt scheme for funding the debt of the Revolution , gave twenty shillin*s of the public money to his supporters for what had cost them but two and six pence . The course pursued by the Emperor of Russia in equalizing 14*ie currency of his vast Empire after the wars with Napoleon , were governed by a different principle . Russia has participated in the advantages of the Credit System on a large scale . The Imperial Bank of Russia suspended payment for several years , and its issues of paper had been so prodigal as to have fallen into great depreciation , compared with specie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specie standard at the nominal rate , without producing almost an universal overthrow of property . It became a brave and difficult question to determine how the commerce of the country could be carried on under the existing medium , or how an equal and stable currency could be substituted without ruining nearly every person who had entered into contracts . Under these embarrassments the Emperor Alexander , had the good sense to ask the advice and opinion of three of the most distinguished financiers in the worldMr . Alexander Baring , of London , now Lord Ashburton , Mr. Gallatin , of New York , and Baron Dupin , of Paris . They concurred that to require debts contracted in a depreciated medium , to be paid in specie , would be the height of injustice , and must lead to deplorable consequences . As the best mode of avoiding greater difficulties , though not itself free from objection , it was recommended by these experienced and judicious advisers , that as depreciated paper had been allowed to become the practical measure of value , // in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been entered into , it was impossible to realise the essential benefits of a metallic currency in reference to those contracts , excepting by an equitable and definite rate of depreciation . The advice was adopted , and the ratio of payment in specie , upon all previous contracts , was prescribed by law . As far as could be possible by a general measure of this kind , substantial justice was thus done , both to public and private creditors . But in England , all* public and private engagements , to an aggregate amount which fancy can hardly realize when expressed in thousands of millions of dollars , and which had been contracted in reference to a paper currency depreciated from ten to forty-five per cent . below specie , were at once required to be paid in gold . This measure enhanced the burdens imposed upon the tax-payers , as well as upon every person whose outstanding debts exceeded the sums due to him , to an incalculable amount . In adopting it , the interests of the wealthy were alone constilted . Every other class of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect is exhibited in one of the returns annexed to the Report of the Committee of Secrecy upon the Bank of England in 1832 , by which it appears that up to that time there had been divided in bonuses and extra dividends among the stockholders , in addition to a permanent dividend of seven per cent . upon the capital stock , upwards of fourteen millions sterling , or nearly seventy millions of dollars It would have been obviously impossible to secure the acquiescence of the landed interest , who exercised , at that time , a more powerful comparative influence in Parliament than at present under the operation of the Reform bill , in such a measure , had not their interests been ostensibly provided for by that supplement to the Credit System  --  the Corn Laws . During the century preceding 1797 , the price of the agricultural staple of England , wheat , had not averaged forty shillings per quarter , or five shillings sterling a bushel , taking one year with another . The average amount of the circulation of the Bank of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of private bankers about four millions . When the restriction of specie payments took away every check from the coiners of paper money , but the moderation of their own desires for the acquisitions of property , the issues of the Bank of England increased to twenty- eight millions , and those of private bankers to about twenty-two millions . The natural consequence of this monstrous inflation , was not only a great increase in the price of wheat , and of all articles of subsistence , but great improvidence of engagements of every kind . During the suspension of specie payments , the average price of wheat was upwards of eighty shillings per quarter or more than ten shillings sterling a bushel , it was a nece*sary corrollary of the measure by which the national burd:ens // were enhanced , that some step be adopted which should enable the landlords to receive their rents , as well as the holders of the debt , their dividends . The corn laws were therefore devised for the purpose of keeping up the prices of a ricultural produce , at the unequal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System , by shutting out all competition from the English markets excepting on occasions of scarcity , precisely on the principle , that the tariff laws of this country were contrived to sustain our manufactures under the expansions of our own currency . Like all artificial schemes for counteracting the natural course of things , the Corn Laws have inflicted an incalculable amount of positive suffering upon the industrious classes of England , without subs*antially benefiting those in favor of whom they were imposed . The deep dissatisfaction which generally prevails throughout the middling and lower classes , which ha alre*dy produced the Reform of the I-louse of Commons , and threatens from its daily i. crease to effect still more important organic changes in the British Constitution , may be principally ascribe ( l to this iniquitous legislation in favor of particular interests . It appears to be im1 ) ossible that a system which sacrifices the security and xvell-heing of so many millions of the most valuable portion of the pol ) ulation , for the advantage of a few thousands , should in the present age be permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of keeping up the vents of the great landholders  --  and the vast burden of taxation imposed on almost every thing which enters into human consumption ,  --  excepting perhaps , only the air ,  --  which are rendered necessary by the expenses of the public debt , contracted and enhanced in the manner we have described , amounting at this time to more than one hundred and fifty millions of dollars a year , besides the vast expenditure required to support the army , navy , and great public **25;1075;TOOLONG with the moderate remuneration for labor , can hardly fail to produce greater innovations in the form of government at no very distant period . 11cr present situation appears fully to justify one of the most distinguished of her recent historians , in denouncing " those twin-curses of England-paper money and public credit . " Among a people so generally well informed and so clear-sighted with regard to their interests as those of Great Britain , the great Democratic principle of self-government roust sooner or later assert its natural rights , in placing a proportionate share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public burdens upon industry . While the people of the English nation have been thus sinking in the scale of comfort and personal independence , far different has been the fate of the French . From the era of their Revolution their condition has been continually improving . Travellers on the Continent of Europe previous to 1790 were invariably accustomed // to institute comparisons between the comfort of the full-fed laboring classes of England , and the destitute , poverty-stricken peasantry of France . The books of English tourists for half a century were filled with these parallels . The contrast at the present time is much stronger in favor of the French . Though they have sustained the enormous expenditure of the wars of Napoleon-the ravages of two general invasions of their territory  --  the burden of indemnities to the Allied Powers to an immense amount as well as to their own emigrant nobility -- still the great mass of the people of France have been constantly progressing in general improvement of condition . At the present time there arc at leas.t ten times more independent proprietors of land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the ownership of the soil has been concentrating in England into the hands of the few , it has been distributing in France into those of the many . This is one of the inevitable consequences of the different systems of financial legislation which have been pursued in the two countries since the French Revolution . J'he one has had a tendency to enrich and render independent the middling classes  --  the other as we have seen , has impoverished the mass of the community for the purpose of adding to overgrown fortunes . As the former result is diametrically opposed to the object of the " CreditSystem " it meets with the most pointed censure throughout Mr. Carey 's publication . His remarks upon the commercial classes in France , partake strongly of the feelings of those days when French Jacobins were held up to popular odium by a portion of the politicians of this country , through the application of the most extravagant epithets which our language could furnish . Because the currency of France is principally metallic , there being in circulation at this time according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver exceeding six hundred millions of dollars in that Kingdom  --  the consequence of the former experience of the French people in the blessings of the Credit System-Mr . Carey charitably ascribes this preference of a solid and equal currency , to the total absence of common honesty throughout France ! He even permits his prejudices against metallic humbugs to carry him so far as to assert , that " the foreign trade of France has been in a great measure destroyed by frauds in the preparation of commodities for exportation ! " That the foreign commerce of that country is not so extensive as might be expected in the present condition of the world , considering the vast resources and local advantages of that wealthy and powerful Kingdom , is to be attributed rather to her mistaken policy in restricting the importation of many of the productions of other nations , than to any want of good faith and personal integrity in her manufacturers and merchants-who will probably compare with advantage with those of most other nations . // The statement which we have quoted , is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have derived others , upon which he founds several disparaging remarks relative to the commercial intercourse of France , from the letters of Michel Chevalier , who travelled extensively in this country three or four years since , and is well known to many of our citizens . M. Chevalier is a person possessing very strong powers of description , and is a writer for the Journal des Debats  --  a political journal of considerable notoriety at Paris . An individual really disposed to gather facts relative to the character and policy of our own country for an authentic publication , would be quite as excusable for taking the authority of that race of letter writers by whom the reputation of our own newspaper press has been so much injured from their habitual libels upon truth and decency . From whatever origin the statements of Mr. Carey are derived-it is obvious from the character of the greater part of them , that he has not bestowed the slightest regard upon their accuracy . Throughout the work the attention of an ordinary reader is kept constantly on the stretch by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck us at opening of the book , is a fair specimen . In illustrating the barbarity prevtiiling in France from the absence of paper currency , compared with the prosperity and abundance of England -- he says upon his second page : The owner of a loom in India takes more than half of the product and lives in poverty and wretchedness . The owner of a few looms in Lyons takes one half of the product . The workman receives for his share only one half . Both are poor . The owner of looms in England and the United States takes one tenth , leaving nine ti*.nths to the laborer-hoth are enabled to live well , and constantly to improve their condition . " This exposition of the melancholy state of things in other countries at the very commencement of such a publication , was calculated to create some surprise . It must immediately occur to all well informed men that nothing like a loom-such as is employed by the manufacturers of England and this country , is to be found in India-where cloth is made principally in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive his lower limbs under the shade of a tree , upon which he hangs his gearing -- and instead of treddles , and the other appliances of our looms , uses his toes for the purpose of springing the threads of his warp to receive his long rude shuttle . That it is the general practice for the owners of looms at Lyons to require half their products , is so manifestly absurd as not to merit formal refutation . Soon after the invention of that woederful monument of ingenuity-  --  the Jacquard Loom , with which an ignorant workman is able , without assistance , to execute fabrics of the greatest elegance and variety of figure , which before this invention were within the power of only a few of the most skilful and intelligent weavers , aided by drawboys , it may // have been that half the products of these complicated machines were required by their owners . But that the owners of the looms for weaving plain stuffs at Lyons , which are evidently referred to by Mr. Carey , take one half of their products , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufactories of this country receive nine tenths of the profits of their labor  --  or as that the laboring classes in England are remarkable at the present time for their abundant living and constant improvement of condition . It surely would be treating the understanding and information possessed by all classes of the American people with too great a decree of contempt , to suppose that many of these statements of facts set forth by Mr. Carey , required the slightest comment . We shall instance a few others hereafter . As to the general effect of the sound and equal currency which has prevailed in France since she had the wisdom to profit by the lessons taught by the great disasters brought upon all her productive interests by theCredit System , we shall content ourselves with quoting the evi ( lence of the London Quarterly Review for January 1816 , in an authoritative article upon the Congress of Vienna . No one acquainted with the political influence under which the Quarterly was established , an ( l has been since conducted , will accuse it of undue partiality towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its conductors have always manifested towards that nation , even exceeds that of Mr. Carey . At the close of the long war , the consequences of which upon the prosperity of the English nation we have endeavored to describe , the Reviewers say : - " In point of fact the finances of France , are , strange as it may appear , in a far more flourishing condition than those of any of her neighbors : while the resources of every other State have been gradually exhausted in the late contest , she has fewer financial difficulties to contend with at this moment , than any of the Powers which were lately opposed to her . " This remarkable freedom from the internal embarrassments in which all the other continental nations were deeply involved in consequence of their servile imitation of the Credit System of England -- sporting with the prosperity of their industrious population by the abuse of paper currency for the advantage of the few-must be wholly attributed to a steadfast adherence in the midst of unprecedented difficulties , to a just and inflexible measure of value by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assign ats after it had become settled from the disorders which attended the earlier stages of the Revolution . While all the other principal Continental Powers impoverished their subjects by sanctioning the circulation of a currency of depreciated bank paper , France , by simply avoiding this greatest of all national calamities , though finally conquered in this great struggle , came out of the contest with her internal energies and resources unimpaired* // After the enormous waste and sacrifices of a war , waged upon a scale which had never before been witnessed in any part of the world , her people had not been delivered up to be plundered by artificial engines of extortion under the pretext of affording them relief from their burdens . Perhaps a more potent reason than evcn their preference for a metallic currency , has given rise to the invidious remarks of Mr. Carey upon the French people . Since they have relieved themselves from the consequences of the Credit System , their public finances have been wholly managed by responsible public officers , placed under the most efficient penalties in case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application to the public service . As the publication of Mr. Carey is designed to shew that individuals associated together for their own gain , by financial operations in paper money of their own creation are entitled by right to use the public revenue for private speculation , his prejudice against the French system of Finance might probably influence his views of their whole social polity . Having found occasion to dwell at so much length upon the results of the " Credit System " as presented by the existing condition of England and France , we can hardly command sufficient time or space in the present Article to complete our original design of giving a detailed exposition of the origin and consequences of the operation of this system among ourselves . We shall therefore content ourselves with a few remarks upon this topic , leaving it to the judgment and experience of our readers to suplv our deficiences from their own reflections . Before the adoption of our present form of Government , the United States , as well as most of the individual States , were deeply embarrassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed by the losses and sacrifices of the war of the Revolution -- of which , those occasioned by the depreciation of paper currency were by far the most hostile to the return of prosperity , since they weakened not only all confidence and good faith among individuals , but led to a general distrust in the security of any form of government . the measures adopted to raise the revenues necessary for the support of the institutions of society , and those pursued by individuals for the recovery of debts , produced an intensity of distress throughout the Union which no language can adequately describe . Destitution of the means of payment became so general among the people , that armed combinations were organized to extort from the Legislature the privilege of paying obligations in paper currency . Relief was the rallying cry among the disorganizers from one end of the continent to the other . But the clear-sighted and honest patriots of that day , well understood the original source of all these calamities . The // abuse of paper currency had defrauded and brought into distress the bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speculators , into whose hands most of the available property had become concentrated . The issue of more paper would only increase the avidity of those bloodsuckers by further means of gratification . After remaining in a state of the most painful anxiety from insurrections and violent infractions of the laws in the best regulated sections of the Union for a considerable period , the great men by whose counsels and courage our National Independence had been achieved , despising the empirical remedy of paper money for the general distress , and taking counsel only from their high sense of justice and the public welfare , determined to prevent the recurrence of such evils by endeavouring to establish an efficient government which should secure the fruits of industry from such misguided attempts . The Convention was called for the purpose of framing a Constitution for the United States . The discussions which arose in this body , an outline of which will doubtless be found in the forthcoming work of Mr. Madison , and will be received with the deepest interest by every American , soon made it apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power necessary to be given to the General Government , for the prevention of anarchical excesses from popular excitement in the States , as well as the degree and tenure of the authority with which the Executive branch ought to be clothed . The disturbances which had arisen among the people for the purpose of compelling the States to ( leclare paper money a tender for debts , and the want of confidence in the people , to which we shall presently advert , induced a portion of the members to declare themselves in favor of a strong government practically independent of the people . A larger part of the Convention had determined to make as few innovations upon the existing institutions of the courttry , as might consist with sufficient power to assert our national rights abroad , and secure the protection of person and property at home . At the head of the supporters of a form of strong government , was Hamilton , a man of great industry , talent , and skill in managing mankind . He had come to this country but a short period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep preference towards the institutions of the nation of which he was born a subject . His whole knowledge of the American people had been gathered in the camp , and the artificial atmosphere of cities . Wholly distrustin g their capacity for self-government , he proposed a Chief Magistrate and Senate for life , to be invested with powers in effect , not only irresponsible , but self-elected . The power of the United States would , under this system , become the property of a close corporation into which none could have found // admittance but by the assent of the existing members for life . This was not the precise form , but such was the substance and inevitable result of Hamilton 's scheme of Government . His plan was powerfully resisted by Franklin , Madison , Randolph , Gerry* and several others who had spent the greatest portion of their lives among the freemen of the United States , and fully appreciated their character . It was rejected , and a form of Government resulting from a compromise between various conflicting views was with great difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the organization of the Government under the new Constitution , the important post of Secretary of the Treasury was offered by President Washington to Robert Morris , who had been Superintendent of Finances under the Confederation . He was a native of England and entertained the views of the monied interest of that country , as to the advantage of banks and paper currency which we have already explained . He had put these views into operation while Superintendent , by procuring the establishment of the Bank of North America , in which he placed about half a million of dollars imported in specie by the United States from France , being the only actual capital originally in the possession of the Bank-while the profits realized upon the issue of paper currency based upon this public money , were shared among the private stockholders , who barely contributed their bonds for the amount of their subscriptions . From the confidence which his good fortune in the management of the public finances had inspired in his own mind , as well as among his friends who had liberally participated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boldest character . Like many others who founded their hopes on the quicksands of the Credit System , he was seduced into enterprizes by which he was irretrievably ruined , and spent the latter part of his life within the jail limits . Among the greatest men of any age , President Washington , throughout his whole career , was remarkably distinguished by his anxiety to seek , and his inclination to follow advice . In selecting Morris for this situation , he doubtless acceded to the wisbes of his leading friends in Philadelphia-then , as now the focus of paper money speculation . But the Secretary of the Treasury would not be able to engage in private transactions based upon the public resources . Morris accordingly , no doubt , perceived that his interests would not be so much advanced by taking the office , as by having it placed in suitable hands . He therefore declined the appointment himself , and recommended Hamilton in his stead , who had been an Aid de Camp to the President , and enjoyed a large share of his confidence and esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of the Secretary of the Treasury , Hamilton received important assistance from the experience of his // friend and patron , Morris . The funding system was projected , enabling the holders of the public securities , most of which had been wrun* from the necessities of the brave defenders of the country , and those who had patriotically furnished them with supplies , at rates ran*Ing from one-quarter to one-eighth of their nominal amount , to charge them upon the public resources at the full sum , instead of their equitable value . By this unscrupulous measure , the monied n*tercst of the country was arrayed in support of the friends of strong overnment . After the example of Walpole they then arrane ( l the machinery by which their power might not only be extended over the whole community , but enabled to perpetuate itself by self-elections , agreeably to their original design . The Bank of the United States was created . This measure was vehemently resisted at the threshold by those who had taken a prominent position in framing the Constitution , on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power of chartering it had been denied by the Convention . how these schemes hr which vast sums of money and almost umlimited power were le*rislated into the han ( ls of afew individuals , were carned through Congress is now to be gathered only from tradition . None can reasonably doubt but the leading policy of the English Credit System was liberally applied to overcome the scruples of several individuals . President Washin*ton , from his correspondence lately published by Mr. Sparks , appears to have been wholly opposed in principle , to the adoption , by public authority , of any paper substitute for a sound and equal currency . By the incessant representations of individuals who surrounded him , and in whom he reposed great confidence , he was reluctantly induced to believe , that so universal and powerful had popular feeling throughout the Union become in favor of paper currency , that the country could only be saved from the horrors of anarchy by the charter of the Bank . His constitutional objections to the measure having been overcome with the greatest difilculty by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Having now acquired the absolute and irresponsible control over the ordinary medium of commerce , the friends of strong government could make money plentiful or scarce at their pleasure , and were of course able to ruin or enrich the trading community at their discretion . They were accordingly secure in the permanent allegiance of this influential body . For the acquiescence of the mass of the people in their measures , they mainly relied in the first instance upon the personal popularity of Washington , which was almost unbounded . Subsequently , the excesses of the French r&amp;-volution were turned to a similar purpose in this country as in England , for the purpose of alarming the community at large and inducing // them to support the kindred Credit Systems of the two countries . All who did not implicitly support the self-created aristocracy , were identified in principle with the sanguinary monsters which the long misrule of despotism had produced in France . Many individuals of feeble discernment but correct intentions , were arrayed in favor of the Credit System , under the sincere belief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of all property , religion , and morality . Under the Administration of the elder Adams , the measures adopted by the friends of strong government for burdening the people with enormous establishments in order to control the whole by corrupting a part of the community , became so ross and palpable , that the systematic exaggerations and mistatements by which they were sustained began to lose their influence . The sedition law , instead of repressing inquiry into the tendency of these measures , only served to increase the anxiety of the people for their permanent welfare . Had not the suicidal measures adopted by the friends of strong government accelerated their removal from power , the policy of the United States would have doubtless presented a counterpart to that of England , and the results presented at this time by the abrandizement of the few , at the expense of the comfort of the many , might have been quite as striking . It is not now in our power to follow the various expedients and transformations adopted by the party by whom the " Credit System " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no doubt , however , in any reasonable mind , but the original intention of governing the people of the United States by an irresponsible and self-elected body of men has been constantly kept in view . Whenever the standard of value , exclusively recognised by the Constitution , could be permanently overthrown , the power of the managers of the Credit System over the subsistence , industry , and enterprise of the country , would be perfect . The leading measures of the Bank of the United States have all been evidently directed to this result , as is proved not only by inference , but by the language of its managers from time to time . It is not necessary to quote passages from Mr. Riddle 's letter which is so familiar to all  --  but we would refer our readers to the celebrated pamphlet published by one of the oracles of the Bank durino that period of general prostration and distress which succeeded the few first years of its operation under the charter of 1816 . In the " inquiry into the causes of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in terms " that with a currency convertible into specie , our former prosperity while peace and unobstructed commerce prevail , can not return . " After drawing an appalling picture of the universal distress then existing -- showing that all commodities and real estate had fallen more than one-half in value , it is argued that the Constitution only prohibits the States // from making paper currency a legal tender , but that Congress pos .. sesses that power , and is imperiously called on to exercise it as a measure of relief correlative to the protectiv , e system . he tariff is shown to be nugatory as a means of encouraging industry unless accompanied with a currency not convertible into the precious me tals . " This for the security of past accumulations , and means of future acquisition is indispensable " - otherwise " the banks and a few wealthy individuals will stand by to gather up the fragments of our wealth-they whose cry has been over-trading , extravagance , speculation &amp;c. , but whose object , if they have any but a blind purpose , is to grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust at the State banks was evidently intended to excite feelings among those who were suffering under the calamities produced by the Bank of the United States , of a similar character with those recently raised against the Executive Government . Instead of counte* nancing the suspension of specie payments by the Bank at that time , Congress adopted the more judicious course of investigating its mismanagement and violations of its charter . Had the charter been then abrogated , in pursuance of the recommendation of the Committee , an incalculable amount of demoralizing influence as well as positive loss , would have been spared to the industry of the Union . We have neither time nor space at this time for details upon this subject , as we must touch upon some of the suggestions contained in Mr. Carey 's publication . Its object being to vindicate doctrines , which , if carried into practice , must inevitably destroy all the sanctions by which pro*. perty is protected , by placing the earnings and accumulations of every individual in the community , exclusively within the control of the manufacturers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the price of every thingno term is so continually repeated as security . In reading the work , its iteration becomes so tiresome , that one is ready to exclaim with Falstaff , " I had as lief they would put rats-bane in my mouth , as offer to stop it with security . " A curious parrallel is drawn between the relative security of property in France , England , and several sections of the United States . The ground assumed , is that whenever the banks are able to issue the greatest quantity of paper currency and make the largest dividends  --  the security of property is the greatest . The property of the thousands upon thousands , whose means of subsistence are suddenly snatched away by the arbitrary expansions and contractions of paper , is considered to be wholly unworthy of regard . It would be supposed in fact , from this publication that the term property is applicable to nothing but bank stock . Where banks are not compelled to redeem their issues , the security of property is the greatest , because there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever the specie // in any country is lessened , the greater is the increase of securitysecurity being perfect where there is no specie whatever ! Such of our readers as may not be satisfied with this self-evident deduction , we would refer to pages sixty to sixty-four of the publication itself , where they will find a train of demonstration , establishing this principle beyond doubt or question , which rivals in precision and conclusiveness , any which can be found in Euclid . In That extrao*rdinary manual for political neophytes promulgated by Mr. Biddle at Princeton in 1835-which , like " The Prince " of Machiavel , has been made to bear various interpretations agreeably to the taste and temper of the reader-may be found this emphatic injunction : " Personally and singly objects of indifference , our collected merits are devoutly adored when we acquire the name of the people . " Upon this hint the name in question has been extensively arrogated by the managers and stipendaries of the banks . Notwithstanding this authority , we would venture to suggest , that all countries are not solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beings exist , possessing both souls and bodieshopes which may be disappointed , and feelings liable to be lacerated . Occasionally even in this country , a person may he found having connexions either of blood or friendship . Engagements may be entered into under the expectations of profit which involve individuals throughout all the ramifications of society . Under the strong temptations afforded by the facility of obtaining accomodations , such engagements may not impair the security of banks whenever necessity or caprice shall induce them to diminish the amount of currency in circulation , and throw whole communities into agonies of alarm and distress . The managers of the banks doubtless remain " as calm as a summer 's morning "  - -  bnt what is the security of those unfortunate individuals who have placed themselves in bondage to them , and what is the security of their still more unfortunate wives , children , and others dependent on them ? The state of feeling in our principal cities in 1819 , 1825 , 1828 , 1831 , 1834 , and 1836 , will furnish a satisfactory answer . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have existed among ourselves , we take leave to refer our readers upon this point , to the sixth and seventh volumes of Lockhart 's Memoirs of Sir Walter Scott . They will find in those volumes a most affecting commentary upon the doctrine of security as promulgated in Mr. Carey 's book . The process by which one of the noblest of human intellects was gradually weakened , and the life of that wonderful man prematurely shortened , may be there distinctly traced to this security . The Bank of Scotland lost not a farthingbut the high-spirited Scott , from a state of affluence , became a bankrupt in consequence of the engagements into which he was seduced by the temptations of the Credit System ; and the recent publicaVOL . XII . NO . XI. - NOV. p // tion , in answer to Lockhart , by the friends of the Ballantynes , has conclusively proved that this high spirited man was reduced , for the maintenance of that delusive splendour which it enabled him to assume , to the rejection of the solid independence which his unrivalled talents could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and finally , of treacherous selfishness to his friends , that would merit the harshest epithet , were we not so well acquainted with the specious chicanery by which this fatal system of gambling in credit so often warps even the integrity of its votaries to acts that would call a shudder to the heart of the same individual if presented to his mind in the naked profligacy of dishonor . But this new literary illustration of the Credit System possesses an extrinsic and melancholy interest which may induce us to recur to it again . Were not similar results quite common among ourselves , it would seem to be the most extraordinary part of this heart-rending narrative , that Scott continued to the last to defend both by tongue and pen the system by which he was ruined-. so strongly implanted in the human mind is the spirit of gambling ! Notwithstanding the banks of New York resumed on the first of May , in defiance of the hostility of the Bank of the United States , the Boston banks with a single honorable exception , continued up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mandates of Mr. Biddle for embarrassing the trade and commerce of the country . Accordingly we find a great portion of this publication occupied with the most fulsome compliments upon the excellent management and unrivalled usefulness of those banks . The small amount of specie held by them , and their issues of small notes , are represented to be the sole causes of the prosperity of that section of the Union ! The industry , information , and enterprise of the people , and the great equality of property which prevails there beyond most other parts of the country , are nothing compared with the advantages derived from their banks . The statements of their operations as given , correspond entirely with the truth of these inferences . So far however from hank failures having been few and far between in New England , as stated by Mr. Carey , in no part of the Union of similar extent were they , during the first half of the period referred to , so numerous , and so destructive to the security of the ordinary intercourse between man and man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continual failures of the banks , and the depreciation to which the currency of the greater part of them was more or less subjected , became at last so burdensome to every kind of trade and industry , that it became necessary to devise some plan for the correction of these evils . No adequate legislative restrictions upon the recklessness of some of these banks could be obtained  --  or if obtained , could be enforced . An expe // dient was finally adopted , which for a long time effected the restraint so essential to the best interests of the community . Boston being the principal mercantile mart , all the currency in circulation throughout this section of the Union tends towards that point . The banks in all parts of New England were required to maintain their notes at par in that city , by making sufficient provision for their redemption there . The notes of such as refused to do this , were received in Boston and immediately returned upon the banks issuing them and specie demanded . Most of the weak banks which had before enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their notes not being receivable at other banks , and thus being passed from hand to hand in common payments to the exclusion of almost all other currency , were by this measure either broken up , or compelled to limit their circulation to their means of redemption . Iti the course of a few months the surviving banks found it expedient to redeem their notes in Boston , in order to avoid the necesssity of keeping on hand an amount of coin equal to their issues , which alone would afford them a sufficient protection for the sudden return of their notes upon them . The vigilant and unsparing application of this process for restraining the improvident issues of the other banks , together with the daily exchange of paper among those of Boston , kept the whole in excellent condition until the universal confidence created by the great expansion of the Bank of the United States in 1835 followed by the other leading banks , induced a practical relaxation of these salutary precautions . The banks of New England soon fell into disorder and some of those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Credit System of this , or any other country , can not be preserved in a sound condition , and prevented from inflicting the greatest evils upon the community which sustains it , but by the efficient restrictions upon its abuses which the constant demand for specie will only enforce . The success of the banks of Ne*v England , under the operation of this continual call upon them , has always appeared to be the most cogent example which could be cited in favor of the specie section of the Sub-Treasury Bill of the Senate , discussed during the last session of Congress . As far as the public revenue may extend , this might be made to interpose a constant check upon the excess of issues by the banks , precisely as the necessity of redeeming the notes brought to Boston for the purchase of goods , kept the banks of New England in a sound and wholesome condition . As Mr. Carey goes against all restraints upon issues of paper , he most carefully suppresses all reference to the principle to which the banks whereon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence of the community . That such a principle alone can keep paper currency from ope // rating as a most powerful engine of fraud , is abundantly shown by the proceedings of the Legislature of Massachusetts during its last session . The losses of the community from the explosion of the banks had become so oppressive , that though not less than one hundred and twenty Bank Directors were among the members , the force of public sentiment compelled investigation . In several cases it was attempted to lay the censure upon individual mismanagement-but where both the temptation and the impunity for frauds are so overpowering , the demoralizing consequences belong to the system and not to the unfortunate persons whose fondness for display and distinction may have made them victims to its seductions . One of the reports ( that upon the Kilby Bank ) states expressly , that it has been the usual practice for individuals associated together for the purpose of establishing a Bank , to procure a Charter , subscribe for the stock , borrow a sufficient sum of specie from some neighboring bank or banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary certificate that the hank possesses the amount of specie required , and put it into operation without any capital whatever excepting the promissory notes of the associates representing the shares of stock . The bank then issues paper currency , and its shares are brought into the market . This statement , it must be borne in mind , is not the slanderous invention of some opponent of the Credit System . It was officially made by a Whig committee of a Whig Legislature , and sets forth the usual practice in a State where banking , according to Mr. Carey , is practiced in a higher degree of perfection than in France , England , or any part of the United States . Our readers will judge whether the restraints upon issues which prevailed for several years in Massachusetts were uncalled for under such a practice  --  and when the banks created by it are eulogised as the best in the world by a writer , they perhaps can guess in what sense the following extract is to be understood . We take it from the 128th page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there found : " Were the war against bank and bank notes at an end , there would be an immediate exchange of deposits against the property of those indebted to the banksthe debts of the banks would be cancelled-their liabilities would be diminishedthe currency would he diminished a'nd prices would rise . If there be a continued diminution of confidence , tbe import of coin will afford no relief , but will , on the contrary , tend to a constant diminution in the quality of labor-ia the power of production-in the reward of both laborer and capitalist . If there be a restoration of confidence the reverse will be the case . core/ide e can not be restored under the present system . ' We forbear comment upon Mr. Carey 's doctrine that prices rise in proportion to the scarcity of currency . As he has written a stately octavo on political economy , we feel bound to treat the position of so distinguished a theorist with all deference . This as well as his doctrine that the security of paper currency is increased // by the diminution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , known only to the chosen few who are admitted to the mysteries of the great marble temple in Chesnut street , and which is to be implicitly believed by all true worshippers . Mr. Carey is particularly energetic on the subject of giving the public money to the banks , and sums up his views with these conclusive positions : " That the attempt to substitute Government Agents in lieu of the banks for the receipt and disbursement of the public revenue tends to prevent the restoration of confidence . " " That the attempt to compel the use of gold and silver for all sums under twenty dollars , and in all payments to the Government has a similar tendency . " " That both tend by their preventing the restoration of confidence to diminish the pcoductiveness of labor to the injury both of the laborer and capitalist . " An inexperienced person might be somewhat puzzled to imagine why no credit is allowed by law to be given to any purchaser of the public lands , even upon the security of the increased value bestowed upon the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merchant for the revenue levied upon the importation of foreign goods , to enable him to sell them , and avoid advancing the cash from his own capital upon ample security ; - yet the unj limited use of the public funds should be bestowed upon such indivi-. duals without property , as may associate themselves as stated to be the usual practice in Massachusetts , whose banks are represented by Mr. Carey to be the most perfect in the world  --  and the similar mode explained in Mr. Spencer 's Report on the Bank of the United States , of which no loyal supporter of the Credit System dares question the stability . But the foregoing passages taken verbatim from Mr. Carey 's publication , fully explain this paradox , which it seems could only perplex the vulgar . The object is to restore confidence ! If no individual in the community can be found who will trust such a bank , and a law can be carried through Congress compelling its notes to be received for public dues , and the public money is required to be deposited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not erased ! The experiment of President Jackson conclusively established this result . When the charter of the Bank of the United States was drawing near its close without any probability of its renewal by Congress , many individuals were then , as now desirous , that a system should be organized for receiving , keeping , and disbursing the public money , which should relieve the mercantile community from the periodical paroxysms which its management by banks had continually produced . They predicted on the floor of Congress , that the State banks could not be trusted with the public moneythat they would inevitably fail , in consequence of the abuse of the confidence which would be created in them . Many of those now most earnestly engaged in restoring the State Bank Deposite Sys // tern , were at that time filled with the spirit of prophecy in foretelling the ruin which would be inflicted on the community from placing the public money in them . President Jackson , no doubt , was naturally led to believe , that the long established course of business pursued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of system . For a long period they had paid the taxes levied upon the consuming community through them into the banks , and had often received great facilities from them in making payments-which the banks could well afford to give , as they received interest from the mer* chant , as for an advance of cash-while not a farthing was advanced in consequence of the bank being a public depository . An alteration of this system at once , might expose the merchants who had regulated their business in view of it , to great inconveniences . Principally from a regard to their interests for which many of them have since expressed but little gratitude towards the veteran , he proposed the State Bank Deposite System as an experiment . Could the public business have been securely conducted , and the public faith protected , let the merchants be accommodated by all means , was the general response of the Democratic party . Few of them were on this account inclined at that time to support the project of an Independent Treasury . But in consequence of the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiment failed . The whole community were visited with deep suffering and distress in consequence of the inordinate expansions into which all the banks , following the example of the Bank of the United States , either heedlessly or designedly plunged themselves . By voluntarily suspending specie payments , the banks voluntarily forced a separation from the public finances in which they were sustained by the merchants . Upon what ground shall the people of the United States , who have been the victims of the suspension be now asked to repeat the experiment ? Will not like causes produce like effects ? What assurance can be given that the public money shall not again be made the stakes in this species of national gambling ? If it be the design of good government to promote industry , sobriety , and prudence , there can be no question as to the proper course to be taken , after the lesson furnished by the experiment . Only those will advocate the restoration oC the public money to the banks , who would enable speculators to defraud the public at large by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of embarrassment , in order that a few individuals may prey upon them with impunity . A vast expenditure of declamation took place during the two last sessions of Congress on the subject of Relief . We entertain a very // strong opinion that cure is better than mere relief  --  and that prevention is wiser than either . Congress with great firmness adopted the first step towards curing the disorders into which the currency had been thrown by the imprudence of the banks , to use the mildest term , by passing the penal law against the issue of the defunct notes of the old Bank of the United States . That at once changed the system of military strategy announced by Mr. Biddle in his general orders of the fifth of April last ,  --  compelled the banks of Pennsylvania to resume under the spur of the public impatience and indignation-required the vassals of the Bank of the United States to change front  --  and restored commercial confidence throughout the Atlantic sea-board as if by magic . This was not exactly the " change of system " bespoken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in salutary influence any temporising or tinkering measure for connecting the Public Treasury with the banks , which had so flagrantly betrayed the trust reposed in them . Should Congress exercise the wisdom of taking the next step for the permanent cure of the evils of the circulation , which , for the last three or four years , have afflicted the community-by adopting the plan recommended by the Presig dent , for the management of the public finances agreeably to the Constitution  --  the public faith will not again be thrown into jeopardy by the profligacy of irresponsible individuals . The final step should be to secure the convertibility of all paper currency by the adoption of the measure for preventing all these manifold evils in future , proposed by Mr. Crawford , in view of the terrible disasters of the revulsion of 1819 , subjecting all individuals , associations , and corporations , issuing paper currency , to the penalties of a bankrupt law whenever they shall refuse to redeem it in lawful coin . This will protect the community at large from the lamentable consequences of sudden expansions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our productive interests to such imminent perils . We fully appreciate the utility of well organized and well conducted banks in the management of real mercantile transactions . Our views on this subject were explained at length in the article on Commercial Banking in our May number . But it is worse than folly-it is madness , in any commercial country to permit its currency , whatever portion of it mny be for convenience in paper , to become more plentiful than though it was wholly metallic . Money is only the measure of value . Whether there is much or little in the world is of no importance , because the general ratio of prices very soon adopts itself to the quantity . But whenever a eommercial country suffers its currency to become inflated beyond the level of other countries , by which its prices are artificially pushed up , their commodities soon flow in upon it in undue propor tions , to the destruction of its industry , and an exportation of its // specie must be made for the purpose of producing the equilibrium . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . Our own country , by overlooking its operation , has been periodically subjected to revulsions , which have nearly changed the respectable profession of the merchant into empirical gambling . After each expansion of the paper currency , runs upon the banks take place to obtain coin for exportation ; they are obliged to curtail their operations , and ruin those dependent on them , or to dishonor their own paper and throw the burden upon the industrious classes . This process has been repeated quite too often in this country . What is now required by the increased information which has been spread throughout the Union by the experience of the last few years is , that the laws shall protect the honest , the industrious , and the prudent , instead of affording facilities to gambling and to fraud.
