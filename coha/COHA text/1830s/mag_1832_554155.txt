txt For some years past , there appears to have been a growing conviction of the importance of discovering and exhibiting the principles of impressive delivery , in order to its more general attainment . This conviction has led to several publications in this country and England . Steele , Sheridan , Walker , and some others , have done much in aid of the object ; not indeed by an actual development of the principles of a just , graceful and forcible elocution ; but by useful hints , and by leading succeeding writers to perceive what deficiencies must be supplied , what redundancies curtailed , and what crude and misty conceptions elucidated . In these respects , Dr. Porter 's Analysis of Rhetorical Delivery ' is an improvement upon all the efforts of his predecessors . It has , however , these defects , to mention no others ; - it does not analyze speech into its elements ; and where its instructions are in the main correct , it is not sufficiently precise and definite , to satisfy him who seeks the exact limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit the true elements of speech , and to impart well defined and precise ideas on the subject , is the one made by Dr. James Rush , of Philadelphia , in 1827 , in a work , entitled The Philosophy of the Human Voice . ' The work named at the head of this article , modestly professes to be fruit gathered from this vine . ' Dr. Rush has observed and recorded facts in relation to voice and speech , in a profound and original manner . Other writers have analyzed sentences into members and words ; but he has analyzed speech itself ; and has shown , not the integral elements of sentences , but the vocal elements of syllables , and even of letters . Preceding writers appear to have supposed , that the musical staff was useful only to measure the intervals in the voice of song ; Dr. Rush has shown it to be also capable of measuring those in the voice of speech . Dr. Rush 's work , however , does not fill the vacancy , which was most obvious among the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that production , the vacancy , referred to would // not now have been filled . His work is , as it professes to be , on the philosophy of the human voice . It was not designed to be a manual , for the practical purposes of elementary instruction in the art of speaking ; but it supplied the basis and principal materials for such a manual , which Dr. Barber has since published . Dr. Barber has endeavored , as bis preface informs us , to adapt the whole of bis work to the purposes of teaching . From the work itself , indeed , we should judge that it was primarily intended as a manual , for the use of such persons as might come under the author 's own personal instruction . It has , however , received so large a measure of his effort to render it , in its details , lucid to others , as to be highly valuable to the laborious and philosophical solitary student . On the importance , and at the same time , the extreme rarity of a truly distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He exhibits the elements of articulation ; which he divides into two classes ,  --  vowel and consonant elements . Perseverin* practice upon these , till the organs , which produce them , effect the necessary changes of position with rapidity , precision , and energy , is considered by this author as indispensable . By elements ' of articulation , he means , not vowels and consonants , of which syllables are formed ; but vocal elements , audible sounds ,  --  two or three of which are often found in a single syllable , of as many letters . The importance which Dr. Barber attaches to a complete conquest over the difficulties of articulation , may be best learned by a short quotation from his work ; and it derives additional weight from the fact , that he is himself a highly accomplished and popular lecturer on Elocution . Reading books on elocution , and receiving directions in lectures , have been already tried long enough ; and tried in vain . Practice ; practice upon a series of elementary tables of the primitive sounds of speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We therefore advise , that no pupil be ever permitted to proceed to reading or declamation , until distinctness of utterance is ensured by repeated exercises on elementary sounds . ' p. 16 . To facilitate the practice on which Dr. Barber so strenuously insists , he has given two tables of elementary sounds ; - one of vowel sounds , containing seventeen ; the other of the sounds of consonants , containing twenty-nine . On these fortysix // elements alone , in their perfect utterance , depends that very important part of just and elegant elocution ,  --  distinct and faultless articulation . The vowel elements are considered in the following particulars ; their particular structure , ' their explosive power , ' and their capability of prolongation . ' What Dr. Barber terms the explosive power of the vowel elements , ' is a subject which , 4 priori , we should have been likely to pronounce necessarily unintelligible upon paper , or without an oral illustration . But we take pleasure in acknowledging , that such a sentence would have been premature . It is unquestionably difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is appreciable , in its full extent , only by the ear , as shall be intelligible to the mind , and to give such instructions for the generation of sounds , as shall enable him who reads to produce them ; and Dr. Barber is entitled to the praise of having performed this difficult task . He has thus shown himself to be possessed of analytical and descriptive talents , which , being directed to the improvement of the work before us , will greatly enhance its value , when it shall pass to a second edition . The recitation on consonant elements contains several useful tables ; the most remarkable and valuable of which is one , which presents these elements in their various combinations ; and opposite to each , in the same line , a word , in which the combination of elements , as exhibited , is found . It could scarcely be expected , that such a table should be absolutely perfect in its details . This in truth is not so : but careful observation will enable the author to bring it near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a more complete state . This recitation terminates with a collection of sentences , for the purpose of exercise in articulation , in which most of the combinations in the table are found . These sentences may be styled the gymnasium of articulation. - The general considerations presented in the fourth recitation , which treats of voice , in its properties of quality , abruptness , force , time , and pitch , constitute definitions of these several properties , to which there is frequent necessity for recurrence , in the subsequent parts of the volume . Such a study , therefore , of this recitation , as will ensure perf*t familiarity with the subject , is indispensable to him who would reap all the advantage attainable by its perusal . It would occupy more of our space than can be thus appropriated , if we should transcribe these // general considerations , which would be injured by an attempt to abridge them . We therefore refer the reader to the volume - itself , with a single remark on quality of voice . ' By quality of voice , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished , when we hear without seeing them ; for each has not only his own degree of the several properties of voice , viz , depth , fulness , smoothness , sweetness , and strength , or their opposites , but his own peculiar modification of that degree ; so that no two persons can naturally exhibit the same quality of voice . ' In his recitation on the slide of the voice , Dr. Barber has presented us with a practical demonstration of Dr. Rush 's theory , that the slides of the voice in speech are as measurable by the musical staff , as in song . He does , we think , demonstrate to every attentive reader who will make the experiments he describes , that these slides are those of a tone , a third , a fifth , and an octave ; and also , in what cases these several movements , or slides , are properly and expressively employed , whether ascending or descending . Scarcely any of the uses of voice is more important to sol** emn and dignified delivery , than power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , indeed , it is impossible that a speaker should so deliver himself , whatever may be his subject , as to leave an impression of its solemnity and dignity on the minds of his hearers . There are , in the human voice , as its Creator has constituted it , certain symbols of the emotions of mind . If , therefore , solemnity , arising from the nature of the subject he is discussing , pervade the speaker 's mind , the Author of our being has furnished the voice with the means of propagating through his audience the same solemnity . To produce this effect , however , these very means must be employed , and not others instead of them . Now one of the most important of these means , is lengthened quantity in vocal ele .. meats . If , therefore , in the words which these elements constitute , extended quantity be not employed , the speaker , however eloquent , would fail in producing the emotion which he desires to propagate . The immortal German bard , Handel , well understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his works will prove , that wherever the sentiment he desired to harmonize is solemn , he has employed words to convey it , the elements of which are capable of extended quantity ; and // where the syllables possess this capacity , he has concurred with nature , by setting them to long , rather than short notes . One example may suffice to prove the truth of this remark . The sentiment of the song of the heavenly choir in To the Cherubim , ' is singularly solemn , and the words are admirably adapted to convey the sentiment . A majority of the syllables admit of long drawn time ; and the composer has availed himself of this natural capacity of the syllables , and has adapted them to notes of lengthened duration . Many of the syllables are , in the voice of song , capable of indefinite extension ; and he has accordingly adapted them to notes or strains of considerable length . The movement of the song is rather slow , and in this slow movement , he never adapts a long syllable or element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllable through two , three , and even five measures on a single element . And this is not accident , but the result of design , for he never dwells on a short syllable , throughout the song . There is doubtless as wide a difference between the laws , as between the voices of speech and song ; but this feature is common to both ; - that dignity and solemnity are expressed by grave movements , and these are made by extended duration on the individual syllables or notes which constitute them . It was a delicate instinct or rather inspiration of nature , which taught the composer to lengthen the notes to which long syllables were adapted , when he designed to express solemnity of sentiment ; and the same inspiration will teach the reader or speaker , under similar circumstances , to give long quantity to similar syllables . How destitute of solemnity must have been the character of the strain , had the words Holy , Holy , Holy , ' been set in a rapid movement to semiquavers ! Yet not more so , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered in that short quantity which is heard in the utterance of the imaginary sentence , Rapid inundation , ' Holy , Holy , Holy . ' Now what is it , which has deprived these words of all their solemnity ? It is simply divesting them of that symbol of this quality , with which our Creator has enabled us to clothe them , and dressing them in a garb adapted to the expression of another and an opposite sentiment . Short quantity and rapid enunciation , associated with such words , are obviously out of their proper place . Yet let it not be supposed , that in order to grave and dignified delivery , all the open vowels are to be indefinitely // lengthened . This would he intolerable affectation , and would infallibly create disgust . We say there can he no impressive delivery , without power over quantity in open vowels ; hut to lengthen indefinitely all such vowels , would be such an abuse of the power as nature does not prompt , and therefore the ear would not endure . In this as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here the value of Dr. Barber 's work is perceived . It contains the precepts of this wisdom ; it leads the speaker or reader to perceive the importance of acquiring this power over quantity , the means of acquiring it , the proper places for employing it , and the various kinds of sentiment , to the expression of which the several modifications of quantity are adapted ; and may thus be no inconsiderable auxiliary in the formation and improvement of style . On this part of his subject , as on others , Dr. Barher has made successful efforts to produce a practical work . We have said , that the inspirations of nature will lead the reader or speaker to the proper use of quantity ; hut these inspirations are imparted only to distinguished genius . Must good speaking then be confined to such ? The book before us is an answer to this question . In it , the connexion between the right use of extended quantity and just and impressive delivery is intelligibly exhibited , not merely to the favored child of genius , hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is shown where and how to employ it . With this book in his hand , and with patient and persevering effort and diligent study , unless prevented hy absolute organic defects , he will attain a high degree of perfection in delivery . The recitation on the measure of speech ' is highly interesting and important . It is interesting , as it developes physiological facts relative to the structure of the organs of speech , which demonstrate the wisdom and goodness of the Author of our being and it is important , inasmuch as by a knowledge of these facts , the art of public speaking may be practised to a great extent , through a long series of years and with great energy , not only without prejudice to health , but with an evident tendency to its preservation . No ahridgement of this recitation can do justice to its author . We shall therefore not attempt one ; but content ourselves with simply recommending to every speaker , who is concerned for the preservation of his health and the continuance of his usefulness , to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be received , // and public speakers will regard those physiological laws to which delivery is subject , we shall less frequently be pained by hearing , that men , on whose lips delighted multitudes hung , are withdrawn from their labors , or find an early tomb . The recitation on emphasis comprises that portion of the work before us , which exhibits the combination of the several elements of just and elegant elocution , or the use of the orator 's working tools . Nothing , ' observes this writer , will demonstrate more clearly the importance of elementary investigation , than the fact , that all those powers of the voice which it has enabled us to record , are employed in emphasis , sometimes singly , but ofteiTier in combination . ' This recitation is accordingly devoted to an exhibition of the several kinds of emphasis , or , which is the same thing , to a collection of passages from writers of prose and poetry , in the reading or delivery of which , the recorded powers of voice are severally put in requisition . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense and candor , which are discoverable in the recitatioj*l on the analysis of written language . He does not pretend , that even a perfect acquaintance with all the rules he has given , can render every person who may become familiar with them a good reader or speaker ; but insists , indirectly indeed , but with sufficient plainness , on the necessity of intellect in the pupil who would succeed . Elocution is the art of delineating by the voice the special relations of thought , which existed in the mind of an author ; but no one can delineate , who can not discover them . The discovery of these relations constitutes the intellectual portion of the art ; and a thorough discovery of them , especially in writing of a superior order , requires very nice and rigid analysis . Dr. Barber gives no rules for this , because his own reflection , and his examination of the efforts made by others in this department , have shown him the uselessness of such labor . He rouses the energy of the student by assuring him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples how it may be effected , and leaves him to acquire for himself the art of analysis , by time and practice . This , ' he observes , is all that is necessary for the intelligent , and the dull would be more troubled by multifarious rules and exceptions , than by the difficulties which they seek to avert . Let the elements of an art be fairly unfolded , and a few conspicuous instances of their practical application afforded , and moderate ingenuity will effect the // rest . The right use of elements in other instances is only a proper exercise of individual ability , and comes by a little practice . ' The recitation on improvement of the voice ' demands most seriously the attention of public speakers . From inattention to this particular , many , whose intellectual stores furnish ample materials for delighting and instructing large assemblies , accomplish little more than to mortify and grieve them by the unsuccessful effort to be heard . The beginnings of their sentences are found to give unequivocal evidence , that thoughts that breath&amp; exist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those periods , the symbols of those thoughts ,  - -  their words ,  --  pervade not half the area they are designed to fill ; and the wearied and impatient hearer abandons in despair the effort to catch them . This evil calls loudly for a remedy , and the recitation we are noticing affords it . We recommend to public speakers its perusal , and the adoption of the discipline which it prescribes . The fifteenth recitation is on the application of vocal elements , in expressing emotion . ' This , and the following one on the defects of delivery , ' are valuable portions of the work ; but they are such as call for little observation . They can not be read without the conviction that they contain valuable information , and that the latter describes graphically the characteristic defects of nearly all the faulty speakers , within the circle of our acquaintance . In the seventeenth and last recitation is found a series of questions , designed to aid in criticising a public speaker , which may be said to embody a synopsis of the work before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every excellence and defect in delivery is brought tinder review in them ; and he who stands approved after passing the ordeal of such an investigation , must be a very accomplished speaker . In taking our leave of this work , we may be permitted to congratulate its author on the satisfactory manner in which he has performed a service hitherto unattempted , and by many persons deemed impossible ,  --  that of presenting to the world a work on the important science of delivery , which is philosophical in its character , and intelligible and lucid in its details . For the philosophical character of the present work , the author acknowledges himself indebted to Dr. Rush ; but the praise of having made a practical application of Dr. Rush 's // theory to the art of elocution , is certainly his own . His work , however , as we have before intimated , is not a faultless production . We have mentioned some particulars in which it is susceptible of improvement , and we will venture to suggest another . It would be greatly improved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These recitations contain a sketch indeed of his meaning , and one which he can himself fill up to advantage in the lecture-room ; but solitary students are not satisfied with a sketch . The picture should be at least filled up , if it be left without that warmth and life , with which the coloring of his pencil is capable of investing it ; or , to change the figure , while we acknowledge the fitness of the several parts of the skeleton to each other , and admire the wisdom displayed in their combination and arrangement , we must contend , that a more attractive object of contemplation would have been presented , had it been clothed with flesh , even if it had wanted that breath of life , with which , if be chose , the author could inspire it.
