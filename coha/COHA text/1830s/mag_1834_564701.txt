txt THERE is nothing left to be discovered ,  --  there is no more terra incognita ; every coast is surveyed , every bay is sounded . Pigmies and giants , Esquimaux and Patagonians , all are civilized , and there is no new race , there are no more wonders left for travelers to describe . For novelty , we must visit the regions that Sinbad explored ,  --  we must dive into the imagination , if the march of utility has left such a faculty to the mind . Last summer , being at Eastport , I shared in the impatience manifested by the good people of that pleasant town , for the arrival of the schooner Ripley , from Baltimore , which had been chartered by Mr. Audubon for a voyage after new impressions and undescribed birds . I-us picice volucres ,  --  his birds , which I*e kills , to give them immortality ,  --  are widely known . He hoped to discover new species in Labrador , and , while he cut short their lives , to give them portraits and biographies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party . The schooner was an excellent vessel , and she had supplies for a cruise of six months . The commander was a good seaman and an estimable man . We had all the elements to make a good voyage ; we had all that Argonauts could desire , even to a good cook , who is important in // all great undertakings . Ours , while he gave aliment to the body , afforded , also , food for merriment . On the 6th of June , we left Eastport , with the good wishes of the citizens , and under a salute to the cause of science , from the guns of the fort , and of the cutter . Cheers and hats were raised by our friends on the wharf ,  --  all the omens were propitious , and our spirits rose accordingly . Just as the sea began to weary us by its sameness , we came to the Strait of Canso ; and , though the Cape was but a " sterile promontory , " the land looked familiar and friendly . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fihiy sail in sight ,  --  all bound for Labrador ,  --  forty-nine for fish , and one for birds . On each side spread a barren country , with a few miserable habitations . On the 12th of June , we were at the Magdalen Islands . One of them rises perpendicularly from the water , a bank of-red sand-stone ; it is as regular as a wall , and seems cut by art . There were several hills , one of which was surmounted by a chapel , and another by a cross . There were some dwellings , and , it being a festival , the inhabitants had collected in the church to celebrate mass . Mr. Audubon had an interview with the priest , and made known the object of his visit ; his reverence was pleased , for he had a love for natural history ,  --  not always , however , founded on knowledge . He said that neither he nor any inhabitant of the island had ever seen a reptile upon it . Yet one of the first living things that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colony of French Canadians . *The island , on which we landed , is , at low water , forty-eight miles in length but in high water , the connecting sand-bars are covered , and there are then four or five separate islands . The only quadrupeds of the island are black and red foxes , rabbits , . and rats . The latter were unknown till a vessel was wrecked on the island , having many of them on board . There are wild geese , murganzas , brants , and several kinds of plovers . We ascended , with toil , to the summit of a bold mountain , the base of which was washed by the sea .. We looked over the beetling cliff* hundreds of feet down upon the turbulent waves , and upon our bark , that seemed shrunk to half its size . We discovered in the rock a magnificent arch , a grand natural bridge , under which the water undulated , as the sea rose and fell . After leaving the island , we discovered , in a few hours , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached , was found to be an island . I am glad to borrow Mr. Audubon 's description . " To persons who had lately left the fertile shores of our country , these islands the Magdalen , appeared barren , if not desolate . No birds for us , hinc jihe lackryma ? , no plants , and only a few fishermen , to whom we could put questions , but who were unable to answer them . We sailed towards the famous gannet rocks , which we came in sight of at an early hour . Many files of gannets were constantly passing us on the wing , moving to or from this , their breeding place ; but , as soon as near enough to distinguish the bold summit of this stupendous rock , we saw , through the glass , that it was covered with what we supposed was a deep bed of snow ,  --  nay , the atmosphere exhibited a heavy fall of snow . We sailed on , and approached it ; - imagine our astonishment , // when we found , that instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed consisted of gannets , seated on their nests in close parallel lines , fronting the southern aspect , millions in number , while the gray haze above us was occasioned by other millions , hovering , arising , alighting , or departing . The pure whiteness of their bodies , mingled as they passed , crossing each other on the wing , and mellowing the contrast observable in their jetty-black tipped pinions . " The approach of our vessel 4id not alarm them , and we sail:ed as near the rock as prudence and the captain would permit . We wished to ascend the side of this huge aviary , and a boat was launched but the wind freshened , the clouds thickened , the waves rose and rolled furiously , and the base of the rock was covered with foam . When under the lee a few guns were fired from the boat , thousands of eggs rolled into the sea as the aifrighted. birds took wing , though still every projecting shelf , every " coign of vantage " seemed occupied . It is hardly possible to enumerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of fish required lbr their food . It was a pleasure to observe Audubon 's eyes , as he was watching the birds ; for birds are his passion . The storm which he mentioned increased , the boat was hauled in , and the schooner driven onward at a furious rate . This was the first time we had to study the sea in a storm , and it was a terrific lesson . The waves did not , indeed , in the usual hyperbolical phrase , " run mountain high ; " but they were sufficient to give a good conception of hill and valley . Early on the morning of the l7th ,  --  the ' eleventh day of our voyage , - we descried Labrador , and our hopes were high , of finding undescrihed birds , and we indulged . in expectations of bears , packs of wolves , and tribes of Esquimaux . Myriads of murrs and sea*pigeons were flying around us , . going to their usual breeding-places further north . The coast , at a distance , appeared rather low ; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the shore , we descried masts ,  --  the best marks of civilization . They were fishermen at anchor in a harbor . Supposing ourselves then to be where nautical skill has honor and reward , we hoisted a signal for a pilot ; and one came on board , guiding us through a labyrinth of rocks , called Esquimaux islands . We anchored in the harbor called Nitasquam , or American harbor , fifty degrees North . Small time was consumed in launching the boat and rowing ashore , and our pleasure was so great at the abstract fact of landing , that we perceived not , at first , that we were on a shore barren , wild , and apparently uninhabited and uninhabitable . Our horizon included nothing but a rich carpet of moss spread upon a floor of rock . There was a small stream or two , and a few spots of dwarf wood . There were , also , a few naked rocks of considerable elevation . We remained in this sterile spot nearly a fortnight , . and , when ' it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was not easy to travel ; in the low woods , the interlocked bra*ches were almost impenetrable , and the interminable fields of moss were hardly less discouraging . It was soft and inelastic , and it was an agreeable change to clamber up the rocks . We found many species of birds , but only a single new one ,  --  a finch . There were numbers of murrs , seapigeons , velvet ducks , loons , eyder ducks , terns , and wild geese . We // saw no quadrupeds , but a pair of rats on an island , and a lucerfee , or loup-cervier , a species of wolf ; . but he was too shy for a shot . The tracks of bears were abundant , and we set a spring-gun in the path . On the second morning , we discovered that the bait had been a little removed , and the gun discharged ; but there were no indications that Bruin had been hurt . Mr. Audubon passed much of his time on board , and finished drawings of the murr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sandy beach , near a ri* ) pling stream , there was a camp of half a dozen of the Mickmac tribe . They hunt d for the Hudson Bay Company . In taking seals , one of them is armed with a long gun , and the other with a barbed spear attached to a long line . Concealing themselves in the holes of the rock , they wait for a seal to come on the edge of the cliff and bask in the sun . The moment the gun is discharged , the spearman plunges his weapon in the body , otherwise the seal would sink and rise no more . These Indians had a French Almanac , and kept their days with a pin , which they removed every day according to the calendar . We had time to visit the cod-fishermen , whose life is by no means an indolent one . To each vessel there are five or six small boats , shaped like whale-boats . Each holds about twelve hundred fish . At three o'clock in the morning , each boat , manned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . distant three or four miles . They anchor , and one man sits at the stern , the other at the bow , where , with two or three lines , they are constantly employed in hauling up the fish . On board the vessel , , one portion of the crew eviscerate the fish and drop them into the hold , where another party salt and pack them . They work till eleven at night , and have but four hours for repose . Formerly , the food of these sailors was principally fish , which has of late years been changed for the usual ship provisions , with which the men can endure more exposure and fatigue . Notwithstanding a service of four months , in which they are much exposed to wet , cold , and fatigue , they are more hardy than when they commence the voyage . Our next harbor was Wapitiquam , and on our way we passed many - rocks . Some towered to a great height , and others were indicated only by the waves which broke over them . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render the navigation difficult and dangerous . We landed upon one , which , like all the rest , was the picture of desolation . We had a wild view from the summit . The earth seemed void of inhabitants : we were all that appeared within the visible horizon , and there were no buildings ' , no smoke , no traces of man . Over our heads there were flocks of cormorants , which our landing had disturbed , flying about in silent agitation for the safety of their young : although " so unacquainted with man , " they knew enough of him ' to justify some fear . Each nest had one , two , or three young birds , which generally looked up to us as expecting food at our hands , though some stretched their long necks quietly over their backs , and all ' uttered h'arsb , discordant cries . Mr. Audubon studied . intently the position and expression of these jet-black beauties , and depicted a nest of them in his very best manner . While in this harbor , we were confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost constant rain . From the eminences that we ascended , we saw the interior to be composed of lakes , mountains , and fields of moss . In our excursions , we found it necessary to travel , at least , thirty miles , to advance ten in one direction , there are so many lakes and streams . The Esquimaux , who follow the caribou into the interior , take their canoes , and by this means they can travel in a direct course . Three leagues from our vessel we discovered the habitation of men ; two of the inhabitants were very old , the third of middle age . Old as they were , they all lived by fishing for salmon , *but had then little success . In six weeks they had caught three fish ; but their hopes were as strong as those of any amateur fisherman , who sits all day upon a bank , well pleased with the omen of a " glorious nibble . " The eldest has lived a life of self-denial and simplicity , in this region , forty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortnight 's vacation , and three years ' pay , both of which come to a simultaneous close . At the end of every salmon season , a Company 's vessel comes for the fish . When this season is over , the recluses have little to do . If it were not a life of choice , it would be a very hard one . they have the best garden in the country , and are able to raise in it a few potatoes and turnips ,  --  enough to give them an occasional taste of vegetables . There are few rivers on the coast , but many small streams ,  --  the shallow outlets of the numerous lakes . We went up a few , but found the navigation difficult even for our light gig . The charts are not the best . The British schooner Gulnare , Captain Bayfield , has been surveying the coast for several summers , and the result will probably be of much advantage to navigators . We were much pleased with the society of the officers , who showed us the charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this harbor , Mr. Audubon was eminently successful in his drawings , especially in a pair of ptarn:igan , and their seven young , with a Labrador back-ground . He drew also the great north diver , or loon , and the red-neck diver . Our next harbor was Little Meccatina . There the mountains were more lofty , and the moss less beautiful . Near us was a rock , two thousand feet high , which we ascended , and saw from the summit a chain of mountains and an interminable series of lakes . This harbor was a wild and impressive place . Mr. Audubon shot in the vicinity a Hudson Bay titmouse , which is all the sacrifice he was able to make to the cause of science . On the 21st of July , we anchored in Great Meccatina harbor , and traveled a few miles to visit some fishermen . They have not far to go to find whales and seals , and the oil is sent to Quebec in small schooners . They directed us to Mr. Robinson , three leagues distant , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received us very cordially . He has two large store-houses and a very neat dwelling , all of which were made in Quebec . This part of Labrador has no tree large enough for the smallest beam . With the remnant of an ample fortune he purchased these buildings , and a small schooner , and he has been successful in the trade . In summer ; his land excursions are short , from the difficulty of traveling over the moss , and from the plague of insects-black flies and mosquitoes , small insects but great annoyers . They drew blood like leeches , from // numerous punctures in our faces , necks , and hands . In winter , our host with his family visits his brother , at Brador , fifty miles , and some other neighbors . He is drawn in a sledge over ice and snow , by dogs . At that season partridges are so abundant that hundreds may be killed in an hour ; but they are very lean . hi winter , too , the bears and caribou abound . Here , in Labrador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men have created to be their bane in civilized society ,  --  internperance and avarice . " Money , " said he , " is useless in Labrador , and ardent spirits never enter my house . " He is well contented in the secluded life he has chosen , and the health of the family was uniformly good . Returning to our vessel , we passed the abode of the other man of Labrador , whose dogs , fourteen in number , saluted us with a most dolorous howl . These quadrupeds are idle in summer , except in providing for their own support ; it is only in winter that they are fed . These are of the Esquimaux breed , and but little degenerated . They are large and powerful , shaggy animals , capable of doing good service , but fierce and unmanageable by all but their master . In the day time a person may approach their domain unharmed , but by night he would be torn in pieces . Ten or a dozen will draw a heavily laden sledge fifty or sixty miles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters , seem to understand the prognostics of the weather . When , in the winter , a little cloud is descried in the horizon , which at other times would be unheeded , the heads of the dogs are turned to the nearest shelter , and they seem to comprehend the necessity of making speed ; for such a cloud is generally the precursor of a storm that has no parallel in New-England . The Esquimaux dogs , however , like all the canine race , serve ungrateful masters . When sick , lame , or worn out with service , they are either knocked on the head , or left to the slower destruction of famine . In providing for themselves , the dogs sometimes stand motionless for hours in the cold water , watching for fish , which they snap very adroitly . But patience is the virtue of all anglers . We visited the Murr Rocks , about two leagues from the harbor . Around them the water was black with the birds , the air was darkened , and the rocks themselves seemed alive with sable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , they moved away from us in a manner between swimming and flying ; the flapping of their wings and their cries being blended in a harsh and disagreeable sound . Whereever we walked on the rocks , we dislodged thousands of birds from nests , which passed to and fro over our heads , almost touching us . We conveyed to our boat- " CONVEY the wise it call " - several bushels of eggs , which we collected in half an hour . *f hey were of a beautiful variegated color . Our depredation was as nothing compared with the piracy of a set of men called Eggers , chiefly from Nova Scotia , from whence they come in small schooners , that find harbors in any little nook or inlet . When they land at a breeding-place , no egg escapes them ; they overlook no hole , however small , or shelf , however dangerous . Their trade is as dangerous as his " that gathers samphire . " The Eggers find as sure a market for their spoil in Nova Scotia , as other pirates find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of so many birds destroyed in the egg . To the murrs this removal of the deposits occasions great distress and loss . // We next visited Brador , the largest fishing station on the coast . There were many vessels , and the harbor presented a busy scene . Boats were gliding about , and decks were filled with men preparing their fish , singing , laughing , and passing such jokes as a sailor can muster . One of the masters told us , that , trying to enter the harbor on the 12th of ' July , he was obstructed by ice . Here we tasted the hospitality of a worthy settler , who gave us much local information . He carries on the seal fishery , setting his nets about six weeks in spring and summer , when the seals go up the shallow places to bask in the sun . When they are up , the nets are placed two or three deep , to intercept their coming down . The first range of nets is filled , and hundreds go by to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hooks , haul in some of the seals , while others are drawn on shore in the net , and knocked on the head . The skins are stripped off and preserved , the bodies thrown into large vats , and the oil extracted . When this is done , the carcasses are given to the dogs for their carnival . Three or four hundred barrels are made yearly . Five of the common seal , and three of the hooded kind , produce a barrel of oil . In the lakes of the interior , there are *vild geese and many kinds of ducks , but our host admitted , that , to kill them , was a laborious sport . He had never seen but two polar bears , one of which he killed . Much of his summer was consumed in collecting fuel for winter . He has four cows and a horse , which he winters upon hay , and he raises the only grass we had seen in the country : but the soil was rich , and produced turnips and a few other vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a place where fish are cured on shore instead of ' in the vessels . It was a hard walk . Sometimes we were obliged to hobble for miles , by stepping on loose stones , and we had the agreeable variety of going through water , dwarf woods , and moss . On the 2d of August , we saw an iceberg , that went aground , at the distance of a league . It was none of the largest , but it gave us a conception of these great moving bodies . One day 's sun reduced it to a fluid . We visited Parroquet Island* which derives its name from the birds so called . They do not lay , like the murrs , upon the bare rock ; but , selecting an island with a soil , they dig burrows with their sharp claws , two or three feet in depth , where they deposite their eggs . The Labrador curlews appeared here , on their return from their summer residence . Where that is , who can tell ? They come suddenly in flocks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened as with a cloud . Their bills are about three inches in length , and with these apparently clumsy instruments , they pick the small ber-berries with great rapidity . Their flavor is delicious , and they are easily killed ; for , being fat , they do nol care to rise . We obtained two new species of hawk , on which occasion we raised , as far as our limited voices permitted , three cheers . The world will see them as they were seen in Labrador , perched on a dead branch , and apparently conversing in their own way , little aware of the good fortune that awaited them , of dying in the cause of science , and securing posthumous fame . There will be a good picture of curlews , too , one dead and // the other " scared , " - too much frightened to fly , and trying to hide its head from the whistling shot . On the 11th of August , we departed for Newfoundland , not unwillingly leaving this country of stones , though it had given us gratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by rain , and we had few hooks . But , luckily for us , Mr. Audubon himself was a volume not to be exhausted . He is full of anecdote and originality . We anchored next at the head of St. George 's Bay , in Newfoundland , where there is quite a settlement of fishernen ,  --  for such seems the occupation of all the islanders . Tbere was on the bay , also , an Indian camp . They were of the Mickmac tribe , and filthy and indolent to an extreme . They are averse to all exercise . They hunt only on the pressure of hunger , and they had their little provision in camp , the head ofa caribou ,  --  or American rein-deer . This part of Newfoundland had much of the character of Labrador . The soil , however , was more productive , and we found wild roses and tall pines , though there were many dwarf trees . We found here the fruit called , from similarity of taste , the baked apple . In form , it is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name denotes . The most beautiful plant we saw , was a species or two of kalmia . The inhabitants retire in winter into the country , where , in the woods and sheltered places , they have comfortable log-houses . Many of them are quite intelligent , though the most of them thought their climate preferable to any other ; but I am too experienced in the ways of the world , ever to speak ill of a man 's dog or climate . Of the two , I would sooner venture to speak disrespectfully of the climate in this region . Of the dogs , we obtained seven ; one of which , while with us , dived five fathoms , and brought up a seal that had been shot , larger than herself . But , though I had much more written of this island , your limits admonish me that I must stop . The space you offer is unfavorable to prosers , though I have taken as much advantage in this way as I could . W. I.@@183068716.txt This association has published several volumes of lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important addition to the literature of the country . They doubtless contain some examples of bad taste , and many crude notions ; but in general they are distinguished by good sense and a manly expression of opinion . No class of men need so much the correcting power of intercourse and collision with their minds as teachers . Set apart , by the nature of their profession , from the daily rivalship of equals and superiors , they are exceedingly apt to run into a dogmatism of opinion , which , to say the least , is a disagreeable drawback U*Ofl the pleasures of life , and exerts an injurious influence on the individual teacher 's own mind . They are peculiarly exposed to the ' habit of riding hobbies ; and when once mounted , they are the most unmerciful jockeys in the world . They are monarchs in their own sphere , and can not bear contradiction . They have a string of cant phrases , almost unintelligible to the profane , which they inflict on every body . A schoolmaster is apt to be known as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written on his brow , moves in his gait , sounds in his voice ; it dwells with him at home , abroad , asleep , awake , hungry , at dinner , in the brim of his hat , in the tail of his coat , in the motion of his arm , and on his left thambnail . In short , he thinks of the world as of an enormous school-house , and the object of life , the successful exercise of the pedagogue office . Such is unquestionably the tendency of this laborious profession . He , who is made conscious , at an early period of his career , of this tendency , may guard against it , and escape it . If he does so , his general vigor of mind will be increased , his power as a teacher greatly strengthened ' , and he will feel himself to be not only a teacher , but , what is of greater consequence , a ' man . To meet this want of the great body of teachers , the American Institute was first designed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom , not professionally engaged in teaching , are members , greatly to its advantage . The annual lectures have given ' it reputation , and made it the ' instrument , we have reason to think. , of extended usefulness . This volume contains a journal of proceedings , an Introductory lecture by Mr. William Sullivan , and ten other lectures , on various subjects , assigned by the government of the Institute . Mr. Sullivan is well known as the author of several excellent popular works , and his reputation will be sustained and increased by this discourse . Its general subject is the best method of promoting the intelligence and happiness of society . Its prevailing characteristics are , good sense , and just views , expressed in a clear , correct , and elegant style . The fol // 425 lowing extract contains some striking reflections on the condition of our country , in relation to several agitating topics What is that in which the people of the United States consider themselves to be privileged , far above every other people ; and to gain which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk their lives ? One knows not what it is , unless it be the right of choosing rulers from among equals . Yet , through this , which is not only a good thing politically , but the best political thing that can be , this country seems to be hurrying on to as deplorable a condition as any , which is seen in Europe or South-America . How should it be otherwise ? We go on from generation to generation , as though a clear knowledge of the rights and duties of a free citizen could be bud , throughout our extensive country , by some sort of inspiration . We all know , every citizen is presumed to judge of public policy , and to be able , if it be wicked or unwise , to correct it , by exercising his electoral right . Yet , there is not one youth in a thousand , even among the best educated , who ever spent an hour in stuilying the principles ef our political and social being . It will not be denied , that nearly all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its serious duties , without one word of instruction as to the nature of these duties , nor even that there are any such duties , if a youth observes at all what is passing in the political world , h only reads some speech as a specimen of elotinence ; or notices some electioneering controversy , which must seem to him to be of much the same dignity as a combat among nladiator 's ; and if the election involve some principle of constitutional law , or " of vital expediency , these lie far beyond his perception . How should he have learned , that on the conscientious exercise of electoral right , depends the welfare of himself ; of all around him , and of all who are to come after him ? It never entered his head that a sacred trust will soon devolve on him , for which he will be held far more seriously accountable , than he can be for any other trust , which it may be in his power to assume . If there be any among us , who think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country is fast hastening under the dominion of factions , as audacious and corrupt as any ever known within the walls of Rome , surely they must feel that they have some duties to perform . If they can ' do nothing to arouse and inform adult age , grateful reverence to forefathers , affection for those who are of their own times , and faithfulness to coming generations , unitedly demand of them to do their best and utmost , to instruct and purify the young- . It is not supposed that education can be so universal ; that every citizen , who is entitled to vote , will be profoundly versed in constitutional law , or public expediency . But a large majority may be sufficiently so ; and we must depend , to some extent , on example , imitation , and sympathy . It is as reasonable to suppose that such influences may have effect in morals , and public policy , as in the wearing of a *vatch-chain , or the deforming fulness of a sleeve . It is in vain to busy ourselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals , and in the rational belief on which such morals rest ; for learning , which is not chastened by such ' teaching , is more likely to be mischievous , than useful . Learning , however chastened , affords no assurance of happiness to a people wlso are so careless , or ignorant of their public affairs , that they know not whether they are ruled by honest imbecility , or skillful dishonesty . With all the benefits from instruction , which we can in any way obtain , let us not deceive ourselves in supposing , that we shall be free from all embarrassments and perils , as a nation . All thoughtful men contemplate the future of this country with fearful emotions . They can not be unmindful of the truth , that it requires still more effort . to preserve , than to acquire . We have at no time been more in want of good information , good sense , and sound judgement , than at the present . It is impossible to foresee how we shall be affected by the probable state of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils of the last winter and spring seem to have passed harmlessly over . The causes of excitement remain . The danger of disunion is not passed . No one need now be reminded of the consequences of throwing the States into the relation , . which they sustained from the year 1783 to 1789 . As it is so deeply connected with the happiness of our country , and with national existence , I venture to express some opinions on one subject , which is now much considered in the Northern States , and in England . It is a subject to be regarded with the most fearful apprehensions , and which seems to be improvb // Literary Notices . dently treated . The ostensible cause of nullification , as it is called , was the operation of certain laws of the National Government . It is believed that the real cause lies far deeper , and is of far graver character . Slavery is a sore evil , whether regarded as social , moral , or political . It seems to have originated in the right of victory in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of property in a white man gradually expired , probably under the influence of the Christian religion , in the thirteenth century . The slavery of Africans was begun by Portugal , under Royal authority , at the close of the fifteenth century , and was very soon adopted by Spain . Charles V. granted a patent in 1517 , to supply four thousand negroes annually . In the seventeenth century divers companies were formed in England , under royal patronage , and slaves became an article of established commerce . When the Spaniards obtained possession of South-America , the natives were slaves in right of conquest , and were employed in the mines , a servitude to which they were found to be unequal . A Spanish prelate , named Las Casas , from humanity to the Indians , introduced the Africans , as the slaves of the Western World , and gave , as one reason , that they would obtain the " inestimable advantage of a knowledge of the true God , and of all the benefits of civilization . " Slavery was soon common in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence slaves were first brought , as an article of commerce , by a Dutch vessel , into James River , in Virginia , soon after the settlement of the country . Shortly after they were known in all the colonies as property , and in some of the states are now so held . Morally wrong , and politically grievous , as slavery undoubtedly is , it is not perceived that those who were born in the states , where slavery thus became incorporated with social existence , are to be reproached with its origin , or continuance ; certainly not with the former ; nor with the latter , unless they have the means of extirpating it . Whether it was right , or wrong , to recognize the existence of human beings as property , in establishing the union of the states , and whether any union could have been effected without that recognition , it is worse than useless to inquire . Doubtless , wisdom , foresight , and patriotism , are to be attributed to the assembly who framed the constitution , and to the representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to any that ever met . At any rate there is slavery , and the persons of the black man and of his descendants are regarded as property in the national confederacy . Over slaves , as such , the national government has no power of legislation , beyond the securing and restoration of slaves to owners when they are fugitives from the states in which their owners live ; and also when Congress sees fit to resort to direct taxation ; in which case slaves are included with other taxable property . As each state is sovereign within its own limits , except in those respects in which the people of each state have vested powers of sovereignty in the nation , the people of one state can exercise no power over person , or property , within the limits of any other . Such are our relations , whether we like them or not ; and such they must continue to be , until changed by consent or violence . Thus the enormous , dangerous , and revolting evil of slavery has grown up , and such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it exists , acknowledged it to be . Under these circumstances , some persons among the humane , the moral and religious , who dwell where slavery is not , and who are mostly utter strangers to its practical operation , from personal inspection , consider themselves imperiously called on , from high motives of duty , to demand , and by all means in their power to effect , immediate and entire abolition . Several of the following lectures are distinguished by elegance of composition and strength of thought . Mr. Professor Packard 's lecture , on teaching the ancient languages , is excellent . He is known as a practical instructer and an accomplished scholar . Many of his sug* gestions are of great importance , particularly his remarks on the mode of studying the classics by the aid of extracts from a great variety of authors , instead of a selection of entire works . His view is becoming the common belief of classical teachers , and the probability now is that the principle , on which his view is founded , will , before long , supersede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on emulation in schools , is written with force and liveliness . Like all that gentleman 's former writings , it is // strong , and independent , and occasionally marked with high eloquence. lie is decidedly in favor of using this motive to exertion , and his argument seems to us decidedly triumphant . The subject is probably about to be thoroughly discussed , as conflicting opinions are beginning to be expressed at home and abroad . Candid examination and honorable controversy can never do the cause of truth any harm ; and this , among many other subjects , will well bear to be canvassed anew in our high places of learning . Mean time , as a specimen of Mr. Withington 's beautiful style , we give the following short passage In tracing the history of all metaphysical reasoning , it is curious to see , how much of its acuteness and ingenuity consists in innovations on language , and departures from the common usages of mankind . We are told by one that all virtue depends on expediency . But what is expediency ? Surely not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as well might the eagle attempt to support his flight to the sun , by the waving of a single feather , as for a moralist to build a solemn system of duty on such a sandy foundation : but expediency here is something , which can justify the assertion that it is the ground of all virtue . Then you have a wonderful discovery , a reciprocal definition , that all virtue is founded on expediency ; and expediency is that which supports all virtue . When two abstract words are thus brought *together , the one to define the other , with an attempted accuracy beyond the plainness of common speech ; I am sure beforehand , that I am to have all the puzzle of philosophy without the light of truth . One column of smoke goes up to illuminate another column of smoke ; and both these columns serve only to fill the air with darkness , and increase the number of sore eyes . Bishop Butler speaks of those , who trace all our actions up to selfishness ,  --  even the saint and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in serving God , and doing good to man ,  - -  as much delight as the epicure in his sensual pleasures ; and that delight is as much their own delight , and therefore it is selfish . In this sense , no doubt , every action in every holy being is selfish . But then , as Butler remarks , this is not the language of mankind . I have often thought , how many a fine system might be overthrown by the remark-Tins is NOT THE LANCUACE or MANKIND . Seneca tells us that all anger is sinful . We must not merely rule it , but we must kill and purge from our hearts every seed and sediment of that baneful passion . Aristotle had said that anger was necessary ; it was one of the constituent principles of our moral composition ; but we must govern it by reason ; we must use it as a private soldier , and not as a general to lead the way . But no , says Seneca ; if anger listens to reason , it ceases to be anger ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand by anger , is a principle unbridled and ungoverned . Very well : here we have a definition which makes anger a wrong thing ; and then the sapient conclusion , that all anger is wrong . Now what shall you oppose to Seneca 's reasoning ? Why , simply the remark of Butler-this is not the language of mankind . St. Paul came much nearer to that language , when he said , be ye angry and sin not . Of all the writers , who have apparently led us through new mazes of thought , and landed us on the shore of unknown conclusions , I remember none , who holds a more sparkling pre-eminence at the present day , than Coleridge . His language is beautiful and precise ; his figures are the finest devices stamped on the most shining metal ; his thoughts are sometimes new , and his reasoning is sometimes just . His books have paragraphs in them finer and more eloquent than the English language can elsewhere show . Yet his Friend is the most misleading book that was ever written ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead me to the temple of truth . And what is the difficulty ? He is a mystic , with more truth and more power in him , than most other mystics ; and when he has led you up the mount , in a path of sunshine ,  --  as far as he , perhaps , or any other mortal can go ,  --  then , to fill you with greater astonishment , he plunges into the fogs which surround the top of his Ida or Olympus , and you lose him somewhere between earth and heaven . The re*der is inclined to say at the close of some paragraph , splendid and dark-This is very eloquent and touching , and perhaps there is some truth in it , but this is not the language of mankind . In short , you may define a metaphysician generally as a man , who makes a language of his own . When you see a startling paradox , you may be sure there has been tampering with the king 's English ; and metaphysics can prove anything ,  --  // as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , and moulds its words to her own imperial will . Mr. Greene 's lecture , on Jacotot 's method of instruction , will be in* teresting to those who are concerned in the business of teaching . It is written with candor and ability . Dr. Reynolds 's , on the principles of physiology , contains views of lasting importance . This subject has been long and culpably neglected ; but now , many of the most acute minds in the country are giving it their attention , and developing great truths , deeply affecting the methods of education , at present in vogue . Erom these investigations we hope the most favorable results . The Germans have a technical word ( Padagogik ) which might he rendered " Pedagogics , " or the Science of Education . This shows the importance they assign to the subject . It has assumed the form and the name of a regular science among them , and many elaborate treatises have been published , illustrating it in every possible way . Should such a state of things ever exist in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked upon as among the most interesting and useful works on the &amp;ience of Education.
