txt This little volume is understood to be the production of a young writer , who has grown up among the wild scenes of the North-Western frontier of our country , and being now restored to the abodes of civilized life , has given us the fruits of his experience in the form of tales . We have had some reason to suppose that the North-West coast was a pretty good school , and the work before us will go far to extend this favorable prepossession to the internal regions in that quarter of the continent . Considering the circumstances under which it was prepared , we look upon it as one of much promise . The descriptions of nature , both living and inanimate , have a striking air of truth and fidelity , and the style of execution is marked throughout with great freedom and power . There are no doubt obvious symptoms of immature taste , and a too rapid preparation ; but these are defects that are naturally and easily corrected when there is talent at bottom . If in his future at*. tempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement of his materials , and allow himself more time for composition and revision , we think we can assure him a decided success . The characters that figure in these narratives are the Indians , the half-breeds , and the American and English hunters , that roam through the vast solitunies of the Missouri territory , and are all different varieties of the same general character . The representation given by our author of time manners of the natives is somewhat less poetical , but probably more true than that of Cooper . The leading traits of the picture are , however , substantially the same which appear in his delineations , and which , with few or no important discrepancies , have been assigned by almost all observers to the aboriginal mba hitants of our continent . The Indians furnish undoubtedly one of the most favorable specimens of savage life that have yet been met with . The striking similarity between their state of society and that of the ancient Germans , as described by Tacitus , has bcen often pointed out , particularly by Robertson and Herder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natives of our continent , had they been left to pursue their own course , // would have made a progress in civilisation , corresponding with that which has taken place in Europe , is a curious question , which it is now impossible ever to solve . It is much to be *egretted , that political events of an accidental character are likely to defeat the only effort that has yet been made with a probability of success for bringing any portion of the natives within the pale of civilisation . The southwestern tribes had within a few years apparently overcome the first and greatest obstacles to improvement , and it is peculiarly unfortunate that just at this moment a combination of local and sectional intcrests should have operated to prevent the progress of this interesting experiment , and probably in the end to remove from our territory the tribes in which it was going on . The tales contained in the volume before us are generally short . The longest , entitled the Bois Brub* ( Burnt Wood , the French name for a half-breed ) , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the one in which , from its length , a want of maturity in plan and style would naturally be most observable . Among the most spirited and pleasing is the one entitled Payton Skaht , or the White Otter , which we extract entire as a specimen of the author 's manner . We have before intimated that we can not prctend to much accuracy with regard to dates . So we are not certain that the events we are about to relate did not happen five centuries ago , perhaps more ; but it is probable that the time was not so remote . Be that as it may , we shall give the facts in the same order in which tradition hands them down . The Dahcotahs were at war with the Mandans . Many were the onslaughts they made on each other , and long were they remembered . Among the Sioux warriors who struck the post , and took the war lath , none was more conspicuous than Payton Skab , or the White Otter . He belonged to the Yankton band . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , more properly with his bridle rein adorned with Mandan scalps , the seniors of the tribe pointed to him and exhorted their sons to ride , to draw the bow , and to strike the enemy like Payton Skab . Payton Skah was a husband and a father . As soon as he was reckoned a man , and able to support a family , he had taken to his bosom the young and graceful Tabtokab ( The Antelope ) , thought to be the best hand at skinning the buffalo , making moccasins , whitening leather , and preparing marrow fat , in the tribe . She was not , as is common among the Dahcotahs , car VOL. xxxl. - No. 68. 26 // ned an unwilling or indifferent bride to her husband 's lodge . No , he had lighted his match in her father 's tent , and held it before her eyes , and she had blown it out , as instigated by love to do . And w hen he had espoused her in form , her affection did not diminish . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned from the chase , nor at drying and rubbing them till they became soft and pliant . A greater proof of her regard was , that she was strictly obedient to her mother-in-law . And Payton Skah 's attachment , though his endearments were reserved for their private hours , was not less than hers . No woman in the camp could show more wampum and other ornaments than the wife of the young warrior . He was even several times known , when she had been to bring home the meat procured by his arrows , to relieve her of a part of the burthen by taking it upon his own nianly shoulders . In due time , she gave him a son ; a sure token that however many more wives he might see proper to take he would never put her away . The boy was the idol of his old grandmother , who could never suffer him out of her sight a moment , and used constantly to prophecy , that he would become a brave warrior and an expert horse-stealer ; a prediction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the youngster was able to walk erect . About this time the band began to feel the approach of famine . Buffaloes were supposed to abound on the river Des Moines , and thither Payton Skah resolved to go . His mother had cut her f.oot while chopping wood and was unable to travel ; but she would not part with her grandchild . Tahtokah unwillingly consented to leave her boy behind , at the request of her husband , which indeed she never thought of disputing . One other family accompanied them . They soon reached the Des Moines , and encamped on its banks . Many wild cattle were killed , and much of their flesh was cured . The young wife now reminded her spouse that his mother must by this time be able to walk , and that she longed to see her child . In compliance with her wishes he mounted his horse and departed , resolved to bring the rest of the band to the land of plenty . At his arrival his compatriots , on his representations , packed up their baggage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where he had left his wife and her companions . But the place was desolate . No voice hailed their approach ; no welcome greeted their arrival . The lodges were cut to ribbons , and a bloody trail marked where the bodies of their inmates had been dragged into the river . Following the course of the stream , the corpses of all but Tahtokah were found on the shores and sand-bars . Hers was missing , but this gave her husband no consolation . He knew that neither Sioux nor Mandans // spared sex or age , and supposed it to be sunk in some eddy of the river . And Mandans , the marks the spoilers had left behind them , proved them to be . Now Payton Skah was , for an Indian , a kind and affectionate husband . The Sioux mothers wished their daughters might obtain partners like him ; and it was proverbial to say of a fond couple , that they loved like Payton Skah and Tahtokah . Yet on this occasion , whatever his feelings might have been , he uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave what was , in the eyes of his co-mates , a more honorable proof of his grief . He vowed that he would not take another wife , nor cut his hair , till he had killed and scalped five Mandans . And he filled his quiver , saddled his horse , and raised the war-song immediately . He found followers , and departed incontinently . At his return but three obstacles to his second marriage remained to be overcome . In the course of the year he fulfilled the conditions of his vow . The five scalps were hanging in the smoke of his lodge , but he evinced no inclination towards matrimony . On the contrary , his countenance was sorrowful , he pined away , and every one thought he was in a consumption . His mother knew his disposition better . Thinking , not unwisely , that the best way to drive the old love out of his head was to provide him a new one , she , with true female perseverance , compelled him by teazing and clamor to do as she wished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart ) , for her son , and demanded her of her parents , who were not sorry to form such a connexion . The bride elect herself showed no alacrity in the matter ; but this was too common a thing to excite any surprise or comment . She was formally made over to Payton Skab , and duly installed in his lodge . He was not formed by nature to be alone . Notxvithstanding the contempt an Indian education inculcates for the fair sex , he was as sensible to female blandishments as a man could be . Though his new wife was by no means so kind as the old one , yet as she fulfilled the duties of her station with all apparent decorum , he began to be attached to her . His health improved , he was again heard to laugh , and he hunted the buffalo with as much vigor as ever . Yet when Chuntay Washtay , as she sometimes would , raised her voice higher than was consistent with conjugal affection , he would think of his lost Tahtokah and struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked Chuntay Washtay of her parents previous to her marriage , and who had been rejected by them , now became a constant visiter in her husband 's lodge . He came early , and staid and smoked late . But as Payton Skah saw no appearance of regard for the youth in his wife , he felt no // uneasiness . If he had seen what was passing in her mind , he would have scorned to exhibit any jealousy . He would have proved by his demeanor that his heart was strong . ' He was destined ere long to be more enlightened on this point . His mother was gone with his child , on a visit to a neighboring camp , and he was left alone with his wife . It was reported that buffaloes were to be found at a little oasis in the prairie , at about the distance of a day 's journey , and Chuntay Washtay desired him to go and kill one , and hang its flesh up in a tree out of the reach of the wolves . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but you can make a fire and sleep by it , and return to morrow . If fat cows are to be found there we will take down our lodge and move . " The White Otter did as he was desired . His wife brought his beautiful black horse , which he had selected and stolen from a drove near the Mandan village , to the door of the lodge . He threw himself on its back , and having listened to her entreaties that he would be back soon , rode away . His gallant steed carried him to the place of his destination with the speed of the wind . The buffaloes were plenty , and in the space of two hours he had killed and cut up two of them . Having hung the meat upon the branches , he concluded that as he had got some hours of daylight , he would return to his wife . He applied the lash , and arrived at the camp at midnight . He picketed his horse carefully , and bent his way to his own lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenting their master , gave no alarm , lie took up a handful of dry twigs outside the door and entered . Raking open the coals in the centre of the lodge , lie laid on the fuel , which presently blazed and gave a bright light . By its aid he discovered a spectacle that drove the blood from his heart into his face . There lay Chantay Washtay , fast asleep by the side of her quondam lover . Payton Skah unsheathed his knife and stood for a moment irresolute ; but his better feelings prevailing , he returned it to its place in his belt , and left the lodge without awakening them . Going to another place , he laid himself down , but not to sleep . But when the east began to be streaked with grey , he brought his horse , his favorite steed , to the door of the tent . Just as he reached it , those within awoke , and the paramour of Chantay Washtay came forth and stood before him . He stood still . Fear of the famous hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stern voice , commanded him to re-enter ; and when he had obeyed followed him in . The guilty wife spoke not , but covered her face with her hands , till her husband directed her to light a fire and prepare food . She then rose and hung the earthen utensil over the fire , and the repast was soon // ready . At the command of Payton Skah she placed a wooden platter or bowl before him , and another for his unwilling guest . This last had now arrived at the conclusion that he was to die , and had screwed up hi* courage to meet his fate with the unshrinking fortitude of an Indian warrior . He ate , therefore , in silence , hut without any sign of concern . When the repast was ended , Payton Skah produced his pipe , filled the howl with tobacco mixed with the inner bark of the red willow , and , after smoking a few whiffs himself , gave it to the culprit . Having passed from one to the other till it was finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effects , and pack them up in a bundle . This done he rose to speak . " Another in my place , " he said to the young man , " had he detected you as I did last night , would have driven an arrow through you before you awoke . But my heart is strong , and I have hold of the heart of Chantay Washtay . You sought her before I did , and I see she would rather he your companion than mine . She is yours ; and that you may be able to support her , take my horse , and my bow and arrows also . Take her and depart , and let peace be between us . " At this speech , the wife , who had been trembling lest her nose should be cut off and her lover , who had expected nothing less than death , recovered their assurance and left the lodge . Payton Skah remained ; and while the whole band was singing his generosity , brooded over his misfortunes in sadness and silence . Notwithstanding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly unsettled by the shock . He had set his whole heart upon Tahtokah , and when the wound occasioned by his loss was healed , he had loved Chantay Washtay with all his might . He could vaunt of his indifference to any ill that woman could inflict to the warriors of his trihe , but the boast that they could have truly made , was not true coming from him . Though one of the bravest of men , his heart was as soft as a woman ' s , in spite of precept and example . At this second blight of his affections , he fell into a settled melancholy , and one or two unsuccessful hunts convinced him that he was a doomed man ; an object of the displeasure of God ; and that he need never more look for any good fortune . A post dance , at which the performers alternately sung their exploits , brought this morbid state of feeling to a crisis . Like the rest , he recounted the deeds he had done , and declared that to expiate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go to the Mandan village and throw away his body . All expostulation was vain ; and the next morning he started on foot and alone to put his purpose in execution . // He travelled onward with a heavy heart , and the eighth evening found him on the hank of the Missouri , opposite the Mandan village . He swam the river , and saw the lights shine through the crevices , and heard the dogs bark at his approach . Nothing dismayed , he entered the village , and promenaded through it two or three times . He saw no man abroad , and impatient of delay , entered the principal lodge . Within he found two women , who spoke to him , but he did not answer . lie drew his robe over his face , and sat down in a dark corner , intending to await the entrance of some warrior , by whose hands he might honorably die . The women addressed him repeatedly , but could not draw from him any reply . Finding him impenetrable , they took no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been present . Had they known to what tribe he belonged they would have fled in terror ; but they supposed him to be a Mandan . He gathered from it that the men of the village were all gone to the buffalo hunt , and would not return till morning . Most of the females were with them . Here then , was an opportunity to wreak his vengeance on the tribe such as had never before occurred , and would probably never occur again . But he refrained in spite of his Indian nature . He had not come to kill any one as on former occasions , but to lay down his own life ; and he remained constant in his resolution . If it be asked why the Mandans left their village in this defenceless condition , we answer , that Indian camps are frequently left in the same manner . Perhaps they relied on the broad and rapid river , to keep off any roving band of Dahcotahs that might come thither . Payton Skah sat in the lodge of his enemies till the tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jingling of the little bells round his neck , announced that a warrior had returned from the hunt . Then the Whito Otter prepared to go to whatever lodge the Mandan might enter , and die by his arrows or tomahawk . But he had no occasion to stir . The horseman rode straight to the lodge in which he sat , dismounted , threw his bridle to a squaw , and entered . The women pointed to their silent guest , and related how unaccountably he had behaved . The new comer turned to Payton Skah and asked who and what he was . Then the Yankton , like Caius Marius within the walls of Corioli , rose , threw off his robe , and , drawing himself up with great dignity , bared his breast and spoke . " I am a man . Of that , Mandan , be assured . Nay , more : I am a Dahcotah , and my name is Payton Skah . You have heard it before . I have lost friends and kin by the arrows of your people , and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear ten feathers of the war-eagle . Now it is the will of the Master of life that I // should die , and to that purpose came I hither . Strike , therefore , and rid your tribe of the greatest enemy it ever had . " Courage , among the aborigines , as charity among Christians , covereth a multitude of sins . The Mandan warrior cast on his undaunted foe a look in which respect , delight , and admiration were blended . He raised his war-club as if about to strike , but the Siou blenched not ; not a nerve trembled-his eyelids did not quiver . The weapon dropped from the hand that held it . The Mandan tore open his own vestment , and said , " No , I will not kill so brave a man . But I will prove that my people are men also . I will not be outdone in generosity . Strike thou ; then take my horse and fly . " The Siou declined the offer , and insisted upon being himself the victim . The Mandan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter at last held out his hand in token of amity . He commanded the women to prepare a feast , and the two generous foes sat down and smoked together . The brave of the Missouri accounted for speaking the Dahcotah tongue by saying that he was himself half a Siou . His mother had belonged to that tribe and so did his wife , having both been made prisoners . In the morning Payton Skah should see and converse with them . And the Yankton proffered , since it did not appear to be the will of the Great Spirit that he should die , to become the instrument to bring about a firm and lasting peace between the two nations . In the morning the rest of the band arrived , and were informed what visitor was in the village . The women screamed with rage and cried for revenge . The men grasped their weapons and rushed tumultuously to the lodge to obtain it . A great clamor ensued . The Mandan stood before the door , declaring that he would guarantee the rights of hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the bow and war club he held ready to make his words good , made the impression he desired . The Mandans recoiled , consulted , and the elders decided that Payton Skah must be carried as a prisoner to the council-lodge , there to abide the result of their deliberations . Payton Skab , indifferent to whatever might befall him , walked proudly to the place appointed in the midst of a guard of Mandans , and accompanied by the taunts and execrations of the squaws . The preliminary of smoking over , the consultation did not last long . His new friend related how the prisoner had entered the village , alone and unarmed , save with his knife ; how he had magnanimously spared the women and children when at his mercy ; and how he had offered to negotiate a peace between the two tribes . Admiration of his valor overcame the hostility of the Mandans . Their hatred vanished like snow before the // sun , and it was carried by acclamation , that he should be treated as became an Indian brave , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proceedings a woman rushed into the lodge , broke through the circle of stern and armed warriors , and threw herself into the arms of the Dahcotah hero . It was Tahtokah , his first , his best beloved ! He did not return her caresses ; that would have derogated from his dignity ; but he asked her how she had escaped from the general slaughter at the Des Moines , and who was her present husband . She pointed to the Mandan to whom he had offered his breast . He it was , she said , who had spared her , and subsequently taken her to wife . He now advanced and proposed to Payton Skah to be come his kodak , or comrade , and to receive his wife back again , two propositions to which the latter gladly assented . For according to the customs of the Dahcotahs , a wife may be lent to one 's kodah without any impropriety . The Mandans devoted five days to feasting the gallant Yankton . At the end of that time he departed with his recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other gifts bestowed on him by his late enemies . His kodah accompanied him half way on his return , with a numerous retinue , and at parting received his promise that he would soon return . We leave our readers to imagine the joy of Tahtokah at seeing her child again on her arrival among the Sioux , as well as the satisfaction of the tribe at hearing that its best man had returned from his perilous ex'cursion alive and unhurt . In less than two months Payton Skah was again among the Mandans with six followers , who were hospitably received and entertained . An equal number of Mandans accompanied them on their return home , where they experienced the like treatment . As the intercourse between the tribes became more frequent hostilities were discontinued , and the feelings that prompted them were in time forgotten . The peace brought about as above related has continued without interruption to this day . As to Payton Skah , he recovered his health and spirits , was successful in war and the chase , and was finally convinced that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weenokhenckah Wandeeteekalt , or the Brave Woman , is another very agreeable story . The hero , Toskatnay , or the Woodpecker , is represented as a young Dalicotah of high pretensions on the score of intellectual and personal merit . He is rescued from an imminent danger by the courage and presence of mind of a copper-colored beauty , bearing the formidable // name just quoted , and without much previous attachment marries her out of gratitude . A well-stocked harem is , it seems , one of the principal means of political advancement among the Indians ; and our Woodpecker , being of an ambitious turn , after a while espouses a second wife , of whose name we are not informed , but who is the daughter of a leading Chief , called the Heron . The two dames very naturally quarrel , and out of their differences grows the distress of the tale . We extract the conclusion , which begins with a pleasing description of the Falls of St. Anthony , on the Upper Mississippi . There is nothing of the grandeur or sublimity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls of St. Anthony . But in wild and picturesque beauty it is perhaps un.equalled . Flowing over a tract of country five hundred miles in extent , the river , here more than half a mile wide , breaks into sheets of foam and rushes to the pitch over a strongly inclined plane . The fall itself is not high , we believe only sixteen feet perpendicular , but its face is broken and irregular . Huge slabs of rock lie scattered below , in wild disorder . Some stand on their edges , leaning against the ledge from which they have been disunited . Some lie piled upon each other in the water , in inimitable confusion . A long , narrow island divides the fall nearly in the middle . Its eastern side is not perpendicular , but broken into three distinct leaps , below which the twisting and twirling eddies threaten destruction to any living thing that enters them . On the western side , in the boiling rapids below , a few rods from the fall , stands a little island , of a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with forest trees . At the time of our story , its mightiest oak was the haunt of a solitary bald eagle , that had built his eyrie on the topmost branches , beyond the reach of man . It was occupied by his posterity till the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three , when the time-honored crest of the vegetable monarch bowed and gave way before the northern tempest . The little islet was believed inaccessible , till two daring privates of the fifth regiment , at very low water , waded out in the river above , and ascending the fall by means of the blocks of stone before mentioned , forded the intervening space , and were the first of their species that ever set foot upon it . Large trunks of trees frequently drift over , and diving into the chasms of the rocks , never appear again . The loon , or great northern diver , is also , at mnoulting time , when he is unable to rise from the water , often caught in the rapids . When he finds himself drawn in , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible , he faces downwards and goes over , screaming // horribly . These birds sometimes make the descent unhurt . Below , the rapids foam and roar and tumble for half a mile , and then subside into the clear , gentle current that continues unbroken to the Rock River Rapids ; and at high water to the Gulf of Mexico . Here too , the high bluffs which enclose the Mississippi commence . Such was the scene at the time of this authentic history , but now it is mended or marred , according to the taste of the spectator , by the works of the sons of Adam . It can shew its buildings , its saw-mill , it grist-mill , its cattle , and its cultivated fields . Nor is it unadorned with traditional honors . A Siou can tell you how the enemy in the darkness of inidiiight , deceived by the false beacons lighted by his ancestors , paddled his canoe into the rapids , from which he never issued alive . lie can give a good gucss too , what ghosts haunt the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our story : Toskatnay and his band passed the falls and raised their lodges a few rods above the rapids . It so happened that evening , that a violent quarrel arose between the two wives , which the presence of some of the elders only , prevented from ending in cuffing and scratching . When the master of the lodge returned , he rebuked them both , but the weight of his an*er fell on Weenokhenchah Wandeeteekah , though in fact , the dispute had been fastened on her by the other . She replied nothing to his reproaches , but his words sunk deep into her bosom , for he had spoken scornfully of her , saying that no Sion had 50 pitiful a wife as himself . She sobbed herself to sleep , and when the word was given in the morning to strike ti*e tents , she was the first to rise and set about it . While the business of embarkation was going on , it so chanced that the child of the poor woman crawled in the way of her rival , and received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother . Vociferating such terms as are current only at Bilhingsgate and in Indian camps , for squaws are not remarkable for delicacy of expression , she fastened upon the Heron 's daughter tooth and nail , who was not slow to return the compliment . Luckily their knives were wrested from them by the by-standers , or one or both would have been killed on the spot . This done , the men laughed and the women screamed , hut none offered to part them , till Toskatnay , who was busy at the other end of the camp , patching a birch canoe , heard the noise , and came and separated them by main force . He was highly indignant at an occurrence that must bring ridicule upon him . The Heron 's daughter he reproved , but Weenokhenchah Wandeeteekali he struck with his paddle repeatedly , and threatened to put her away . This filled the cup of her misery to overflowing : she looked at him indignantly and said , " You shall // never reproach me again . " She took up her child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an ordinary fit of sullenness , paid no attention to her motions . His unkindness at this time had the effect of confirming a a project that she had long revolved in her , mind , and she hastened to put it in execution . She embarked in a canoe with her child , and pushing from the shore , entered the rapids before she wa* perceived . When she was seen , both men and women , among whom her husband was the most earnest , followed her on the shore , entreating her to land ere it was too late . The river was hicrh so that it was impossible to intercept her , yet Toskatnay , finding his entreaties of no avail , would have thrown himself into the water to reach the canoe , had he not been withheld by his followers . Had this demonstration of interest occurred the day before , it is possible that her purpose would have been forgotten . As it was , she shook her open hand at him in scorn , and held up his child for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her song ran thus . " A cloud has come over me . My joys are turned to grief . Life has become a burden too heavy to bear , and it only remains to die . " The Great Spirit calls , I hear his voice in the roaring waters . Soon , soon , shall they close over my head , and my song shall be heard no more . " Turn thine eyes hither , proud chief . Thou art brave in battle , and all are silent when thou speakest in council . Thou hast met death , and hast not been afraid . " Thou hast braved the knife , and the axe ; and the shaft of the enemy has passed harmless by thee . " Thou hast seen the warrior fall . Thou hast heard him speak bittc. * words with his last breath . " But hast thou ever seen him dare more than a woman is about to do ? " Many speak of thy deeds . Old and young echo thy praises . Thou art the star the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the land . " But when men tell of thy exploits , they shall say , He slew his wife also ! ' Shame shall attend thy memory . " I slew the ravenous beast that was about to destroy thee . I planted thy corn , and made thee garments and moccasins . " When thou wast an hungred , I gave thee to eat , and when thou wast athirst , I brought thee cold water . I brought thee a son also , and I never disobeyed thy commands . " And this is my reward ! Thou hast laughed at me . Thou hast given me bitter words , and struck me heavy blows . // " Thou hast preferred another before me , and thou hast driven me to wish for the approach of death , as for the coming winter . " My child , my child ! Life is a scene of sorrow . I had not the love of a mother , did I not snatch thee from the woes thou must . endure . " Adorn thy wife with ornaments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be kind to her , and see if she will ever be to thee as I. " ' So saying , or rather singing , she went over the fall with her child , and they were seen no more . * * * * * * * * One year precisely from this time , Toskatnay followed the track of a bear which he had wounded , to the brink of the falls . He halted opposite the spot where Weenokhenchah Wandeeteekah had disappeared , and gazed on the foaming rapid . What was passing in his mind it is impossible to say . He had reached the summit of his ambition . He was acknowledged a chieg and he had triumphed over the Beaver and the Chippeways . But she for whose sake he had spurned the sweetest flowers of life , true love and fond fidelity , had proved faithless to him , and fled to the Missouri with another man . He had nothing farther to look for , no higher eminence to attain , and his reflections were like those of him who wept because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence roused him from his reverie . A snowwhite doe , followed by a fawn of the same color , came suddenly within the sphere of his vision ; so suddenly , that they seemed to him to come out of the water . Such a sight had never before been seen by any of his tribe . He stood rooted to the ground . He who had never feared the face of man , trembled like an aspen with superstitious terror . The animals , regardless of his presence , advanced slowly towards him and passed so near that he might have touched them with his gun . They ascended the bank and he lost sight of them . When they were fairly out of sight , he recovered from the shock , and stretching out his arms after them , conjured them to return . Finding his adjurations vain , he rushed up the bank , but could see nothing of them , which was the more remarkable as the prairie had just been burned over , and for a mile there was no wood or inequality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a deer . He returned to his lodge , made a solemn feast , at which his relatives were assembled , and sung his death-song . He told his wondering auditors that he had received a warning to prepare for his final change . He had seen the spirits of his wife and child . No one presumed to contradict his opinion . Whether founded in reason or not , it proved true in point of fact . Three // weeks after , the camp was attacked by the Chippeways . They were repulsed , but Toskatnay , and he only , was killed . No stone tells where he lies , nor can any of the Dahcotahs shew the spot . His deeds are forgotten , or at best , faintly remembered ; thus showing " on what foundation stands the warrior 's pride ; " but his wife still lives in the memory of her people , who speak of her by the name of Weenokhenchah Wandeeteekab , or the Brave Woman .
