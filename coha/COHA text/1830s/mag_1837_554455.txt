txt WE are glad to find that this highly respectable Society continues to add volume after volume to our stores of historical information , and is as vigorously productive in its old age , as it was at its formation , nearly fifty years ago . It is among the oldest of our literary and philosophical societies , and we know of none that has published so much , either in amount or value , or whose transactions reflect more credit on the intellectual character of the country . Twenty-five octavo volumes , relating to American history and antiquities , make a large and substantial contribution to our literary treasures . At the time of the Society 's institution , in 1791 , the plan // which it projected was a novel one . Its purpose was to collect and preserve the scattered records and papers relating to the history of this country , for the benefit and instruction of after times . Its object was not merely to drag forth these dusty and mouldering manuscripts from their forgotten hiding-places in old family cabinets , and deposit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scholar and the antiquarian ; but its chief aim was to secure their perpetuity , and extend the knowledge which they contained , by multiplying copies through the agency of the press , and thus putting them within the reach of the inquisitive in all parts of the country . Its object was not to hoard , but to diffuse , these treasures . And experience had abundantly shown the great need of such a measure . The irreparable loss of Governor Bradford 's History of Plymouth Colony , the shameful destruction of Governor Hutchinson 's papers by the mob in 1765 , and the depredations committed by the British soldiers on the invaluable collections of Prince , deposited in the steeple of the Old South Church , all proved that there was no security for our ancient documents , so long as they remained in manuscript . It was , then , an important and necessary work which this Society proposed to itself , and one which it has pursued with great singleness of aim and intensity of purpose for nearly half a century . If it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England from the original manuscript , it would have conferred a lasting obligation on the comnunity . Its collections are now continually appealed to , as unquestionable authorities , wherever an interest is taken in American history . No one presumes to write the history of a town or a State , without referring to them for information ; and it may be safely asserted that the admirable history of the United States , which has lately proceeded from the pen of Mr. Bancroft , never could have been written without the use of the materials which this Society had so amply provided and so liberally dispensed . The volume now before us , which the Society has just issued , yields to none of its predecessors in interest and value . The articles are nearly all printed from original manuscripts preserved in its archives . Several of them relate to great public transactions and events ; and those of a private character are full of those minifle particulars and details , narrated with perfect simplicity and naturalness , which lend such a touching interest to the diaries and autobiographies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at the contents of the volume . 1 . The first article , consisting of seventy pages , is the Journal , // never before printed , of the proceedings of the Congress held at Albany , in 1754 , and which sat for twenty-two days , for the purpose of treating with the Six Nations of Indians , and concerting a scheme of general union among the British American colonies against the French and their Indian allies . This congress was held at the suggestion and under the sanction of the mother country , and Governor Hutchinson , who was himself a member of it , justly remarks in his History of Massachusetts , that " it was the most deserving of respect of any which had ever been convened in America , whether we consider the colonies which were represented , the rank and characters of the delegates , or the purposes for which it was convened . " Governor Livingston says of this convention , that " the commissioners were , both for abilities and fortune , some of the most considerable men in North America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , some delivered themselves with singular energy and eloquence . All were inflamed with a patriotic spirit , and the debates were nervous and pathetic . This assembly might very properly be compared to one of the ancient Greek conventions for supporting their expiring liberty against the power of the Persian empire , or that Louis of Greece , Philip of Macedon . " The plan of union which was agreed upon by the Congress , was drawn up by Franklin , who was one of the commissioners ; but it was rejected , on different grounds , both by the colonial assemblies and by the government at home , the assemblies thinking that there was too much prerogative in it , and the government that there was too much of the democratic . Some estimate may be formed of the value of this document from the fact , which has lately come to our knowledge , that the accomplished chief magistrate of our State , than whom there is no one among us more fainiliar with the history of the country , some years since had an exact transcript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the record of so important a transaction should exist only in a single manuscript . Five hundred printed copies of it now put it beyond the reach of destruction . 2 . The second article , of twenty-five pages , is a journal , now first printed , of a negotiation at Albany , in August , 1775 , between the Six Nations and commissioners of the Continental Congress . It is well known that the attention of Congress was very early drawn to the importance of securing the alliance , or at least the neutrality , of the Indian tribes during the impending conflict with the mother country ; and commissioners were accordingly appointed to treat with the Indians , to preserve peace and friendship , and to prevent their taking any part in the // approaching commotions . This journal shows the prudence and skill with which the commissioners discharged their difficult and delicate duty , in their interview with the powerful and warlike tribes that dwelt along the southern shore of Lake Ontario . 3 . The third article is a very interesting journal , kept by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pioneer of the forest , who accompanied Washington in 1753 , in his tour over the Alleghany Mountains , to visit the commander of the French fort on the Ohio . Washington 's narrative of that expedition , it is well known , was published at the time , and is contained in Mr. Sparks 's admirable edition of his Writings ; hut the journal of his only companion in this arduous and perilous enterprise has never before seen the light . Some of the adventures and hair-breadth escapes here related are singularly romantic , particularly Washington 's narrow escape from drowning when he fell from the raft in the Alleghany river , and his miraculous deliverance from the deliberate and deadly aim of an Indian 's rifle . 4 . The next article , of sixty-seven pages , is General Lincoln 's Journal of his tour , when sent by Washington in 1793 , in company with Timothy Pickering and Beverley Randolph , to effect a treaty with the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio , who were then in a state of hostility with the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as presenting a graphic description of the state of the country through which the writer passed , more than forty years ago , from Philadelphia hy the way of New York , Albany , the Mohawk river , Wood Creek , Lake Oneida , Lake Ontario , and Niagara , to Detroit . It likewise contains , as do the first and second articles in the volume , the best specimens of Indian eloquence and diplomatic skill , that we have ever met with . Appended to the Journal is a beautiful lithographic copy of a sketch of the conference with the Indians at Buffalo Creek , in 1793 , taken on the spot by a young British officer who was present . It is well remarked by the publishing committee that " an exhibition of that occurrence so many years since , multiplied by an art then undiscovered , is a suitable appendage to the relation of a tour in the land where all the objects which then solicited the traveller 's attention , except Ontario , Erie , and Niagara , are totally changed . " 5 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the most generally acceptable , is an autobiography of the Rev. John Barnard , of Marblehead , who was born at Boston in 1681 , and died in 1770 , in his 89th year . This paper was drawn up in 1766 , when the writer was in his 85th year , for the use of President Stiles , of Yale Col1ege* It records in a very simple // and touching manner , his life and adventures from his schoolboy days to his declining years . And his was an eventful life ; he went as chaplain in the expedition against Port Royal in 1707 , of which he gives a very minute account from the journal which he kept ; was present at the trial of Sacheverel in Westminster Hall , in 1709 ; was the cotemporary and opponent of the Mathers , and had great and deserved influence both in church and state . In 1741 , he oppposed " the Whitfieldian ferment , " as he calls it , and was appointed by the convention to draw up their " public testimony against the errors and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his advice and recommendation , that Holyoke was chosen president of harvard College , in 1737 . We hardly know when we have met with an article of American biography more interesting than this . 6 . We have next a brief paper from the Rev. Dr. Holmes , of Cambridge , in which he proves conclusively that the claim of Rhode Island of having early established a universal toleration of religious opinions , is altogether unfounded . He maintains that in the act of toleration , passed in 1664 , the Roman Catholics were excepted , and he brings forward , as evidence of this , a copy of an act of the General Assembly of that State , passed in 1783 , repealing the excepting chuse in the act of 1664 , arid extending to Roman Catholics all the rights and privileges of Protestant citizens . We presume this sets the question at rest for ever . 7 . We then have a letter from Colonel George Morgan to General Washington , enclosing the Lord 's prayer in Shawanese ; and the volume closes with biographical sketches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , the notices of the Rev. Drs . Freeman and Prince , by their respective colleagues , Messrs . Greenwood and Upham , are deservedly more full and extended , since these venerable men were among the founders and fathers of the Society . We can not take leave of this volume without strongly recoinmending it , and the series of works to which it belongs , to the patronage of the community . We know of no set of books more deserving of a place in a public or private library . We regret to learn that the sales have not been sufficient to reimburse the Society for the cost of their publication ; although the labor of preparing the volumes for the press is performed gratnitously by its members . The Society have recently resolved to publish a volume annually , and have reduced the price to one dollar a volume . We trust they will meet with sufficient encouragement to authorize them to proceed in their useful and meritorious labors.                  @ @ @
