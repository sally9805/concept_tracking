THE document here mentioned relates to the new form of government , which the Congress of Buenos Ayres have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well known , that among the different kinds of government , which have prevailed in these provinces , since their release from the tyranny of Spain , none has been attended with complete success . For about two years a Congress , composed of delegates from the provinces , has been in session , for the greater part of the time , in the city of Buenos Ayres , deliberating on the general concerns of the country , and endeavoring especially to institute a constitutional system , which shall meet the views of the people , and attain the desired objects of union , strength , and prosperity . // As early as April 14th , 1825 , the Congress recommended to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , a speedy preparation of a plan for a constitution ; but the committee in their first conferences soon found , that too many difficulties were in the way of their proceeding to arrange any systematic plan* which would be likely to be approved by all the provinces . It was deemed essential , that , as a preliminary step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained , as far as this could be done . Accordingly on the 20th of June a law was passed , containing the three following directions ; first , that application should be made to all the provinces , with a view to ascertain the form of a constitution , which each preferred ; secondly , that the mode of obtaining the opinion of the provinces should be through their representative assemblies , and that where such assemblies did not exist , they should be created for the purpose ; thirdly , that the opinions thus indicated by the provincial representatives should not in any way restrict the authority delegated by the people to the congress , for preparing and sanctioning a constitution best suited to promote the general interest ; and that the right of accepting it should at the same time be preserved to the provinces . in conformity with a previous law . After waiting a suitable time for returns from the provincial assemblies , the result was , that C6rdova , Mendoza , San Juan , and Santiago del Estero , were for having a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States ; those of Salta , , Tucuinan , and Rioja , decided in favor of a representative republican government , but one of a central , consolidated form , like that of Colombia ; those of Catamarca , San Luis , and Corrientes expressed no opinion , but contided wholly in the wisdom of the congress ; and those of Buenos Ayres , Santa Fe , Entre Rios , Misiones , and the Provincia Oriental , had seat to the congress no opinions , at the time the Report of the Committee on the Constitution was made . By various indications , however , the sense of the people in these last provinces was pretty well known , some of them being for the central , and others for the federative system . In this stage of the business the Committee on Constitutional Affairs presented a Report to the Congress on the 4th of June last , in which they recommend a central form of government , and support their decision by a series of arguments . Some of these we shall here translate , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of government , they will convey to our readers a good deal of information respecting the present state of the country . After such preliminary remarks as the subject required , the Committee proceed as follows . // In relation to the nature of the government that is most suitable for the provinces of the Union , the people have decidedly and constantly called for the representative republic . This is not one of those momentary opinions , that are for the most part erroneous , and always dangerous ; it is the perpetual , deliberate , and permanent wish of the whole nation . The question only turns on the form of administration , and may be accurately couched in these terms ; Are these provinces to be governed under a federal , or consolidated form of administration ? Will the order , the liberty , and prosperity of the Republic be better maintained , by dividing it into as many states as there are provinces , which , politically leagued under a federal government for the direction of national affairs , may yet reserve to themselves the residuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming all the provinces into one state , consolidated under a central government , and charged with the interior administration of all ? Which of these forms will be most proper to organize , preserve , and ioake happy the Argentine Republic ? This question at first sight appears very simple , but it is , in truth , exceedingly complex . No form of government has an absolute value ; the value of each one is relative to the state of society to which it must be applied . The different kinds of government have been instituted to guaranty to man his rights , and without doubt , that is the best , which best secures them . But , as the form of government , which is proper to secure the rights of the citizen in one society , is not perhaps proper to secure them in another , for each association is composed of different elements , to which its government must be accommodated , it is important to know ours , to feel all its relations , and practically to consider its physical , moral , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution of this great problem . Among the physical circumstances of our country , the most remarkable is that which is presented by the thin population of its provinces . Many of those , that hear this name , either have not , or scarcely have fifteen thousand inhabitants , thinly scattered over an extensive surface . The most are poor , and some in extreme poverty . If all have , in the fertility of their respective territories , the ingredients for friture riches , at this day they enjoy only scanty productions , which can not distribute among them a fund of* public revenues capable of providing for the first necessities of the community ; and will it be prudent to break up the nation into the smallest fractions , with the name of states , when of all these , there can hardly be formed one small republic of five hundred thousand inhabitants ? Since the history of the ancient governments , and the experience of the modern , have made us ac // quainted with the defects of the turbulent democracy of Athens , the proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is already a proverb among politicians , that no simple government is good , because simple forms are degraded and vicious . Simple monarchy , for example , is the supremacy of a monarch , who collects all power in himself Oligarchy is the supremacy of the rich , the noble , the illustrious , who refer every thing to these qualities , at the expense of the oppression of the poor . Democracy is the supremacy of the multitude , who , proud of their numbers and their strength , discard propriety , knowledge , and virtue , and seek to govern in disorder . Mixed forms alone suit modern societies ; because separating the vices of each one , they accumulate the good qualities of all . Thus every government , which degenerates too much into a simple form , is dangerous , for it is not compatible with the present state of 1 ) olitical societies . Such would be that of federation in the depopulated situation of our provinces . With such a reduced number of inhabitants , they an never maintain a suitable representation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , even those incapable of exercising political rights , or they must concentrate it in the small number of the powerfhl . The first would terminate in a destructive democracy , the second , in an oppressive oligarchy . But the committee will return to this point , so worthy of the meditation of the legislators to whom the nation has confided her destiny . The moral circumstances of the country , are in most open opposition to the form of a federal government . The committee will say nothing of the silent resistance , that may be made to this species of government by habits acquired from ages of subjection to the Spanish government , which was so much further removed from a similar organization , as it was more absolute . They will not insist on the propensity , or instinct , by which at the moment that the provinces shook off the yoke of ancient domination , they were led to identify themselves in unity of government , until the periods of anarchy awoke the idea of federation . Nor yet will they attach much importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prejudice not the desired liberty , or of claiming that new laws should at once form new customs , although nations in their infancy , like men , should leave their cradle with care , and only in proportion to their powers . The committee will only dwell on those more palpable inconveniences which the moral state of the country presents . The deficiency of intellectual light among our people , is notorious . if our former pxovincial capitals maintain some estab-* lishment of public education , the smaller towns have none . The // great mass of their inhabitants are destitute of that instruction , which a federal government demands for the discharge of public duties . Representative , instead of collective and tumultuary assemblies of the people ; the separation and marked distinction of the three powers , legislative , executive , and judiciary ; and the balance , by which the legislative departments are counterpoised , are the three grand discoveries which have been made in the art of constituting a free government . Without this essential equilibrium , every government must experience frequent convulsions , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till thQy reached the period of their entire ruin ; and , with this system alone of constitutional balances , England , and the United States of North America , have practically taught the world the mode of establishing and preserving a government free , and , at the same time , tranquil . Were our provinces federatively constituted , each one should establish its three powers , legislative , executive , and judicial , should perhaps divide the legislative power into departments , should create the employments , that policy exacts , the system of revenues and the other branches of a regular interior administration ; while the most of them have no men who can discharge such duties , nor revenues that can defray their expenses . Here it is that the committee appeal to the practical testimony , the familiar conviction , the consciences of the honorable the Representatives and of all their fellow citizens . Let it be observed how far the provinces have advanced in the six years of their separation . There are some that have not as yet established a permanent assembly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no men , who can serve them , nor salaries to support them . Various citizens of Tucuman have claimed the right of bringing appeals in their law suits , to the tribunal of this capital , and an honorable deputy from Santa Fe has evinced similar solicitude before the National Government . It is impossible that , in the nascent state of education and wealth , there could be constituted in each one of our provinces , an interior administration capable of warranting the liberty and rights of the citizens . From what they have effected and what has happened in the period since their separation , it is very easy to predict , what will occur in the case of federation . Without powers divided , and independent , the first ambitious man , who may know how to profit by the favor of circumstances , will seize on all public power , and this is insupportable tyranny ; or the power will always vibrate between the smallest number of men remarkable for their capacity or riches , and this is a miserable oligarchy ; or it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // multitude , unfortunately a mere personal instrument , as has grievously happened in some provinces within our sight . ' There are not wanting some xv ho affirm , that in the last six years of their separation and independence , the provinces have been predisposed for federal government ; but quite the contrary is lamentably the case . ' Six years have passed ; the provinces have held in their hands the elements and power for organizing themselves ; yet , with the exception of a few , the most have advanced in nothing , and many have gone backwards in this respect . There are some , who have no institutions , good or bad , and who hear no law but the caprice of him who governs . It is impossible to feign ignorance of the fact , nor is it right longer to conceal it . Let us consult our own conviction ; let us hear the clamor of the citizens who suffer ; the echo of distress is loud ; it penetrates into these precincts , where sits the majesty of the nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among other defects , that have originated from the dissolution of the general government , has been the separation of nearly all the cities from their ancient capitals ; a separation sustained by an irrevocable resolution to become more united . Many honorable deputies bring decisive instructions from the people on this point . Such a lacerated state of the whole country may be amended by the system of republican unity ; but it would be necessary proportionally to mark out the provinces , equalizing the population and the territories , in order to shun the ridiculous metainorphosis of desert fields and wretched people into sovereign states . Far from the provinces having been , in their isolated state , predisposed for the form of federal government , there has been felt , on all hands , the necessity of consolidating in one homogeneous mass , the dispersed fractions of the union , bringing them to a common centre of authority . Permanent habits are not contracted in six years of disorder . It is certain , that , in this unfortunate interval , the people incurred the alternative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen thus , as s*on as they may place their interests and rights in the hands of the whole nation , who , represented by citizens of her immediate choice , can not contemn the rights and the necessities of one portion of the people , without contemning those of all ; and those that are not as yet capable of governing themselves , will have a safeguard , a certain protection , in the general administration of the Republic . If circumstances of a moral nature resist the institution of a federal government , political considerations imperiously oppose it . The two great objects of all political association , are security and // liberty ; but , as it is impossible to obtain the one , without having first fortified the other , security ought to precede , and prepare for the degrees of liberty , that a nation is capable of enjoying . Security is interior or exterior . The interior security of our republic , can never be sufficiently consulted in a country like ours , of an immense and unpeopled extent , unless by giving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strong action , which can not be had in the complicated and weak organization of the federal system . Exterior security calls all our attention and cares to a neighboring government , monarchical and powerful ; which possesses real advantages over us , and , at this very day , makes war against us , to sustain the scandalous usurpation of a large province of our territory ; a government , whose pretensions are ancient , and a principal object of whose policy will be , to make these pretensions interminable , and so much the more violent , as our republic may be the weaker* The national constitution ought to provide for the preservation of the state in peace , and its greater defence in case of ivar . Thus , in forming ours , all reasons of policy should carry our consideration to the states that surround us , with whom we are in contact , and must maintain immediate relations . Let us refer to the republics of Colombia , Peru , Bolivia , and Chile , and we shall be admonished that the Argentine Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it must form and maintain a permanent friendship , that suits the interests , the policy , and the general cause of free America . But , as a fatality , prepared in the contingencies of futurity , might disturb the peace , that ought to be perpetual , it is proper to observe that we are surrounded , on the one part , by a powerful empire , and , on the other , by consolidated republics . A legislative body may , in certain respects , be compared to a skilful architect , who , though he can not depart from the plan , that has been given him for the design of the edifice , ought , nevertheless , to form , in his mind , the model of the best , in order to approximate towards it as much as may be possible in the execution . The plan that the provinces have , with mutual consent , given us , is that of a representative republican government , but in relation to the best form of this kind , they are not agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan , with that form , * which is most congruous to the purposes and objects of its constituents . Thus , after having felt the circumstances of the country , consulted our own experience , and profited by the documents , which the history of others presents to us , the Committee do not hesitate to offer to the House , the opinion , which a conscience , // faithful to its sacred trusts , dictates . The representative republic , consolidated in unity of government , is the only one , which levels , on the one hand , the obstacles already designated , and guaranties , on the other , all social rights , combining the advantages of all free governments , and separating their abuse.s and defects . The Committee would desire , that the Congress , and all citizens , the friends of a practical and rational liberty , would attentively pause on this last expiession ; for it removes the fears by which it is endeavored to alarm the people against the system of unity . This is not the unity which characterizes absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single will of one man alone ; it is the unity of representation and power , in which the law , that binds all , must emanate from the general will , representative of the rights of all . ' A representative republican government of unity , certainly renders all these rights safe ; under it the nation governs itself ; the law , which it dictates , through the medium of its representatives , is its only sovereign , safeguard , and friend ; the incapacity of some , is supplied by the capacity of others , and no one portion of the people can lose its liberty , unless it is lost by the whole nation . Far from the Committee , is the antisocial thought to establish unity of power to bind the nation and individuals , depriving them of the faculty of providing for their wellbeing . On the contrary , the committee think that , after securing national and individual rights , the constitution should leave in the hands of the provinces themselves , those powers , which they alone , and none better than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral situation , for the necessary or useful establishments , that they may create , for the enjoyment of their local advantages , in everything that may not be essentially dependent on the general administration of the nation . This central power should be a beneficent power , whose authority may only foster , and never blight the principles of prosperity in each province ; like the activity of the sun , which , scattering light and heat through all nature assists , and does not obstruct it , vivifies and fertilizes , that it may germinate , produce , vegetate , and ripen . We have , already , practically observed the little , that most of the provinces can effect towards gdverning themselves in an isolated situation ; and we have , as yet , no lesson from experience against the government of unity , which the Committee propose . It is true that the multitude , whose philosophy is uniformly fixed on effects , feeling all the weight of the calamities , with which the country was afflicted , in the governments anterior to the year * imputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ; but it is likewise true , that this central power was absolute and abusive , and , at this day , no one can condemn , by practical arguments , the effects of unity of government . If any positive testimony can be opposed , with the appearance of reason , it is the example which is offered us by the federal government of the United States of North America ; but no one denies the enormous difference that exists between the circumstances of that country , at the time of its establishment , and those of ours . The thirteen states , which , at the moment of their emancipation , were constitutionally confederated , did not make a perilous and violent transition to a new form of government ; they did nothing more than perfect an organization as ancient as their existence . Instruction was there propagated through all the extremities of the territory , and above all , each state was a numerous nation , in respect to our desert provinces . ' Such are the arguments used by the Committee in favor of a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are specious , but to us they do not appear altogether sound . The recent success of Mexico and Central America , where the population and other circumstances bear a strong resemblance to those of Buenos Ayres , affords a practical confutation of these arguments in the main . Federative systems have been established in those Republics , which have thus far proceeded with harmony , and a good promise of durability . All the Republics will inevitably come to this form at last , and it will be of great advantage to be placed on the true basis as soon as possible . 11. - Address on Ghurch MIesZC , delivered by request , on the Evening of Saturday , October 7 , 1526 , in the Vestry of Hanover Church , and on the Evening of iiionday following in the Third Baptist Church , Boston .

I had been taught to reverence the taw as a sort of earthly Providence , as the great popular sovereign ; the unthroned and sceptreless prince ; the mild dictator , whose province it was to see that not a single subject of its sway received harm . Protection against the law ? protection against the protector ? EuwARo EVERETT . Above all these is the moral principle clothed with a kingly authority over man 's whole nature plainly given to bear sway over every desire . It is the principle of justice , taking the rights of all under its protection , and frowning on the least wrong , however largely it may serve ourselves . CHANNINO .

We all act according to our own standard of selfestisnalion ; and the more sensitive we are , the more are we influenced in our behavior by the opinions of others concerning us . Women are more sensitive than we , and therefoce more at the mercy of opinion . It is women , after all , that form our character . BLAcsmwoon 's MAOAZINE . AT first view , one might imagine moral rules unnecessary to wellmeaning people , that the impulses of a benevolent heart might be safely trusted for just views and due performance of our social duties ; but our own experience , at length , and what we learn of others , show us our mistake . We are taught to thank Heaven , that it has not left us , with our limited views of the consequences of actions , to decide upon measures according to their apparent utility-that since nothing less than a vast and altogether unattainable extent of observation and experience would constitute us accurate judges of general expedience , there has been conferred upon us the most precious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our path ; a code , that , by its authority , hinders the ingenuity , which finds as many arguments for the wrong as for the right from being an evil , instead of a boon . The records of our race testify , how often , by not borrowing this light divine , they have gone astray . The woes of . Africa originated in mistaken humanity . " To save the weaker natives of America from servitude , Las Casas proposed to the Flemish ministers , to purchase a sufficient number of negroes from the Portuguese settlements on the coast of Africa , and transport them to America , that they might be employed as slaves in working the mines and cultivating the ground . While he contended earnestly for the liberty of those born in one quarter of the globe , he labored to enslave the inhabitants of another region ; and , in the warmth of his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke , pronounced it to be lawful and expedient to impose one still heavier , upon the Africans . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhallowed policy , * This article has been long in our possescion . Its publication was at first postponed , to afiord us an opportunity to look at the work by Dr. Cooper , which seems to have suggested the subject to the writer . Such an opportunity has never occurred . The subject is interesting in itself , and is well treated , and can have lost none of its interest , by the issadvertent procrastination of publicity to which it has been doomed . // which tolerates what is wrong , because it appears to be beneficial ; a principle , which is the parent of religious persecution , which prompted the elaborate arguments that have been employed to show that private vices are public benefits , to which the custom in certain countries of exposing children and aged persons may be traced . It was this false principle , as we believe , which actuated Dr. Cooper to censure the legal protection granted to women , from the oppressive law , depriving them , when married , of their property . " In Great-Britain , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking with a jealous eye upon every kind of precontract that tends to impair the unity of interest between married people , and the dependence of the wife upon the husband , have leaned somewhat too strongly in favor of precontract , by marriagesettlements , trust-estates , testamentary powers to be exercised by the wife , and by enforcing equivalent settlements on the receipt after marriage of a wife 's property . " We have reflected with increasing surprise upon his views of the law , divesting women of their property , and upon his undoubting objections to all mitigations of it . From his statements we learn that the law is recommended to him by the following considerations : - " The natural prevalence on the part of the husband of mental energy as well as of corporeal force , independent of the means of acquired knowledge ; the precepts of Christianity , which have settled the subordinate situation of the wife , and civilized expedience . " These reasons appear to us to contribute but a specious support to the law . We can not perceive the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if this inferiority amounted to an incapacity , which would make it necessary to appoint a guardian for every woman , married or unmarried . A woman does not stultify her* self by wedding , so that if her inferiority be good cause for the interference of the law with her property. , it ought to be no more at her own disposal before , than after marriage* . And guardianship , the only legal measure 4plied with propriety to incapacity , stops entirely short of the power assumed by law over a woman 's purse , which does not give in trust , but transfers . A more generous deduction from the inferiority of the female sex would be , to enjoin , that their fortunes should he confirmed to them , by way of compensation , to insure them a consideration , which they are in danger of losing with their beauty . We should not apply Dr. Cooper 's inference even to the matches described in the early history of man , where beings of a higher order wedded the daughters of men , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We see no more * ) propriety in taking away a woman 's property on this ground , than in taking away the property of a man , to give it to one wiser or stronger than himself . To make a law just , which should merely give a man the administration , instead of the possession of his wife 's property , incompetence on her part should be proved ; inferior discretion , on the part of women , can not confer authority , which nature has denied , can not license men to be unjust , because women are imprudent ; but we do not accede to the inferiority of the female judgement , as regards expenditure . Women do not paint and write so well as men , but , as a mass , they excel , in our opinion , in a wise management of expense ; from habits of self-denial , and the absence of an enterprising temper , they , better than we , " match their wants and means . " Their sensitiveness to opinion , and the high // standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vicious pleasures ; their superior tenderness of heart , concentrated from their comparative seclusion , on a few objects , inclines them more generally to the best object of expense , household good . But , in repelling the pretence of incompetence , we fear we obscure the question , which is not whether men or women are most likely to be spendthrifts ,  - -  but what is justice ? Whatever a woman possesses , whether by labor , donation , or success ion , the law upon her marriage wrests from her entirely ; yet , nothing hut an inferiority , amounting to incompetence , which would make it for the best good of the wife herself , as in the case of a minor , an idiot , or a lunatic , could justify , in the eyes of those who have not adopted the opinion of Hobbes , that unlimited power confers an unlimited right , a law , restraining her , in any degree , in the use of her property . We can not understand how Dr. Cooper applies the Christian precepts to the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refers to the relative rights of the sexes , puts them on the same footing . Mark x. 11 , 1* . The Christian maxim , of doing as we would be done unto , is utterly at variance with the legal disadvantages under which women are placed in their relations with the other sex . What man would avail himself of his legal powers to appropriate to himself the fortune of his wife , who weighed her rights , advantages , and detriment in the same balance , in which he weighs his own ? We do not think it possible for the man , who places himself as Christianity ro. quires , in the situation of the woman he marries , to make the law his guide ; he would do violence to himself , in not interposing to save her from its action . The man , who takes the property of his wife , is either deficient in proper sentiments towards her , or has not been ac* customed to make that use of his imagination , on which morality principally depends . He has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Christian religion , in the place of others , to feel their feelings and apprehend their desires , to do as he would be done unto . We think reference must be made by Dr. Cooper to the apostolic precepts , enjoining female subordination ; but he can not deduce correctly a right in the husband to the property of the wife from these precepts , any more than such a right in the father and ruler from the precepts enjoining filial and civil suhordination . No man believes that Paul 's injunctions to children to obey their parents , mean that whatever the child acquires belongs to the parent , or that his injunction of submission to the emperor means , that there was no private property in the empire . When we consider who the apostles were , when they flourished , and the condition in which they saw the female sex , we regard their unexpected liberality with respect to women , so far beyond the age , as one of the most convincing evidences that their wisdom was divine . Nothing seems to us more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of married women , than the manner in which the matrimonial relation is treated in the New Testament . The apostle says , " Love one another . " The operation of the law is to alienate the one from the other . The example of the tenderest love , which has ever been felt on earth , is held up by the apostle as a model for husbands . " Husbands love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it . " Sentiments are enjoined , // which would make a man shrink from exercising the liberties with regard to his wife 's possessions , appointed by law . We hold , with Jeremy Taylor , " husbands should rather he fathers than lords ; that the wife ought by all means to please the husband , and he must by no means displease her . " In fact , it appears to us , nothing can be more hostile to the Christian religion , than the law we have been considering , whether we regard the duties that religion requires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the argument derived from civil expedience , before it can he admitted to any consideration , the practice in question must be proved innocent . Let those who , in a case ofethics , make expedience of any sort a rule of action , pause over the admirable words of Bishop Butler : " The happiness of the world is the concern of Him who is the lord and proprietor of it ; nor do we know what we are about , when we endeavor to promote the good of mankind , in any way but those which he has directed . " Dr. Cooper objects to any evasions of the law , as tending to impair the unity of interests between married persons . Now , where this unity of interest subsists , ideas of property will be so far relaxed , as to put the parties at ease with regard to its mutual use ; where it is unhappily wanting , no circumstance tends more to widen the division , than the operation of this law . When the interests of the husband and wife are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining her property ; when they are not the same , what monstrous injustice that his should be promoted by the ruin of hers , the privation of her all , that she , as it may happen , should be devoted to penury , to " gild his waste ! " From Dr. Cooper 's remarks , we perceive that he ohjects to the wife 's retaining her property , as placing a sanction on wrongs , of which such prudence shows the fear . He seems unable to imagine any motive to such a measure , but the foresight of a divorce , and objects to any legal steps in anticipation of such an event , as weakening the public sentiment of the indissolubility of marriage . Among the causes which ought , in our opinion , to enforce legal protection of the wife 's property , he selects circumstances of more rare occurrence , perhaps to show how little this protection is needed ; and the most flagrant , perhaps , to heighten , by the offensiveness of the suspicions intimated , the odium of the measure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown , it is prudent on the part of the lady 's friends to make the best provision against the event ; other objections to the free course of the law , both weighty , and founded on events of frequent occurrence , establish still more fully the necessity of precaution , such as prodigality , rashness of speculation , alienation of property from the children of the mother by whom it came . Nobody would believe , from Dr. Cooper 's representations , that a man 's spending his wife 's property was an every-day case . He seems to think that men partake , without ever wasting , the property of a wife . Had he been at our side when we once attended , at the former residence of a man , who had married a woman of fortune , and soon failed ,  --  in one of our cities , where bankruptcies have been frequent ,  --  one of those auctions of rapine , natural successors of the abandonment of the wife 's property to the husband , those scenes which give an insight into the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought by the law he supports so warmly , he would have been visited with a new sense of the subject . He would have been affected , we hope , as we were , in traversing the desolate apartments , thrown open to the general gaze , in looking round upon the materials of domestic comfort , displaced , and all forfeit to this oppressive law ,  --  sofas , carpets , beds of down , the select library , the silent piano , with half-worn music books , the kitchen utensils , every thing indicative of taste , past plenty , and hospitality . A friend was struck to see the elegant little presents , received by the wealthy bride from her young friends , counted among the property of the husband 's creditors ; but we were more moved at the sight of the worn furniture of the nursery , the defaced toys of the banished , disinherited descendants of the wealthy grandfather . Every thing marked the stunning suddenness of the shock ; there was oil remaining in the lamps , cards in the card-racks . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the remains of various condiments in their appropriate vessels . Amid the melancholy scene , a Canary-bird was recommending himself by his songs to a new owner . We looked mournfully around , and thought this a sorry sight for a well-governed country . Could Dr. Cooper , with a full view of the subject , have defended a law , which shows so unreasonable a partiality to the descendants of a man through one child , in preference to those through another ? The law transmits a man 's property to his son , and again to the children of that son ; the law transmits a man 's property to his daughter also , but instead of carrying it forward to her children , delivers it , while she yet breathes , to her husband , and divides it finally , after his death , between his last wife , and the various progeny of all bis wives . Often a mother willingly denies herself every luxury , even comforts , to educate and provide for her children ; dies , and leaves the fruit of her selfdenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectator of the rifled hive . We pity even bees , who , after collecting a sweet hoard for their young , have it diverted to other mouths . We do not patiently see this economy of tenderness deprived of its natural reward . Many an amiable woman 's temper is soured by the foresight of this injustice ; for even the dove would peck her mate , should he snatch from her bill the food she was hurrying to the open mouths of her young . It is not strange that a woman should spend profusely , whose children are not her heirs . Whether an estate should remain within the family of the ancestor , from whom it came , or , according to law , go , while grandchildren yet survive , into another family , no one is likely to hesitate . Some are ready to say the moral sense of the husband will prevent this . Not so ; perhaps he will imagine  --  the predominant influence of the living wife strengthening the opinion-that his duty lies that way , though the property inherited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children . A woman , married to a man enriched by this former wife , knowing the law , unless she be a woman of an upright mind , expects and is willing to be , with her children , the heir of the property of her predecessor . These expectations , a man easily persuades himself he ought not to disappoint ; out of a vicious law grows a vicious morality . We were pleased in perusing Redwood , with the just picture of the law given by such an intelligent moralist as the author ; it is represented // as a temptation to a crime in one sister , and to reject its operation , is made a duty in the other . Alas , that the law which professes to be intended for every body 's preservation , should in so many instances openly sacrifice the weaker to the stronger ! that the legal relation between the sexes , the highest moral interests of society , should form so affecting an exception to the touching eulogy of Hooker " All things in Heaven and earth do her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the greatest as not exempt from her power 1 " We , with Dr. Cooper , wish to see the marriage-bond indissoluble ; we do not agree with him as to the means by which it is to be guarded and strengthened . We know too well , bow much the law he approves , operates , with its degrading and unjust tendencies to weaken the natural sentiment of conjugal affection . Our aim is to extinguish with it the sparks , which light up implacable domestic dissensions . Domestic happiness , which forms the strength of the conjugal tie , must depend on the manner in which domestic life is constituted . Essential to it , is a sentiment towards the wife , which would insist on leaving her property at her own disposal . How many delightful homes have been ruined by a contrary course ! How often has a bad law deprived men of happiness in domestic life ! a happiness which supplies the place of every other , but for which no other can compensate . Often has this law hardened and sundered bosoms which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's pillow to repose divine . " Good men and wise will aim in their matrimonial institutions to promote conjugal affection ; and they know that the best way to preserve the union of hands is to secure the union of hearts . It is because the interests of the married pair are the same , we would annul the law , which , preferring one party to the other , mars the well-being of both ; its bitter fruits are inevitably shared by the husband . In tnarried life , on whichever side the dissatisfaction begins , it must spread to the other . The law operated as unfavorably for Capt . Byron as for Mrs. Byron ; for John Wilkes as for Mrs. Wilkes . He , who does not study his wife 's happiness , does not study his own . Which would a man choose in his wife , the " Merry heart , " that " goes all the day , " Or , " the sad one , " that " tires in a mile a ? "  --  the ingenious and overflowing devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inanimate duty ? This law is one of the most striking of all exhibitions of the " ill-husbandry of injustice . " The uncomfortableness of the tenure by which all property is held , acquired in a way not approved by the natural sentiments , generally renders the holder careless about its preservation . The law seems devised to promote idleness ; idleness produces bankruptcy . For the cruelty of its operation , it deserves as deep reprobation as a lottery . Men , who marry fortunes on the present legal footing , like those who gain the dear-bought prizes of a lottery , fancy themselves in possession of wealth which no prodigality can exhaust . The prizes of the matrimonial lottery are generally as evanescent as those of any other , and they bequeath in their passage heavier regrets . The moral sentiments are stronger than the artificial regulations of law ; and a sense of the violated claims of the // wife , which no perverse institutions can annul , or wholly darken , aggravates the sorrows of the prodigal husband , who has spent her fortune . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and their subsequent chagrin , remind us of the mistake of Milton 's fallen angels , in the showy fruit of the grove , that suddenly sprung up , hard by Pandemonium . " Greedily they plucked The fruitage fair to sight they , fondly thinking to allay Their appetite with gust , instead of fruit Chewed hitter ashes . " A confused sense of these evils has given many men a horror of marrying a fortune . When things are placed on a just footing , we think it as advantageous to marry a rich woman , as a rich man ; the property being left at the wife 's disposal , while it is to the husband an unmixed and material benefit , is at the same time , in the eyes of the public , no more than a reasonable and equitable advantage . The husband escapes in such a case , the attacks of envy , and finds in his wife , instead of a discontented slave , an attached ally . He escapes what is in our opinion dangerous to friendship , too heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the happiness of the confiding party , a responsibility at which we should shudder . Few yet understand this . The law , by destroying in men all moderation , frequently prevents matches reciprocally eligible . If a suitor 's extravagant desires for a woman 's whole property are disappointed , the match is often rejected to the detriment of both parties . Inordinate expectations , that in these days would not have been conceived , unless suggested by the laws of a barbarous period , blind a m*n entirely to the only real benefit that can be derived from a wife 's property , sharing her income . A happy marriage is often defeated , because the law holding out an advantage delusive , because incompatible with justice and domestic happiness , renders a man indifferent to the solid , real benefit which the case admits . We should be glad to see , by a repeal of the law , the untowardness of the counteracting steps done away . There is something in this business of restitution , for so it may be called , not in harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great objections to the law , whose downward course must thus be retraced , that it should cause such a discordant process to mingle with the fair hopes and tender devotion of the betrothed pair . We would annul the disagreeable necessity of this retrogressive step , by abolishing the law altogether . Perhaps to the desire of being rid of this uncomfortable warfare of the mind , is to he attributed the speech we hear from young , enthusiastic women : " Where I trust myself I will trust my property , " as if a man might not have a good disposition , and make them happy , without any discretion ; as if , also , men were unchangeable . The word trust , perhaps , deceives them a little . Let men remember , that with whatever apparent willingness the wife endures the operation of the law , a sentiment is sometimes chilled by the sacrifices it makes . Women often persuade themselves that the compelled sacrifice is voluntary ; but this persuas*on is apt to fade away , and to be succeeded by indi*nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length , and are hurt and chagrined by , the ungenerous terms , on which the marriage union is formed . The dimness of fancy is illumined by experience and reason , " The beam pours in , for time and skill will couch the blind . " One of these confiding wives , descrying the approach of poverty , was heard to say , a few years after her marriage , " I hate the name of wife . " Being censured on one occasion for negligence of her husband , she said , " I have been more sinned against than sinning . " Women have been known , on account of the insupportable laws which oppress them , to wish they never had any property . One of the great English moralists , on the same side with Dr. Cooper , indicating , with his customary vivacity , any provisionary arrangements on the part of a woman betrothed , as proving great folly , resigning herself , as she does , to a man on whom she is not willing to rely wholly , applies to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound foolish ; " but though he is of opinion that the requisite degree of regard , previous to marriage , is too confiding to seek any stipulations , he gives , by stating the propensity of the sex to many men , who , if " they even happen to be good-natured , serve only to dissipate their fortunes , " the greatest force to the considerations , which recommend women to the public care . There is an apparent inconsistency here ; and that such plausible objections should lie against the remedy one law provides against another , ( as Dr. Cooper states them we found them almost irresistible ) impresses us more deeply with the necessity of the complete abrogation of that we complain of . They owe their force with us and others to custom ; and strange is the force of custom , we have thought , when we have heard men really generous say , without any suspicion , that , by such a declaration , they were showing a much greater deficiency of generosity , than that they censured- " I would not marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Edward Everett tells us-referring to a case of less urgency than this-that " it is one of the worst effects of bad laws , that they corrupt public sentiment . " Such an evil must exist here , whatever side of the question is taken ; for it is impossible that the principle of the law and the principle of evading it can both be right , it is true , as Bishop Hare says , that " Most men think they can do conscientiously whatever they can do legally . Men of refined and exalted understandings , who have a large compass of thought , and have looked into the principles of things , know that written laws are but deductions of the law of nature , which is prior to all human institutions ; that these sometimes deviate from that unwritten law , and , when they do , are of no real intrinsic authority . They know that a thing is not just and reasonable because it is enacted , but in good governments is enacted , because it is just and reasonable ; the generality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally . " Cities , the great torches , which light the way to the rest of the community , are be , innin to understand this subject . In cities , the wife 's fortune , where it is considerable , is now usually confirmed to her . A man is there blamed if he does not secure to a daughter the property he gives her . Fathers are no longer contented to follow the lead of // the law , that the real estate they expect to devise to a daughter be but a plank she can lay hold of in the wreck of all the rest ; they no longer make the unfatherly difference , originated by law , between the married and the unmarried daughter ; they reject , in behalf of their daughter , the legal conditions of the transfer of their property . " Necessaries ,  --  in which term are comprised , by the law , food , drink , clothing , washing , physic , instruction , and a competent place of residence ; " they have learnt there is no certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , and they do not mean that an exorbitant price shall be given for a petty annuity , which is , after all , insecure . Now and then , a man might marry a daughter to one , in whom it would be safe to place unlimited confidence ; but , as her sisters might not be equally fortunate , he generally deems it proper , and he ought to deal alike , with all his sons-in-law . In cases where the property is small , though often valued more on this account , by the possessor , this abuse continues every where in its original force . We heard a case detailed lately , in humble life , of peculiar hardship , where a sempstress , having furnished comfortably , by her . earnings , her two rooms , her furniture , after her marriage , disappeared , article by article , sold by her profligate husband to buy liquor . The law , at one and the same time , snatched from her the reward of industry , and changed , in him , an evil propensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her her chairs and tables , caused her not only the loss , but destroyed her just influence , by placing her in a contemptible light before him , as a creature , whose welfare was , in the eye of law , of no importance . We have often regarded this law as the ally of the tavern and the gaming-table . The little earnings of the laundress , the nurse , the school-mistress , the female fruit-seller , and the sempstress , are a common supply to the thirst of the intemperate . We have known repeated instances of a husband , absent for years at a time , sweeping into his empty pockets , on his occasional visits , the earnings of his wife in his absence . Those who are familiar with the state of the poor in this city , will call to mind repeated instances of this kind . This aiding of tyranny and profligacy by the forms of law , arming them with the legitimate authority , under the shelter of which they perpetuate the most cruel wrongs , is an abuse , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing but legislative interference can bring relief to this numerous and helpless class of sufferers . The law must retrace its steps , till it gets back within the moral boundaries of legislative authority . In addition to Dr. Cooper 's arguments in support of the law , that men are stronger , have better sense than women , that Heaven requires of the wife to render up her property to her husband , ( we do not find the law in our Bible ) that it is convenient she should do so , and that men will behave themselves ill , if it is withheld-we have met with a few additional ones . Some say that legal assurance to the wife of her property is impertinent . There is a large , well-meaning class , who adopt the arguments of Devorgoil , when he declares , he " Never swerved from his ' integrity , Save at the voice of strong necessity , Or such o'erpowering view of high advantage , As wise men liken to necessity , In strength and force compulsive. " // There are others , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , who , instead of considering , before they adopt a measure , whether it is right or wrong , ask what the custom is ? Such persons will enter upon a very exceptionable course of action , and prosecute it , without consciousness of blame . " Custom makes a rectitude in their eyes ; they imagine that a thing must be done , and ought to be done , because it always has been done ; what they never questioned in their own minds , and never heard questioned , passes for an innate principle , a self-evident truth , needing no evidence to support it , and which no evidence can overthrow . " We consider this the largest class of the supporters of this oppression , because of this character are the majority of mankind . They say the law is old . We know it is old ; so old , that to which branch of the northern pirates , that overspread the island from which we deduce our origin , we owe this deleterious legacy , we know not ; but it is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , when this law was adopted , or devised , by the " ignorant swordsmen " of barbarous Britain ; men whose rule it was , " That they should take who have the power ) And they should keep who can that it was enacted when law , so far from making it an object to se ' * cure the weaker individual from the violence of the stronger , was but an expression of the mere good pleasure of power . It might be expected that it should have been deposited long since in the graves of the sea-kings ; shred by shred has dropped from the English jurisprudence of the dark and barbarous time 's of- old . We hope that the reforming shears will shortly lop off this part of the *coarse and tattered tissue . The antiquity of a law has weight with us ; but it is only of that law , " which has no date , which was never enacted , which is prior to all things , coeval with eternity. , the law of rectitude ,  --  that , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of which alone they oblige ; " we think it plain , this later law is a most flagitious repeal of the older . There has been some mitigation of the state of women since the days of the heptarchy . " Dower is imagined by some to be the relic of a Danish custom , since , according to the historians of that country , dower was introduced into Denmark , by Swegn , the father of our Canute the Great , out of gratitude to the Danish ladies , who sold all their jewels to ransom him , when taken prisoner by the Vandals . " Swegn deserves the compliment , Scott puts into the mouth of Co*ur de Lion , when he offers his hand to Robin Hood , and says , " There is mine , and 1 hold it honored by being clasped with yours . For he that does good , having the unlimited power to do evil , deserves praise , not only for the good which he performs , but for the evil which he forbears . " There is some hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that law will make the property of married , like that of unmarried , women an inviolable vossession ; that legislators will interfere to hinder men in their blindness from lacerating tbe left arm with the right ; from doing what is as foolish and imprudent , as it is unjust and cruel . There are men , who distinguish between a moral and a legal right to property , who confess the unfairness of the advantages given them by // law , and whose forbearing integrity towards the women they marry , testifies the force of their convictions ; their example will attract attention . As society improves , the equitable temper , which is disposed to weigh the interests of others in equal balance with our own , must become more prevalent . Does any one view this subject in a just light ? Let him , who knows , pities , and abhors the evil , embrace that generous course of action , " Which smooths this life , and wins the next . " Let him endeavor to produce that state of knowledge and feeling throughout society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil withdrawn from the aberrations from virtue and the scenes of domestic misery , caused by this law , its folly and horror would strike all alike .
