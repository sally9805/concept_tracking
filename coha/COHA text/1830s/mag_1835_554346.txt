txt WE have read this hook throughout with great , though equally sustained interest . Mr. Dunlap has brought together in it a great variety of curious information about artists and the arts in the United States . The author 's own life has been given , in a great measure , to the study and practice of painting , both at home and abroad ; and though he has never reached a high eminence in that art , yet his familiarity with practical details , and his extensive acquaintance with living artists , would seem to give him peculiar qualifications for the task he has undertaken . This task we think Mr. Dunlap has , on the whole , ably and laboriously fulfilled . Every source from which knowledge could be drawn , has been resorted to , and an extraordinary collection of materials , to illustrate the progress of the arts , in and out of the United States , has been gathered with untirmg industry , and amazing minuteness of research . Printed and manuscript hiographies , public and private documents , the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pour their treasures into this reservoir . The number of names which Mr. Dunlap has made the public acquainted with , would make the stoutest defenders of the superiority of American genius stare with wonder , and ought to make the cavillers hang their heads with shame . These names include the professors of all the arts of design , both those who had talents and those who had not ; but we feel bound to say , // that the latter class outnumbers the former by a great majority , counting per capita . Mr. Dunlap has relieved the body of his work by interspersing brief essays on the several arts , some of which are from his own pen , and some written by others practically engaged the profession . In this way a great amount of information on the technical terms and manual processes of art , is brought within the reader 's reach . This information , though not commonly possessed , is quite necessary to the right understanding of criticisms on the works brought into discussion . We think Mr. Dunlap has done wisely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove a benefit to the sale of the book . Some of the most interesting portions of the work are the auto-biographical letters of living artists , published wholly or in part . Mr. * sketch of his early life , is one of the most entertaining histories of genius , struggling to find its true position , that we have ever read . Mr. Allston 's notices of cotemporary artists , are fine specimens of good humor , and excellent criticism . The same remark may be applied to many others . Mr. Dunlap 's narrative style is easy and clear , though sometimes wantingin strength . There is , also , a want of arrangement , selection and compression ; circumstances of little or no importance , are often related with as much gravity as those of the highest . The spirit of Mr. Dunlap 's criticism , though not searching and profound , is , in general , full of good sense and candor . He praises heartily , and blames independently . He loves and respects the arts , and delights to honor those whose genius in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fault to find with him . He has been too free in showing up the private histories of artists , and blazoning abroad circumstances in their domestic or personal relations , which ought to have been held forever sacred from the public gaze . A man no more forfeits his individual rights by becoming a painter or sculptor , than he does by becoming a shoe-maker or house-carpenter , - and that great busy-body , the public , has as good a claim to pry into and violate the sanctity of domes. * tic life , in one case , as in the other . He has taken up too many pages with the unimportant or merely local quarrels of artists , and sometimes shews a strength of personal feeling that must lessen his credit as an impartial historian . The wearisome attacks on Colonel Trumbull are marked by aharshness // of temper which a sensible man ought to keep under the control of his better nature . Many stories are told , in this and other portions of the work , - the life of Stuart , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but being thus furnished with a local habitation in authentic history , may be of serious injury to the fame of those about whom they are related . Scandalous chronicles need more sifting to come at the truth than the records of virtuous deeds , a discreditable story being commonly more readily believed , and more easily invented , than the opposite one . It is a safe rule to believe all the good a man has credit for , at once , and disbelieve all the evil laid to his charge , save on the strictest proof . Take the word of him who speaks his neighbor 's praise , but hold the tale .. bearer to the law and the testimony . We propose to give a few pages to some notices of the state of Americaii art . The rank which our countrymen have taken in this departmcnt , within the last fifty or sixty years , renders this an interesting and important theme . Undoubtedly many of the master productions of this age have sprung from the genius of America . Men are ever and anon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom God has gifted with the seeing eye and the cunning hand ; before whom nature outspreads her beauties , and is understood ; over whose souls the mighty mother breathes her inspiration , and they heave with the emotions of creative genius struggling on blindly , until some happy accident , some unforeseen event , leads them into their destined path , and a thousand forms of beauty , grace , and grandeur , descend to them and gather round them , to glow on the canvass , to live in the marble . Our greatest want is the want of models , which time and patience will supply . An open career , unbounded freedom of personal action , are the birthright of every American artist . The spreading intercourse of this country with others , the ever-growing sum total of native productions , are fast filling our public collections and our private abodes . Public and private prosperity are increasing , and the humanizing arts are following in their train . The first artist commemorated by our author , was John Watson , a Scotchman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been a great oddity . His works made the children stare , and might reasonably have made grown people stare , too . He had some taste for picturemaking , but more for money-making . He had a bad eye for // the picturesque , but an excellent one for the main chance . He often missed a likeness , but never a safe investment . His works are never spoken of , and even his name is unknown beyond the circle of Mr. Dunlap 's readers . Smybert , the next in order , is chiefly remarkable for the influence he exercised over the minds of ' abler artists than himself , Copley , Trumbull , and Allston . His most interesting works are the copy of Vandyke 's Bentivoglio in Harvard library , and a picture of Bishop Berkeley 's family , now in the possession of Yale college . He had joined in the visionary schemes of this enthusiastic philanthropist and scholar . The main object of the enterprize failed , but its failure was more fortunate for the artist than success would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and competence . After noticing slightly several other and more obscure artists , our author takes up the life of Benjamin West . West had the singular fortune of reading the greater part of his biography , in the ample volume of Gait . But though this circumstance might reasonably he expected to give additional weight to the narrative , it must be confessed that Galt 's love of fiction , or habit of writing fiction , has strangely adorned the simple history of the Quaker painter . As an artist , West 's fame has perhaps already passed its zenith ; and in this respect , he will probably stand lower in the opinion of posterity , than the love and admiration of his contemporaries will allow . But his history will offer to all coming ages , a beautiful example of a virtuous and honorable man . True his character has been exposed to the sneer , and his genius to the mockery of the foul-mouthed author of Peter Pindar ; but what exalted and illustrious worth was sacred from his attacks ? what purity of virtue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated by that " obscene bird " of song ? West 's talents were unquestionably great , but his industry was greater . His temper was placid , his habits frugal , his manners gentle . He had gathered up treasures of knowledge , which he dispensed to the young with unsparing bounty . Information and advice were never sought from him in vain , by the youthful beginner in the career of art . Exposed to the temptation of a dangerous metropolis , he passed through a long life without a stain . The attractions of fashionable dissipation , so fatal to the irregular sensibilities of most men of genius , were opened in vain before the undisturbed serenity of his mind . // He toiled on , amidst them all , with a steadiness of purpose , a calmness of self-possession , a coolness of judgment , an evenness of temper , a staid sobriety of feeling , that made the resuits of his efforts , both in the services he rendered to his studious young countrymen , and in the number and extent of his works , truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known incident , in the painter 's life . " At the age of twenty-one , Benjamin West embarked with young Allen , and soon arrived at Gibraltar , where the ship stopped for convoy . Captain Kearny , commanding the ships of war on the station , was a friend of young Allen 's father , and the young man , with his companion , being invited to dine on board his ship , West was introduced favorably to the officers , with whom he proceeded up the Mediterranean . Messrs . Rutherford and Jackson were the correspondents of Mr. Allen , and the young painter , having delivered his credentials to them at Leghorn , was furnished with letters to Cardinal Albani and other distinguished characters at Rome . Under these favorable auspices the quaker painter proceeded on his journey in charge of a French courier , who had been engaged *y his Leghorn friends as his guide and interpreter , and gained his first view of the immortal city from a height at eight miles distance . It is easy to imagine the impression such a prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American youth of that day , and it is much safer to leave the subject to the imagination of the reader than to obtrude upon him the surmises of the writer . Suffice it to say , that the unsophisticated Yankee arrived safe at the great metropolis , and was introduced to the remains of her ancient taste and splendor , scarcely more the object of his admiration , than he was of attention to the nobles of Italy , and the illustrious strangers with whom the city swarmed . An American had come to study painting , and that American a quaker ! This was a matter of astonishment , and when it was found that the young man was neither black nor savage , but fair , intelligent , and already a painter , West became emphatically the lion of the day in Rome . " It was on the 10th of July , 1760 , that the French courier deposited the youth at an hotel in the great city , and spread the strange story abroad that a quaker and an American had come to study the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English gentleman , Mr. Robinson , that he immediately sought him , and insisted on his dining with him . The letters brought by West proved to be from Mr. Robinson 's friends , and the artist had the advantage of an immediate introduction to the best society of Rome . // " At the house of Mr. Crespigny he was presented to Cardinal Albani , who , although blind , had acquired , by the exquisite delicacy of his touch , and the combining powers of his mind , ' we quote Mr. Galt , such a sense of ancient beauty , that he excelled all the virtuoso of Rome in the correctness of his knowledge of the variety and peculiarities of the smallest medals and intaglios . ' To this virtuoso Mr. Robinson introduced the quaker as a young American , who had come to Italy for the purpose of studying the fine arts ; ' and the query of the cardinal was , Is he black or white ? ' " West , among the many advantages derived from nature , possessed a fine form , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mistresses . At the age of fifty he was remarkable for comeliness ; and it is presumed that at the period of which we treat , his appearance must have been very prepossessing , and not the less for the flowing locks and simple attire of his sect . The cardinal being satisfied that the painter was as white as himself , ( that being his next inquiry , ) received him graciously , examined his face and head , with his fingers , expressed his admiration , and made up a party to witness the impression which the sight of the chef d'muvres of antiquity , would make upon a native of the new world . The Apollo was first shown him , and his exclamation was , How like a young Mohawk warrior ! ' " The Italians , on hearing the words translated by Mr. Robinson , were mortified , but when West , at that gentleman 's request , described the Mohawk in his state of native freedom , as seen in those days , his speed , his vigor , his exercise with the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen a Mohawk standing in that very attitude , intensely pursuing with his eye the flight of the arrow just discharged from the bow , ' his auditory were delighted by the criticism of the stranger , and applauded his untutored acumen . " The following extract contains an interesting summary of Mr. West 's travels in Italy . " It is related by Mr. Galt that West 's first specimen of painting in Europe , a portrait of Mr. Robinson , was said to be better colored than the works of Mengs , at that time the greatest painter in Rome , and that the young American was pronounced the second in rank in that capital . This assertion does not accord with the fact that few of West 's pictures previous to that time appear to have merited preservation . Many of Copley 's works painted before he left his country are yet to be seen and admired . We have been obliged to search diligently for any specimen of West 's portrait painting before he left America , and when we have found it , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can // July , Dunlap 's History of the Arts . say , that we have found none better among the works of his predecessors . They are not such as we should expect would rival Mengs in coloring or anything else ; we have previously mentioned those of Mr. Bard and Mr. Morris , and we may not have seen the best he painted at that early period . On the other hand , we know that West during the four years he passed in Italy , painted pictures which gained him academical honors , and the applause of the public ; we know that his copy of Corregio 's St. Jerome , executed at Parma , is a perfect specimen of coloring ; and we know that on his arrival in England he took his stand immediately as the first historical painter in the kingdom . " Mengs and Pompeo Battoni were at this period the greatest painters of Rome . Of the latter , in connection with our subject , we have been favored with the following from Mr. Allston , as related to him by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' dividing the empire of art with Mengs . He received Mr. West very graciously in his painting room , and after some questions respecting his country , concerning which he seemed to have had no very distinct notion , - said , And so , young man , you have come - how far is it ? ' Three thousand miles . ' Ay , three thousand miles from the woods of America to become a painter ! You are very fortunate in coming to Rome at this time , for now you shall see Battoni paint . ' He thereupon proceeded with his work then in hand , a picture of the Madonna ; occasionally exclaiming , as he stept back , to see the effect , e viva Battoni ! ' " Mengs very liberally applauded the effort of the young artist , which had been compared to his own masterly productions , and traced out a plan for his studies and travel . See and examine everything deserving of your attention here , and after making a few drawings of about half a dozen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been done for art in the collections there . Then proceed to Bologna , and study the works of the Caracci ; afterwards visit Parma , and examine attentively the pictures of Corregio ; and then go to Venice , and view the productions of Tintoretto , Titian , and Paul Veronese . When you have made this tour , come back to Rome , and paint an historical composition to be exhibited to the Roman public . ' " The excitements of Rome produced fever , and before West could avail himself of this judicious advice , his friends and physicians advised a return to Leghorn for the restoration of health . Here he was received into the hospitable mansion of Messrs . Rutherford and Jackson , and by their care , recovered so far as to return to his studies in Rome , but was soon again forced by a relapse to fly once more to Leghorn , when the fever left him with an affection of the ancle , which threatened the loss of the limb ; // His constant friends Jackson and Rutherford sent him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated surgeon , who produced a radical cure , after a confinement of eleven months . " Even during this season of pain and disease , the artist pursued his studies , and was encouraged by the attentions of men of taste and influence , both natives and travellers . When recovered so as to bear the fatigues of travelling , he had the good fortune to obtain as a companion on the tour recommended by Mengs , a man of extraordinary accomplishments and acquirements . A gentleman of the name of Matthews , connected with 1*iessrs . Rutherford and Jackson , visited Florence and agreed to accompany the young painter in his visit to the most celebrated repositories of Italian art . " In the mean time , that good fortune which attended West 's conduct throughout life , was operating in his favor on the shores of the western world . The applause bestowed on the portrait of Mr. Robinson , was mentioned in a letter from Rutherford and Jackson to Mr. Allen , of Philadelphia , and the letter read by him to an assemblage of gentlemen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen mentioned the sum deposited with him , by West before his departure , adding , as it must be much reduced , he shall not be frustrated in his studies for want of money : I will write to my correspondents to furnish him with whatever he may require . ' This generous declaration produced a demand from the Governor ' , that he should be considered as joining in the responsibility of the credit . ' The consequence was , that while West was waiting at Florence for the sum of ten pounds for which he had written to his friends at Leghorn , he recejved notice from their bankers that they were instructed to give him unlimited credit . " It is not always that talents , when backed by good conduct , produce such effects upon mankind ; and some may perhaps exclaim , surely mankind are less inclined to obey the generous impulses of nature now , than they were a century ago . ' But it is not so . Talents ever command admiration , and good conduct solicits good will . But both or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately , and not be deserving of friendship . They may be united , and their efforts destroyed by personal defect in the possessor , timidity , false shame , false pride or excessive sensitiveness , and as far as these defects have influence , the effects of good conduct are weakened , obscured or destroyed . West had talents , virtue , youth , beauty , and prudence . He appears to have possessed no quality to counteract their influence , and circumstances independent of his own good qualities seemed uniformly to favor his progress . VOL . XLI. -* NO. 88. // " From Florence Mr. West proceeded to Bologna , and after inspecting the works of art , he went on to Venice . Here the style and coloring of Titian were his principal study . After completing the tour recommended by Mengs , he returned to Rome , and pursued his study again in that great centre of taste . He at this time painted his pictures of Cimon and iphigenia , and Angelica and Medora . These established his reputation as an historical painter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of his father he determined to visit England before returning home , and again he had the advantage of travelling with a man of taste and refinement , Dr. Patoune , who was returning to Great Britain . The doctor proceeded to Florence , while the painter went to take leave of his friends at Leghorn . The travellers afterwards stopped at Parma , while West finished his copy of St. Jerome . This beautiful picture is in the possession of the family of Mr. Allen , one of the painter 's earliest friends , and in America . Here again the novelty of an American quaker painter procured him the attention of the great ; and the friend kept on his broad brim when introduced to the court of Parma , very much to the astonishment of the prince and his courtiers , - perhaps not a little to their amusement . " Genoa and Turin were taken in the route to France , and the peace of 1763 having been but lately concluded , the travellers as Englishmen , were only protected by a magistrate from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Paris , West visited , as every where else , the collections of paintings and sculptures , but the inferiority of France to Italy was at that time more apparent than at this , and the American had little to learn in Paris , who had studied in , and gained the approbation of the academies of Italy . " The following able review of Mr. West 's character is from the pen of Sir Martin Archer Shee , the President of the Royal Academy . " The discourses of President West bear ample testimony to the zeal and knowledge which he brought to the performance of a task , rendered as arduous as it was honorable , by the extraordinary ability with which it had been previously executed . " Well grounded in the elementary principles of this profession , he was as conversant with the theory , as he was dexterous in the practice of his art . It is no exaggeration to say of him , that in the exercise of those powers of the pencil , to the attainment of which his ambition more particularly directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , was the facility of his hand , and with so much certainty did he proceed in his operations , that // he rarely failed to achieve whatever he proposed to accomplish , and within the time which he had allotted for its performance . " Indefatigable application and irrepressible ardor in his pursuit , succeeded in obtaining for him that general knowledge of his subject , which seldom fails to reward the toils of resolute and welldirected study . No artist of his time , perhaps , was better acquainted with the powers and the expedients , the exigencies and the resources of his art . No man could more sagaciously estimate the qualities of a fine picture , or more skilfully analyze the merits combined in its production . If you found yourself embarrassed in the conduct of your work , and you consulted him , he would at once show you where it failed , and why it failed . Like a skilful physician , he announced with precision the nature of the disease , and could suggest the remedy , even where he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished him , both as a man and as an artist , were , perhaps , not a little influenced by the peculiar religious impressions which he had early received . Order , calmness , and regularity characterized him through all the relations of life . In his habits of investigation , there was nothing loose , desultory , or digressive . The stores of knowledge which study and experience enabled him to lay up , were immediately classed and ticketed for use ; and the results of his observations he diligently endeavored to compress into principles , whenever they would admit of so advantageous a reduction ; the natural turn of his mind leading him to repress , within the strict limits of system and science , the arbitrary , irregular , and eccentric movements of genius and taste . " No man could be more liberally desirous than West to impart to others the knowledge which he possessed . He never , indeed , appeared to be more gratified than when engaged in enlightening the minds of those who looked up to him for instruction ; and though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great predecessor , and communicating the lessons of his experience in a similar way , he does not approach to a rivalry with Reynolds as a teacher of his art ; though his pen was not so ready as his pencil , and can not be said to display the graces of language and style which distinguish the compositions of that eminent writer , yet the discourses of President West , delivered from this place , must be acknowledged to contain many ingenious remarks and much useful information . They evince an ardent enthusiasm for the honor and interests of his profession , and a laudable zeal to recommend the just claims of the arts to the respect and protection of our country . " It is impossible to review the character and professional powers of this able artist , without the strongest sense of regret that // they are so inadequately understood and appreciated in this country , even at this day . The spirit of criticism prevalent among us , which , it must be confessed , is not generally too indulgent to the imperfections of modern art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually fastidious and severe . The high aims of his pencil , which might reasonably be expected to propitiate the community of taste , have procured for him no favor . He is unsparingly censured when he fails , and is allowed little credit where he has succeeded . He is tried , not by his merits , but by his defects , and judged by a tribunal which admits only the evidence against him . His profession , indeed , have always done him justice ; and they manifested their sense of his claims by the station in which they placed him . But few artists have been less favored by fortune , or more ungenerously defrauded of their fame . It has been unreservedly stated on his own authority , that the remuneration of his labors , from the patronage of the public , during the space of fortyfive years , was so inadequate to his very moderate wants , as to leave him dependent on the income allowed him as historical painter to his royal patron George the Third , for the means of living in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of this resource having been unexpectedly withdrawn from him , very late in life , and at a period when his royal protector must have been unconscious of such a proceeding , the close of his long and laborious career was embittered by pecuniary embarrassment . But his enthusiasm for his art never for a moment failed under his disappointments . The spring of his mind never once gave way ; and nearly to the latest hour of an existence prolonged beyond the period usually assigned to the age of man , he was occupied in projecting works sufficiently extensive to startle the enterprize of youth , and demand the exertion of the most vigorous manhood . " Unfortunately , however , West did not possess , in a sufficient degree , those qualities of art which are the most popular amongst us . The captivations of color , citiar ' oscuro , and execution , which the English school displays in such perfection , were wanting to set off his productions ; and the merits of a higher order which they contained , appealed to , and required the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of his time could in general supply . " So little impression , indeed , had his various powers left upon the public mind , after the toils of more than half a century , that a collection of his pictures , formed after his death by his family , coixtaining many of his finest works , and arranged with peculiar judgment and taste , had scarcely sufficient attraction for the admirers of art in this great metropolis , to defray the expenses attending their exhibition . // " The defects of West were obvious to the most common observer of his works . Every small critic could talk of the hardness of his outline , the dryness of his manner , and the abs*nce of what may be called those surface sweets which are so highly prized , under the name of execution , by that class of artists and connoisseurs who think more of the means than of the end , in contemplating a work of art . But it demanded greater knowledge of the subject than is commonly found amongst the ordinary dispensers of fame in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers of composition ; - his general facility of design ; - his masterly treatment of extensive subjects , where , in pouring a population on his canvass , the resources of an artist 's imagination are put to the test ; - the scientific construction and arrangement of his groupes , and the appropriate action and occupation of the different figures of which they are composed . Yet all these are qualities which rank high in the scale by which it is usual to estimate the comparative claims of a painter . We must take care not to lose sight of the standard by which the relative merits of our art are to be measured . In proportion as the intellectual is combined with the mechanical , do we value those productions of man which are not appropriated to the purposes of manufacture , or the ordinary accommodations of life . " invention , composition , design , character , and expression have always taken precedence of coloring , chiar ' oscuro , and execution , in the estimation of the judicious critic ; though excellence in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may , from local prejudice , or personal peculiarity , prefer silv&amp; to gold , or a pebble to a diamond ; but if we reverse in our notions the relative value , which , by common consent , has been assigned to these objects , our judgment will be considered not only erroneous but diseased . " The ambition of West directed him to the highest department of his art . In his hands the pencil was always employed for the noblest purposes , - on subjects the moral interest of which outweighs their mechanical execution . He delighted to commemo .. rate heroic deeds , to illustrate the annals of sacred history , and perpetuate the triumphs of patriotism and public virtue . " If we applaud the exalted spirit which prompted him to devote his talents to such praiseworthy objects , shall we not also offer the just tribute of our admiration to the enlightened monarch who encouraged and sustained his labors ; who , by liberally endeavoring to re-open the church to the arts , sought to procure for them a new source of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him lay , set an example of generous patronage of the arts to the great and powerful of his day , which , if it had been followed with corresponding zeal and patriotism , could not have failed to obtain // for Great Britain all the glory which pre-eminence in arts can shed upon a state ? " The degree of success with which the honorable exertions of West were attended , may , I conceive , be fairly determined by this test : let the most prejudiced of those who are inclined to question his claims to the rank of a great artist examine the series of prints engraved from his works . would , in particular , entreat them to view with some attention , the Death of General Wolfe , - the battle of La Hogue and the Boyne , - the Return of Regulus to Carthage , - Agrippina bearing the ashes of Germanicus , - the young Hannibal swearing eternal enmity to the Romans , - the Death of Epaminondas , - the Death of the Chevalier Bayard ,  - -  Pyrrhus , when a boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - and Penn 's treaty with the Indians ; riot to mention many others , perhaps equally deserving of enumeration . Let these well-known examples of his ability be candidly considered , and where is the artist , whose mind is enlarged beyond the narrow sphere of his own peculiar practice , - where is the connoisseur , whose taste has not been formed by a catalogue raisonn* , or in the atmosphere of an auction-room , - who will hesitate to acknowledge that the author of such noble compositions may justly claim a higher station in his profession than has been hitherto assigned to him , and well merits to be considered , in his peculiar department , the most distinguished artist of the age in which he lived ? " The next artist commemorated in these memoirs , is John Singleton Copley . He was born in Boston , in 1738 , and began to show the turn of his genius for painting early in life . In 1774 he went to italy , and two years after , arrived in England , where he devoted himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides his portraits , many historical pieces from his pencil have gained considerable celebrity , - among them are , " the Death of Chatham , " and " Charles the First in the house of Commons . " The name of Copley has been made still more illustrious , by the genius of the painter 's son , Lord Lyndhurst , who has twice been raised to the dignity of Lord High Chancellor of England . The following remarks on Copley are from the letters of C. R. Leslie , addressed to Mr. Dunlap . " Of Copley I can tell you very little . I saw him once in Mr. West 's gallery , but he died very soon after my arrival in London . Mr. West told me he was the most tedious of all painters . When painting a portrait , he used to match with his palette-knife a tint // for every part of the face , whether in light , shadow , or reflection . This occupied himself and the sitter a long time before he touched the canvas . One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and represents a group of the royal children playing in a garden with dogs and parrots . It was painted at Windsor , and during the operation , the children , the dogs , and the parrots became equally wearied . The persons who were obliged to attend them while sitting complained to the queen ; the queen complained to the king ; and the king complained to Mr. West , who had obtained the commission for Copley . Mr. West satisfied his majesty that Copley must be allowed to proceed in his own way , and that any attempt to hurry him might be injurious to the picture , which would be a very fine one when done. * " The prediction of West was fully accomplished ; and this graceful , splendid , and beautiful composition was seen by the writer at Somerset House , in the year 1786 or 7 , and is remembered with pleasure to this day . " On the subject of Copley , we must give our readers some further valuable and entertaining matter from the pen of Mr. Leslie . He says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have it , such as it is . His merits and defects resemble those of West . I know not that he was ever a regular pupil of the president , but he was certainly of his school . Correct in drawing , with a fine manner of composition , and a true eye for light and shadow , he was defective in coloring . With him it wants brilliancy and transparency . His Death of Major Pierson , I think his finest historical work ,  --  you have perhaps seen it , - at any rate you know the fine engraving of it , by James Heath . Copley 's largest picture is in Guildhall ; the destruction of the floating batteries off Gibraltar , by General Elliot . The foreground figures are as large as life , but those in the middle distance , are either too small or deficient in aerial perspective . Instead of looking like nen diminished by distance , they look less than life . With the exception of this defect the picture is a fine one . His Death of Lord Chatham is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored picture I have seen by him , but it has a defect frequent in large compositions made up of a number of portraits . There are too many figures to let . Too many unoccupied , and merely introduced to show the faces . His picture of Brooke Watson and the Shark , is in the large hall of the Blue Coat School . It is a good picture , but dry and bad in color . He painted , I believe , a great many portraits , but I have seen none of any consequence excepting the group of the King 's Children I described to you in my last . It is a beautiful picture . I have heard Allston say , he has seen very fine // portraits , painted by Copley before he left America . I would advise you to write to Aliston about it . ' In another of Mr. Leslie 's valuable letters we have the following : - I know not if Allan Cunningham in his life of Copley , has told the following story of his tediousness as a painter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fanily in one large picture , but during its progress , the gentleman 's wife died , and he married again . Copley was now obliged to obliterate all that was painted of the first wife , and place her in the clouds in the character of an angel , while her successor occupied her place on earth . But lo ! she died also , and the picture proceeded so slowly as to allow the husband time enough to console himself with a third wife . When the picture was completed , therefore , the gentleman had two wives in heaven , and one on earth , with a sufficient quantity of children . The price , which was proportioned to the labor bestowed on the picture , was disputed by the employer , who alleged that the picture ought to have been completed before his domestic changes had rendered the alterations and additions necessary . Copley went to law with him ; and his son , ( now Lord Lyndhurst , ) who was just admitted to the bar , gained his father 's cause . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to remember Copley , but he did not give me his authority for it , and I fear it is too good to be true. * I remember one or two of Copley 's last pictures in the exhibition , but they were very poor ; he had outlived his powers as an artist . ' " This country has produced no portrait painter of more commanding excellence , than Gilbert Stuart . He was a man of great impetuosity and lively sensibility . His discernment was acute , and his judgment unerring . He saw the character of his sitters at a glance , and gave them to the canvas with amazing truth . He did not merely imitate the face , - map it , as some one has well expressed the thought ,  --  but he unlocked the secret within , and drew the portrait of the mind itself . He painted the outward lineaments with striking truth ; hut in a higher spirit of truth , he strove to give the thinking being . A curious anecdote is told , to illustrate this trait of Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait of his brother , General Phipps , then on the point of sailing to India . Something strange in the picture struck his lordship 's eye , and drew from him the exclamation , " I see insanity in that face ! " The first news of General Phipps , after his arrival , was , that // he had gone mad , and cut his throat ! This may have been an accidental coincidence ; but it is most likely that the painter saw some slight peculiarity of mind , symptomatic of insanity , and that it unconsciously affected his conception of the whole character . Stuart 's portraits have thus , very naturally , taken rank with the foremost productions in that branch of art . Stuart 's talent in conversation is said to have been extraordinary . His wit was copious and ready , his knowledge vari. ous , and he appears to have had , in an eminent degree , the art of making every sitter talk in his own peculiar vein . Every body has heard of the awkward feelings experienced by people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The painter who has not tact enough to remove these amiable weaknesses , will stand a poor chance of giving a happy likeness . A majority of the portraits in the world , express the feelings of bashful men , under a painful consciousness of being dressed up , and standing point blank before a row of ladies in a drawing-room . But Mr. Stuart 's portraits differ widely from all this . The character of many of our most distinguished men will be handed down to posterity by his vivid pencil . The following capital anecdote is from the amusing pen of Dr. Waterhouse . " He was travelling in England in a stage-coach , with some gentlemen , who were strangers to him , but all sociable , and full of spirits . After dinner they fell into conversation , in which Stuart , it seems , was conspicuous ; for his conversation was at all times animated and various , ( and not the less so after dinner , ) upon any topic that came up , especially upon subjects that called forth nice discrimination , correct judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Burke-like power of expressing them . After he had been blazing away in his dramatic manner , his companions were very desirous to know who and what he was , for whatever Doctor Franklin may have said a century ago of the question-asking propensity of his countrymen , I never noticed so much of that kind of travelling curiosity in New-England as in Britain . On the contrary , I am certain that we in the United States are remarkably free from that sort of travelling importunateness . To the round-about question , to find out his calling or pro .. fession , Mr. Stuart answered with a grave face , and serious tone , that he sometimes dressed gentlemen 's and ladies ' hair , ( at that time the high craped pomatumed hair was all the fashion. ) - You are a hair-dresser then ? ' What ! ' said he , do you take me for a // barber 1 ' I beg your pardon , sir , but I inferred it from what you said . If I mistook you , may I take the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes brush a gentleman 's coat , or hat , and sometimes adjust a cravat. ' 0 , you are a valet then , to some nobleman ? ' A valet ! indeed , sir , I am not . I am not a servant ;  --  to be sure I make coats and waistcoats for gentlemen . ' Oh ! you are a tailor ! ' Tailor ! do I look like a tailor ? I 'll assure you , I never handled a goose , other than a roasted one . ' By this time they were all in a roar . What the devil are you then ? ' said one . i 'll tell you , ' said Stuart . Be assured all I have said is literally true . I dress hair , brush hats and coats , adjust a cravat , and make coats , waistcoats , and breeches , and likewise boots and shoes at your service . ' Oho ! a boot and shoe-maker after all ! ' Guess again , gentlemen , I never handled boot or shoe but for my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true . ' We may as well give up guessing . ' After checking his laughter , and pumping up a fresh flow of spirits by a large pinch of snuff , he said to them very gravely , Now , gentlemen , I will not play the fool with you any longer , but will tell you , upon my honor as a gentleman , my bona Jide profession . I get my bread by making faces . ' He then screwed his countenance , and twisted the lineaments of his visage , in a manner such as Samuel Foote or Charles Matthews might have envied . When his companions , after loud peals of laughter , had composed themselves , each took credit to himself for having all the while suspected that the gentleman belonged to the theatre , ' and they all knew that he must be a comedian by profession ; when to their utter surprise , he assured them that he never was on the stage , and very rarely saw the inside of a play-house , or any similar place of amusement . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before parting , Stuart said to his companions , Gentlemen , you will find that all I have said of my various employments , is comprised in these few words : I am a portrait-painter . If you will call at John Palmer 's , York-Buildings , London , where I shall be ready and willing to brush you a coat or hat , dress your hair , * la mode , supply you , if in need , with a wig of any fashion or dimensions , accommodate you with boots or shoes , give you ruffles or cravats , and make faces for you . ' " While taking a parting glass at the inn , they begged leave to inquire of their pleasant companion , in what part of England he was born ; he told them he was not born in England , Wales , Ireland , or Scotland . Here was another puzzle for John Bull . Where then ? ' I was born at Narraganset . ' Where 's that ? ' " Six miles from Pottawoone , and ten miles from Poppasquash , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the // spot where the famous battle with the warlike Pequots was fought . ' in what part of the East Indies is that , sir * East Indies , my dear sir ! it is in the state of Rhode-Island , between Massachusetts and Connecticut river . ' This was all Greek to his companions , and he left them to study a new lesson of geography , affording another instance of the ignorance of islanders , respecting men of genius , whose vernacular tongue is the same with that of Bacon , Newton , and Locke , Shakspeare , Milton , and Pope . ' " Stuart received much instruction from Mr. West , and became distinguished among the greatest portrait-painters of the British metropolis , where he passed many years of his life . With the proud feeling and high-wrought sensibilities of genius , he had many of its xveaknesses . His disregard for the maxims of prudence often entangled him in pecuniary difficulties , and threw a shadow over the uprightness of his character , which never dims the lustre of dull minds , protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His life , though beautiful forms could he summoned around him at will , - must have been a wretched scene , a " painted misery , " harassed by petty annoyances , as unnecessary as they were vexatious . But we will " No farther seek his merits to disclose , Or draw his frailties from their dread abode ; There they alike in trembling hope repose , The bosom of his Father and his God . " The twelfth chapter contains an interesting sketch of miniature painting , a beautiful branch of art , which has been cultivated with much success among us , and has at present many skilful practisers . The next three chapters Mr. Dunlap gives to his own biography . This will be read with eagerness , both on account of the varied incidents and scenes which he has been a witness of , or an actor in , and the perfect candor with which he delineates his own character in its shades as well as lights . The next chapter is taken up with names but little known to fame . The eighteenth chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by much useful information on the technical terms of the art . This is followed by a full account of the life and works of Colonel Trumbull , in which many of his productions are highly praised ; but we are sorry to say that portions of the narrative are uncandid , and unnecessarily severe . We can not go into the battles of the artists ; the space in Mr. Dunlap 's book taken up by this unpleasant subject , is // worse than wasted . We leave it with the single remark , that we do not admire Colonel Trumbull as an artist , hut that his industry and zeal entitle him to respect , if not to applause . His life is closely connected with the history of the American revolution , many scenes of which he has illustrated by his pencil , and his name will thus have a twofold claim on the notice of posterity . A short sketch of American academies of art , followed by shorter sketches of some obscure artists , closes the first volume . The second volume embraces a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period illustrated by the genius of Malbone , Vanderlyn , Jarvis , the Peales , and numberless others . But the works of Washington Alls ton will , of themselves , make this a splendid era in our history . As this gentleman is living among us , he is to be spoken of with reserve , except as an artist . What , then , are the leading traits of his genius ? His works show a mind of vast compass , and varied culture . In literary attainments and poetic talent , he stands pre-eminent among his brethren . Early education , after studies , and wide intercourse with the most illustrious men of Europe , have made him familiar with every region of thought , from which a genius for art can draw its nourishment . He has carefully studied the great models of painting abroad , - in Italy arid England , and he has mastered the profoundest principles with the minutest details . His drawing is celebrated for truth , science , and accuracy . His coloring is rich , expressive , and of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the proudest attribute of genius , the power of surrounding himself at will with the loveliest and sublimest creations . His imagination seems to dwell forever in a world of ideal beauty , - in the " kingdom of forms " which come and go , obedient to his nod . He can conjure up the most solemn scenes of Pity and Terror , or the mild and gracious images of Romance and Love . The awful Shade of Samuel speaks horror to the soul of the conscience-stricken king , - the figure of the Prophet of Israel , dictating to his Scribe , dilates with the inspiration of God , - and the richest and softest scene of Shakspeare , starting into mimic life on the canvas , makes the heart feel with a delicious enchantment , * How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon the bank . " // ages , as Mr. Aliston . His love for the art has bound him to it , heart and soul , and for life . The promptings of his exquisitely organized nature lead him onward and still onward in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exarnples of the loftiest poetry of art . His hand and eye are obedient to the bidding of his calm intellect . May the world long profit by the presence of that serene spirit , whose pathway has always lain in the realms of truth , purity , and beauty ; whose treasured thoughts have been poured out in every form of grace and sublimity ; whose light is destined to shine , like some beneficent star , in the brightest constellation of American genius ! Mr. Dunlap has adorned his life of Allston with many extracts from the painter 's letters . These are delicious pieces of poetry , anecdote , and criticism , and , what is better , they breathe the finest spirit of humanity . They show a heart as free from malice and envy as childhood itself . Such is the character of a great and good man . Let the irritable geniuses of the age learn of him , that the essence of wisdom is not concentrated in a sneer . The life of Mr. Sully is full of interest . He will un questionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of a later race , there are many distinguished names . Harding is successful and brilliant in portrait painting . Alexander excels in this , and may excel , if he chooses , in higher branches of art . His " Magdalen , " though an unfinished study , is an uncommonly beautiful exhibition of pathos and power . It drew from Sir Walter Scott , when that gre at man was in Italy , the exclamation , " she is forgiven ! " and has , from this circumstance , a melancholy interest . Inman is celebrated for the exquisite finish of his style of portraiture . Mr. S. F. B. Morse is in the prime of life , and the flower of strength . His fame is high and increasing . H is exertions have been honorably devoted to a more systematic promotion of his favorite arts and he has been called to preside over an institution which owes its origin mainly to his labors . He has lately finished a picture , representing the Gallery of the Louvre , with copies on a reduced scale , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have not yet had the pleasure of seeing ; but report speaks of it in terms of high praise . The history of Mr. Cole is replete with touching interest . His success is the just reward of virtuous industry , and strong native // powers . His landscapes are finished and beautiful productions ; and he bids fair to occupy an enviable niche in the temple of fame . Many other living painters , of high promise , are commemorated in this volume ; hut we are compelled to pass them by , together with numerous interesting notices of engravers and architects , for the sake of saying a few words on American sculpture . In this noble art , two young Americans have risen to a conspicuous rank . 1*Ir . Augur , now living in New Haven , is well known for several beautiful pieces executed by him under many disadvantages , but with signal success . His first original work , we believe , was a small statue of Sappho , which attracted considerable attention in Boston , and was bought by Mr. Thomas H. Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the impassioned poetess is more like that of a puritan girl of Cromwell 's time ; the figure is rather stiff , and the attitude ungraceful . But the touch of genius , though unripe and inexperienced , is upon it . There is a promise of better things , and the promise has been kept . The group of " Jeptha and his Daughter , " followed . This is a higher and grander subject . The action belongs to the sphere of tragedy , and requires greater vigor of conception and profounder sentiment . The crisis chosen by the artist , is the moment when the chieftain recognizes his daughter . He is bound by a solemn vow to offer up to God the first one who comes forth to meet him , as he returns victorious from the battle field . The sudden agony of the father 's heart , on seeing his only and beloved daughter rush to certain death , - to death by his own hand , - with triumphant song and dance , is conceived with wonderful force of imagination , and fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The artist is equally successful in expressing the mingled concern , inquiry , and astonishment of the daughter , as she suddenly pauses , bends forward , and sees her father agitated by some strong but unaccountable emotion . In the execution of this group there are very decided proofs of much progress in the art , since the last . The drawing is correct , the draperies well managed , the attitudes easy and natural , and the chiselling is done with a free hand . We are not aware that Mr. Augur has exhibited anything since , but we hope to hear from him again , at his convenience ; for we are sure that he is striding forward to high fame and honor in his beautiful art . // Horatio Greenough , now resident in Florence , has already gained a wide and well-deserved renown . A few years ago he left the halls of Harvard University , to visit the land of art , beauty , and song . He had already shewn a fine eye for form , and his imagination was teeming with creations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to embody . He went abroad with the advantage of a thorough literary education , which he had wisely persevered in attaining . With a mind highly cultivated , and full of poetry , he sailed to Italy , and gave himself up , enthusiastically , wholly , to sculpture , surrounded by the gathered treasures of ancient and modern genius . He toiled on silently , patiently , fervently . There were moments , doubtless , of anxious thought and gloomy foreboding . But he lived in a world of beauty , against whose splendors he could not shut his eyes ; and with the strong spirit of youth and ambition , he worked on , nor abated " one jot of heart or hope . The first original work of Mr. Greenough , exhibited in this country , was the group of " Chanting Cherubs . " The idea of this delightful group was taken from two figures in the Madonna del Trono , of Raphael . The work was executed for Mr. J. F. Cooper , by whom it was sent to the United States . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration . The figures represent two infant spirits , or cherubs , about to begin a chant . The idea of sinless childhood , free from the sufferings of this world , in the act of praise and song to the new-born Saviour of man , is expressed in this group with remarkable sweetness , purity , and beauty . This work gave Mr. Greenough , at once , a high rank , in the opinion of his countrymen . Another work of great merit followed . The idea of the " Medora " is borrowed from the following lines of Lord Byron 's Corsair : " In life itself she was so still and fair , That death , with gentle aspect , withered there ; And the cold flowers her colder hand contained , In that last grasp as tenderly were strained , As if she scarcely felt , but feigned a sleep , And made it almost mockery yet to weep ; The long dark lashes fringed her lids of snow , And veiled , - thought shrinks from all that lurked below . Oh ! o'er the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit from her thron* of light ; // Sinks those blue orbs in that long last eclipse , But spares , as yet , the charm around her lips , - Yet , yet they seem as they forbore to smile , And wished repose , but only for a while . But the white shroud , and each extended tress , Long , fair , but spread in utter lifelessness , Which late the sport of every summer wind , Escaped the baffled wind that strove to bind , - These , and the pale pure cheek , became the bier . " Medora lies in the stillness and beauty of recent death . The outlines and proportions of the figure belong to the most perfect form of female loveliness , while the placid , calm repose that overspreads her countenance , is exquisitely true to the poet 's conception . The attitude , the position of the several limbs , and the resting of the drapery , are wrought out with minuteness of labor , carefulness of study , and delicacy of thought . We have since been gratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of two infants , the elder of whom is receiving the younger into Paradise . The figures are moulded after the fairest and fullest form of childhood . Their attitudes are marked by perfect grace and freedom , on whichsoever side they are viewed . The younger spirit is gazing into the face of his guide with an expression of infantile confidence and earnest inquiry . Qua* nunc abitis in loca ? is the question bursting from his amazed and happy heart . The elder exhibits a beautiful blending of child-like loveliness with the expanded intellect of a spiritual being . The lines of the lower part of his face are those of humanity ; but the broad and beautiful forehead speaks the higher intelligence of another state . A spirit sits enthroned upon it , not of this world . Mr. Greenough is understood to be engaged at present on the statue of Washington , for which he has lately received a commission from the government of the United States . This , though a splendid distinction for so young a man , is fully merited by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , - Cli antrey and Canova , - have tried their hands upon this , the sublimest subject of mere human history ; but it is thought with no very eminent success . Mr. Greenough will have one advantage in the execution of his work over both his illustrious predecessors , - the enthusiasm of an American heart for the Founder of American Liberty . // Mr. Greenough has shown many of the highest qualities of genius . He has shown a high creative genius , set off by the graces of refined taste . His industry is unwavering , his perseverance unbroken . He has a correct eye for form , a skilful hand for drawing , and su peradds to the other excellencies of his works , the higher excellence of soul and sentiment . With such gifts of genius , - with an accomplished education , - with the untrammeled freedom of an American spirit , Mr. Greenough 's prospects are more flatterin0 to his ambition than those of any artist who has sprung up among us . What , then , is the state of American art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as iVir . Dunlap 's book bears ample testimony . That we have had many artists of exalted genius , the collections of this country and Europe fully prove . Allston , Stuart , and his accomplished nephew , Stuart Newton , with many others , have been equally distinguished at home and abroad . The elder teachers of American artists have passed or are passing away ; but a new generation is coming forward , to dispute the palm , perhaps to win the victory . The galleries of Europe are annually thronged with pilgrims from the new world , to the tombs of departed genius in the old . We have academies which have done something , and promise to do more , for the arts . We have yearly exhibitions of all the good pictures to be had , in all the principal cities of the Union . We have other exhibitions , from time to time , of great works which find their way from Europe to our shores . The Boston Athenarnm has , in its possession , the invaluable paintings of Rome , by Panini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures and statues of Italy . We have had the original comic * , roup of Mr. Thom , from Burns 's Tani O'Shanter , - and very lately , the model of a group , executed by an artist of New York , representing Uncle Toby and the Widow Wadman . Artists are regarded among us with esteem , nay , with reverence . Their works are examined , criticised , praised , - both with and without knowledge , - and , what is better , they are bought . But it must be confessed , that a large proportion of the works of our artists , like a majority of our literary productions , are of an ephemeral character . Landscapes and fancy-pieces are produced in quantities to suit , like stanzas to young ladies , and verses in albums . Our artists are not willing enough to give long years to strict mental toil , - to a laborious study of the . // principles which lie at the foundation of all art , - to an unceasing practice of the elementary studies , on which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination and taste , by careful literary culture . Still we think , after the works of temporary interest have vanished from the face of the earth , there will be left many enduring memorials , on which genius , labor , and high poetry , are visibly stamped . It may be that an era of art is approaching , in xv hich the graceful refinement , the elaborate finish , the delicate taste , fostered by the venerable institutions of Europe , shall be made to adorn the spirit of our republic , and the typified sentiment of American freedom.
