txt LITERATURE has its laborers of all sorts ; and , as there are readers of all capaciies , so I apprehend there should be writers of all grades , from the father of the ponderous folio to the conipiler of the little spelling-book . Great books should have great reviews ; and 1 confess I have often looked with compassion on the toils of those , who are obliged to wade through protracted volumes merely for the pleasure of writing a dissertation on them , and telling the world how little they are worth . I am thankful I am not a reviewer of volumes ; I have not the power of attention ; I have not the capacity ; I have not the victory over somnohmcy and indolence , to engage in an occupation , which , if ever so crilninal , always sets the punishrncnt before the offence . But to review a paragraph is a different affair . It just suits my capacity . The vehicle which I drive is one of the hourlies ; and , though the horses may be jaded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers that the fare is wondrous cheap . Every book is made up of paragraphs ; and if there is any harm done , it is always effected in these little corners . I have known a political writer to put more malice and insinuate more falsehood in one little parenthesis , than could possibly be spread over a volume , printed in the atlas style , on diamond types . In war , it is the small bullets which do the most execution ; and a man may be killed by a single buckshot as effectually as by the bursting of a shell or the blowing up of a mine . Besides , many readers are like me ; they only remember single sentences . The latter end of the commonwealth to them forgets the beginning , and they go through the garden ( though I am changing the metaphor ) only to bear away a single flower . I have heard many a sermon , most logically divided and subdivided , arranged into sixteen heads , and containing twice as many inferences , extending its unbroken beauties through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have brought away has been some single remark ; and that perhaps screwed to my wicked memory by its absurdity or falsehood . Alas , Sir , it is paragraphs that do the mischief . Long speeches are harmless things ; arid our legislators in Congress are patterns of innocence . If we wish to make truth current in this world we must launch it on the sea of life , embarked in a nut-shell . Permit me , then , to keep my eye on paragraphs . If I must turn reviewer I will be an honest one , and own that I have never read the books which I examine . In a writer of some eminence , as remarkable // perhaps for the caution of his reasonings as for candor to his enemies , I find the following paragraph , which I have read from beginning to end-every syllable of it . THE PARAGRAPH 0 When it is affirmed that the - Father is God ; and the Son is God ; and the Holy Ghost is God , ' - no words can more clearly convey any meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three existences of whom the attrihntes of God may be predicate - , and yet there is only one existence of whom the attributes of God may he predi ated . But - this is not an incomprehensible mystery ; it is plain nonsense . I hope no reader will suppose that I am about to enter into a learned discussion on any subject of religious polemics . To confute or to establish the doctrine of the Trinity is not my object . I do not deem - it necessary to reveal to my readers whether this ineffable nonsense is - my own belief or not . But this paragraph has awakened some reflections in my mind , to which I must give vent . In the first place , what an amiable thing is Christian meekness , mingled , as it ever ought to be , with humility and love ! It is not ambition , it is not vain glory , it is not contempt for the opinion of an opponent , that drives the reluctant polemic to take up his pen in the cause of righteousness and truth . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ties of allegiance which bin-d hi-rn to his God . He sees nonsense stalking abroad in the world under the garb of religion , leading thousands and tens of thousands captive in her train ; he sees a vast majority of the Christian church led astray by delusions too wild to be  --  the subjects of the - sick man 's dream ; he sees these men , to be sure , rational and sober on other subjects ; they have the - power of thought ; they have enjoyed the light of the sun ; they are endowed with some portion of common sense- ; they wear the forms and have the faculties of men ; they read the Bible and conscientiously interpret it ; and even the man , who opposes them , is obliged  --  to allow that they are able and pious men ; and yet the efforts of all their studies is to lead them into the most contemptible delusions . This a wise man , when he writes a polemic book , sees ; and , fired with a virtuous indignation , he calls things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their most cherished doctrines , as so much nonsense , and themselves , by consequence , fools for believing them . We must suppose , that these words , however , were spoken with the tenderest of all possible tones . What a luxury must it be to hear the meek and modest author of this urbane and delicate paragraph reading his own lucubrations . I see him arise-holding the lamp of truth in his hand - heavenly love and humility are seated-o-n his brow ; tenderness and pity sparkle in his eye ; - there is no sneer on his face ; no supercilious airs of superiority ; no contempt expressed or implied ; but pitying art erring church as he pities a lost world- ; with a sobbing voice and a streaming eye , he pronounces all the opinions of antiquity , and a vast majority of the creeds of existing Christendom , as downright nonsense . A charitable man knows the value of humility , and is willing to teach it to all his opponents . His communicative benevolence will not * 5tatement of Reasons for not believing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * We have given our opinion of Mr. Norton 's work in the Magazine for July , 1833 , page 76. // suffer him to allow people to imagine that they are delivering the oracles of wisdom while they are doling out nonsense . This writer is a plain spoken man ; and , like Mrs. Malaprop , in the play , he thinks " nothing is so conciliatory to young people as severity . " I am only sorry that my duty as a reviewer obliges me to insinuate that this beau* tiful paragraph is somewhat of a plagiarism . I think the candid author must have had in his eye ( perhaps unconsciously ) the first head in the famous sermon of the ordinary of Newgate , as reported in the history of the renowned Jonathan Wild . " What , " said that worthy divine , * " was all this mighty matter of philosophy , this heap of knowledge , which was to bring such large harvest of honor to those who sowed it , and so greatly and nobly to enrich the ground on which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap of nonsense , ( the very words of our paragraph ) of absurdities and contradictions , bringing no ornament to the mind in its theory , nor exhibiting any usefulness to the body in its practice . What were all the sermons and sayings , the fables and morals of all these wise men , but , to use the word men tioned in our text once more , FOOLISHNEsS ? What was their great master Plato , or their other great light , Aristotle ? Both fools ; mere quibblers and sophists , idly and vainly attached to certain ridiculous notions of their own , founded neither on truth nor on reason . Their whole works are a strange medley of the greatest falsehoods , scarce covered over with the color of truth ; their precepts are neither borrowed from nature nor guided by reason ; mere fictions , serving only to evince the dreadful height of human pride ; in one word , FOOLISHNESS . It may be , perhaps , expected from me , that I should give some instances from their works to prove this charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be to transcribe their whole works. ; and as , in such a plentiful crop , it is difficult to choose , instead of trespassing on your patience , I shall conclude this first head by asserting , what I have so fully proved , and what may , indeed , be inferred from the text , that the philosophy of the Greeks was FOOLISHNESS . " I only am concerned to remark , that we see from this long extract , not only that the writer of this paragraph has been following a precedent , but , also , that it is possible for the most contemptible of all beings , in demolishing an adversary , to use contempt . In the second place , how wise it is , in a controversial writer , in meeting the errors of an opponent , to let him know that he has some sensibility to the force of his difficulties ; some knowledge of the arguments which have convinced hundreds and thousands of believers ; some power of appreciating that state of mind which makes a questioned opinion look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never was a doctrine , however absurd , universally received , which had not some bright side to it ; some corner or angle from which it cast a ray , to make way for its reception , into rational minds . Men certainly have no abstract love for absurdity ; and good men , such as compose the church of God ,  --  who , however they fall short of perfection , must still be considered as the portions of the world most interested in religious truth , and most earnest to find it ,  --  are certainly not the people who wish to degrade their minds and debase their // hearts , by opinions , which only serve to flatter their passions and expose them to the scorn and ridicule of mankind . It is , therefore , a proof to me , that every- dogma , which has been piously embraced and has long prevailed , has some side which is plausible ; is susceptible of some representation or argument , which redeems it from the character of downright nonsense . There are few doctrines , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than the Romish tenet of transubstantiation . When I was a boy , and had as weak a judgement and as hot a head as some others , who never cease to be boys , I boldly pronounced , on hearing this article of the creed of millions , that it was plain nonsense . But age and reflection have altered my opinion ; and I must suppose that this opinion could not have been embraced by Augustine , and Bernard , and Pascal , and Fenelon , and Melancthon , and Luther , ( substantially , ) and almost by Calvin , without some presentation of it , which looked very different from nonsense . Still less , if I were going to debate with a Roman Catholic , with the least hope of converting him , should I begin the controversy with calling him a FOOL , prefixing , perhaps , to the substantive , an adjective of a profaner sound . No : I should endeavor to enter into his state of mind ; to appreciate his reasoning , to adopt his mental views ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though by further reasoning they might be certainly overthrown . Such is the method in which a debate should proceed , according to my low views . But why should I talk of myself ? May my arrogance be forgiven ; - in all that constitutes a modern polemic , T6*wv * I yield my author the palm . In the third place , how beautiful it is to hear the meekness of the heart express itself in soft language ! A soft answer , says Solomon , turneth away wrath . And what is a modern controversialist but the same , in practice , that Solomon was in theory ? Great complaints have been uttered of the angry spirit , in which controversy has been carried on in this vicinity of late . But Dr. Beecher has left us ; Dr. Wisner has resigned his charge ; Parsons Cook has for a long time been silent ; and the venerable Dr. Morse is sleeping in his grave . The wicked cease from troubling , and the weary are at rest . At this calm period , of suspended animosity and closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine peace-maker must have thought , that if he could only convince an irritable crowd that their opinions were plain nonsense , it must hush their passions and dispose them to peace . For who would contend for nonsense-PLAIN NONSENSE ? here I am reminded of a good story , which comes into my mind , though , like Sancho 's proverbs , I know not that it is any thing to the purpose . In a public assembly , somewhere ,  --  no matter where ,  --  perhaps it was Fanenil Hall ,  --  on a certain day when people met to speak and hear , there broke out in the gallery some little disturbance , which confused the speakers and stopped the proceedings . A great fat man , with tremendous lungs and a terrible cane , was pounding and bawling out , " keep the peace here-stop that noise-silence-out with him , " &amp;c. and this he continued until almost every body else was still . At length , a quaker , who sat near to him , vent tired to say ,  --  " Friend , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more peace. * ' As it has now been proved to one man 's satisfaction , that the tenets // of all sects but one are plain nonsense , perhaps it will be best that no more should be said . In the last place , let all future pugilists in the holy ring of religious controversy , beware how they overthrow their advers*iries too completely . There is such a thing , the logicians tell us , as proving too much . I have often admired the art of our naval officers in the last war , when they took a British frigate . They never represented their enemies as a pack of cowards ; they knew their own interest better ; but they represented them as a set of brave men , whom , by superior bravery , they had overcome . There was great skill in this ; if an enemy maneuvres well and fights bravely , the consequence is certain ; there is more credit in conquering him . It seems to rne ,  --  though no language can express the caution with which we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the only religious volume that is not palpable nonsense ,  --  it seems to me , that this able advocate depreciates his foes almost too much for his own reputation . To attack nonsense , although it should be dark and obscure , would hardly be worth the time of a wise man . But plain nonsense ! open contradiction ! palpable absurdity ! why should it ruffle the serenity or consume the time of our wisest and best men ? What credit is there in stripping off the motley coats of a pack of fools , who will be sure to find others ? Why deprive the idiot of his cap and bells , since the jingling of them cobstitutes half his employment and all his joy ? Besides , is there any credit in detecting palpable absurdity , in proving that to be nonsense which was plainly so before ? Does it need the genius of one of our brightest scholars to accomplish this ? Let the author of this paragraph satisfy the desires of his heart in some intellectual conflict , more worthy of his talents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being an Ajax , spreading havoc among the sheep . I wish that , instead of being a poor reviewer of paragraphs , I were a great genius ; I wish I had some flashes of that light , which enables certain men to be so confident , who are perfect sceptics except on the negative side . The more I consider religion , the more I am convinced that it is very difficult for me to say , in the vastness of its objects , and in the dimness of my vision , what is a contradiction , or in polite language , what is plain nonsense . There are many things incontestibly proved concerning the Deity ,  --  nay , even concerning so gross an object as rnatter ,  --  which look strongly like contradictions . If the reader will look into that common book , the Spectator , No. 590 , vol. viii . he will there find some speculations concerning the past existence of God , considered as a being , if he pleases , possessed of the strictest unity , which appear to my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard respecting the trinity , from the highest partizan of the doctrine , even Dr. Waterland himself . The doctrine of the existence of the antipodes , was , to Lactantius , plain nonsense . Est quisquam tam ineptus , gui credat esse homines , quorum vestig'ia sint superiora , guam capita ? * The argument ihat a man could not walk with his heels over his head , was rather knock-down reasoning in those days . The dialogist in Cicero , thought that the // creation and future eternity of the soul , were flat contradictions . 1-Jiune censes primis , ut dicitur , labris gustasse physiologiarn , qui quidquam , quod ortum sit , putet aeternum esse posse ? When I*see , in the long his tory of human errors , the mistakes that men have been led into by dogmatism and rashness , I suspect that caution and humility are no bad guides to conduct us to truth . I could wish that every author of a warm temperament were obliged , like Dryden , to submit to depletion and phlebotomy , before he should write on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he has first learned to be cool . What , then , shall we say of this splendid paragraph ? I suppose the theological young men in the first class of some committed seminary , would clap the bold author on the back , and applaud the decision of his intellect and the strength of his pen . A moderate Unitarian , with fifty years over his head , would say , " The language is a little spirited , but I hope the meaning is good . " An impartial philosopher , perhaps , would say , " Liberality may have its bigots as moderation has had its fierce defenders . " The writer of this article would only presume to hope , that the discriminating and classical eye of the author , may drop a tear on the offensive word , which , like that of Uncle Toby 's recording Angel , in another case , shall blot it out forever . G.@@183068677.txt An American Review of the late revolutionary movements in Europe is an important addition to the political literature of our country . The excitement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most direct and circumstantial information concerning any political question , and abriost any political event , must be received with many allowances . Thus the Edinburgh Review describes the late Revolution L France as a glorious uprising of the spirit of liberty against the encroachments of despotism ; but the London Quarterly would have us believe that it was nothing more than the licentiousness of a frantic mob , trampling under foot the authority of the government , the legitimate government of that paternal monarch , Charles X. by the mere force of numbers . From England we have three distinct views of all political subjects  --  a Tory view , a Whig view , and a Radical view . From France we have a droit view , a gauche view , an extr*me gaucle view , a jaste milieu view , and so on , to all the points of the political compass . rom other European nations we generally get such views as the Metternichs are pleased , in their high wisdom , to give us . It , therefore , becomes a matter of no little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . whose mind is imbued with the principles of rational liberty , and accomplished in the learning of Europe ; a man , who can examine patiently , compare coolly , and judge impartially a man , who can think clearly and write forci* VOL .

It is full of minute 1 ) articulars , but deeply interesting , to the last page . Mr. Cushing writes like a man who is thoroughly familiar with his subject , and his descriptions are so clear that we can understand the scenes described at once and completely . He has apparently gone over the whole ground , and examined all the localities with his own eyes ; for he writes with the distinctness of an eye witness , or rather with more distinctness than an eye witness could probably attain . Thus all the movements of the two parties in the Revolution of the Three Days are set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is traced , from the first outbreak of popular tumult , to the gloriou.s consummation of popular triumph over a perjured monarch and a perjured ministry , in such a manner , that a reader , of ordinary powers of attention , can follow and comprehend the whole . At the same time , the whole work is animated by a spirit , so philosophical , so moderate , and so just , that we rise from it with a settled conviction , that the cause of Liberty , of Order , and of Law , has made a permanent addition to its strength by this last perilous experiment . The first part of the work is taken up with a retrospect of European Civilization , and an " Idea of the French Revolution . " The former is drawn up with a good deal of ability , and deep learning . It is a condensation of the scattered lights of history , through a dark but interesting period in the progress of man ; and it presents a very intelligible view of the formations of those institutions , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European thought , all the forms of European culture , and all the channels of European opinion , owe their origin . The " Idea of the French Revolution " contains , of course , but little , if any thing , that is absolutely new ; but in many respects it has the effect of novelty , by the proper grouping of incidents and characters , so as to give consistency , harmony , and truth to the whole . After this highly appropriate introduction , the main subject of the work is begun . The condition of France , and the various influences which acted on the thoughts and passions of her inhabitants , at the accession of the Polignac Ministry , are carefully described . The suspicions entertained by the country , of the purposes of the cabinet , the meeting of the chambers , the prorogation , the subsequent elections , the expedition to Algiers , are interesting incidents in the prelude to the great revolutionary drama . Chapter III . contains an able review of the state of parties , and a clear statement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French people , but recoiled , with such a fatal rebound , on the heads of their projectors . As this is decidedly the most important part of the history of the Revolution , we quote the following excellent sketch " In such a condition of parties , what were the indications , which encouraged the Ministers to invade the Charter ? No man knows , and they can not tell , where they discovered any grounds of confidence whereon to proceed . A free press had been sounding the tocsin of alarm for eleven months . The aristocracy had no power as such ; for none could it have after the aholition of the rights of primogeniture . The clergy were divided unpopular , and without influence . A violent excitation of sentiment pervaded the whole country . The election had proved the force of popular right , even in spite of the artificially devised system // of electoral colleges . All men felt ready to act upon the maxims and motto of a patriotic society , which assumed for its title side toi , le Cici t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , confident in their power to sustain them , and ready to do all and dare all , rather than submit to any arbitrary acts on the part of the King . " It has frequently been ohserved that the situation and character of Charles X. of France were strikingly similar to those of James II . of England . M. de Polignac might have taken warning from this instructive page in the history of princes , when he saw the readiness of the people to run out the extraordinary parallel to its consummation . In England , Charles I. by singular alternations of weakness and ohstinacy , contrihuted to bring on the revolution which led him to the scaffold ; and in France Louis XVI . wonderfully like Charles in his virtues and his failings , had reached the same result by the same means . In France , as in England , wild utopian schemes of government , sanctioned by various factions , afterwards agitated a country given up to the usurpation and tyranny of legislative assemblies . The dictatorship of Cromwell followed in England , as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal talents of these extraordinary men having proved too powerful for the public liberties , while no legitimate monarch ever reigned with greater dignity than they , or with a truer perception of what the internal welfare of the country required . The Restoration came next ; and it needs only the same full development of the history of Louis XVIII . to show how much the one voluptuary resembled the other in his character and the policy of his government . To each a brother had succeeded ; and who could deny that Charles X. was the very doable of James II. ? The same weak unreasoning obstinacy impelled each to attempt the overturn of the constitution , which he was sworn to maintain . Charles X. was not yet dethroned , for the climax of his arbitrary attempts was to come . But everybody was following out the analogy . It was unfolded in the newspapers , discussed in conversation , present to every mind . All the world seemed to say to the King : If you undertake the same enterprise , you must expect the same fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identical part here , which William of Nassau enacted in England . " It was in such a state of parties , in a crisis like this , when the whole nation was expecting occasion for oppugnation and preparing to display it , that Charles undertook to assume the swelling port of absolute power . To the only faithful counsellors of his family , he seems to have held the doctrines of Leontes , forgetting that this was the age of revolutions , constitutions , and equal rights , and not that of the jus divinum : Why need we Commune with you of this ? Nor rather follow Our forceful instigation Our PREROGATIVE Calls not your counsel ; but our natural goodness Imparts this ; - which , if you , or stupefied , Or seeming so in skill , can not or will not Relish as truth , like us ,  --  inform yourselves We need no mere of your advice ; - tlie matter , The loss , the gain , the ord'ring o'nt , is all Properly ours . No reasoning , in fact , could turn hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its maturity of wisdom or discretion of character . A brilliant levie was holden at St. Cloud on Sunday , the 25th of July , at which the members of the Cabinet , the corps diplomatique , and the leabitads of the royal saloon , assembled for the last time to grace the Court of Charles Tenth . Those who were in the secret of the meditated coup d ' etat , carefully disguised their feelings under a cheerful exterior ; and the great body of courtiers felt easy amid the assurances , direct and indirect , which were holden out to them by the parties to the conspiracy . The famous Ordinances were signed on the same day , after the close of the levee , and carried to Paris by one of the Ministers , to be inserted in the next Moniteur . The Keeper of the Seals himself , M. Chantelauze , who , as appears from the Trial of the Ex-Ministers , had drawn up the Report already spoken of , sent for M. Sanyo , the conductor of the Moniteur , to receive the Ordinances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chantelauze , the two Ministers , both exhibiting the greatest dejection in their manner ; and he did not disguise from therm his own consternation , when he came to understand the nature of the Ordinances. // Litcrary LXOtICCS " Of these Ordinances , one suspended the liberty of the Press , another annulled the election of the Deputies , and a third arbitrarily changed the constitution of the future Chambers . The Ordinance relative to the Press consisted of nine articles , which placed all the journals , of whatever kind , under the strict surveillance of the Police , so that no periodical writing should appear without authorization , to he renewed every three months , and liable at any time to be revoked or suspended . I-lad these provisions been constitutional in form , they would have been oppressive to the last degree ; but as the Charter assigns the regulation of the press to the laws , that is , the concurrent acts of the King and the two Chambers , this Ordinance was a palpable violation of the Charter . " The second Ordinance is brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being informed of the maneuvres , which have been practised in various parts of the Kingdom , to deceive and mislead the electors during the late operations of the Electoral Colle . Cs , ' it merely ordains that The Chamber of Deputies of Departments is dissolved . ' Such are the words used , but they are altogether false and deceptive . No Chamber of Deputies then existed . Individuals had been elected to be members of a future Chamber hereafter to be organized ; but as yet there was no Chamber . The words of the Ordinance , to speak the exact truth , should have been : The late elections of Deputies of Departments are annulled ; - for this and this only was what the Ordinance did , under the jesuitical pretence of exercising a constitutional power to dissolve the Chambers . " To comprehend the remaining Ordinance it is necessary to call to mind the actual and past state of the laws for the choice of Deputies . The Charter provides that The Chamber of Deputies shall be composed of Deputies elected by the Electoral Colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( art . 30 , ) and that Each Department shall have the same number of Deputies that it had until the present time ' ( art . 31 . ) Previous to the law of June , 1820 , the number of Deputies had been 258 , all returned by Electoral Colleges , of which there was but one for each Department , and consisting of the whole body of qualified electors , voting alogether , or in sections , according to circumstances ( Loi 5Fdvrier , 1817 . ) After a few years ' trial of this system , it appeared to operate too favorably for the democratic principle , and the Ministers devised the ingenious legerdemain of the double vote , heretofore mentioned , to augment the power of the aristocracy ( Loi 29 Juin , 1820. ) rhe Electoral Colleges already subsisting were suffered to remain in substance , with the right of returning the 258 old members as before , only divided into permanent sections , called Colleges of Arrondissements . At the same time 1172 new umembers were added , to be chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the electors paying the highest tax , in number equal to the fourth part of all the electors in the Department ' ( art . 2 . ) These 172 Deputies , be it observed , were created by a ministerial manwuvre for the sole purpose of giving the nomination of two-fifths of all the rnemb rs to a select body of the aristocracy , in the hope that a small portion , at least , of the other three-fifths would continue favorable to the court-party , so as thus permanently to secure a majority to the Ministers . Of course , this addition to the Chamber , and this mode of electing the additional members , had always been vehemently censured by the liberal party , whose influence was thus greatly abridged . One thing more is to be remarked , namely , that the members of the elective Chamber are , in the language of the Charter , styled Deputies of Departments ' ( art . 50 . ) This expression would seem to be the true legal denomination for all the Deputies collectively ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for dissolving the Chamber . " These explanations have been premised in order that the reader may folly understand the mingled meanness , effrontery , and tyranny of the Ordinance relative to the elections . It begins by providine that , Conformably to the articles 15 , 36 , and 50 of the Constitutional Charter the Chamber of Deputies shall consist only of Deputies of Departments ' ( art . 1 ; ) and that Each Department shall have the number of Deputies allotted to it by the 36th article of the Constitutional Charter ' ( art . 3 . ) Such are the very terms of the Ordinance ; and when we come to render these cabilistical phrases into something more intelligible to us vulgar sublunary mortals , it will be seen that M. de Peyronnet , the author of this Ordinance , had practised very diligently upon the maxim of the honest diplomatist , who defined words to be instruments employed for concealing one 's meaning . ' The signification of the latter article is , Henceforth the Chamber of Deputies shall contain but 258 members ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signification of the other article is equally abstruse and recondite , and is // veiled in a most contemptible quibble . If the sentence had been worded in the simplicity and directness of an honest purpose , it would have been , Henceforth the Deputies shall be chosen by the Departmental Colleges alone . ' The singular phraseology actually employed was adopted in a spirit of low cunning , in order to have it seem that the Ordinance was but a restoration of the Charter . So far as it regarded the number of Deputies contemplated by the Ordinance it was indeed a return to the Charter ; but if the 172 new members elected under the law of 1820 were all unconstitutional , by whom were they introduced and for what purpose ? Were they not the creation of the government ? Was not their creation a mere trick , a device , a far-fetched expedient , to enable the government to return members favorable to themselves , out of the ranks and by the votes of the high aristocracy alone ? But what right had M. de Peyronnet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by the Colleges of Arrondissements , that is , by the whole body of electors , were not Deputies of Departments within the true intent of the Charter ? He undertakes virtually to affirm that none , but Deputies chosen by the newly invented Colle , , es of June , 1820 , are Deputies in any sense , and by force of this notable discovery disfranchises at once all those electors , who under the law of 1817 voted either in the mass or in sections , and under the law of 1820 were permanently organized into sections . The whole electoral power was thus thrown icto the hands of the famous fourth part , ' - lea blecteurs les plus imposinSs ,  --  nothing being ssigned to the other three-fourths but the right of nominating a list of candidates , out of whom the fourth part ' should choose half the Deputies . " The Ordinance , ofcourse , ever took effect , and therefore is only important in a historical point of view . It was illegal in the same way the others were , inasmuch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Charter , could only be done by enacted laws . It operated in fact a total change of the whole constitution of the Chambers . We have taken pains to give a just account of the mode in which it was devi ed , because this does not appear to have been well understood out of France , and could not be , indeed , without careful examiaation of the pre-existing laws on the subject . It should be added that another Ordinance convoked the Electoral Colleges according to the new system , and appointed a meeting of the new Chambers that were to be thus unconstitutionally elected , for the 28th of Septembe .. " When these Ordinances appeared in the Moniteur , and began to he *enerally known , as they were read in the gardens , ccifts , and cabinets de lecture , nothing could exceed the consternation they universally occasioned . People in general had , perhaps , been lulled into comparative tranquility , supposing that the great struggle would not take place until after the regular meeting of the Chambers . They supposed it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some degree of discretion , and they saw the manifest advantage to him in having the crisis deferred until the Chambers should take some step of a violent or unreasonable character , so as to give a color of necessity to his arbitrary designs , and thus make sure of the sympathies of Europe . They supposed it would be so , because they saw no token of preparation , on the part of the Ministers , to encounter a popular movement . And they were astounded at the profligate audacity of the Ministers , in thus rooting up all the de* rest bulwarks of the Charter at once , and in a manner as insulting to the sense of the nation , as it was destructive of their liberties . But indignation , a determination to make a stand for their rights , desire of organization , and a looking around for the means of resisting the government , soon took the place , in the minds of all men , of the stupor and amazement of the first impression .

They could not hesitate which to choose . " The consequences of this act of ministerial madness are known to all the world ; the real character of the act is but imperfectly understood .

Perjury is one of its smallest elements the shedding of blood ,  --  not on the insignificant scale of highway robbers and midnight assassins ,  --  but murder by thousands is char*eable on those guilty men . The simple statement of facts , in Mr. Cushing 's book , has taken from our mind the last vestige of pity for those infatuated felons . We have already spoken of the clearness with which Mr. Cushing explains the movements of the two parties during the three days . The whole of this passage is too long for quotation , and we will not injure its effect by attempting to select a part . We must content ourselves by commending it to the special attention of American readers . The arrange*i*nts for the restoration of order and regular government , are related in the most interesting manner , and full justice is done to the moderation and wisdom of the French people . The subsequent cause of France has amply sustained her first decision in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch of Louis Philippe 's first Cabinet " The first care of the King was , of course , to fix the organization of his Cabinet on a permanent basis . The Moniteur of August 12th announced that M. Dupont de lEure was appointed Keeper of the Seals ; General Gdrard , Minister of War ; the Due de Brogue , of Public Instruction ; M. Guizot , of the Interior ; Baron Louis , of Finance ; Comte Mobs , of Foreign Affairs ; and Comte S*bastiani , of Marine . At the same time MM . Lafitte , Casimir P&amp;ier , Dupin , and Bignon became members of the cabinet without portfolios . These eminent individuals , most of whom have been frequently before us in the foregoing pages , represented the moderate party among the enemies of the late dynasty ; and the same reasons , which had seemed to exact the hasty proceeding of the Deputies in the transfer of the crown , namely , the danger of commotions in France and the necessity of conciliating the rest of Europe ,  --  spoke loudly in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in consideration of the particular pre-eminence acquired by those individuals in the affairs of France , it may not be amiss to give a cursory account of each of them , in this place . " M. Dupont d lEure , one of the great ornaments of the French judiciary , was a practising advocate at the bar of Normandy in 1789 , and embarked with intrepidity and zeal in the cause of the Revolution . He held in succession the offices of mayor of his commune , administrator of the district of Louviers , public prosecutor , member of the Council of 1'ive Hundred , President of the court of Rouen , with various other judicial and legislative stations , bestowed upon him previous to the Restoration , after which he became one of the most respected and influential members of the Chamber of Deputies on the side of the Opposition . " Comte G&amp;ard is one of the eminent commanders of the empire . He entered the armies of the Republic as a volunteer at the age of eighteen , and was constantly in service , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhine , in Italy , and in Germany ; hut it was in the series of bloody battles of 1812 , and the following years , that he became pre-eminently distinguished . During the Hundred Days he was second only to Ney in the glory , and equal to him in the devotedness , of his efforts in behalf of France ; and being elected a Deputy in 1822 , he earned new titles to public confidence as a powerful auxiliary of the Opposition . " The Duc de Broglie is of a family eminent for a succession of great military men in the reign of Louis XIV . and . Louis XV . but is himself distinguished only as a man of letters and a civilian , and as a zealous member of the liberal party ever since his first entrance into public life at the period of the Restoration . " M. Guizot has made his way to distinction as an author and a writer for the daily press , and is more universally esteemed for his talents and erudition , than for his consistency as a statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as secretary general of the Abb6 Montesquien , the then Minister of the Interior , // 251 and he followed Louis XVIII . to Ghent during the Hundred Days . After the second Restoration , he held the office of secretary general in the department of Justice , and finally became a Counsellor of State under the ministry of M. Decazes , from whom he received the appointment of the censorship of the press . M. Guizot went out of office with his patron the Duc Decazes , and while he returned with new ardor to his literary pursuits , he gradually became identified in his political course with the liberal party , although it was impossible to obliterate the recollection of his anti-national opiuions and conduct during the early years of the Restoration . his lectures at the Sorbonne have imparted to him a European celebrity , especially the published ones on the History of Civilization in Europe and in France , which deserve to be better known , than they now are , in the United States . " M. Louis , a clerk to the parlia ient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of the Revolution , lie was obliged to take refuge in England during the Reign of Terror , but returned to France under the Consulate , and rose through various gradations of administrative duties to be Secretary in the department of Finance at the time of Napoleon 's downfall . He has twice held the same office since the second Restoration , but at other times has generally acted with the Opposition in the Chamber of Deputies . " Count Mol6 began his career as a political writer , and rose rapidly under Napoleon through various lesser offices to be at length Minister of Justice . Since the Restoration he has also been high in office , having held atone time the portfolio of the Marine . " Comte S*bastiani is , like Napoleon , a native of Corsica , and served his countryman , alternately in the camp and in embassies , with equal fidelity , distinction , and honor . Being elected a Deputy in 1819 , he displayed talents as a legislator not less remarkable than those which he had exhibited in diplomacy and war ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " M. Lafitte , at the epoch of the Revolution of the Three Days , was deemed the wealthiest banker in France , ' having risen by his own merits , from a clerkship in the house of the banker Perregaux , to be head of the commerce of Paris , and to hold eminent rank as an Opposition member of the Chamber of Deputies . We have seen the responsible part he took in the events of the Ibree Days ; and to him , more than to any other individual , was then ascribed the mnanagemsnt of the various measures by which the Doc d'Orl*ans was elevated to the throne . " M. Casimir P6rier was also a banker by profession , and extensively engaged in various departments of productive industry , which did not prevent his entering deeply into political affairs . The important stations occulsied by these two individuals in the sequel will give us occasion to speak of them more particularly at a proper time . " M. Dupin , previous to the Three Days , had been chiefly distinguished as an advocate in lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good will of the liberal party by the ability he displayed in the defence of persons accused of political offences , especially in the many trials , immediately consequent upon the second Restoration . Although attached , since 1819 , to the service of the Disc dOrleans , he manifested , it would seem , little readiness to participate in the more decided movements of the Three Days , and subjected himself to continual accusation of incisisnr and of lukewarmness in the cause of the Revolution . " M. Bignon began life in 1793 as a soldier , but after being s veral years in the army was transferred to the diplomatic service , in which , and in the performance of kindred administrative functions , he continued until the abdication of Napoleon . He is distinguished as an author and as a liberal Deputy of unimpeached attachment to constitutional principles . The successive issue of the French Revolution was followed , as all the world knows , by popular commotions in other parts of Europe . The first , and thus far the only , prosperous imitation of the glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of this Revolution , from its first stage , to the coronation of Prince Leopold as King of Belgium , is narrated with the same thoroughness of knowledge , and clearness of comprehension , which give so high a value to the history of affairs in France . The following brief sketch of the siege of Antwerp will not be unacceptable to the reader // " The King of Holland having distinctly refused to evacuate the citadel of Antwerp , and the forts and places dependent upon it , which the treaty was designed to affect ,  --  an English order in council made its appearance on the 7th of November , suspending all intercourse with Holland , and commanding the detention and capture of all ships belonging to that nation . The Moniteur of that date gave information that a like order had been issued in France . And at the same time the combined English and French fleets were despatched to the Scheldt . And these demonstrations producing no effect , the French army of the North , under the command of Marshal G6rard , passed the frontiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antwerp . In taking this step Louis Philippe expressly undertook not to occupy any of the fortifiedplaces of Belgium ,  --  but that , on the contrary , after attaining their object , the French troops would immediately retire upon the territory of France . " Marshal G6rard was accompanied by the Dukes of Orleans and Nemours , and followed by a numerous army organized and equipped with those irresistible means of sure success , which had characterized the expedition against Algiers . On the 17th Baron Chass* , who still commanded  --  the citadel of Antwerp , issued an order of the day , announcing his resolution to hold out the place to the last extremity . SL rnltaneously with the entrance of the French into Belgium , Prussia caused a numerous army of observation to assemble on the Maes , engaging to withdraw it when the French should withdraw . And thus at length the Belgian question , which had filled Europe with alarm for two years , openly assumed the threatening aspect of an impending European war . " By the 30th of November the French army was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only delicate point in the matter was to preserve the city of Antwerp from being subject to the fire of the citadel . To attain this object Marshal G6rard opened a negotiation with Baron Chass6 , which resulted in an understanding that the garrison would treat the city as neutral in the contest , on condition that the French abstained from availing themselves of the fortifications of the city in their hostile operations . This arrangement added greatly to the difficulties of the French , but was dictated by every consideration of honor and humanity . It is edifying to remark the tranquil civility of language employed in the summons to surrender and the reply . I hope , ' says G&amp;ard , ' to find you disposed to acknowledge the justice of my request ( for the possession of the citadel . ) If , contrary to my expectation , it should be otherwise , I am charged to apprise you that I must employ all the means at my disposal to occupy the citadel of Antwerp . ' To which Chass6 responded in the same courteous tone : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant received , I inform you that I shall not surrender the citadel of Antwerp , until after having exhausted all the means of defence at my disposal . ' Whereupon the parties proceeded to address each other in the more expressive language uttered at the cannon 's mouth . " The trenches were opened during the night of the 29th to the 30th , and the fire commen ed from the citadel at noon of the 30th . Amid great embarrassments from heavy rains and the local situation of the works under the fire of the citadel , every thing was completed by the 4th of December , on which day the French batteries opened with a tremendous discharge from eighty-two pieces of ordnance . All means of siege and attack , which modern art supplies , were now brought in requisition by the French , and to such effect that , on the 23d of December , General Chass6 signified his desire to stop the further effusion of blood . By the articles of capitulation the garrison , consisting of about four thousand men , became prisoners of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King of Holland should order the surrender of the forts of Lillo and Liefkenshoek , which , being independent of General Chass6 , could not be delivered up to him . When the French took possession of the citadel they found all the buildings within it a heap of ruins , and the soil every where ploughed up by shot and shells , indicating alike the skill of the besiegers. and the resolution of the garrison . The great object of their expedition being accomplished , the French treeps were immediately marched back to their country , leaving King William to digest this decisive step of his good allies , and to ponder upon the measures of coercion still employed by them on the water . " After this follows a minute and interesting sketch of the gallant but disastrous struggle of the Poles . The events of this uprising of an oppressed nation are generally familiar to our countrymen , who took a // lively interest in them at the time . But no history has heretofore been given us , combining so much research and method and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cushing . The notices of the members of the council , to whom was entrusted the administration of affairs , are very attractive .. " At the breaking out of the Revolution there was a Council of administration for Poland , consisting of Prince Lubecki , and six others , in whom the executive authority of the kingdom was vested . Although devoted to the Emperor by position or by principle , the Council sought , by temporizing with the insurgents , to gain the control of affairs . To this end they immediately associated with themselves some of the most prominent friends of the national interests , namely , the Princes Adam Czartoryski and Michael Radziwill , the Senator Kochanowski , Generals Pac and Chlopicki , end Julian Niemcewicz ; and shortly afterwards , by arrangement of Lubecki , his old companions in the Council were removed from it , and the Castellan Leo Dembowski , the Counts Ladislas Ostrowski and Gustavus Malachowski , and Joachim Lelewel were substituted in their place . ' " Of these distinguished men , Lelewel was an eminent scholatansi patriot , who , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became by his talents and zeal , the animatin spirit of the Revolution . Niemcewicz , also , was selected , not merely as possessing the warmest patriotism , and the merit of service under Kosciuszko , but as being the first name in Polish literature ; for the Poles on this occasion , like the French after the Three Days , were ' proud to do homage to intellectual cultivation and acknowedged intellectual fame , in the distribution of the duties and honors of the revolutionary government . " Czartoryski was the first nobleman of Poland , alike pre-eminent for his wealth , his rank , and his character . In regard to wealth , he was one of those gre at Polish proprietors , princes in fact as well as in name , whose estates covered : provinces , and who could equip whole squadrons from their own private resources . In rank , he ' claimed descent from royalty , through a long ' line of distinguished ancestry . Jn character he was a true Pole . At the last partition of Poland , he and his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he contracted an intimacy with Aleaander , which continued when the latter succeeded to the imperial authority , and exercised considerable influence over the political career of Czartoryski . At the urgent solicitation of Alexander he accepted of various appointments in the Russian administration , first as Ambassador to Turin , next as Minister of Foreign Affairs , and ' at the same time as Curator of the University of Wilna and commissioner for the establishment of schools in the Russian provinces of Poland . In ' all these offices , it was the aim and the good fortune of Czartoryski to preserve his fidelity to his country unshaken ' , at the same time that he performed his duty to the Emperor , in whose employment he served . Previous to the collision between Russia and Fran'ce he bad resigned his portfolio , and devoted himself to the improvement of his country through his connection with the University of Wilna , perceiving , perhaps , that a time was coming , when the duties of a minister of state would militate with the interests which he held most dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his constant endeavor to impress on the minds of all , the great truth , that the balance of power in Europe could only be maintained by the restoration of Poland . He accompanied Alexander to Paris in 1814 in order to effect this object ; so that probably much of the good ' feeling of Alexander towards Poland , and especially , the liberal constitution he gave the kingdom , may be attributed to Czartoryski 's persuasions . When he saw the disappointment of his hopes by the continued violation of the Charter , he broke off all his relations with the Russiangoverement , and was loud in his complaints concerning the wrongs done his country . When the Revolution commenced , he was residing on his estates at Pulawy , about eighteen leagues from Warsaw . He did not hesitate to embark his life and'fortune , in the cause of Poland , entering into the contest with a generosity of purpose and con'tinuin in it with a sJf-s*criflcing devotedness of patriotic virtue , which were above all praise . " Prince Michael Radziwill was in rank and possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of the last partition , to share in the glorious effort of Kosciuszko , he passed his early life in the fashionable pleasures of high life ; and thus it happened that , when Napoleon entered Wars* xv in 1806 , he was selected to be Chamberlain to the E *iperor . But Napoleon , with his VOL . V*. // accustomed penetration , soon discovered that young Radziwill was fitted for a higher sphere , and conferred on him the command of a Polish regiment in active service . Radziwill was greatly distinguished in several campaigns , until the political changes consequent on the fall of Napoleon , led him to seek retirement , in spite of the solicitations and flattering offers of Alexander . Subsequently he became a prominent member of the Polish Senate , where he signalized his love of country by opposing the course of Russian policy , and it was thus he became endeared to the Poles . Chlopicki began his career under Kosciuszko in the former struggle of the Poles for independence . Afterwards he entered the Polish Legion under Napoleon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which capacity he served in Spain . When Poland fell into the bands of Alexander , Chlopicki took umbrage at some one of those insulting expressions , which Constantine was continually addressing to the Polish army , and replying to the reproof of the Grand Duke , that he did not gain his rank , nor receive his decorations , on the parade ground , he demanded his discharge , arid firmly resisted all the instances of the Grand Duke arid the Emperor that he would resume his station , preferring honorable poverty and obscurity to the glitter of Russian servitude . His military reputation , and the independence of soul he had displayed , drew the eyes of the nation upon him at this crisis . " The great prominence acquired in the sequel by these individuals makes it proper they should be noticed thus , distinctly from the other members of the Council . At first the patriots gave the temporary command of the troops in Warsaw to General Pac ; but so soon as Chlopicki would consent to act , he was by general acclamation placed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his accession to the cause a point of extreme interest to the insurgents . " The martial operations in this war xviii be read with unflagging interest . The final catastrophe is among the most deplorable events in the history of national wo . But there is a just Providence , who will call oven a Russian despot to his reckoning . The attempts at reform and revolution in Spain are next related , followed by the commotions of Switzerland and Germany . We quote the concluding passage of this portion of the volume . " The Germany of Madame de Stael , a land of dreamy philosophy , of extravagant sentimentality , of genius lost in a misty atmosphere of transcendental ideas , exists no longer . Its people are thoughtful still , but they are corning to be more practical in their thoughtfulness , and to think on subjects of sublunary and immuediate interest . Germany has long possessed a literary unity , a common feeling created by the possession of a beautiful , a noble , an exalted common literature ; but the sentiment of political unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by a series of events affecting Germany almost as powerfully as did the Reformation , namely , the wars consequent on the French Revolution . Germany , ' it has been said , with her supineness ,  --  with her gentle infirmities , her almost useless virtues ,  --  with her aimless overflowing genius ,  --  with her vague cosmopolitanism-with her divided forms of religion , and her fruitless metaphysical speculations , ' - needed some resistless agency to clench and draw together her severed parts , ' and she found it in the mailed hand of Napoleon . Her inhabitants were united by common misfortune ; their reunion was cemented in their common blood ; they were trampled as it were into a community of national feeling . The Germans like the Italians , have now gained a definite aim , and they are moving OIl towards it slowly , but surely ; and that aim is the reconstruction of Germany ; not the Germany of the existing league , subject to the control of the King of Hungary or the Elector of Bradenburg , but a Germany of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , capable of playing its part efficiently in the affairs of Europe , and in the work of Europemin civilization . " The Politics of Great-Britain are of deeper interest to Americans than those of any other nation . The history of the passage of the Reform Bill must therefore attract more attention and excite a livelier interest // *255 than the rest of the work . We take the following extract without comment " Parliament re-assembled on the 6th of December ; and in the speech from the throne , now as before , the King recommended the reform-measure to most careful consideration , expressing an opinion that a speedy and satisfactory settlement of the question became , daily , of more pressing importance to the security of the State and to the contentment and welfare of the people . On the 12th of December , Lord John Russell once more introduced the Reform Bill , considerably modified and simplified , and so far changed that no reduction was to take place in the aggregate number of members of the House . It passed to a second reading on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of conciliation being exhibited on either side now than during the former debates . The Bill continued under discussion in the house , chiefly upon its details , until the 22d of March , when it passed to a third reading by a majority of 116 , an ( t the next day passed the House . It was taken up in the House of Lords on the 26th of March , and after debate was allowed a second reading on the 13th of April , by a majority of nine in its favor ; but on the 7th of May , upon a motion of amendment by Lord Lyndhurst , which the Ministers considered totally adverse to the Bill , they were left iii the minority , there being a majority of 35 for the motion of Lord Lyndhurst . " This result produced a crisis of the question , which had been long anticipated , and for which the Ministers and the country were prepared . The 1-louse of Lords , persisting in hostility to the Reform Bill , stood in the attitude of settled opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hereditary and the representative elements in the British constitution , the latter having the hearty concurrence of the King . Should the Lords he suffered to triumph in this way over the rest of the states of the Realm ? - lf the King pursued a course of misrule and oppression , the Commons  |p9ssessed  a constitutional check upon his authority in their power to withhold the supplies , if the Coniinons manifested a factious and seditious spirit ; the King had a constitutional remedy in his power to dissolve the House . In the event of a factious combination among a majority of the Lords to counteract the public wish , did the constitution afford no redress ? The Ministers conceived , and the nation inaintaiiied , that the remedy in such case lay in time royal prerogative for the creation of peers ; for if this remedy did not exist , then , as Lord Grey justly observed , they no longer had a government of Kings , Lords , and Commons , but were subject to a ( 10 mineering oligarchy . Accordingly , the Ministers advised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift the majority in the House of Lords to the ministerial side ; and in the event of his rejecting their advice , they tendered to him their resignations . The King , it was well known , was decidedly in favor of the Bill . It was equally well known , that he was averse to exercising the royal prerogative in such a contingency , as an act injurious to the dignity and independence of the Lords . He , therefore , accepted the resignation of Earl Grey and his colleagues ; and immediately sent for Lord Lyndhurat , and consulted with him on the means of extrication from the existing difficulty ; desiring Lord Lyndhurstto communicate with such persons as lie saw fit , with a view to the composition of a new ministry . Lord Lyndhurst repaired first to the Duke of Wellington , who declared that he did not want office , but that he was willing to make any sacrifice , to incur any obloquy , rather than desert the King at such a moment ; and if the necessities of public service required it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its advantage . Sir Robert Peel , however , distiIictly declared , that it was impossible for him to accept office on condition of carrying aui extensive reform in the representation , which the King declared to be the only terms upon hich he could make appointments . Nor was Sir Robert Peel alone in his conviction of the gross inconsistency of men doing that in office , which the day before they had opposed as fatal to the best interests of time country , and as a high-handed measure of revolutionary violence . It seemed , therefore , mere madness to attempt the construction of a cabinet of the anti-reform party ; to comisist only of its inferior members , and with a fierce and overpowering majority against it in the I-louse of Commons . " The question was put at rest by the energetic conduct of the House of Commons . On motion of Lord Ebrington , the House of Commons voted an address to the King , e xpressin , , their unabated confidence in the L te Ministers , and earnestly imploring him to call to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpaired in all its essential provisions , that Bill for the reform of the representation of the people , which bad recently passed the House . In the debates which , members of the House spoke in the strongest terms of rep- // Literary Notices . robation of the conduct of the Duke of Wellington , and others among his political friends , who could think of taking office on condition of supporting the Reform Bill , after the sentiments they had professed on the subject , and the solemn protest , which some of them had recorded upon the journals . Although the Duke of Wellington vindicated his own motives , by resting his conduct upon a principle of uncalculating loyalty towards his sovereign , and of anxiety to relieve the King from the necessity of stretching the royal prerogative in the appointment of perhaps a hundred peers in order to carry through the Reform Bill , yet , after these proceedings in the House , he became sctisfled that it was totally impossible for him or his friends to administer the government , and he so informed the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the necessity of recalling Earl Grey and his friends to the head of affairs , and of course giving to them authority , if occasion required , to make a large cr ation of peers . The reinstatement of the Whig Ministers was announced on the 18th of May , a week , only , after their displacement ; and on the 18th , Earl Grey moved for the resumption of the Bill on the Monday following , announcing that it was the intention of the cabinet to carry it through unimpaired and at all events , although he refused to explain his intention as to the creation of peers . At the same time it was well understood , that such would be the consequence , if the Lords persisted in their opposition to the measure . Indeed , a special request , on the part of the King , was addressed to the Opposition Peers , inviting them to abstain from further opposition to the Bill . And the greater portion of them accordingly absented themselves from the House , the Earl of Harewood , one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of evils , and , in adopting it , he acted by compulsion , and with a feeling that he could never again vote in that House independently as belonged to his constitutional rank in the state . But in truth the Lords had only themselves to thank for the humiliating position in which they were placed . Burke observes that , If there is any one eminent criterion ; which , above all the rest , distinguishes a wise government from an administration weak and imprudent , it is this ,  --  Well to know the best time and manner of yielding what it is impossible to keep  --  and the remark applies most emphatically to the Lords , who , by gracefully conceding what they could not retain , might have substituted the influence of popularity for the direct exercise of power . But they absurdly chose to incur the odium of ineffective resistance to the measure , in addition to the inevitable evils of the measure itself ; thus holding up their very weakness as a target for the attacks of the press and the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Lords met with no serious obstacle . Some amendments were introduced , which were concurred in by the Commons ; and on the 7th of June , 1832 , the royal assent was given to the Bill . The irish and Scottish Reform Bills passed also , of course , in the wake of the English Bill ; and thus at length was accomplished this great change in the representation of Great-Britain and Ireland . It is no part of our purpose to follow the ordinary public business of the year . Suffice it to say that the existing Parliament was dissolved on the 3d of December , in order to the election of a reformed Parliament . " The recent settlement of Greece , and another brief glance at the state of things in France , with some concluding remarks , fill the remainder of the book . We have already given our opinion , in general terms , of the merit of this work . It belongs , in our opinion , to the first class of works of research , and will stand high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful industry , and is to be relied on as a work of authority . its style is , in the main , excellent . There is sometimes a tendency to wordiness , which injures the effect of description or reflection , by overloading it with cumbrous phraseology . A little exercise of the critical pruning-knife would remove this overluxuriance , and give the book a classical form as well as historical value . We hope a new edition will be called for ; and , if so , that Mr. Cushing will have it printed in better style , and on better paper . The appearance of the work is a serious obstacle to its success . We know several individuals who have been hindered from the pleasure of reading it , by its somewhat shabby exterior , and too crowded page.
