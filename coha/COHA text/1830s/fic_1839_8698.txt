The writer of this comedy has endeavored to show , that our own country furnishes ample materials for the drama , without perpetually resorting to foreign nations for characters , customs and sentiments , which have frequently little or no resemblance among ourselves , and in their public exhibition are often highly pernicious . He has also attempted to demonstrate , that dramatic interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every day circumstances , without the aid of wild and extravagant incidents , so often relied on for effect in the modern drama ; and he has been particularly anxious to prove , that profane and obscene language are by no means necessary to give interest and piquancy to this form of composition . Whether these objects have been even partially accomplished , is not for the author to determine . His aim has been rather to indicate what might be successfully done by others , more skilled than himself , in dramatic writing . Besides the mere gratification of employing a few leisure hours , he acknowledges one motive which prompted him to the task , and that is to hold up to ridicule the despicable arts of demagoguism , if the expression may be pardoned , which are now practised to such a frightful extent in our country , and which , if not rebuked in every legitimate mode , will most assuredly endanger our free institutions . If the public should happen to be amused by the trifle which is now presented to them , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author will be abundantly compensated . Main text ACT I. AN APARTMENT IN A COUNTRY TAVERN . SCENE I. Enter Mr. and Mrs. Roundtree . Mrs. Roundtree . Mrs. Roundtree You 're an obstinate , contrary man , Mr. Roundtree ,  --  that you are . Our poor dear Kate has only been at home three days from school , and there 's nothing but constant grumbling about the trifling expense of her edication . It is barbarous treatment in you  --  and so it is . Major Roundtree . Roundtree Trifling expense , did you say ?  --  Why a whole year 's clear profit of the Hickory-Tree Tavern , would hardly pay the huzzy 's bills . And then what 's the good of it all ?  --  She went away a snug tidy country girl , ready to put her hand to any and every thing ,  --  could either make a pudding or mend a stocking ,  --  and now she 's come back a town flirt , with her head cram 'd full of aristocratic notions , about botany , natural philosophy , and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house work , instead of sending her away to a Whig town to be corrupted . Mrs. Roundtree . Mrs. Roundtree Stuff !  --  I tell you , Kate was quite an awkward thing when she left home , and had n't a particle of larning except what she got from Mr. Supine . And what is she now but quite an accomplish 'd young lady . Does'nt she talk French ,  --  play on the piany ,  --  dance like a top ,  --  draw and paint pretty landscapes , and understand all about the natur ' of flowers ? What more would you want ? I 'm astonished at your ignorance , Mr. Roundtree . Major R. Roundtree Ignorance indeed !  --  You forget that I 'm a county court magistrate , and have read the greater part of the Virginia Justice ; a Major of Militia , and have studied considerable of military tactics ; keeper of the Hickory-Tree Ordinary , and know how to cast up accounts ; and last , though not least , Post Master under the Federal Government , and a leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least three newspapers in order to keep my ideas continually bright and perpendicular on politics . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree Aye , politics ,  --  forever politics !  --  for my part I wish there was no such thing in creation ; and as to newspapers , I should never care to see another come into the house ; they 're nothing but litter and lies . If you 'd only send off these lazy louts of the neighborhood who come here to listen to the newspapers and swill your liquor at free cost , we should hear less of poor Kate 's bills for edication . Mr. R. Roundtree Why , Dolly , you talk as if you had lived a century before the flood . Do n't you know that newspapers are the very sunshine of democracy ,  --  the people 's spy glasses , by which they find out those muskrat politicians who are continually boring under the constitution ? Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree No , I do n't know any thing about it ; and what 's more I do n't want to know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must let our dear Kate alone ,  --  for if you do n't , I 'll raise this house about your head , depend upon it . She 's the only chick and child we have , and she shall be a lady  --  I 'm determined she shall . Mr. R. Roundtree Odds bother it ! my dear ,  --  do you talk as loud and strong as all that to a Major of Militia and an honorable Justice of the Peace ? Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree Yes , I do  --  and what is more , I would say so to Andrew Jackson himself , if he was present in this room . I am not to be frightened by your militia Majors , and your gentlemen justices of the peace . I know too much of them . Mr. R. Roundtree Come ,  --  come , Dolly ,  --  moderate your dander a little . Ca n't a man complain of having his purse lightened by dancing masters and French teachers , without raising such a clatter ? I can tell you one thing ,  --  if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her husband , if she ever gets one , will wish her  --  Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree Hush ! hush ! none of your barbarous speeches . No husband but a brute could ever wish harm to the poor child . You 're are an unnatural father , Mr. Roundtree , to talk so . Supine . Supine ( Entering . ) Good morrow , Major Roundtree . Mrs. Roundtree I am your very obedient servant . A little matrimonial breeze , I perceive , springing up this morning ,  --  infelicitas matrimonii ! ( Takes snuff . ) Mr. Round . Roundtree A breeze do you call it Mr. Supine !  --  Odds bother it ! if you had not stepped in at the moment , it might have blown into a hurricane . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree It 's all his fault , Mr. Supine . Mr. Roundtree , you know , is very well to do in the world , and has scrap 'd together a smart little property , as one might say , and yet he begrudges a few worthless dollars to make our Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoking , Mr. Supine ? I know you do . Supine . Supine Ah ! my dear madam , you speak of my old pupil Miss Catharine ! I had heard only yesterday of her safe and happy return to the domestic roof ,  --  and accordingly have put my locomotive faculties into exercise this morning , to pay her my respectful and affectionate homage . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree Mr. Supine you will be delighted to see her ; I am sure you will . You 've no idea how Kate is changed . Mr. R. Roundtree Indeed Mr. Supine you have no idea how Kate is changed ! Sup . Supine Happy parents to have such a daughter ;  --  felices parentes !  --  It was I who first taught her infant mind to expand ,  --  her young ideas how to shoot . It was I who first imparted to her the divine mysteries of the parts of speech , the various uses and attributes of the noun , pronoun , adjective , verb , adverb , participle , preposition , interjection and conjunction . I , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to her path , and I doubt not that she has fully justified my early prognostications . Excellentissima puella ! Mr. R. Roundtree ( aside . ) He 's taught her the parts of speech to some purpose  --  for the huzzy 's almost as glib on the tongue as her mother . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree You shall see her Mr. Supine  --  you shall see her this moment . She 'll be quite charm 'd to meet with her old master . Here , Jenny  --  Jenny .  --  ( calls . ) You ca n't think how the child has improved , Mr. Supine . ( Jenny enters . ) Go tell your Miss Catharine that Mr. Supine , her old master , has called to see her . ( Exit Jenny. )  --  Mr. Supine , Kate has got by heart all the nat'ral sciences ; she paints in water colors , and makes a rose look for all the world just like a rose . And , besides , she dances so charmingly  --  I wish you could see her dance . There 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can hold a candle to her ,  --  not even Miss Clara Worthington ,  --  and Miss Clara you know is one of our standards . Mr. Round . Roundtree Standard indeed ! Her father is one of the staunchest federal whigs in the whole country ,  --  and I want none of my flesh and blood to copy after such folks . Enter Jenny . Jenny . Jenny Miss Catharine say , mam , she be glad if the gemman come into her sitting room . ( Exit . ) Mr. Round . Roundtree Sitting room indeed !  --  Another new-fangled town notion ; as if all the rooms in the house were not made for sitting in . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree Hold your tongue , Mr. Roundtree !  --  Would you have our Kate to be made a gazing stock for every idle customer who comes to the house ? Besides , how could she stow away her nice little trumpery ,  --  her port-folio ,  --  her sweet scented bottles ,  --  her drawings ,  --  her red morocco work-box and gilt annuals ,  --  unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , Mr. Supine !  --  I 'll show you the way to Kate 's parlor . Sup . Supine I follow you , madam . ( Exeunt Sup . and Mrs. R. ) Roundtree . Roundtree Solus . Was there ever the like to this ? Why I 'm of no more use in my own house , than a fifth wheel would be to a wagon . If I 'm to be hen-pecked at this rate , I shall have to resign my commission as a field officer ; for if I do nt , the rank and file will laugh at me on parade . Odds bother it !  --  it will never answer for a leader of the democracy to be led himself by a termagant . I must spunk up a little , and teach Mrs. Roundtree that it 's rather a dangerous experiment to be trying on the breeches of a militia major . A horn blows without . Ha ! that 's the post-boy just arrived with the papers , and I must go and assort the mail . Our election for Congress-man comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , General Fairweather , stands on sure ground . These whigs are mighty slippery fellows , and require sharp watching . ( Exit . ) SCENE II . ( Changes to a parlor  --  Catharine Roundtree in fashionable costume seated at a table sketching in her port-folio  --  the table covered with books , cologne bottles , work box , &c.,; &c.;  --  Jenny in attendance . Catharine . Catharine Jenny , do you think Clara Worthington knows that I have returned home ? Jenny . Jenny Yes , Miss ; I 'll be bound she do . Catharine . Catharine Has she called lately , in her carriage , to inquire after me ? Jenny . Jenny Oh yes , Miss ; she call very often indeed . Miss Clara 's a mighty nice young lady . Black and white , gentle and simple , all like her . Cath . Catharine How did Mr. Supine hear of my arrival ? Jenny . Jenny La , Miss Cath'rine , I reckon the whole neighborhood has hearn of it by this time . How could such a thing be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much land and servants as Miss Clara , you 'd take the shine off her . Cath . Catharine Why do you think so ? Jenny . Jenny Becase I thinks you are more beautifuller than she ,  --  and I reckon you 've got a heap of knowledge since you went to town . Cath . Catharine Ah ! here comes Mr. Supine and my mother  --  you may go until I call for you .  --  ( Exit Jenny . ) Enter Supine and Mrs. Roundtree . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree There she is , Mr. Supine . Kate , my dear , Mr. Supine has called to-day expressly to see you . Sup . Supine I have great pleasure in paying my respects to my former pupil . Only two years have elapsed since she left us , a blooming little rustic of fifteen  --  and now , like a full blown rose , she has expanded into the ripe dimensions of lovely womanhood .  --  Approaches Catharine , and upon her rising , kisses her hand . Cath . Catharine Oh , Mr. Supine !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naughty little school girl who once trembled at the sight of your ferule , has become quite a passable young lady ? Sup . Supine Or , as some happy swain would express it , altogether irresistible . Ah , Mrs. Roundtree ! if so fair a vision as this , had only crossed my path some twenty years since , I should have been tempted to desert the unfruitful but independent condition of a bachelor . Renuntiavissem coelibatum . Cath . Catharine That is to say , Mr. Supine , if the vision had been satisfied with your addresses . But , pray sir , remember that the school-master 's rod is not the arrow of Cupid . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree ( Aside . ) How prettily she talks ! Supine . Supine Oh no ! not the arrow of Cupid strictly  --  but , my dear Miss Catharine , you must understand , that when the schoolmaster 's rod was laid aside , I felt myself well qualified , that is twenty years since , to exchange glances with all the pretty girls of the neighborhood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some execution upon their innocent hearts , yet some how or other I always contrived to keep safe and sound myself ,  --  salvus et validus . ( Snuffs . ) Cath . Catharine But you think if you had only seen Miss Roundtree then , as you see her now , you would certainly have fallen a victim . Indeed , Mr. Supine , I almost wish you were twenty years younger ,  --  for after all there must be some pleasure in having a beau . Is'nt there , mother ? Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Why , my dear , its not to be denied that courtship has its sweets with young persons ,  --  but then when you come to take on yourself the cares of matrimony , you will find that all is not gold that glitters , my child ,  --  that you will . Cath . Catharine I am sure , madam , you have always had your own way  --  and what more could any reasonable woman desire ?  --  I think I should be very happy if my  --  my husband that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  besides being all in mind and person I could wish , would always humor my little whims ,  --  obey my commands ,  --  which of course should be very gentle ,  --  and would think and act just as I thought and acted myself . Would'nt that be charming , Mr. Supine ? Sup . Supine Very charming indeed , Miss Catharine . There is only one drawback to it , and that is , that it is altogether impossible . It is not in the nature of things  --  natura rerum . Cath . Catharine That is always the way with you old folks !  --  When youthful fancy sketches some bright and blissful dream for the future , you come with your wise maxims and your cold experience to whisper their chilling breath upon the enchantment . Walks aside as if musing . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree ( Aside to Supine . ) Does'nt she talk very sweetly , Mr. Supine ? has'nt she made rapid improvement ? Sup . Supine Oh , very rapid improvement indeed , madam  --  so rapid , that peradventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without your knowing a word of it . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Runaway ! Sup . Supine Yes , madam ,  --  runaway , to the end of all education ,  --  the end of all novels and romances , and of most poems ,  --  the end of all our early labors and toils , ( except with such as have philosophy enough to resist , ) the end of all imaginary sorrows ,  --  and too often the beginning of all real ones . I mean runaway to matrimony , madam . Cath . Catharine Pray , mother , what is it Mr. Supine is saying about matrimony ? With old bachelors it is not generally a favorite theme . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Why he only means , my dear , that edication qualifies a young lady to get married at a suitable time . I hope you would never think of such a thing unless it was entirely proper . Cath . Catharine Oh never , madam ,  --  never ,  --  unless it was entirely proper , I assure you . Mrs. Round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Supine ca n't you ask some questions about her larning ?  --  would'nt you like to see how much she 's improved since she went to the old school house ? Sup . Supine By all means , madam .  --  I will examine Miss Catharine with the highest satisfaction . But here comes Major Roundtree , and some one with him . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree As I live it is Jemmy Chipps , dressed in his Sunday clothes . Kate , do n't you remember Jemmy ?  --  The school boys used to plague him about being in love with you . Cath . Catharine Oh , I remember Jemmy very well . ( Enter Chipps and Major Roundtree ; the latter with newspapers in his hand . ) Round . Roundtree Kate , your old school fellow , Jemmy Chipps , has called to see you . Give him a welcome , girl ; as for me , I 'll sit down here quietly and read the news . ( Seats himself behind and reads . ) Chipps  --  Chipps ( bows . ) Sarvant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that used to be ? Cath . Catharine Do n't you remember your old school mate , Mr. Chipps ? Chipps . Chipps I 'll be dog 'd if I should ever have known you in creation . Is it possible this is little Kate Roundtree , that I used to go to school with ? Do n't you remember , Miss Kate , I used to tote your basket , and help you over the fence ; and sometimes almost break my neck hunting after wild flowers for you ? Cath . Catharine I remember it very well . I believe , Mr. Chipps , you left Mr. Supine 's school two years at least before me . Chipps . Chipps Yes I did , and have been at hard work ever since  --  trying to make a living . Let 's see ,  --  its been about two years coming next month , that you left home for town ; and many a day since that , has I thought on you , notwithstanding I was dubious whether you cared a pin for me . But you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was then . You used to wear a nice calico frock and clean white apron , and did'nt seem as if you were above common folks . Now , you are dressed in all sorts of finery and fashion ; and instead of calling me Jemmy , as you used to do ,  --  which sounded so sweet ,  --  you call me Mr. Chipps !  --  Ah , Miss Kate , I 'm afeard you 're about to turn lady . Cath . Catharine Jemmy , why should there be any thing so shocking in being a lady ? Chipps . Chipps Oh nothing at all , except that your father and I are true blue democrats . We are the people 's men , and entirely agin those folks who set themselves above the rest of human natur ' . I would'nt have you to be a lady , Miss Kate , in the strictest sense of the word , for the world . Cath . Catharine Well , Jemmy , I certainly did not intend to give you offence , and had I expected your visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean white apron . Chipps , Chipps ( aside . ) I 'll be dog 'd , if , with all her finery , she do n't look mighty smart and sweet , any how . Sup . Supine Jemmy , I believe that when under my preceptorship the maximum of your attainments was reading , writing , and arithmetic ; in neither of which did you ever excel . Since then , you have either been tacked to the plough-tail , or have delved at the hoe ; and I should , therefore , consider you a very incompetent judge of modes , manners , and customs . You are not exactly , sir , an arbiter elegantiarum . Do you understand ? Chipps . Chipps Understand ? Oh yes  --  just as well as I understand Indian , or any other outlandish gibberish . Now , Mr. Supine , if you will only poke a little of your larning at Miss Kate , I will listen for all the world as if I understood every thing about it myself . ( Aside . ) I 'll be dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Supine . Supine Oh yes , yes  --  by all means . Mrs. Roundtree did me the honor to make the same request . Well , my dear Miss Catharine , how many languages , pray , were you taught at the female seminary ? Cath . Catharine Languages !  --  why let me see . My mother tongue , Mr. Supine , you know , I acquired under your superintendence . Well , besides that , I have studied the French language and the language of flowers . Sup . Supine The language of flowers !  --  that I believe is altogether modern . I suppose we may call it the lingua florum . Chipps . Chipps I 'll be dog 'd if ever I have hearn of such a language as that before . The beasts and birds , I know , carries on a sort of conversation ; but as to a rose and lily talking to one another , I should as soon believe that my grandmother did'nt belong to the female sect . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Jemmy , you hav'nt patience . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The language of flowers is a beautiful mode of communication , and is founded upon some real or fancied resemblance between the flowers themselves and the passions or feelings they are used to represent . For instance  --  if you , Mr. Supine , should present me with a red tulip , I should regard it as a declaration of love , and would return you a white rose-bud with an ice-plant : these would signify that the object of your admiration was much too young to love an old beau ; and thus , you see , unpleasant explanations would be saved , as well as pen , ink and paper . Chipps , Chipps ( aside . ) I 'll be dog 'd if she has'nt treed the old fellow up a gum . Sup . Supine Very fine  --  very fine , Miss Catharine  --  argumentum ad hominem . Cath . Catharine And as to you , Mr. Chipps , if you were to send me the tulip , I should probably give in return a piece of pitch pine , by which you would understand that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chipps . Chipps But I 'll be dog 'd , Miss Kate , if you had'nt as well wait until you are ax 'd . I confess that I felt a very considerable hankering after you , about the time that I finished my schooling ; but I do n't think , some how or other , that at present you would suit me . Cath . Catharine That is very probable , Jemmy . I do not think I should suit you at all . But come , let me show you my Album . Chipps . Chipps Album ! What is that , Mr. Supine. ? Sup . Supine Why in the lingua latina , album means white . Cath . Catharine It is a young lady 's repository of precious thoughts and beautiful sentiments , either selected from good authors , or , if original , generally the productions of friends  --  or  --  lovers . Will you write in it , Jemmy ? Chipps . Chipps Write !  --  not I indeed . Mr. Supine said when I was at school that I could never make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catharine Well , then , let me show you my herbarium . Chipps . Chipps Herbarium !  --  What is that , Mr. Supine ? Sup . Supine Let 's see . In the lingua latina , Herbarium must mean a gatherer of herbs . Cath . Catharine It is used by students of botany to preserve flowers and plants in their living form and color . Here , for example , is a specimen of the Datura Stramonium  --  or thorn apple . Chipps , Chipps ( peeping into the book . ) I 'll be dog 'd if that is any thing but common jimson weed . Thorn apple indeed ! Cath . Catharine Mr. Chipps , you have never studied the delightful science of botany . The datura belongs to the class pentandria , having five stamens , and the order monogynia or one pistil . See , here is the corolla ! Chipps . Chipps One pistol !  --  who ever heard the like of that ? Just now the flowers were said to talk like men and women ; now it seems they carry pistols in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of larning . Sup . Supine Miss Catharine is a very apt scholar ;  --  docilis discipula . ( Snuffs . ) Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Oh , Mr. Supine , Kate has improved so much ! Sup . Supine Indeed , madam , I feel in her presence as if I had only been looking at the gilt binding of nature 's volume , whilst she has been peeping into its divine interior . Roundtree , who during the preceding dialogue has been seated at the back part of the stage , attentively engaged with the newspapers , suddenly starts up and advances to the front . Round . Roundtree News !  --  news !  --  Dolly , here is good news ! Let 's read the whole paragraph from the " Democratic Star . " published in our country town . Here it is . ( Reads . ) " We have the pleasure to state , that General Fairweather , our representative in the last Congress , is now on a visit to the democracy of the County . He has visited most of the precincts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is firm in the good cause , and faithful in his allegiance to the ruling powers . Notwithstanding the federal whig aristocratic opposition , we count with certainty upon his re- election . " Dolly , my dear , we may look out for the General every moment . Take a peep at the pantry , and have the kitchen put in order for a little extra cooking . Jemmy , do you tell the neighbors , and especially our friends Slang , Bangall , and Rowdie , to come over , and lets give our Congressman a real jollification . Mr. Supine , I fear that for some time past you have been rather back-sliding from the true democratic faith ; but come and take a horn nevertheless . I must go myself and help to get things in readiness . ( Exit . ) Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Always the way .  --  Nothing but politics ,  --  politics . I am sure I 'm heartily sick of it . Cath . Catharine Mother you must treat the General very kindly , and by and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree Well , my dear , I suppose that our Congressman ought to be civilly treated  --  and even with attention . ( Exit . ) Sup . Supine A backslider from the true democratic faith , eh !  --  Errans in publicis rebus . ( Snuffs . ) Jemmy it is time for us to go . Miss Catharine , I am your very obedient humble servant . ( Exit . ) Chipps . Chipps Miss Kate , your very obedient humble servant . ( Imitates Supine awkwardly  --  bows and exit . ) Cath . Catharine ( alone . ) And so we may expect a visit from General Fairweather , the father of Henry ! Why am I thrown into such a flutter at the bare mention of the name ? Indeed I do not know . I am sure I would not whisper my thoughts to any one , and yet I will not deny that I should be quite as well pleased to see the young gentleman as the old one . Heigh ho ! what a strange world this is !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , whilst my dad is of opinion that he is ruined in purse , and I utterly spoiled by my city education . Let me think !  --  I suppose there would be no harm in trying to win the good graces of the honorable Mr. Fairweather . He and my father agree so well in politics , perchance they may agree hereafter in other things . He 's a widower , I am informed , and on that account may be more easily won by a girl 's attentions . I fervently hope , however , he may not fall in love with me ;  --  that would never do . I would rather his affection should prove a little more paternal . Mrs. Roundtree re-enters in haste . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Kate ,  --  Kate my dear ,  --  here 's Mr. Worthington 's carriage standing at the door , and a letter for you from Miss Clara . I thought Miss Clara would come or send over soon ;  --  she 's a kind , dear-hearted creature , just like her mother was . Cath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My Dear Miss Catharine ,  --  I did not hear of your happy return home until this morning , and should have hastened to welcome you , but Papa expects a visit from General Fairweather , which obliges me to remain at home . I have , therefore , sent the carriage , with the earnest request that you will not permit it to return empty . To-morrow is election day , at your house , and I trust you will be willing to escape from the tumult , even if you had no other inducement to visit your ever affectionate friend , Clara Worthington . " Dear Miss Clara , you remember , mother , was my schoolmate at Mr. Supine 's ; and although many of the scholars thought her proud , and called her one of the great folks , and by such like terms of reproach  --  to me she was ever gentle and kind . Well , what say you  --  must I go ? Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Go ! yes , by all means . I 've no notion of your being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow , and raise such a clatter as to frighten people out of their wits . No , my dear ; go and see Miss Clara . She 's the society for you to keep . She 'll see at once that you 're a lady , just like herself . Cath . Catharine I will take your advice ; and as to dad , if he should disapprove , I must leave the matter to be settled between you and him in my absence . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Never mind  --  never mind  --  leave that to me . I 'll manage the militia major . Get ready directly , and slip into the carriage whilst he is giving orders about the General . ( Exit . ) Cath . Catharine ( alone . ) My mother , with all her other good qualities , has excellent nerves ; and I have sometimes thought , from my buoyant spirits and a certain degree of perseverance which belongs to me , that her daughter was somewhat similarly constituted . Latterly , however , I have felt something like timidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I find myself frequently sighing without precisely understanding the cause . Let me see ,  --  General Fairweather will spend the night at Mr. Worthington 's , and I shall probably become well acquainted with him . May I not win so far his good opinion , that , if perchance I might happen hereafter to be introduced as a family connection , he would not blush to own me . I 'll begone directly . ( Exit . ) ACT II . SCENE I. OUTSIDE OF THE HICKORY TREE TAVERN . Enter General Fairweather and Henry . Gen'l Fairweather . General Fairweather We have made a good ride , today Henry ,  --  and here we are , safe , at the old Hickory Tree , kept by my worthy personal and political friend , Major Roundtree . The Major was a host in himself at the last election . He is one of your out and out thorough-going fellows ,  --  and when once fairly in motion is altogether irresistible . Henry . Henry Fairweather A valuable hand at electioneering , I have no doubt , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is Catharine 's dwelling ! Gen'l F. General Fairweather It is said that he has at least thirty or forty voters in this precinct , completely at his disposal ,  --  and , by the by , Henry , I believe from what I hear , I shall probably stand in need of them . Whiggery has made sad havoc of late in the district . Henry . Henry Fairweather Do you think , sir , it augurs well for the republic , or speaks loudly in praise of self-government , that one man should govern forty so easily ? Gen'l F. General Fairweather That is precisely the question which a young book-worm , green in the knowledge of mankind , would be likely to ask . Do n't you know , that these notions of human equality are mere empty speculations , and that we are obliged to take men , not as we would have them to be , but as we find them in reality ? Henry . Henry Fairweather But I thought you were one of those politicians , who profess unbounded confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as no less than moral treason to doubt that our free government will endure forever . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Like all young theorists , Henry , you have lived not quite long enough to know , that upon most subjects men carry about them two opinions  --  one for the public , and another for their own closets or private circles . I do not say all men , for there are some fool-hardy enough to come out with their real sentiments , and the consequence is , that they are generally laid flat on their backs . A man who would pass along the highway and call the first traveller a knave ,  --  the second a fool ,  --  and the third a thief ,  --  would most likely be thrown into a ditch , or have his cranium decently fractured , although in every instance he might probably speak the truth . You must learn to chime in with men 's humors , prejudices , and delusions . When any advantage is to be gained , flatter them ; and remember never to offend , unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry . Henry Fairweather Your opportunities , sir , have enabled you to understand these things , but I always thought , myself , that honesty was the best policy . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Oh yes ,  --  honesty is an excellent thing , in its way ,  --  and is doubtless very essential in all private transactions . All men profess to hold it in great respect , especially those who have very little or none of it themselves . In public affairs , however , there is such a thing as being honest overmuch . Henry . Henry Fairweather If I were a statesman , sir , it appears to me I should aim at the public good , and make it my governing motive . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Very true . A statesman should take care of the public , and for so doing the public should take care of him . In these degenerate days , a man can not be expected to labor for nothing , and find himself in the bargain . True charity , my son , always begins at home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for society at large , as we do by first providing pretty well for ourselves . But this is a subject , I perceive , upon which you are yet to be informed , and which , therefore , can not interest you much . I desire your attention to a different matter . Henry . Henry Fairweather Which you think will be more interesting . I am all attention , sir . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Within a mile of this place lives my old friend Worthington , of whom you have heard me speak . I promised to reach his house to-night ; but on reflection it would be better to tarry with Roundtree until after the election . Worthington is an inveterate Whig , and possibly some of the Democracy might take fire at our intimacy . I have , therefore , concluded , so soon as you have made your toilet , to send you in my stead , with a note of apology . Henry . Henry Fairweather Well , sir , that is reasonable enough . Gen'l F. General Fairweather But I have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as I confess it induced me to send to town for you and to take you on this electioneering campaign . Worthington is a man of family and wealth , and has an only daughter , who I am told , is beautiful and accomplished . Henry . Henry Fairweather And you wish me , I presume , to fall in love with her ;  --  but love , you know , sir , is an involuntary passion . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Involuntary indeed !  --  I wonder if you found that doctrine in Blackstone . Love , I suppose , is a species of involuntary homicide ,  --  a sudden killing by accident !  --  Well , why may not accident and thirty thousand dollars bring you to the feet of Miss Worthington ? Marry first , and love will come afterwards . Henry . Henry Fairweather I confess , sir , I regret to hear such sentiments from such a source . Suppose , for argument 's sake , my affections were placed upon another  --  could you expect me to transfer them so suddenly ? Gen'l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of argument , what I hope is not true . I trust that hitherto you have been too diligent in your studies , to allow attendance on the court of Cupid . Now , indeed , as you have just obtained your law license , it might not be amiss to take out a matrimonial one also , with the approbation of the young lady I have named to you . Henry . Henry Fairweather But , sir , is it possible you could desire a family alliance with Mr. Worthington  --  an influential Whig  --  or , as you would be pleased to call him , a Federalist ? Have you not denounced that party , as every thing odious and detestable ,  --  as bank-bought traitors , and enemies to republican government ? Gen'l F. General Fairweather Pshaw !  --  Hav'nt I already told you , that every man ,  --  every politician , at least ,  --  has , upon most subjects , two opinions ?  --  I grant you , that Mr. A. B. , for example , may be a scoundrel in politics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Worthington was my classmate at college ,  --  I know him well ,  --  and he has less of the corrupt dross of humanity about him than any man I ever knew . As to his political heresies , he may be honest in entertaining them ,  --  but it is necessary , nevertheless , to hold them up to public hatred , or else , how is it possible for our party to get along ? Henry . Henry Fairweather Your party , if you please , sir . As for me , I will never belong to any party whose creed would confound all distinction between public profligacy and private virtue ; or whose principles would rebuke dishonesty among individuals and yet tolerate and applaud it in governments . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Very sentimental , truly !  --  Well , I would thank you to say nothing about politics to Miss Clara . Look at the girl herself , and decide , if a fine young lady , and thirty thousand dollars in the bargain , would'nt be quite comfortable . ( Cato enters with baggage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage is secured , and inform Major Roundtree of our arrival . Cato . Cato Yes , sir . Gen'l F. General Fairweather And have Henry 's horse saddled in an hour . Cato . Cato Yes , sir . ( Goes into the house . ) Gen'l F. General Fairweather You must see the girl this night ,  --  and , having seen her once , I doubt not you will be sufficiently anxious to repeat the visit . Henry . Henry Fairweather I do not fear to encounter her , sir . Every young man must be prepared to meet the archery of the other sex , whether it consists in mental and personal charms , or , what is of no less consideration in the present age , a valuable stock of goods and chattels . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Spoken like a lad of spirit ! ( Enter Roundtree from the house . ) Ah , my dear Major , I 'm rejoiced to see you . Maj. Round . Roundtree My dear General , welcome to the Hickory Tree precinet , You have done well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little before the election . We want stirring up . These wicked Whigs have been undermining us by spreading false rumors . Who is this youngster ? Gen'l F. General Fairweather My son . Round . Roundtree A chip of the old block , I 'll warrant . My boy , give us your hand . I hope , General , you have taught him to be a good democrat ;  --  for some how or other , I find these youngsters when they return from college , or even from our common academies , generally tainted with the confounded aristocratic notions of modern Whiggery . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Major , upon my conscience I believe it is so . I have had my son reading law for some time past , and I want him thoroughly indoctrinated in the genuine principles of democracy . Round . Roundtree Reading law !  --  Why , confound me , if that is'nt the very worst way in the world to make a good democrat of him . Do n't you observe that these young lawyers are almost to a man against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen'l F. General Fairweather That 's rather a perplexing question , Major  --  but I suppose young minds are apt to be poisoned by certain doctrines not very favorable to democracy , which are found in English law books . Round . Roundtree Aye ,  --  and daughters are apt to be spoilt too by the trash they pick up at city boarding schools . My Kate ,  --  no , you do n't remember Kate , General , for I sent her to school just before the last Congress election ,  --  Kate , as I was saying , instead of coming home in holiday times to see her mam and dad ,  --  what must she do but gad about with rich folks , to learn fashionable airs and refinement , as they call it . I 've one consolation left , however ,  --  it was all the old woman 's fault . Henry , Henry Fairweather ( to Gen. F. ) I will retire , sir , and make preparation for my evening visit . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Very true ;  --  we will excuse you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my son intends going a step further this afternoon , but I shall myself remain under your comfortable roof . Some of my constituents may be passing , and may desire to know what the last Congress has been doing . ( Aside . ) By the by , it would be a very puzzling inquiry . Mr. Round . Roundtree Your son wo n't leave us , General , surely . I 've just sent out to scrape up half a dozen neighbors  --  true blues ,  --  to welcome your coming ;  --  and I 'm resolved we sha'nt part until we crack a few bottles together . I 'm a tavern keeper , it is true , General ,  --  but I 've made a little money , and intend to do things in my own way , and after our own country fashion  --  and , what is more , sir , at my own expense . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Very true  --  very true . My dear Major , I admire your fine spirit . I will meet the democracy with great pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to despatch him on an errand to Mr. Worthington . Round . Roundtree Worthington ! Odds bother it ! If your son keeps such company he will be ruined thoroughly . Mr. Worthington is one of the most decided Whigs in the whole country , and he 'll vote against you to-morrow as sure as I 'm a Militia Major . Gen'l F. General Fairweather I certainly do not expect his vote , and he may be ,  --  I dare say is ,  --  strongly tinctured with federalism ,  --  which is a most dangerous heresy ; but he 's an old acquaintance of mine , and privately a very worthy man . Round . Roundtree To speak the honest truth , he is , privately , a right clever sort of a man . I wish he was on the right side . Gen'l F. General Fairweather An excellent wish ! If there were more persons on the right side , Major , there would be fewer on the wrong . By way of changing the subject , however , what 's the prospect in the district ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiggery been doing mischief ? Let 's have your candid opinion , for in such matters I rely more upon your judgment than upon that of any man of my acquaintance . Round . Roundtree I 'll tell you the honest truth , General ; its a right nice calculation . Your opponent , Mr. Manly , has been all along in this neighborhood , and has left his tracks after him . Some of the democrats say they heard he was a federalist , but , after seeing with their own eyes , they took him for a right decent sort of a man . Mark me , though ! I would'nt say this publicly  --  not I. I tell the democracy if they 'll only stand up to the rack , we shall carry the day . Gen'l F. General Fairweather That is noble ! It is one of the greatest of the electioneering arts to appear confident of success with the certain prospect of defeat . I own to you , I think the contest will be a close one , and without intending to flatter , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roundtree Like enough ! but I think I 've got the boys in good training hereabouts . I can make them wheel to the right or to the left with as much ease as I muster my battalion . I 've only to blow a horn , and the rogues swarm around me like bees in summer time . Gen'l F. General Fairweather It is a good thing to possess influence , if exerted in a good cause . You 're a valuable friend , Major , and at the same time a formidable foe . Round . Roundtree When I take a liking , I am very apt to like , General  --  and when I hate , I hate in good earnest  --  and there 's no mistake about it . But , come , let me show you my spring , where I 've put up a tip-top shelter , large enough to dine twenty people under it . We 'll have a few of the democracy there presently , and a little something to go upon . Gen'l F. General Fairweather With all my heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROOM IN THE HICKORY TREE TAVERN . Enter Cato and Jenny . Cato . Cato Well , now I 've put away the baggage , if you 'll show me the kitchen , Miss Jinny , I 'll rest my bones awhile , and enjoy the satisfaction of your company . Jenny . Jenny You must be right tired . Cato . Cato Well , I think I 'm right down a little fatigued , sister . I very seldom takes such long rides . Pulls out his watch . Let me see , Mass Henry 'll want his horse exactly in an hour by the watch . Jenny . Jenny Where 's the young gemman gwine to ? Cato . Cato Why , you see , Miss Jinny , I do n't trouble myself much about white folks ' concerns ; but knowing the General as well as I do , and his son too , I think I could suppose there might be a young lady in the case . Jenny . Jenny Ah ! you men is always thinking about us ladies . Cato . Cato Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , as I was saying , the General 's a mighty ambitious man , and takes care of the main chance . I was with him throughout the whole of last session of Congress , and I 'll tell you what , Miss Jinny ,  --  though I say it , who should'nt say it ,  --  he 's as great a palaverer as any in the universe . Jenny . Jenny What 's that ? Cato . Cato Why one thing ' fore a man 's face , and another ' hind his back . That 's what I call palavering . However , Mass Henry 's quite a clever sort of a youth ; I never catch 'd him saying one thing and doing another . Jenny . Jenny I wish he 'd court my young misses . I 'll be bound she 's good enough for him . Cato . Cato The General holds his head mighty high , Miss Jinny . Right civil too to the commonalty , when he choose ; but he loves great folks and rich folks to distraction . Jenny . Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! Why has'nt I kept his company ever since I was a boy so high ? Jenny . Jenny Well , did you see any color 'd ladies at Congress , which you fancied ? Cato . Cato Yes , plenty of ' em ,  --  but I always kept company , myself , with the first class  --  the servants of Congress-men and great folks . I hear ' em talk about the Kitchen Cabinet , but I never was the gemman to have nothing to do with it . ( Takes snuff . ) Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree ( without . ) Jenny  --  Jenny , I say . Jenny . Jenny There comes old misses , a-scolding . Do you go out this way to the kitchen , and , bime-by , I 'll come and sit with you . ( Exit Cato . ) Enter Mrs. Roundtree . Mrs. R. Mrs. Roundtree You huzzy , what are you idling here for ? What man was that ? Jenny . Jenny General Fairweather 's servant , ma'am . He brought in the baggage , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master is now up stairs fixing his dress . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Here he comes now . Go and see that the servant is attended to . ( Exit Jenny . ) Well , thank goodness , Kate is gone before this vile election . Nothing but trouble , trouble , comes of this politics . From this time till late to-morrow , it will all be hurly-burly , noise and frolicking . Enter Henry Fairweather . Henry . Henry Fairweather Madam , your most obedient . I presume you are Mrs. Roundtree , and if so , I am happy in having this opportunity to pay you my respects . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree That is my name , sir . ( Aside . ) He 's a very civil young gentleman . Henry . Henry Fairweather May I be so bold , madam , to inquire after your daughter , Miss Catharine . I had the pleasure of knowing her at her boarding school , or rather at the seat of a mutual acquaintance in the neighborhood of the city . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know our Kate ? You are General Fairweather 's son , I presume , sir ? Henry . Henry Fairweather I am , madam . I accidentally heard that your daughter had returned home . I hope that her health and spirits are good . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Oh , very good  --  very good  --  thank you , sir . Kate 's amazingly improved , although her father do n't seem to think so . But Major Roundtree 's a man of very queer , whimsical notions , Mr. Fairweather . He 's so much taken up with politics , he hardly thinks of any thing else . Oh ! what would I not give , if he would only get rid of this odious tavern-keeping , Mr. Fairweather . To think , that such a girl as our Kate should be constantly exposed to the eyes of every stranger ! Henry . Henry Fairweather Such a daughter as your 's , madam , need not fear the scrutiny of any beholder ,  --  for whilst she has sufficient ease and affability to charm the many , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can not fail to win the hearts of those who are best acquainted with her . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Bless me , sir , what a flatterer you are . Well , I wish you had come a little sooner , for Kate has just rode over in Mr. Worthington 's carriage to stay a day or two with Miss Clara . I am sure it would give her a deal of pleasure to see you , for her mind is constantly running upon her town acquaintance ; and , indeed , I think it quite strange that she has not mentioned you . Henry . Henry Fairweather Perhaps , madam , she did not deem me worthy of remembrance . And yet I own I should feel much mortified if I thought so . I can not imagine much keener suffering , than that we experience when our own warm feelings are requited by coldness and indifference . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Pray , Mr. Fairweather , have you known Kate long ? Is your acquaintance with her in any wise particular ? Henry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time during the Christmas holidays , at the house of Mr. Evergreen , a friend of my father . Miss Evergreen was her schoolmate and companion  --  handsome , accomplished and rich ; but , believe me , when compared with your Catharine , even with all those attractions , she was but an ordinary girl . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Indeed ! is it possible ? bless me ! Well I always thought Kate a very promising child . Mr. Fairweather you must stay long enough with us to see her . I 'll send her word you are here . I am very sure she will be glad to see you . Henry . Henry Fairweather Fortunately , madam , my father is about to despatch me with a letter to Mr. Worthington , so that I shall have the pleasure of renewing my acquaintance with Miss Catharine . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree And you will have an opportunity of seeing another fine girl at the same time . I mean Mr. Worthington 's daughter . Miss Clara is one of the liveliest , amiablest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd warn any young gentleman who sees her to count upon being captivated at first sight . And then she 's so rich . Henry . Henry Fairweather Oh never fear , madam ! I wear an armor which is invulnerable to all Miss Clara 's charms . Enter Roundtree and General Fairweather . Gen'l F. General Fairweather Mrs. Roundtree , your very humble servant , madam . I hope I have the happiness , madam , of seeing you well . It has been at least two years , I believe , since I had that pleasure before . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Yes sir , just before you were chosen to Congress , two years ago . I recollect Major Roundtree was very active in your election , and I hope he will be so again , General ; both for your sake and for the sake of your son . Gen'l F.

I 've got all the drinkables in fine order , ready for action . What 's become of Kate ? Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree She 's on the road to Mr. Worthington 's . Did'nt you know that Miss Clara sent the carriage for her ? Round . Roundtree Not I , indeed . Odds bother it ! if this is'nt rather a strange thing , for the daughter of Major Roundtree to be riding in a federal whig carriage . If the democracy find it out , I shall be blown sky high ! Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Never mind the democracy ! If they give themselves any airs , I 'll send them home to their wives , with such a blast as will make the hen-peck 'd varlets fairly tremble .

I know it all ; I got it from his own handsome lips . Yes , and he 's going now this moment to Mr. Worthington 's to see her . Round . Roundtree Odds bother it , wife ,  --  you must be jesting . Where did he meet with her ? Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree He saw her during the Christmas holidays ; got acquainted with her ; and fell violently in love with her . I know it all . I wish now you could have only heard the young man talk about Kate ; it would have done your heart good . Round . Roundtree Confound me , if it would'nt be a right good match , Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I ; and why should'nt the children marry if they like each other ? Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Well , now , Major  --  you talk like a sensible , rational man  --  that you do . I hav'nt it in my conscience to scold you again for a month . If the dear things should only fancy each other , wo n't you buy Kate a nice piany ? I know you will . Round . Roundtree A piany ,  --  let 's see ,  --  what will it cost ?  --  only a few hundred dollars . Why , I think a fellow might afford that . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree I 'll declare you are now one of the most reasonable men in the world . I thought you would come over to my way of thinking ; I knew you would . Did'nt I tell you all along that Kate was born for something extrornary ,  --  and that what you spent on her edication , would be clear gain ? Round . Roundtree Confound me , I believe you did ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Fairweather 's son , I reckon , would be no bad bargain . Noise without . Ha ! I hear the boys coming . We must give the General a warm welcome . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree And I 'll do my part , since I find you are quite a reasonable man . Enter General Fairweather . Pray , sir , wo n't your son take some refreshment before he goes to Mr. Worthington 's ? Gen'l F. General Fairweather No , madam  --  he is already off at a tangent . When the boy has an object in view , he seems to set hunger , thirst and fatigue at defiance . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree He has an object then in view , sir , in going to Mr. Worthington 's ? Gen'l F. General Fairweather Oh yes , I presume so , madam ,  --  at least I have for him ;  --  I sent him as the bearer of a letter . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree He will see our daughter Kate there , General . He became acquainted with her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam ?  --  I have not heard Henry speak of her ,  --  but he is by no means communicative . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree He 's a noble youth , General  --  that he is . Exit hastily . Enter on the opposite side , Slang  --  Bangall  --  Rowdie  --  and Chipps . Round . Roundtree Boys , you are all welcome . This is our Congressman , General Fairweather , and a candidate for re-election . Surely you hav'nt forgot the General . All together . Hurra for the General !  --  Hurra ! Slang . Slang Forgot the Gin'ral !  --  no  --  not we . Gin'ral , give us a shake of your paw . Why , we could as soon forget old Hickory himself . Fair .

Bangall I 'll be drot if the Gin'ral do n't look fresher about the gills , and more youthfuller , than he did two years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks amazing well . Rowdie . Rowdie Gin'ral , what sorter tobacco do they chaw in Washington ? I should be glad of a good chaw . Fair . General Fairweather Oh , with great pleasure . Here is some of most excellent manufacture . I generally take two or three pounds extra with me , for the special accommodation of my friends . Chipps . Chipps Gin'ral , have you forgot Jemmy Chipps ? I voted for you at the last election , and mother said I wer'nt of age neither . Fair . General Fairweather Oh , Mr. Chipps , your most obedient . I remember you now , very well  --  I very seldom forget faces . How is Mrs. Chipps , my good fellow ? Chipps . Chipps Mrs. Chipps indeed !  --  I hav'nt that misfortune to answer for neither . I can hardly take care of myself , much more of one of your highflyers , who likes to put on a quantity of finery and the like of that . Rowdie . Rowdie Gin'ral , do n't you remember that famous speech of yourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair . General Fairweather Speech !  --  ah  --  ah  --  I  --  I believe I do . Let us see , what was the particular subject ? Rowdie . Rowdie Subject !  --  Why I do n't bother my brains much about the subject ; but I read every word of it to the old woman  --  I am sure of that . Oh , yes  --  I do remember ; you gave the Bank monster a licking . It was a real soaker . Fair . General Fairweather Oh yes  --  yes  --  I remember . The Bank was a great enemy to the Democracy ,  --  and I did'nt spare it . Rowdie . Rowdie And I think there was something in it too about the Tariff . That Tariff , Gin'ral , must be a monstrous mischievous thing  --  a sort of sea sarpent , I reckon . Fair . General Fairweather You are perfectly right . The tariff was like a great robber , who would thrust his hands into the pocket of one person , and put the stolen purse into the pocket of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chipps . Chipps Well , that is rather better than the robber 's putting the money into his own pocket , Gin'ral . For my part , I should like to have mine pretty well fill 'd . Bangall . Bangall Gin'ral , I suppose you 're in favor of the soveranity of the people ? Fair . General Fairweather Oh , my dear sir  --  that is one of the fundamental articles of the democratic creed . In this country the people are supreme . ( Enter Supine . ) Ah ! here is my old acquaintance , Mr. Supine ; I remember him well . Pray , Mr. Supine , how fares it with you ? Supine . Supine Indifferently well , General . I hope you enjoy all the substantial blessings  --  and that you are not troubled with that weariness of spirit which we scholars call tedium vit . Fair . General Fairweather Thank you , Mr. Supine . I possess quite a reasonable share of creaturely comforts . Moreover , I believe I have found out the true philosopher 's stone : that is , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel with our bread and butter . Sup . Supine Excellent doctrine ! We should likewise be moderate in our desires , General ,  --  Contentus parvo . For example : if , peradventure , you should be defeated in your election to-morrow , you will no doubt bear it like a man  --  and , as a good democrat should always do , submit to the vox populi . Fair . General Fairweather That is a contingency , Mr. Supine , which I ought not to fear , when surrounded by so many good friends . I believe I had the honor of your vote at the last election . Sup . Supine That is true , General  --  but , as I know you like sincerity and candor , I am free to confess that for some time past I have been somewhat on the fence  --  or , as I might better express it , laborans dubitatione . Fair . General Fairweather Sorry to hear it . Hope no vote or act of mine , Mr. Supine , has occasioned your displeasure . Slang . Slang Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't scatter his boys and gals , and set the old log-house on fire , if he votes agin you . Wo n't we Bangall ? Bang . Bangall As sure as a gun we will . Fair . General Fairweather My dear good friends , do n't threaten violence to our excellent fellow-citizen , Mr. Supine . He is the Socrates or Plato of your neighborhood ,  --  the instructor of your children ,  --  and , withal , I have no doubt a very reasonable man . What if he doubts to-day ,  --  to-morrow he will prove faithful to the good cause . Round . Roundtree Look here , gentle folks ,  --  this is all talk and no liquor , as the saying is . I have got a table spread under the shelter at the spring , and something substantial to go upon . Let 's go and take a glass together , and that will settle all differences of opinion . Rowdie .

I attach myself to your command pro tempore and ex necessitate ;  --  but remember , that the mind of the free voter is not to be chained by the fascinations of social intercourse . As to these good people , who are just before us , permit me in classical language to say , odi profanum vulgus . ( Exeunt Fairweather and Supine , following the rest . ) SCENE III . A SALOON AT MR . WORTHINGTON 'S . Enter Clara Worthington and Catharine Fairweather . Clara . Clara Worthington Well , Catharine , I hope your slumbers will be sweet and quiet to-night . I am sure you must need repose  --  for , even when we are surprised agreeably , our spirits are somewhat agitated in spite of ourselves . Now , is'nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me your reason for thinking that this young gentleman 's visit was particularly intended for me , or that I was particularly delighted and surprised at meeting him ? Clara . Clara Worthington Oh , you unconscious girl . Do n't you remember we were standing together at the window when he rode up ,  --  that I , mistaking the son for the father , wondered if the honorable General Fairweather could look so young ,  --  and , that when he leaped from his horse and approached the house , your breathing became suddenly short ,  --  your cheeks reddened to crimson , and your eyes sparkled like rain drops in the sun ? Cath . Catharine Miss Clara , you are quite eloquent . Was it wonderful , that the meeting with an acquaintance unexpectedly , should have caused some little emotion ? Clara . Clara Worthington Not at all ,  --  and especially if that acquaintance was one calculated to inspire emotion . But that is not all . Come , tell me , if I did not hear some soft whispering between you , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon ? Why not make me your confidant ? To be candid with you , I have had something to do with these mysterious love affairs myself lately  --  and , being somewhat your senior , I may give you some friendly counsel . Cath . Catharine I 'll declare , Miss Clara , there is no resisting you . Well , I do own that I met young Fairweather for the first time at Christmas ,  --  that we were together every day for a week ,  --  that the is very handsome and intelligent ,  --  that his conversation is very interesting ,  --  his manners very insinuating ,  --  and that before we parted I believe we were mutually not at all displeased with each other . Dear Miss Clara , tell me if there is any harm in all this ? Clara . Clara Worthington None in the world ! I think it perfectly innocent not to be displeased with any body ; and what is more , I think it equally innocent to be very much pleased with somebody . Now , Catharine , suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away my beau . What would you think of it ? Cath . Catharine Think of it ? I should think it very unfriendly and ungrateful indeed , if I could suppose it possible . Clara . Clara Worthington But it is possible ,  --  and what is more , I believe I could almost persuade you it was true . Now let me read you a letter which papa slyly put into my hands before he and Mr. Henry went out to walk . It was brought by the young gentleman himself , and was written by his father .

" " My Dear Worthington : I sent you word I should be with you the day before the election ; but I find it necessary to remain here to-night , and have therefore despatched my son to make my apology and act as my representative . He has lately obtained his law license , and I understand , passed his examination with credit . You will find him well informed , and , between ourselves , I suspect him of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your daughter , I believe , was at school , and I understand she is all that a parent 's heart could desire . I must tell you frankly , I am anxious that Henry should see her ,  --  and if the interview should lead to a union of our houses , there is no one who would more rejoice at it than him , who , though separated from you in politics , still subscribes himself your old classmate and assured friend , " " Francis Fairweather . " Now , tell me , dear Catharine , do n't that look something like taking my beau from me ? Cath . Catharine ( seriously. )  --  No , Miss Clara  --  but it looks very much like taking my beau from me . Clara . Clara Worthington Oh , never fear that . I promise you I will do no such thing . I do not think that the interviews between Mr. Henry and myself , are likely to lead to a union between the houses of Worthington and Fairweather . Not that I would by any means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong reasons why he and I can not be united in the holy bonds of wedlock . Cath . Catharine Dear Clara  --  what are they ? Clara . Clara Worthington He loves another  --  and so do I. Cath . Catharine If you love another , Miss Clara , it meets the approbation of all concerned ,  --  but , alas ! in my case , General Fairweather will never permit his family pride to be humbled by a marriage connection with the daughter of a tavern keeper . Clara . Clara Worthington Come , do n't be serious , I beg you . I do not know the father , it is true ,  --  but I rather think the son will have something to say on that subject himself . One thing you may rest assured of ; little Cupid is never much troubled about pedigrees . But here come the gentlemen from their evening walk . Enter Worthington and Henry . Worth . Worthington Young ladies , you should have joined us in our walk . Nature has nearly completed her spring toilet , and the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you charmed us in the parlor . Clara . Clara Worthington I hope that Mr. Fairweather was equally pleased with the excursion . After his fatiguing ride , rest would perhaps have been more agreeable . Henry . Henry Fairweather With your society , Miss Worthington , I confess I should have given the parlor a decided preference . Clara . Clara Worthington Indeed , sir , you are very complimentary ,  --  but I can not in conscience claim the whole merit of interesting you , when my friend Miss Roundtree , is entitled to her full proportion . Worth . Worthington My daughter , you perceive , Mr. Fairweather , is quick at repartee . But Miss Catharine , I presume , would not disown her share of skill in the art of pleasing . Cath . Catharine It is certainly very desirable , sir , to possess that art ; and , I suppose , in a greater or less degree , it belongs to every one who has the temper and willingness to practise it . Worth . Worthington Justly and truly said . There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they feel little or no enjoyment in imparting happiness to others ; they have neither the temper nor willingness to make themselves agreeable , unless induced to do so by personal vanity or the desire of admiration . Clara . Clara Worthington I 'll declare I believe we are all getting very sentimental ; and , as an evening walk in spring , is apt to inspire appetite , as well as sentiment , I will hurry the servants with supper . ( Exit . ) Worth . Worthington A very timely thought !  --  Mr. Fairweather , I presume you go to the election to-morrow ? Henry . Henry Fairweather My father desired me to ride over . You will doubtless , sir , also attend . Worth . Worthington That is the first duty of a citizen ; often a painful one , but enjoined by the highest considerations . You are no doubt apprised that your father and myself were early friends and classmates ; and yet we differ so essentially in our political views , that I shall be compelled not only to record my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against him . Henry . Henry Fairweather Your sentiments on that subject , sir , I entirely approve . Worth . Worthington And , as to-morrow will be given to the public , I must devote the remainder of to-day , to private matters . Be pleased therefore to excuse me for the present . ( Exit . ) Henry . Henry Fairweather Catharine , you look serious . Cath . Catharine I think I have cause . Henry . Henry Fairweather Indeed !  --  It was but an hour since you were apparently happy . Has any thing occurred ? Cath . Catharine Yes !  --  Miss Worthington read me your father 's letter , of which you were the bearer . Do you know the contents of that letter ? Henry . Henry Fairweather Upon my honor , I do not . Cath . Catharine Then I will tell you . The purpose of your father in sending you to this house , was to seek a more honorable alliance than with the daughter of a tavern-keeper . Were you aware of his intention ? Henry . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he revealed to me such a design ,  --  but I repelled the suggestion at once . Cath . Catharine And yet , you came willingly . Henry . Henry Fairweather Most willingly  --  when your mother informed me you were here . Cath . Catharine Henry , I believe you sincere ,  --  but , remember , when you first urged your suit , you saw me in a sphere of life , I was not accustomed to . My parents are not only comparatively poor ; but , if you judge them by those distinctions which prevail in society , their condition is an humble one . You must , therefore , be convinced that the great inequality between us , must constitute a serious , if not insurmountable bar to our union . Confess that you were rash in your declaration of love , and did not consider these difficulties with sufficient calmness and forethought . Henry . Henry Fairweather I did consider , and am fully prepared to meet them , You were candid enough to state these difficulties before . I am no stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to receive me as the equal of his son , or as the rightful sharer of his parental love . On the contrary , his mind is clearly intent upon some alliance , which would be more gratifying to worldly ambition . This starting conviction , Henry , never forced itself on my mind until your father 's letter was read to me ; and it now seems plain , that to cherish this attachment longer , would not only alienate his affections from you , but reduce me to the humbled condition of a despised intruder . Let us then , whatever pangs it may cost , endeavor to forget each other . Henry . Henry Fairweather Never  --  never !  --  If I wanted further proof of your worth , Catharine , this generous offer of self-sacrifice would be sufficient . But harbor not for one moment the thought , that I could ever repent my attachment , or waver in my purposes , from calculations of interest . I consider you irrevocably pledged to me  --  as I am to you ,  --  and neither the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune , shall alter my resolution . Cath . Catharine Think , Henry  --  think how relentless is family pride ; think of the scorn which Catharine Roundtree would have to encounter . Henry . Henry Fairweather You overrate this matter much . We live in a country where the prejudices to which you refer , are fast yielding to the spirit of the age . Mankind are becoming too wise , to believe , that to be well descended , as it is called , gives claim to respect in the absence of personal merit ; and innocence and beauty are as often found in humble life , as in the circles of fashion and luxury . Cath . Catharine You suffer your feelings , Henry , on this subject , to master your judgment . I fear you will soon be convinced that both of us have been rash and imprudent . Henry . Henry Fairweather Banish these fears , I beseech you ,  --  and , especially , do not betray your feelings to the family . ( Bell rings . ) Let us begone . Worthington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ACT III . SCENE I. BEFORE THE HICKORY TREE TAVERN . Enter Roundtree and Fairweather . Roundtree . Roundtree Glorious day this , General , for the election . I think the democracy will muster strong presently ,  --  for my scouts and file leaders , have had orders to beat up every bush ; aye , and to clap fire on every democratic terrapin 's back in the precinct . Footnote : 1Kb Fairweather . General Fairweather You have done well , Major . I believe this county , and perhaps this precinct , is to decide the election . With the aid of the knowing ones in these matters , I have ascertained that the other parts of the district will be about equally divided , or , as the sportsmen say , neck and neck , between the candidates ,  --  so , that , in fact , you may be said to have the issue of the day 's contest in your own hands . Round . Roundtree Then , " I 'll take the responsibility , " as the old Hero so emphatically said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small one in territory ,  --  and I have made arrangements , by means of hired expresses , to get the probable result to-night . My success is not only very important to the party , but to me personally ,  --  for , to be very candid Major ,  --  and it is a disclosure which I would make to none but my true friends ,  --  I had a hint from one of the cabinet , that my re-election would ensure hereafter a very high appointment ,  --  probably a foreign embassy . Round . Roundtree Those who fight for the democracy , and win the victory , have the best right to the spoils . That is the true doctrine ; and I think , General , considering that the laborer is worthy of his hire , I must put in a claim myself one of these days , for a bite at the public crib . Fair . General Fairweather By all means  --  by all means ; there is no one of my acquaintance whose claims stand upon higher ground . Let me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairweather will never abandon his friends , so long as they stick to him . I fear we can do nothing with the schoolmaster . Round . Roundtree An obstinate old mule ! I plied him well with liquor last night , until towards bed time he was comfortably filled up ; but it made him , if possible , more perverse and independent than before . All the answer I could get was a growl , and occasionally a little dog latin . Enter Supine from the house . Fair . General Fairweather Good morrow , Mr. Supine . Sup . Supine Slave , salve , General ! Not exactly myself in sound bodily condition to-day  --  rather an uneasy sensation about the head  --  or , as the latins would call it , capitis dolor . My friend Major Roundtree , was rather too liberal with his gifts on yester night . Round . Roundtree Fine day for the election , Mr. Supine . Supine . Supine Oh , very fine ,  --  very luminous ,  --  that is , if considered in reference to atmospheric temperature and transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pretty dark one  --  tenebrosus dies . Fair . General Fairweather It would be dark indeed , Mr. Supine , should the principles of democracy unluckily sustain a defeat ; and I entertain the hope that a night 's refelection has conducted your vigorous and well stored mind to the same conclusion . Not that I solicit your vote for myself , Mr. Supine . No , sir , not for the world . I feel no anxiety on my own account ,  --  none whatever . I go altogether for principle . Supine . Supine A noble resolve , General . Principia non homines , is the maxim of every correct politician ; and it is one by which I propose to govern myself to-day . Personal respect and acquaintance , might incline me to record my suffrage in your favor , but duty to my country will oblige me to vote for your competitor . I must now go down to the schoolhouse , and dismiss the scholars for the day . Salve et vale . ( Exit . ) Round . Roundtree An old gull ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fair . General Fairweather Major  --  I think every vote will count to-day . Is there no weak point about this pedagogue , at which we can penetrate him ? Is he vain ,  --  avaricious ,  --  aspiring ,  --  or what gap is it that will give us free access to his heart ? Round . Roundtree Why  --  I believe I will go and promise the old Jack , to build him a new schoolhouse . May be that will do the business . Fair . General Fairweather Or , as his wardrobe is rather scanty , suppose we threaten to clap a new coat upon his back . Round . Roundtree I think I 'll try the schoolhouse first ; but the thing must be done with skill . I must bring some of my military tactics to bear on him . ( Exit  --  following Supine . ) Fair . General Fairweather ( solus . ) Perhaps the old pedant is honest , after all ; for although honesty is rather a rare plant , I believe it may be found sometimes , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry promised to be here about this hour . ( Takes out his watch . ) Apropos ! here he is . ( Enter Henry . ) Well , my lad , how did you find Worthington and his fair daughter . Your visit , I hope , was very agreeable to all parties . Henry . Henry Fairweather Very agreeable to me , sir , I assure you . Fair . General Fairweather So far , so good . Of course you saw the young lady . Henry . Henry Fairweather Yes , sir , certainly . Fair . General Fairweather Is she beautiful ? Henry . Henry Fairweather Very beautiful ! Fair . General Fairweather And accomplished ? Henry . Henry Fairweather Highly accomplished ! Fair . General Fairweather Do you think you could love her ? Henry . Henry Fairweather I not only think so , but I know that I do love her with fond devotedness . Fair . General Fairweather By my troth  --  but you must either be a very susceptible youth , or the girl must possess supernatural charms to bewitch you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I have known her for several months . Fair . General Fairweather Whom do you mean ? Miss Worthington ,  --  the daughter of my friend ? Henry . Henry Fairweather No sir , not Miss Worthington  --  but the daughter of another whom you also style your friend . Her have I seen at Mr. Worthington 's house , the companion of his daughter . And , as it is proper that I should no longer disguise from you the fact , I frankly acknowledge , that the young lady to whom I allude , is in fully possession of my heart  --  and that I am unalterably pledged to her . Fair . General Fairweather Explain yourself  --  whom do you mean ? Henry . Henry Fairweather I mean the daughter of your friend Major Roundtree , the keeper of this tavern . Fair . General Fairweather The daughter of Major Roundtree , the keeper of this tavern ! Have you lost your reason ? Have your law studies run you stark mad ? or have you been cramming your brain with silly love-sick romances ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak the words of truth and soberness . Miss Roundtree has been well educated , and is all I could possibly desire her to be . She is sensible ,  --  beautiful and good ,  --  and I would prefer to wed her without a penny , than even the accomplished Miss Worthington with a fortune . Fair . General Fairweather Do you dare , sir , speak this language to me ? You wed the daughter of Major Roundtree ? A Fairweather connect himself with the vulgar progeny of a tavern-keeper ,  --  a low pot-house politician ,  --  a clownish Major of Militia ?  --  You , sir , tell me this to my face ?  --  By my troth , but I 'll disinherit you on the spot . A fellow of such grovelling propensities , shall not finger one dollar of my fortune . Henry . Henry Fairweather I expected this storm would come ; and I must patiently abide its pelting . Fair . General Fairweather What , sir  --  and insult me too to my face , with a tone of defiance ?  --  Fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the bitterest hour of your life . Is this a plot laid to ruin me ,  --  and can this old fox Roundtree , be accessary to it ? His Jezebel of a wife knew of the meeting most certainly ;  --  Ah , here he comes opportunely . ( Enter Roundtree . ) Major  --  here is a very disagreeable business , and I desire a prompt explanation . I sent this son of mine yesterday to the house of Mr. Worthington , and it seems that he met your daughter there , as if by appointment . I hope sir , you had no hand in the matter . Round . Roundtree Odds bother it , General ! what do you mean ?  --  Your son met my daughter at Mr. Worthington 's ! and what 's that to you or me ? Has'nt my daughter as much right to go there as your son ? Oh ho !  --  you 're afraid they might possibly make a match of it , are you ? Confound me if I do n't think this very extraordinary talk from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has nothing to do with a man 's private affairs . Democracy , sir  --  is a matter of public concern . I am now speaking , sir , of clandestine interviews , and clandestine engagements among young people , who have no discretion . I am now speaking , sir , of improper and unsuitable matches . I  --  I  --  Round . Roundtree Look you here , General  --  look you here ! You are my superior officer , and I am bound to treat you with all proper respect , when on military duty ;  --  but here , sir , at the Hickory Tree tavern , and on an election day , I 'll let you know that I am as good as you or any other man . Fair . General Fairweather And I 'll let you know , sir , I do not choose that my son shall marry without my consent . Marriage , sir , is a domestic arrangement between families , and has no connection with politics ;  --  marriage is a matter altogether of private feeling . Henry , follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Fairweather Be not offended with him , Major . His anger will soon subside . ( Exit . ) Round . Roundtree ( solus . ) Why , here is a terrible clatter , to be sure !  --  Mad with me , because his son chooses to take a liking to my daughter !  --  Why he scolds as furiously as an old woman . I never heard Mrs. Roundtree fume so , since the day we were married . Odds . bother it ! this pretended democrat is a rank federalist in disguise ,  --  but I 'll fix his flint for him ;  --  I 'll be knocked into a cock 'd hat if I do n't . ( Enter Mrs. Roundtree from the house . ) Why , Dolly , here 's a pretty spot of work . We are dished , as sure as I am a Major of Militia . The General has found out what you suspicioned yourself  --  that his son looks kindly at our Kate ,  --  and he 's got into such a rage about it , that although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly keep my courage down ! Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Bless me ! bless me ! I thought that the General would be overjoyed at it . Now you do n't tell me that he 's as angry as all that . This comes of his not seeing Kate with his own eyes . I 'll send over to Mr. Worthington 's for her directly . I am sure if he could only take a good look at her he 'd be perfectly melted . Mr. Round . Roundtree Aye , send over Jemmy Chipps for the child , Dolly ,  --  and let him bring her to her own home immediately . ( Mrs. R. goes into the house . ) She shall come , but not to turn away General Fairweather 's wrath . I 'll lock her up  --  and not one of the aristocratic breed shall even take a peep at her . Odds bother it !  --  he think himself above me and my family !  --  I 'll teach him , that on election days a Major of Militia is as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You seem to be somewhat disconcerted , Major ,  --  aliquanto irritatus . ( Takes snuff . ) Round . Roundtree Mr. Supine , you are perfectly right not to vote for this swaggering , ill-humored , purse-proud aristocrat , General Fairweather . He is not a genuine democrat , sir ,  --  but an abominable federal whig in disguise . I have just found him out . He 's been playing ' possum in this district for several years , and I 'll have his dough-face taken off this day . Sup . Supine This is what I would denominate a very sudden somerset , Major ,  --  repentinus vertens ! Round . Roundtree I do n't know what the Latin of it is , sir , but I understand the English ; and if I do n't make the boys stand up to-day and give the General a broadside , I 'll never wear another epaulet on my shoulders ! Above me and my family , eh ! I can tell him , Mr. Supine , that the Roundtrees are as good as the Fairweathers any day . Sup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt we are all descended , in truth , from one common family . Old Mr. Lawrence Roundtree , your grandfather , I knew when I was a boy , and he was a man such as we find not often in these degenerate days . Round . Roundtree Let us go and see the boys that are already on the ground . I told Rowdie , and Slang , and Bangall , to muster all their forces ; but I reckon , as how , they shall fight under a new flag , and that pretty soon . Above me and my family , eh ! A foreign embassy , eh ! Come this way , Mr. Supine , and let me tell you of this fellow 's insolence . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE II . A ROOM IN WORTHINGTON 'S HOUSE . Enter Clara and Catharine . Clara . Clara Worthington Did Henry say that his father should know all ? Cath . Catharine So he declared at parting ,  --  and if , as I fully expect Miss Clara , his father should be obstinately opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more . Clara . Clara Worthington Make no rash promises , Catharine . You love young Henry  --  and woman 's love , if true , is not so light and transient a thing , that we may cherish and discard it at pleasure . Cath . Catharine But there are other and keener pangs than those of disappointed love . Clara . Clara Worthington Perhaps so ; but why do you like to contemplate the dark side of the picture ? Since I read you that unfortunate letter , you are absolutely changed into a new being . Enter Worthington . Worth . Worthington Miss Catharine , here is Mr. Chipps on a hasty errand from your mother , and desires to see you himself . Enter Chipps , hastily . Cath . Catharine Mr. Chipps , what in the world is the matter ? Chipps . Chipps Matter , Miss Kate ! Why I 'll be dog 'd if I can hardly tell myself ,  --  exceptin ' that I 've almost run the breath out of my body . Cath . Catharine Is any one ill ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in a piping rage .  --  Your mother ax 'd me to come over in a great hurry and fetch you home ,  --  and she says that the Major is boiling all over , and wants to see you a bit . Cath . Catharine ' T is very strange ! Chipps . Chipps Not very strange neither , Miss Kate  --  for I 've a sort of a notion , from a sly hint the old woman dropped , that our Congressman 's in a kind of a pucker too , about something . You know what I told you about going down yonder among those whig folks to get an edication . Cath . Catharine Dear Miss Clara , I will get my bonnet and take leave . Worth . Worthington You must not return on foot , Miss Catharine , with our consent . I will order the carriage , and Clara shall accompany us . Mr. Chipps can return immediately , and say we are coming . Chipps . Chipps But , sir , I calkilated upon having some snug little chat with Miss Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be old cronies and school-fellows , and many a time has I helped her over the fences , and let down the bars for her , as we went to the old log house together . Worth . Worthington I must insist upon waiting on the young lady myself  --  and you may so inform her parents . Chipps . Chipps Well , if it ca n't be help 'd it ca n't . So , sir , I am your sarvant . ( Exit . ) Worth . Worthington Miss Catharine , I beg that you will not suffer yourself to be discomposed by trifles . Consider me as one entirely disposed to befriend you ,  --  and be assured also , that in my daughter 's affection you may place the fullest confidence . ( Exit . ) Cath . Catharine Dear Clara , how sweet is that assurance . Clara . Clara Worthington I shall be most happy , Catharine , to be numbered among your friends . Let the rougher sex exhibit the instability of human attachments , but we will remain knit together by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE III . BEFORE THE HICKORY TREE TAVERN . Roundtree , Supine , Slang , Bangall , Rowdie , and others , in a group . Round . Roundtree Fellow citizens , soldiers , brothers , neighbors , and democrats ! As I was telling you , I have always been a true friend to the democracy . I have stood up for the cause through good report and evil report ; and when others have sneaked away when they thought it rather a ticklish concern , I have always been ready to sink or swim with my party . Rowdie . Rowdie That you have , Major  --  you shouted and hurra 'd for old Hickory , when there war n't five men in the neighborhood that would dare to pat you on the back by way of encouragement . Slang . Slang I can testify , Major , that you 've always been a whole hog  --  drag-out republican ,  --  the real grit . Bangall . Bangall If any man disputes your democracy , Major , send him to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what hurt him . Round . Roundtree Well , then , as I was telling you , I always supported this man , General Fairweather , for Congress . I thought him a sterling , bang-up republican ,  --  but I am sorry to say that I 've found him out , and that he 's not the clean thing . He smells too much like an aristocrat for me ; and I should'nt wonder after all , if he had some notions of monarchy about him . What do you think of his boiler 's almost bursting , because his son happened to be thrown into company with my daughter Kate ? Is that acting like a good democrat ? Ai nt Major Roundtree 's daughter as good as any man 's son ? I appeal to you , as the sovereign people ; and I hope when you march up to the polls , you will vote for some one besides a federal whig in disguise . Slang . Slang Is it possible that Gineral Fairweather could have acted so ? Bangall . Bangall Well , blame my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a federalist . Rowdie . Rowdie We sha'nt vote for him ,  --  and that 's flat ! Omnes . Omnes We wo n't vote for any such man ! Round . Roundtree Depend upon it , friends , he 's not the man he 's cracked up to be . Instead of looking to the interests of the democracy , he 's got a hankering after the loaves and fishes for himself . Why what do you think of his telling me , that if elected , he expects to get a fat office somewhere beyond the water ? Slang . Slang Abominable ! Bangall . Bangall Monstrous ! Rowdie . Rowdie Down with him ! Round . Roundtree Ask Mr. Supine here , who you know is a good man , and has taught most of your children their reading and writing ,  --  ask him what he thinks of the General . Sup . Supine Why touching this alleged personal affront , my friends , I must in candor , plead my ignorance  --  ignorantia delicti . Slang . Slang Le 's have it in English , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg pardon . I forgot that all were not fortunate enough to have their understandings tinctured with scholarship . Well then , I must frankly confess , I do not admire the General 's politics . Bangall . Bangall Who do you vote for ? Sup . Supine I shall cast my suffrage on Mr. Manly . Rowdie . Rowdie Major , must we vote for Mr. manly ? I thought you said he was a federal whig . Slang . Slang And a Bank-tariffer , to boot ? Bangall . Bangall And an abolitioner also ? Round . Roundtree Hold , friends ! I believe , on reflection , it would be the wisest course , to vote not at all . In that way we stick to principle . Omnes . Omnes Aye , lets us stick to principle . Round . Roundtree In the mean time we 'll go down to the spring , and take a good pull together . It will brighten our ideas . Bangall . Bangall Aye , let us take a pull  --  and a long pull  --  Slang . Slang And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-together . ( Exeunt all but Supine . ) Sup . Supine ( solus . ) A practical commentary this on the freedom of elections ! This is that divine vox populi , which we read and hear of ! We are certainly the most free and enlightened nation under the sun . ( Enter Cato . ) Well , blackey , who may you happen to be ? Cato . Cato I is Cato , sir  --  at your service . Sup . Supine Cato ! then I presume you are something of a classic ,  --  and being of the African physiognomy , peradventure you may have descended from the great Cato of Utica . Cato . Cato My daddy 's name , sir , was Solomon ,  --  and both of us was born in the family of the Fairweathers . We belong to the old school , sir ,  --  none of your upstart folks . Sup . Supine Upon my conscience , I believe you are something of a Solomon yourself ,  --  an Ethiopian sui generis . Where is your master ? Cato . Cato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looks as mad as a hornet . Sup . Supine Here he comes now  --  and alone . Cato . Cato Well then I blieve I 'll go and have a little conversation with Miss Jinny . ( Exit . ) Enter Fairweather . Fair . General Fairweather The boy is perfectly inflexible . I thought that my plans had been laid with wisdom , when lo ! they are suddenly blasted by his headstrong folly . Mr. Supine , your most obedient . I presume that the voters are fast assembling at the polls ! Sup . Supine Many are now at the spring  --  the usual place of rendezvous . It is there , General , that much of the patriotism of this precinct is annually inspired . A squad , under the Major 's command , left this but a minute since , to offer a copious libation at the fountain  --  and , I must frankly inform you , in a condition of mind very destructive to your prospects . Fair . General Fairweather How !  --  what !  --  Explain , my dear sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Supine I speak of your own political family . Your quondam friend , Major Roundtree , is now as bitter an enemy as you could possibly desire . Tempora mutantur , &c.;  --  you know , sir . Fair . General Fairweather Confusion !  --  why I shall lose my election , and that will ruin all my political prospects . Sup . Supine Perhaps , General , to be rejected by the people , will be the surest road to Executive favor . Fair . General Fairweather Not in my case . I stand sponsor for the district , and if I fail I shall lose my reputation for sagacity . My dear Mr. Supine , ca n't you act as mediator ? Assure the Major that I meant no political offence whatever , and , that as to the little personal matter between us , I spoke in a passion , and believe that I was somewhat in the wrong . Tell him I have the highest respect for him , and that private considerations ought never to weigh against the public good . Do , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sup . Supine He is firm as a rock , sir  --  bitter as gall  --  and will carry the whole democratic hive with him . You have touched him , General , on a chord nearest to his heart . Punctum tenerum . Fair . General Fairweather I am aware of it . I was wrong . Do you know his daughter , Mr. Supine ? Supine . Supine She was my pupil  --  a beautiful young woman  --  gentle ,  --  accomplished  --  and worthy of a prince . Here she comes this instant , attended by Mr. Worthington and daughter . They have just alighted from the carriage . Enter Worthington , Clara , and Catharine . Worth . Worthington My dear General , I am happy to see you . Allow me to make you acquainted with my daughter , and with Miss Roundtree . ( They salute . ) Fair . General Fairweather Worthington , I am rejoiced to see you , and especially at the present conjuncture . You are fortunate to have in charge two such lovely samples of their sex . If Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will avail myself of this moment to confer with you privately on a matter of much importance . Worth . Worthington With all my heart . Sup . Supine And with all my heart , sir , will I manifest my gallantry on this occasion . ( Conducts the ladies into the house . ) Fair . General Fairweather I ask your counsel as a personal friend  --  not as a political adversary . By some imprudence , I fear I have involved myself in difficulty . I had fixed my heart , Worthington , upon your lovely daughter as a suitable companion for my son  --  but he , it seems , without my knowledge or consent , has pledged his affections to Miss Roundtree . In an evil moment , when I made the discovery , I deeply offended the young lady 's father , and in consequence thereof he is suddenly converted from a warm political friend into a bitter personal enemy . His great influence in this precinct , will probably turn the scale against me , and I shall not only lose my son , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Worth . Worthington You appeal to my private friendship and candor , and I answer you frankly . Your path is plain Withdraw your opposition to your son 's free choice . He can not marry my daughter because she is sacredly betrothed , with my consent , to another . Your son is also bound to another by every obligation of faith and honor , and let me assure you ( this little matter of family feeling aside ) he could not have given his heart to one more lovely and deserving . Adopt this course , and the Major will be easily reconciled . Fair . General Fairweather ( after a pause . ) I believe your counsel is wise . It is a struggle ,  --  but I yield . Worth . Worthington That is generous and noble . I go this moment , and will return with Major Roundtree . He is fortunately walking this way . ( Exit . ) Fair . General Fairweather ( solus . ) Bitter enough !  --  but even wormwood is sometimes good for the health . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor is it very agreeable to anticipate Mr. and Mrs. Roundtree as the father and mother-in-law of Henry Fairweather . On the other hand , the girl herself is a fair scion from rather a scrubby stock , and if , in addition , I can secure my re-election and all its advantages  --  why I believe upon the whole the consolations will be nearly equal to the disquietudes . Re-enter Worthington with Roundtree . Fair . General Fairweather Major  --  Mr. Worthington has told you all , and whilst I offer you my hand , I sincerely apologise for my rudeness . I have inquired more minutely into the matters which betrayed me into temporary excitement , and am not only convinced of my error , but take pleasure in assuring you that I shall entirely acquiesce in the choice of my son 's affections . Round . Roundtree Well now , General , that is arguing like a man , and I give you the right hand of fellowship . I thought you were too good a republican to take such high ground about the difference between one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter ,  --  and , although I admit that my dander was confoundedly up , yet when one is willing to confess one 's errors , why there ought to be an end of it . Fair . General Fairweather And I hope , Major , if the unfortunate impression made upon your mind against me , has produced any influence upon others , you will do me the justice to restore matters to their usual good footing as speedily as possible . Round . Roundtree Aye , let me alone for that . There may have been some little misunderstanding to be sure , but I 'll put matters to rights in a twinkling . I 'll go and explain every thing to the democracy in a few minutes . If I say I have been mistaken  --  they 'll believe it ,  --  for , although I may be often deceived myself , I make it a rule , General , never to deceive other people  --  if I can possibly help it . Fair . General Fairweather An excellent rule . But , Major , as time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . Round . Roundtree Exactly so . Here are the boys coming up to the polls now . I 'll go and meet them , and have a little brisk conversation on the subject . ( Exit . ) Worth . Worthington You have not only adopted the best and wisest policy ,  --  you have done more ,  --  you have discharged the obligations of duty . Fair . General Fairweather I believe you are right . Your moral perceptions , Worthington , are more acute than mine . They were always so . Enter Supine from the house . Sup . Supine Your fair daughter , Mr. Worthington , desires to see you when perfectly convenient . You are happy , no doubt , sir , in having such a daughter . Worth . Worthington Very well contented , sir . She is very dutiful . Sup . Supine And you might add , sir , without exaggeration , very beautiful . Nor must you forget that the co-operation of art was necessary to produce so fair a creation . My own share in her early instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of benefit . Worth . Worthington For which , Mr. Supine , you have long since received my acknowledgments . Before I obey my daughter 's summons , General , I have another duty to perform ,  --  in order , if possible , to counteract one of the results which might follow the little service I have rendered you to-day . I must rally our whig strength , and dispute your claims to victory . Fair . General Fairweather A perfectly fair and legitimate effort ; and , if I am beaten in the contest , it will be some consolation that young Manly 's success will be particularly gratifying to you . Worth . Worthington Now then for an open field , and a fair fight . ( Exit . ) Fair . General Fairweather I will myself seek the melancholy Mr. Henry , and apprise him of the sudden change in the aspect of his fortune . ( Exit . ) Re-enter Roundtree , with Slang , Bangall , Rowdie , Chipps and others . Round . Roundtree I tell you I was altogether mistaken ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , its his duty honestly to confess it . Slang . Slang Did'nt you say that he smelt like an aristocrat ? Rowdie . Rowdie And that he had a hungry appetite after loaves and fishes ? Bang . Bangall And that his mouth watered after an ambassy ? Round . Roundtree Yes , yes  --  all that is so ; but do n't we know that some things appear true , which afterwards turn out to be false ? Do n't you recollect , Rowdie , when that crafty old whig , Thornberry , charged you with making too free a use of his sheep ,  --  and that some of the neighbors actually believed the report , until you proved to a dead certainty that the rogue was no other than Robin Hedgeman 's dog ? Chipps . Chipps Aye , and some of the neighbors are wicked enough to believe the story to this day . Rowdie . Rowdie Hold your tongue , Jemmy  --  it was nothing but a whig lie . Round . Roundtree You see , then , how easy a thing it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , for a moment , that the General wavered in the democratic faith ,  --  but I am now perfectly convinced that he 's as good a republican as ever trod shoe leather . Bangall . Bangall Hurra for the Gineral ! Slang . Slang Major Roundtree says he 's a good democrat . Rowdie . Rowdie Gineral Fairweather forever ! Round . Roundtree Lets go then , boys , around to the other end of the house , and give in our votes for the General . Omnes . Omnes Hurra ! hurra ! ( Exeunt all but Supine . ) Supine , Supine ( solus . ) This is democracy with a vengeance ! The Major is very kind to them in one respect however  --  he saves them the trouble of thinking . For , to one who like myself has had sad experience in intellectual toil  --  in other words , the opus cogitantis ,  --  it is no little refreshment to be occasionally relieved from it . I 'll go and carry one vote to the polls at all events , but in bestowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of the General . ( Exit . ) SCENE IV . CATHARINE 'S PARLOR . Clara and Catharine seated . Cath . Catharine It has come to pass then , Clara , as I predicted . Place yourself in my situation , and you would resolve , as I do , not to be the cause of family dissention . Clara . Clara Worthington These prejudices are strong , but sometimes more violent than lasting . Cath . Catharine But , even if finally overcome , the thought that they once existed would be to me most painful . Clara . Clara Worthington Your feelings are too acute , Catharine . You must make some allowance for human infirmity , the force of education , and different habits of thinking . Cath . Catharine And it seems , too , that the General and my father have had an angry quarrel  --  and all on my account . Mr. Supine says it will insure Mr. Manly 's election . Do you know Mr. Manly ? Clara . Clara Worthington I ought to know him , Catharine ,  --  but men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor in the last twelve months , and from his own confessions would not give a feather to be elected , except to advance the cause which he has espoused . Indeed I almost dread to hear of his success . Cath . Catharine Why so , Miss Clara ? Why should Mr. Manly 's triumph or defeat interest you particularly ? Clara . Clara Worthington Indeed I do not know exactly ,  --  but I ,  --  at another time I will tell you . Noise without . Cath . Catharine What a tumult out of doors ! I suppose by this time the election is over . Clara . Clara Worthington Quite likely ,  --  but here comes one who will tell us all about it . Enter Worthington . Worth . Worthington I have most agreeable news for you both . Clara and Cath . Clara Worthington , Catharine ( rising . ) What can it be ? Worth . Worthington That General Fairweather will certainly be elected to Congress . You will be pleased , Clara , because if I mistake not I have heard you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reason to be delighted , not only because he is your father 's friend , but because it may probably occasion you a winter 's visit to Washington . Cath . Catharine Indeed , sir , I can not understand how the General 's election can possibly produce that consequence ; and as to his friendship for my father , that I understand has been suddenly turned into hate . Worth . Worthington And as suddenly again turned from hate into friendship . Cath . Catharine You astonish me ! Shouts without . Worth . Worthington Hear those shouts which are wafting the victor to the skies ! Your father has touched the key which produces that music , so grateful to political aspirants . To keep you no longer in suspense , the General and Major are perfectly reconciled ; and I am , moreover , authorised to say , that their friendship will be hereafter cemented by a strict matrimonial league between the families . ( Catharine hangs her head in confusion . ) Clara . Clara Worthington I told you , Catharine , that prejudice would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed . But this is so sudden a change , that were it not reported on such good authority , I could not credit it . Enter Mrs. Roundtree . Mrs. Round . Mrs. Roundtree Kate , my dear , have you heard the good news ? Your father and the Gineral are two of the best friends now in the world . Did'nt I tell you that if the Gineral could only get a peep at your face , he 'd be pacified in a moment ? Cath . Catharine He saw me only for a moment , madam . Worth . Worthington I verily believe , Miss Catharine , that single moment had it effect . Clara . Clara Worthington Oh certainly it had its effect . Did he not make a brief , but complimentary speech to us both ? Cath . Catharine I must still think that sudden changes of opinion are wrought by more efficient means . Clara . Clara Worthington For my part , if things are brought about precisely to my taste , I shall never inquire into the why 's and wherefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let the causes take care of themselves . Enter Supine . Sup . Supine Ladies , your humble servant . I congratulate you that this noisy election is over , and that the sovereign people are in a state of rapid dispersion . Worth . Worthington What is the true state of the poll , Mr. Supine ? Sup . Supine The General is some thirty votes ahead in the precinct , and his particular friends say , ergo , he is elected . My own opinion is , however , that the conclusion is a non sequitur . Enter Chipps . Chipps . Chipps Well , Miss Kate , we 've all done to-day exactly what your father told us . Cath . Catharine And what is that , Mr. Chipps ? Chipps . Chipps Why he told all us democrats , for a long time past , that Gin'ral Fairweather was a good honest republican ; then he told us again to-day that he was a federal whig aristocrat ; and , as we believed him before , we were obliged to believe him a second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , that he was entirely mistaken the second time  --  but was exactly right the first time ; so that as twice thinking right is better than once thinking wrong , we all concluded that the Major was right the first and last time , and wrong the second . So we all throw 'd up our hats and voted for the Gin'ral . Sup . Supine Jemmy , you are a very profound logician  --  and I think when the General gets to Congress , he ought , if possible , to procure you a professor ' chair . Chipps . Chipps Thank you , sir . If any body knows my capacity , it ought to be my teacher . Enter Major Roundtree . Round . Roundtree Hurra for old Virginy and General Fairweather ! Well  --  I can tell you what now , squire Worthington  --  the way in which we have laid Whiggery low to-day , is a caution . We have brought up the General to the front rank ,  --  and , unless there 's desertion in some of the other squads , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major of the second battalion . Worth . Worthington Very likely , Major  --  but my consolation is , that the cause of truth and justice is not more frequently decided rightfully at the polls than in the battle-field . In the one case , reason has to contend with the powerful antagonists of ignorance , prejudice and passion ,  --  whilst in the other , personal prowess , and superior skill in the use of steel and ball , are more available than the goodness of the cause . Sup . Supine In other words , the whole art of electioneering is conducted upon the principle of ad captandum vulgus . Enter Cato . Cato . Cato Ladies and gen'men , my master , General Fairweather , desire me to say that he and Mass Henry will pay their respects to you very soon , but an express has just come which bring intelligence about the election , and he 's now looking over the contents . Round . Roundtree Aye , that is news from the other parts of the district . A gold eagle to a shin plaister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , you shall be the happiest girl alive . Cath . Catharine Indeed , sir , the issue of the election , whatever that may be , will give me but little concern . Round . Roundtree Aye , aye  --  I suppose your thoughts are somewhat turned in another direction . Jenny enters , and whispers to Mrs. Roundtree , who takes Catharine out . Cato . Cato Mass Roundtree , if so be , you entertains no objection to it , I would like to speak a little word to you in private . ( They come to the front , apart from the rest . ) Round . Roundtree What have you to say ? Cato . Cato I have had a hint , sir , that my young Mass Henry is likely to make a match with young Misses , your daughter . Round . Roundtree Well , sir , what of that ? Cato . Cato I was thinking , sir , if so be it was agreeable , you 'd have no objection to another member of the family besides Mass Henry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cato . Cato Why , sir , I 's been talking the matter over with Miss Jinny , and I think we should like to make a match of it too . Round . Roundtree Odds bother it ! we are likely to have a merry making of it , sure enough . Well , sir , at another time we will think of the matter . For the present stand aside , as I see the General coming in . ( Cato goes to the back ground . ) Enter General Fairweather  --  Henry leading in Catharine , and Mrs. Roundtree following . Fair . General Fairweather My friends  --  I am pleased to see you all assembled here . I have just placed the hand of this fair girl into that of my son with their mutual consent , and have bestowed upon them a father 's preliminary blessing  --  to be followed speedily , I hope , by one of a more sacred character . I have done this with the conviction , sudden I acknowledge , but not less sincere on that account , that their happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their union ; and I may add , if a little selfishness be allowed to mingle with the pleasure of anticipation , that I shall hereafter have much need for their society . I have received undoubted intelligence that the public voice has consigned me this day to private life . Round . Roundtree What , General , not turned out ? Impossible ! Fair . General Fairweather It is true . The returns of course are not complete , but I learn enough to convince me , that by one of those singular reactions which take place in popular feeling , I am left at home by many hundred majority . Sup . Supine A pretty exact fulfilment , General , of my own prophecy . Chipps . Chipps I 'll be dog 'd if ever I hearn the like of it . Major , I wish I had bet the shin plaister agin your gold eagle . Round . Roundtree I confess I am confoundedly bothered ! Some treason in the camp . Worth . Worthington Well , Clara , what think you of this sudden turn ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that as Mr. Manly , the successful candidate , is the selected partner of your future destiny , you may be willing yourself to figure a winter or two in the circles of our republican court . Clara . Clara Worthington Indeed , sir , I do not know exactly what to think of that matter . I will patiently wait until I receive the invitation . Cath . Catharine Dear Clara , is it possible that Mr. Manly is the favored man ? Clara . Clara Worthington Many things are possible Catharine ! Fair . General Fairweather I have read a lesson in this day 's history , which I hope will not be lost . I have learned that to pursue the phantom of popular favor , regardless of right or wrong  --  to flatter the passions and follies of the multitude , with no better motive than our own advancement  --  is not only demoralising to them , but must , sooner or later , plant a thorn in our own bosoms to unfit us for the duties as well as for the happiness of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and renounce all ambitious aspirations . I shall content myself with the purer enjoyment of domestic peace , and shall endeavor to practice those various duties which are enjoined of a social , moral and created being . Sup . Supine Consilium admirabile ! FINIS .
