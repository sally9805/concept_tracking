Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : STANZAS. from Poems , in The rosary ( 1835 ) There lives a freedom in the Wind , when o'er the fields of Spring It roams with gladness unconfined , on rich and dewy wing ; It wakes unbidden melody where'er its wanderings lie ; It fans the soft and vernal earth  --  refreshes all the sky , It stirs the green leaves into sound , and haunts the forest glades , ' Till sweet and mournful tones are born within its peaceful shades ; And every brook that on its way goes murmuring along , In the old and solemn wilderness , adds to the free wind 's song . The Sea , the mighty Sea , is free ; and on its sounding shore Its hoarsely-thundering surges burst with deep and troubled roar ; The staggering ships , when tempests lower , sink down into the tide :  --  Wrecks of ambitious man are they , the remnants of his pride ! And yet above the flashing gem , the diamond and the pearl , The vast and foaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how beneath their spray , all whitening in the deep , The bones of the young and old are strewn , where lost affections sleep ! The soft blue streams of Spring are free , when , glittering in the sun , Far to the wide and heaving deep their pleasant waters run ; They sing to banks where early flowers perfume the sunny air , Unfolding all their tinted leaves  --  the beautiful and fair : Even the great earth is moving on , and brings each season round  --  The Summer hour , the Winter 's sere and melancholy ground : There 's freedom in the golden Cloud , which sails along the West , Dissolving in a sky of fire above the Ocean 's breast . And shall the clouds , and winds , and streams , be chainless all and free , O Man ! while fetters of the mind are lingering over thee ? Shall the soft harmonies that rise and fill the fields above , Pour through the arches of the sky the eloquence of love , While passions rude enthrall the soul , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in desolation proud ? Wake ! Let the sunbeams burn thereon , like Morning on the sea ,  --  The light which breaketh from above , and makes THE SPIRIT free ! Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : INFINITUDE. from Poems , in The rosary ( 1835 ) " Is not God in the height of Heavens ? And behold the height of the Stars , how high they are ! " Job XXII. 12 . Soar upward , boundless Thought ! Through the far evening skies direct thy way , Where , with deep glory fraught , The splendors of unnumbered star-beams play , Burning in azure fields ,  --  unwedded to Decay ! Earth hath its primal hours  --  The opening beauty of its peerless Spring , With all its leaves and flowers ; When Time goes by with radiance on his wing , O'er the ephemeral bloom , a rainbow spell to fling . Yet , to the pensive eye , That looks on Autumn in its blighted time , How sad  --  how silently Is changed the beauty of the young year 's clime ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its prime But , in the unbounded space , That brightly bends its calm blue arch above , Lingers undying grace  --  A glow , which Time 's dull lapse can ne'er remove  --  A halo of delight  --  a Cynosure of Love . Change comes not there , to dim The sapphire hues , that the pure heavens invest ; And the melodious hymn Of morning stars , in their far home of rest , Lifts high the praise of God , and stirs the throbbing breast . Kingdoms in dust are laid ; Column and fane in wrecks are overthrown ; The Pilgrim 's prayer is said ' Midst halls of mighty dead , with weeds o'ergrown , Where the green lizard broods on the damp threshold-stone . Names , lofty in their day , Fade like the sunset from the western sky ;  --  The soul deserts the clay , Death 's torpid seal is on the languid eye , And o'er the mouldering tomb , Oblivion 's wave goes by ! But still the glorious Heaven Uprears its mighty arch , by Death unwon , By storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may blot the sun , ' T is but a brief eclipse , whose shadows soon are done . Faint emblem of the glow  --  The flush of glories that beyond are spread :  --  To thy pure fount I bow Illumined Space !  --  throughout whose bounds was shed The radiance of that Star , which to the Savior led !
