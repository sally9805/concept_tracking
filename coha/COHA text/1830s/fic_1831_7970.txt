Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE ALCHYMIST. from The alchymist ( 1831 ) Thousands , with anxious care , have sought The key of Nature 's wealth to find  --  Strange these deep searchers never thought The spell of power was in the MIND . Wouldst be an Alchymist ?  --  Behold ! The sun on yonder cloud has beamed ! Mark the rich purple , crimson , gold  --  As seraph-robes o'er heaven had streamed . And dost thou gaze with raptured eye ? Do angel fancies thrill thy breast , And joy , that God has decked the sky As ' t were a mansion for the blest ? Then scale some lofty mountain 's height , And note the pleasant places round ; There dwell thy brothers ! Doth the sight Quicken thy pulse 's joyous bound ? Canst thou , with glad and grateful voice , Bless Him who makes man dwell secure , Nor covet aught thou seest ?  --  Rejoice ! Thou hast the golden secret sure ! S. J.
