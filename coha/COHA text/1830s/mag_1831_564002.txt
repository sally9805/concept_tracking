txt NO . III . IN the remarks I have made on the unparalleled progress of Ohio , I have scarcely hinted at the causes . These are principally four ; the moral energy of the population , the exclusion of slavery , the fertility of the soil , and the facilities for navigation . The last can not be overrated . To no spot on this planet has nature been more lavish of her rivers . To describe them belongs to the geographer . But let me ask , of what avail would these magnificent gifts have been to the West , without the labors of Watt and Fulton ? It is steam , which is building and peopling thesecities , andurging the march of empire westward . Ihaveno question that before twenty years have gone by , the majority of the pop .. ulation of the Union ,  --  if it last so long ,  --  will be found west of a north and south line drawn through the capital of Ohio . Cincinnati , the Empress of the West , will then be the geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved westward , here will it , most likely , be placed . Nor could its site be better chosen , for never was an inland city more easy of access from every quarter . And this we owe principally to Steam . Pittsburg has become our immediate neighbor , and the Gulf of Mexico is brought almost in sight . Steam has created for us Ports of Entry more than a thousand miles from the ocean . Banish steamboats from these vast rivers , and what would become of the cities that line their banks ? Suppose steamboats never to have been used , and tell me if these cities could by any possibility have attained their present magnitude in one century from this time ? I believe not . The Steam Engine is no subject for Poetry or Romance , but I must be cold-hearted if I could witness its achievements here without enthusiasm . Ask a citizen of the West , who are the greatest benefactors of modern times , and Watt and Fulton occur to him spontaneously ; the one , for perfecting the Steam Engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth all finished from the hand of Watt , as Minerva came all armed from the brain of Jupiter . But it was reserved for America , the native home of mighty rivers , to discover its most important function . Why do not the people of this valley erect a monument to Fulton , and place it on one of the loftiest hills that overlook the Ohio or Mississippi ? Antiquity would have raised altars and decreed divine honors to such a man . And , on second thought , Fulton has built his own monuments all over our waters . The three hundred steamboats this side of the Alleghanies , and the two hundred on the other , are so many glorious monuments of his stupendous benefaction . The first steamboat , called the New-Orleans , passed down the Ohio , just twenty years ago ; and well might the wood-nymphs retire in aifright from the noise of its machinery ; for it was the knell to their dominion over these vast solitudes . Now , it is no uncommon thing to count as many as fifteen or eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departing and others coming every hour , and a livelier scene can hardly be conceived . The greatest speed obtained in Fulton 's life-time , leaving wind and current out of the question , was ten miles an hour . Since that , it has been increased to nearly fourteen miles an hour . This would make three hundred and thirty-six miles a // da , y . What a rate to be moving , and that , too , with a motion so easy , so motionless , if I may so call it , as to invite rather than repel slumber ! Nor is it in propelling boats only , that steam is working its miracles here . I see and hear it wherever I turn . It moves our grist-mills , saw-mills , paper-mills . It labors in our factories , foundries , and breweries . A single engine supplies Cincinnati with water from the river , which it forces up into a reservoir more than a hundred feet above high water mark ; while hundreds are fabricated every season to work on the sugar plantations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not justified in pronouncing the invention of the Steam Engine to be the most important which history has recorded ? If we of this age do not believe so , future times will . Or if they make any exception it will be in favor of printing , for nothing else has any pretensions to competition on the score of utility . Printing has been eloquently described as " binding the whole human raee of uncounted millions , into one gigantic rational being , whose memory reaches to the beginnings of written records , and retains imperishably the events which have occurred . " With equal truth may it be said that the Steam Engine furnishes for this gigantic rational being an accomplished , tractable , never-tiring , Herculean servant , with muscles of iron and a soul of fire , to perform all the labor and drudgery , which his ever increasing wants may require . Remember that I do not now speak of this engine as an exquisite specimen of mechanical contrivance , which it preeminently is ; but I speak of it as the instrument through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime moving forces . Before this invention , the principal moving forces were Gravitation , Wind , and Animal Strength . Compare Steam with either of these , as a prime mover , and for all practical purposes it will be found immeasurably superior . Compare it first with Gravitation . This can act but in one direction ; that acts in *Jl directions . This would suffice , if the course of things on earth were one everlasting downhill ; that makes the distinction between uphill and downhill almost insignificant . This can carry a boat tardily from Pittsburgh to New-Orleans , but can never bring it back ; that scarcely heeds the existence of the current , equally despising its help or its obstruction . On the smooth lake or sea , Gravitation is useless ; but there Steam acts to its utmost advantage . Formerly mills could only be placed by falls of water , and then whole regions , like our immense prairies , must have been necessarily without them ; but now we find them placed any where and every where , according to the con*enience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to Gravitation . Compare it next with Wind . The wind bloweth where it listeth ; obeying a higher power than man , it is never constant either in direction or intensity . Now it blows this way , now that . To-day we have a tempest approaching to a hurricane , sweeping and devastating all before it . Tomorrow the whole atmosphere rests in torpid stillness , the sails flag , and the vessel becomes a ' motionless mass , supine and sluggish on the dead surface of the waters . Not so with Steam . That is subject to the control of man , and acts in the direction and with the intensity he chooses . Amid storm and calm , against wind and tide and with them , the vessel urged by Steam pursues its way , unheeding // qwq // 494 Recollections of the Hospital . So many of the patients who come before us , are afflicted with troublesome rather than dangerous complaints , that we may sometimes be excused for lighter feelings than those of compassion . I hope the dignitaries of Broad-street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for saying that a smile is frequently excited by the children of Hibernia . They have such peculiar notions about the position of certain organs , and the nature of certain functions , that the trained student can not sometimes but look with astonishment at their startling innovations . The gentle viscus which is commonly thought the seat of the affections , in their anatomy ranges about among its less interesting neighbors from the throat to the liver , and the stomach possesses absolute ubiquity . A great Irishman was brought up into the operating theatre , the other morning , for the class to have a look at . According to his own story , he had had violent hands , or rather fists , laid on him , and two ofhis enthusiastic antagonists planting a blow on either cheek at the same time , it was a lamentable fact that his lower jaw had gone into three pieces ; but I knocked down two of them , he added , as well as his misfortune would let him . I have been informed that the worthy magistrate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his jaw , a circumstance , however , more amusing , than probable . Honest John - , with his saffron face and his rebellious digestives , has gone away now , and I may venture a stern-chaser at the little fellow , without f*aring an indictment for a libel . Taken in connexion with his multitudinous envelopes , the little gentleman might have put the beam of the Hospital scales into perplexity , if there had been a hundred pounds at the other end of it . His voice was of that peculiar kind , which we sometimes find in those whom the tailor and the census recognize as men , but which nature has more generally appropriated to the softer sex . His face might be considered under two aspects ; the state of quiescence and that of action . When undisturbed it was as innocent looking a polygon as ever flesh was sharpened into , but , when he spoke or smiled , it eddied into a perfect whirlpool of wrinkles , so that it seemed as if every feature were squirming with its own independent vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stamina enough about him to do any thing with a potato after he had swallowed it , it would be hard to say , for the bog it grew in could not have sat heavier on his soul ; but for that most intractable of delicacies , he once saw fit to relinquish the water-gruel he had been ordered . Of this he was solemnly accused before the morning tribunal . " No sir , " said the dove-eyed offender . The fact was supported by witnesses . When a man fails in receiving credence for a simple denial , he is apt to have recourse to the " lie with a circumstance . " But the lie with a circumstance may be refuted or involve contradiction , and it is a much safer method to prove by abstract reasoning that the thing is altogether improbable or impossible . The ingenious culprit thus overwhelmed by evidence , had recourse to this kind of demonstration . He pointed out with eloquence the folly and enormity of the offence , the utter abhorrence with which he should shrink from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , had it been felony , he would have been hanged , and furnished all the morning papers a paragraph ending with launched into eternity . " // There was a poor girl , who , at the age of eighteen , has since been laid in her humble grave , whom her youth and sufferings made to all an object of pity . Her disease was known to be incurable , and , in the very dawn of her Jife , she had nothing to look forward to , but the weary interval of conflict before it had fretted away the threads that held her to a wretched existence . It seemed a mockery of hope and happiness , to see her gasping at the window in the bright mornings of spring . Throughout the wide prospect , the freshness of the early year was breathing over the fields , and the hills , and the waters , while she , with the arrow of death even then quivering in her heart , looked faintly out upon them , as if she thought the spirit , that was shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more give warmth to the springs of health that were freezing in their fountain . How different is the aspect of death at the different seasons . In summer , how fearful is the change that a few hours will leave upon the features , and how short must be the interval between the chamber of sickness and the dark stillness of the sepulchre . In autumn , the path to the tomb is strewed with fallen leaves , the grass of the church-yard is brown and withered , and their decay , at all times dreary , seems doubly desolate , as we pass away , and leave the dead to the sleep which will not wake when the earth above them is green , and the naked branches overshadow them with of the vault , and , with the parting smile upon its unaltered features , we leave the form we have loved in the very clasp of the ungentle elements . The smile of death ! how many speak of it , as if it were the farewell of an untroubled spirit to the body it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal , which the destroyer had set in mockery on his victim ; as if the wild bird should spread his bright wings over the prey that was reeking in his talons . Nothing that comes before us is so distressing as the suffering of children . The poor little things are so transformed in every thing by its influence , that we can hardly recognize , in them , the beings that were lately playing about us . I saw two children , the other day , by the side of each other , one of them in full health , with the exception of a trifling complaint , and the other , panting upon her death-bed . But there was neither terror nor sadness in the wild eyes of the rosy girl ; and , the next morning , when the pillow of the sick child was vacant , she looked at it with a curious kind of expression , in which seriousness formed one of the smallest constituents . An infant , a few months old , was brought into the operating room , a short time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife of the surgeon . The little creature looked up at the crowd of strange faces , and then at the glittering instruments , and smiled as well as it could with its ghastly features ; it did seem like a sin to torture it , but it was necessary , and it was done . If that infant should live to maturity , I should love to ask what were its earliest recollections . Few subjects are more painfully interesting than the physiognomy of sickness . Pain , in different degrees of intensity and duration , and many diseases which work , almost unfelt , at the yielding foundations of health , leave upon the countenance many shades of expression , which are evident to those accustomed to observe every indication of morbid // changes . Even in the ignorance of my unfinished novitiate , I have sometimes found that a very shallow experience had taught me more ' than was for my own happiness . To look at the young and beautifuJ , and to read the death-mark upon them as plainly , as if , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and followed the visionary procession from their thresholds to the church-yard , is no enviable faculty . Before we leave the subject , let us take one general look around the walls which these cursory glances may have already rendered tiresome . In one face we see the expression of anxiety and uneasiness , which it may have taken years of noiseless suffering to wear so deeply into the features ; and then we may come to a row of dyspeptics , with their cold feet and blue lips , looking like a border of frost-bitten violets . We pass by the bed of the next sufferer in silence , for his damp forehead , and fixed eye , and curled up limbs , tell us that he is in the arms of the king of terrors . The next cheek is not pale , but its warmth is the flush of hectic , flickering up from the ashes that still hold a few decaying embers . And now we come to disease in its loathsomeness ; but , as few are called to endure , few need be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apologize for such an article , but I can not think there is pedantry in trying to interest others , for a few moments , in subjects which occupy our thoughts and feelings habitually , though I am sensible that both our thoughts and our feelings , and even ourselves , may be matters of total indifference to our readers.
