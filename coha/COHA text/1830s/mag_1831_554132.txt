txt Mr. Stewart , on commencing the duties of his profession , conceived himself to be specially called to engage in the Christian Mission to the Sandwich Islands , where he took his station in 1823 , with the other Missionaries who had established themselves there three years before . In 1825 , the declining health of Mrs. Stewart , who had accompanied her husband on the mission , rendered it necessary for them to return home , and leave to others the hopeful and already gloriously successful work of christianizing and civilizing the successor of Tamehameha and his subjects . On returning to the United States , Mr. Stewart published his journal of a Residence in the Sandwich Islands , ' which was re-published in England , where , as // well as in this country , it has been very generally read . It is an exceedingly interesting work , and together with Mr. Ellis 's Tour through Hawaii , has made the world acquainted , not only with the progress of the Mission , but also the geography , physical features , state of cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their inhabitants . We have already* vindicated the missionaries against some of the aspersions and misrepresentations promulgated in the account of the voyage of Blonde , under the command of Lord Byron , and in an article on that work in the London Quarterly Review.t In a notice of Mr. Ellis 's Tour , we have also in a former numbert given an account of the state of the missions in 1825 , and an outline of the recent history and present state of these islands . Though , after Mr. Stewart 's return to the United States , it was found that a residence of one year at home had partially restored Mrs. Stewart 's health , yet as her physicians interdicted her return to a tropical climate , and exposure to the hardships and privations of a missionary life , her husband was prevented from rejoining his brethren at the islands , and left to seek some other scene of labor . Accordingly , at the expiration of his engagement with the Missionary Society , he made application for a chaplainship in the navy , to which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of again visiting the Sandwich Islands . During the voyage in the United States ' frigate Guerriere , under the command of Commodore Thompson , to Rio de Janeiro and thence to Lima , and the voyage thence in the ship of war Vincennes , commanded by Captain Finch , to the South Sea Islands , and thence home by the way of Canton , Manilla , and the Cape of Good Hope , Mr. Stewart kept a journal in letters addressed to Mrs. Stewart , which he had no intention to publish at the time of writing those relating to the earlier part of the cruise , though he no doubt supposed they would be read by his friends . They are , therefore , by no means filled with incidents and reflections , which could be interesting only to the parties to the correspondence . With the exception of some erasures in the journal , and of some additions to the last letter dated at Rio de Janeiro , relating to Mr. Tudor , the whole remains , says the // author , almost word for word as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amidst the conversation of his companions for the voyage , and within hearing of all the bustle and din of a man-of-war . Mr. Stewart sailed from Norfolk on board of the Guerriere , early in February , 1829 , in his new capacity of chaplain of a man-of-war , but better accommodated for comfort , reading , writing , or contemplation , than most chaplains of men-of-war , or sea-faring journalists , as he occupied a state-room in the cabin . He describes the forward or diniug-cabin as being an octagon of so me twenty feet in diameter , partitioned off so as to exclude the guns , without any garnishment of battleaxes , cutlasses , shot-boxes , or pistols , on the walls , and well carpeted , so that the party arranged at the centre-table in the evening , had an air of domestic comfort , and presented a parlor-like aspect , while the winter blasts were whistling in the rigging . But with all possible accommodations , a man-ofwar is not the most favorable place to study and philosophize . Five hundred men , settled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily jostle each other , and one is obliged to hear many voices that strike harshly upon the ear , besides that of the tempest . But this dense population of the floating territory , gave it an increased interest to Mr. Stewart , who says that he had long since learned to have a regard for the character of the sailor , to admire his warm-heartedness , his clannish partiality , which leads him to hail every round jacket and tarpaulin hat , as the signals of a brother ; his recklessness of danger , and regardlessness of self ; his good-humor , gaiety of spirit , and credulity tinctured with superstition . Nor were they objects of a merely quiescent contemplative interest and curiosity to one who had conscientiously devoted his life to the reclaiming of men from the errors of their opinions and ways , and who seems to be animated by a still youthful , philanthropie and pious ardor to lead his fellow-men from darkness to the light , as yet undamped by the perverseness , hard-heartedness , and ingratitude , which are apt , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence , and teach one to become indifferent to the fate of others , through despair of serving them . He accordingly labored with untiring , and as we should judge , well-directed zeal , as a faithful pastor of his moving parish . He succeeded in gaining a prompt and devout attention to the daily and weekly religious services , in which the crew became more // and more interested in the course of the voyage . He seems to have persuasively won upon the affections , and attracted the confidence of many of these rough and stern combaters with the elements , and had the satisfaction of believing that a deep and permanent religious impression had been made upon the minds of some , evinced by a striking change in their language and manners . On leaving the Guerriere for the Vincennes , at the port of Callao , he accordingly had the satisfaction of receiving the warmest acknowledgements of gratitude from many of the crew of the former , for his moral and religious instruction , and a general demonstration of personal regard . This Journal is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only to show how much may be done for the moral improvement , obedient and orderly deportment , and discipline of a crew in the naval service , by the assiduous , kindly intended , and judiciously directed labors of the chaplain . For this purpose , however , he must have the countenance of the officers , as Mr. Stewart had in this voyage , being early informed by Commodore Thompson , that it was his wish , as well as that of Captain Smith , the next officer in rank , to have daily public prayers on board , according to the prescribed , though previously disregarded , rule of the naval service . The time of sunset was fixed upon for this purpose , when fair weather permitted ; the occupations of the numerous , busy company ceased at the appointed signal , and all gathered quietly round the chaplain , some fifty or sixty midshipmen pressing closely to him , and the numerous congregation of the men forming the exterior circle ; all giving serious and respectful attention while he read a hymn or a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a short prayer , the whole exercises not occupying longer than ten minutes at the most . To conduct these religious exercises with success , the person leading in them must be sincere and devout , and have professional talent and address ; but he must also be skilled in social and conventional proprieties and conveniences , and limit himself suitably in time , and choose his topics and expressions with discretion and a proper adaptation to his auditory , otherwise the decorum , solemnity , and devoutness of the exercises will be dissipated , and their utility defeated . In the latter part of March , the Guerriere entered the harbor of Rio de Janeiro . After passing Cape Frio , the general // line of the coast trends off to the south-west , from which a bay makes up into the interior in a northerly direction some seventy or eighty miles , about midway of which on the westerly shore stands the city . In approaching the harbor from sea , you pass on your left the Sugar Loaf , with its steep , inaccessible sides , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on your right the fort and long line of fortifications . Before you is the bay , studded with beautiful islands , stretching up into the country , where the prospect is bounded in the far distance by the lofty fantastic peaks of the Organ mountains . The right shore is bordered by luxuriant plantations , sprinkled with white cottages , monasteries , and the towers of churches , with rugged mountains again in the back-ground , fringed with dark forests towards their bases , and projecting their naked tops high into the air . On the left you pass the narrow inlet of the deeply embosomed bay of Botafogo , as tranquil and secluded as a Scotch highland loch , with the palace , and here and there a fisherman 's hut on its border , and numerous sea-fowl above , wheeling to and from their nests in the crags of the steep sides of the surrounding hills . You next pass , on the same side , the wide-sweeping Praya de Flamengo , or beach of the Flamengos , about a mile in extent , along which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansions . The next object on the same side is the Gloria Hill , with the church of our Lady of Glory , a small white octagon , surmounted with lofty , well-proportioned towers , surrounded and partly overhung with trees and shrubbery . Up the valley between this hill and the city , you then open a view of the massy arches of the stupendous aqueduct for conveying water from the neighboring mountains to the city . After you pass this opening , the shor'e shoots up in another bill , capped by a gloomy looking and decaying pile of monastic building , and then the city presents itself , situated mostly on a low level , interspersed among abrupt hills , with its steeples , and towers , and a forest of masts , in the fore-ground . In the centre of the city , a small steep hill rises to the height of two hundred feet , the summit of which is the site of the massive architecture of the episcopal palace , having another hill a little to the westward , the top of which is occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a distance , you see mountains with spire-like or truncated tops , and dark , naked sides , towering into the skies . Such are some of the more striking points in the author 's description of one of the most magnificent landscapes in the world . // Immediately on landing , Mr. Stewart repaired to the residence of Mr. Tudor , at that time Charg6 d'dffaires of the United States in Brazil , whose many amiable qualities and accomplishments , and numerous public services , particularly in his diplomatic character in Brazil , give him ample claims to commemoration , and who is especially entitled to be remembered in this Journal , of which he was the original editor . His residence was at the Praya de Flamengo , already mentioned , where , though the parties were not before personally acquainted , Mr. Stewart was received with the easy grace and frank cordiality for which Mr. Tudor was so much distinguished . He passed the two weeks , while the Guerriere remained at that port , in the society of Mr. Tudor , with the best possible advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his departure took leave of his host with deep regret and painful emotion ; ' not to see him again , for Mr. Tudor 's decease took place before Mr. Stewart had completed his voyage . Mr. Stewart says of him ; He is one of the most talented , extensively informed , and truly amiable men , I have ever met . Received by him with the cordiality of a brother , and admitted at once to the confidence of his bosom , I discovered , during the fortnight of our companionship , traits so noble and fascinating , as to excite an admiration I have seldom known for one not decidedly spiritual in his character , and to win an attachment I can never forget . ' We pass over the author 's observations in the capital of Brazil , the stormy passage round Cape Horn , the visit to Valparaiso , and his account of men , manners , and things at Callao and Lima . On the 4th of July he was transferred to the Vincennes , commanded by Captain Finch . The first night after sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew were alarmed by the cry of a man . overboard . ' The subject of the alarm was a boy of about fifteen , who had dropped overboard . He was soon picked up , and the crew thus saved the ominous presage of commencing the cruise with a funeral . The boy did not take the incident very grievously to heart , for on scrambling over the ship 's side and regaining the deck , looking at his naked foot , he very coolly remarked , i 'll be hanged *f one of my shoes a' n't gone . ' The religious exercises were conducted on board of the Vincennes , as they had been in the Guerriere ; with the only // difference , that instead of assembling the crew by the sound of the boatswain 's pipe , and a hoarse call around the decks , . dll hands to prayers , ahoy ! ' the band , as soon as the bell struck the hour , played the Portuguese hymn , as the signal and as a prelude to the worship , while the men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the devotions , who , as a substitute for a pulpit , stood upon a shot-box by the capstan , upon which the American ensign was spread instead of a cushion . After the religious services , on the Sunday before making the Washington Islands , Captain Finch , by a written order , which was publicly read to the crew , announced to them , that some of the objects of the cruise were to secure a harmonious intercourse between the natives of the islands about to be visited , and the sea-faring Americans who might be compelled in their commercial pursuits to put into the same harbors for refreshments and supplies ,  --  to reclaim such men as might have been left upon those islands ; to make some impression upon the islanders in respect to our national character , and to encourage them in the arts of civilization . He instructed the crew , that for these purposes , a propriety of conduct on their part would be requisite , and informed them that he should prohibit the natives from coming on board , unless under peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usage of the ship in other ports . ' He also intimated that the natives should be treated with respect . The reasons for treating the islanders with some respect , as a sovereign and independent people , having national attributes and rights , appear in the remarks of Mr. Stewart , Vol. 1 , p. 317 , where he says , that he is fully persuaded that their fierce , vindictive deportment to foreigners , is attributable , in at least a majority of cases , to the wrongs , frauds , and contempts committed among them by persons , who regard them as being scarcely above the brutes . To remove , as much as possible , the impressions thus made upon their minds , Captain Finch resolved to treat the chiefs with respect . Passing near to Huahuka , the first of those islands in their course , they proceeded to Nukuhiva , about thirty miles to the south , the same island at which Captain Porter refitted during the last war , and which was the scene of a great part of the events recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he took a part as an auxiliary to one of the belligerent // tribes . Mr. Stewart gives a very good description of the scenery of this island , and the manners , modes of life , and social , or rather savage condition of its inhabitants . Their are similar to those of the Marquesas group , lying further to the westward , and he avails himself of the journal of Mr. Crook , a missionary at these islands in 1797-98 , for an account of some peculiarities in their institutions and modes of thinking , with which he could not have made himself well acquainted during his short stay . According to Mr. Crook , there is nothing like civil authority in these islands . The people are free from all rule and restraint . If one man receives an injury from another ,  --  is defrauded , robbed , or assaulted by him ,  --  instead of entering a complaint to the chief , or seeking redress according to some established usage of the country , he at once resorts to the prowess of his own arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or if restrained by the fear of the power or influence of the aggressor , standing at a distance , he expends his anger in fierce gestures and loud declamations against the infringement of his rights . Such is the relation between the chiefs and the people ; it confers on the former little influence or authority , except that arising from aristocratic birth and large possessions , and exacts from the latter the ordinary marks only of respect and good will . ' There is evidently a striking resemblance in some respects , between the mythology of these and the Sandwich islands and that of Greece . In both systems , for example , a dead hero becomes a god . But the Marquesans refine upon this ,  --  for which they have , however , the authority of the Romans ,  --  deus est nobis ,  --  for they worship and sacrifice to living men , who claim the title and attributes of the Deity , not through a professed inspiration , or possession by a supernatural influence or power , but in their own right of godship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth fruitful or sterile , inflict diseases and death . Though the gods of various classes are sufficiently numerous , those of this description are very few , not exceeding one , or at most two , on an island . There was none near the place where the Vincennes touched at Nukuhiva , though the former abode of one was pointed out to Mr. Stewart . Mr. Crook gave an account of one in Tahuata , an island in the Marquesan group , at the time of his residence there , in 1797 . He was then of great age , and lived in a large house surrounded by an enclosure . From the beams of the house within , and // upon the trees around , were suspended by the heels the corpses of human victims , which had been sacrificed to him , the heads being scalped . No one beside his servant was permitted to enter his house , except for the purpose of bringing human sacrifices , of which more were offered to him than to any other of their gods , and he frequently seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and called for two or three at a time . Human sacrifices were frequent in the Sandwich islands , as well as in the Marquesas . Victims were obtained in war , or by stealing them from a neighboring tribe , as is now practised in those islands to which the labors of the missionaries have not yet extended , the inhabitants of which retain what was considered , at the time of Cook 's voyages , their amiable mildness . A cause of the war raging between two tribes of Nukuhiva , at the time of the visit of the Vincennes , was the stealing of a family to be sacrificed . But war and man-stealing were not the only means of supply . If a priest , in the name of some god , called for the sacrifice of men , the tabu was sometimes resorted to ; an order being issued , for instance , that nobody should go upon the water , eat a certain description of food , touch another , &amp;c. for a certain number of days ; and whoever , through temptation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tabu , was forthwith seized and sacrificed to appease the adored anthropophagus . Mr. Ellis mentions an instance in Oahu , where a man went out into the harbor in the surf , where he appeared to be drowning ; and an old man seeing his apparent danger , went to his assistance , and took hold of him for the purpose of saving him . This was a violation of the tabu . The decoyer there*. upon swam away very briskly , and the old man was seized and sacrificed . These people have a complete feudal system of their own , as far as the property in land is concerned ; the whole of which belongs to the higher orders , civil and religious , the boundaries of each manor being accurately defined . The rest of the population are mere dependants and servants of the land proprietors . Mr. Stewart relates an instance of those atrocities which are so often committed upon these islanders by foreigners , belonging to civilized communities , and which would disgrace the most savage of the savages . In exploring a delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same tribe with which Captain // Porter carried on a short war in behalf of the United States ,  - -  as Mr. Stewart and his companions were passing a neat looking house of a chief , a man apparently about forty years of age , of a good figure , amiable aspect , and respectable appearance , beckoned to them with his fan , from the elevated platform surrounding his dwelling , and invited them to call . They remarked a settled sadness in the countenances of the chief and the females constituting his family . They had heard , since arriving at the island , that not long before , an american whaling ship had approached the island , and hove to off one of its little bays , as if desirous to communicate with the shore ; whereupon a large canoe put off , with seven men , five of whom were received on board of the whaling ship , which then stood off from the land . The three stoutest were selected and retained on board , probably to supply a vacancy made by death or desertion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their lives , the two left in the canoe having paddled for the shore , supposing all their companions to have been carried off to sea . Such was the act of piracy committed by one of our whaling ships , according to the account of the islanders . One of the three men thus kidnapped , was a young chieftain and only son , and the family which Mr. Stewart and his companions stopped to visit , consisted of bis parents , his wife , and his sisters . When the whaling vessel is filled , he will be put ashore at the first inhabited , or perhaps uninhabited island , possibly a thousand miles from Nukuhi-va , and left to get home as he can or perish , while the owners of the whaling ship will carry a share of the cargo to the credit of the profit and loss account of the voyage . The family had recorded the time of his being kidnapped , by adding a knot in a string at every full moon , making the time of the piracy the month of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincennes . The relatives of the stolen chief told the story of this atrocity to their visiters , and mingled with their tears earnest entreaties that Captain Finch would use his endeavors to have the object of their affections and hopes restored to them ; which he readily J ) romised . It is to be hoped , for the cause of humanity , that a suitable infamy and punishment will light upon the perpetrators of a crime so savage . The journal of the visit to Nukuhiva is full of interest . The descriptions are generally very graphical ; the inquiries and observations are made with much industry and intelligence , // and the remarks are characterized by candor and good sense . An admirable description is given of a water-fall , near to the house of the chief whose son was carried off by the piratical whalers . A small river gushes from an opening between two bushy precipices , and dashes in broken sheets down a descent of seventy or eighty feet , into a little deep basin in an offset of the rock , and concealed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing to the right it tumbles along successive shelves , nearly perpendicularly , again about two hundred feet into a quiet basin at the bottom . The scene is rendered more picturesque , by groups of natives with their loose garments streaming in the wind at different points in the fall , some standing at the top and apparently on the edge of the precipice . The Vincennes next proceeded to Tahiti , ( Otaheite , ) a distance of seven hundred miles westwardly . This and the Society Islands ying near , have been the scene of a great revolution , since missionaries were first sent to them by the London Missionary Society in 1797 . It was , however , many years before any effects of their labors appeared , so that in 1813 they reported only fifty converts . In 1815 , the number had increased to about five hundred in all the islands , many of them being pupils of the missionary school established at the small island of Eimeo ; an illustration , among a thousand others , that instruction in the rudiments of learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effectual means of Christianizin0 the heathen . Soon afterwards an additional number of missionaries was sent out , and the people now began rapidly to abandon their old idolatry , until , in a few years , the great mass of the population discarded their former worship , used the uncouth images of their gods for fire-wood , declared themselves Christians , built places of worship , and have since been diligent pupils in the schools , and devout worshippers in their chapels . The South Sea Academy , established on the small island of Eimeo , lying about fifteen miles west of Tahiti , and which has been the great engine of the conversion and civilization of these islanders , is a very respectable seminary . The pupils are tau 0ht in books printed in their own language , which has been reduced to writing by means of an alphabet constructed upon principles proposed in Europe , and simultaneously published by Mr. John Pickering in America , in the transac // tions of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . The seminary is situated at Afareitu , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel , and cottages of the natives stretch along the shore , making an extensive range of white buildings on the water 's edge , beneath mountains rising almost perpendicularly nearly three thousand feet high ; and presenting a striking landscape , which combines magnificent natural scenery , with the monuments of the arts of civilization . Another monument of the triumph of both Christianity and the arts in those regions , is a chapel at another part of the same island . It is an octagon sixty or seventy feet in diameter , constructed of hewn coral , in appearance not unlike light freestone or marble ; well plastered and white-washed within , and furnished with convenient seats , a gallery , and a well designed and well finished pulpit , all of the wood of the bread-fruit tree . A no less striking monument of the progress of improvement is a turnpike road , made by convicts condemned to hard labor , for various breaches of the laws . It extends nearly a hundred miles , all around the island of Tahiti ; is a broad gravel way constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well finished , and crossing the streamlets from the mountains by narrow plank bridges . Though this is the work of convicts , it illustrates not the less the liberal and enlightened policy of the Government , in the application of the industry which is at its immediate disposal . This road we consider to be a very strong proof of civil progress and economical improvement . A people that can accomplish such a work ought no longer to be considered as savages . Another evidence of the same sort , is the code of written laws drawn up by Mr. Nott , one of the missionaries , and now adopted , and practically administered in the Society Islands . This code distinctly defines offences , and annexes to each its appropriate punishment . About the middle of September , 1829 , the Vincennes left the Society Islands , on a passage of twenty-five hundred miles to the Sandwich Islands , where Mr. Stewart found himself again in the scene of his former missionary labors . It was now but four years since he left the islands , and but ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of the absurd and cruel rites of pagan superstition , four missionaries arrived at these islands from the United States , namely , Messrs . Bingham , Thurs // 496 Stewart 's Voyage to the South Sea . ton , Ruggles , and Whitney , with Dr. Holman , a physician , Mr. Loomis , a printer , and Mr. Chamberlain , an agriculturist . Afterwards , as we have mentioned , Mr. Stewart joined the mission , and also Mr. Ellis , who had been long a missionary in the Society Islands , under the patronage of the London Missionary Society . They have since been joined by others , the names of fourteen , in all , being given in a letter addressed to Captain Finch , in 1829 ; namely , Messrs . Bingham , Richards , Andrews , Bishop , Clark , Shephard , Thurston , Goodrich , Green , Chamberlain , Judd , Ruggles , Gulic , and Whitney . Though the chiefs of these islands had not any other gods to prevent their embracing Christianity , yet there were sufficiently formidable obstacles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk in the darkest ignorance , the only amelioration as yet being , that this darkness was not haunted by the cruel imaginary demons of their former worship . They had no letters . They had but recently been sacrificers of human victims . Custom permitted them to expose their aged sick relatives to perish of hunger . Infanticide was frequent , it being the practice with the mothers of sick or troublesome children , a year or two , more or less , old , to dig a hole in the earth in their cabin , as a grave for the living child , to which they consigned it , first stopping its cries by putting a piece of cloth over its mouth . The maternal feeling that n*iturally triumphs over all others , was so entirely extinguished in these savage mothers , that they would , apparently without any compunction , walk over the recent grave of their infant , in the pursuit of their daily employments . At the decease of any principal chief , amidst the wailing and transports of grief , which broke out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all laws took place ; acts of violence were done and even murders committed , being prompted by long remembered grudges , and a thirst of revenge ; and indiscriminate licentiousness without distinction of ranks , was among these funeral rites . The whole population were thieves , drunkards , and desperate gamblers . The women , who had been degraded into mere slaves , were raised in rank and consideration by Rihoriho , but they were exceedingly debased in morals and habits , and their licentiousness of manners was promoted by the visits of foreign ships . Such , and worse in some particulars , were the Sandwich // Islanders ten years before the visit of the Vincennes ; and though their imaginary gods had been in a great measure already displaced , a field of sufficiently arduous labor was presented to the small corps of missionaries , to reclaim a hundred and fifty thousand savages from their darkness , brutal debasement , and wickedness . They had already been reduced to that number by their wars , crimes , and vices , since the discovery of the islands by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to have amounted to four hundred thousand . The changes and improvements that have taken place in these ten years , and especially during the last four , is truly astonishing ; but the representations of some of the foreign residents , that the labors of these ministers of religion and civilization have been disastrous to the islanders , is really unaccountable . That there is no l ) retence for these representations , is demonstrated by a flood of testimony that is quite irresistible ; but what is really surprising , and almost incredible , is , that , with all this testimony before their eyes , men should be so vicious , and so perverted by a supposed present interest in perpetuating the ignorance of the natives in order to make them the fitter subjects of frauds , or by their desire of a clear field for unrestrained indulgence , as to charge these missionaries with having brought misfortunes and misery upon the natives . It is well known that some of the foreign residents in the South Sea islands , have , from the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feelings found their way into the account of the voyage of Lord Byron in the Blonde , and also into the article on that voyage in the London Quarterly Review for March , 1827 ; and that , in the same number , was published a pretended letter of Boki , a chief of the Sandwich islands , complaining of the missionaries ; which letter was fabricated , probably , in the Sandwich islands , and afterwards a little dressed up for publication in London . The missionaries accordingly had , for a time , a formidable array of oppositiQn ; misrepresentations of their detractors at the islands were re-echoed by the editors of the Voyage ' of the Blonde , and countenanced by the Quarterly Review . This was ungenerous treatment , and even persecution in one form , of a set of men , who have rendered one of the most signal services to the cause of Christianity and civilization , since the Reformation . We do not mean to pronounce an // unqualified eulogy upon all the thirty or forty missionaries in the South Seas , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing his life . But admitting some of them , or all of them , to have made mistakes , and in some instances to have stepped beyond the proper sphere of their functions ,  --  as it is very possible they may occasionally have done , and afforded just ground for some small part of the many complaints made against them ,  --  still they deserve to he commemorated in the annals of Christianity and civilization , as among the distinguished benefactors of mankind , the effects of whose labors will continue to ameliorate the condition of whole tribes and nations for many generations to come . It will be sufficient to mention some few facts , to show the greatly improved character and condition of the inhabitants of these islands . The Vincennes touched first at the eastern side of the island of Hawaii , ( Owhyhee , ) the easternmost and principal of the Sandwich Islands , the other six being scattered along at different distances , within three hundred miles , to the north-west . Mr. Stewart visited Hawaii in 1825 , in the Blonde , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just commenced in the island , it being only two years after Mr. Ellis and three other missionaries had made a tour round it near the shore , for the purpose of fixing on missionary stations . These pioneers , at the time of making their tour , preached two or three times a day at the different villages to as numerous congregations as could then he collected , being usually from fifty to one hundred and fifty . At the very place visited by the Blonde in 1825 , where the first rays of light were then feebly glimmering upon the minds of the natives , Mr. Stewart and the officers of the Vincennes , in 1829 , after the conclusion of the services on hoard of the ship , attended public worship on Sunday , in an immense structure , capable of containing many thousands , every part of which was filled , except a small area in front of the pulpit reserved for them , to which they made their way in slow and tedious procession , from the difficulty of finding a spot to place even their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated on their feet as closely almost as they could be stowed ; ' and still many were excluded for want of room . On their entering , the minister , Mr. Goodrich , paused in his discourse until they were seated . The suspense of attention in the people was only momentary , notwithstanding the entire novelty to them , // of laced coats , cocked hats , and other appendages of the naval uniform . ' I can scarce describe , ' says Mr. Stewart , the emotion experienced in glancing an eye over the immense number , seated so thickly on the matted floor as to seem literally one mass of heads , covering an area of more than nine thousand square feet . The sight was most striking , and soon became , not only to myself , but to some of my fellow officers , deeply affecting . It seemed , even while I gazed , that the majesty of Divine power might be seen rising and erecting to itself a throne , permanent as glorious , in the hearts of these but lately benighted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been once known to me , and as they now appeared , the change seemed the effect of a mandate scarce less mighty in its power , or speedy in its result , than that exhibited when it was said , let there be light , and there was light . ' The same spirit moves the general multitude of the inhabitants throughout these islands . It is not an ecstatic , evanescent fit of uninformed enthusiasm . A very large part of the population show a devout and earnest disposition to be instructed , not only in the doctrines of Christianity , but also in the habits , manners , and arts of civilized life . They present the grand spectacle of a whole people , including both sexes and all ages and conditions , going to school together to learn to write their own language in its new alphabet , and taking the first feeble steps in the long career in the arts and intellectual and moral improvements . We can not believe that there are many men in the world , who would desire that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present indulgence or profit . During the week preceding the arrival of the Vincennes , not less than ten thousand people were assembled at that station , on the occasion of an examination of the schools . The officers of the Vincennes were subsequently present at an examination of the schools at Honolulu , the residence of the young king , and the principal port of these islands , where the classes mqst advanced , embracing several hundred scholars , exhibited in reading , writing , the elements of arithmetic , geography , biblical history , recitations from the Scriptures , catechisms and singing . Many of the scholars could write a good hand , and all manifested as full an understanding in the acquisitions made , a would be found among scholars at a // similar exhibition at home . ' The king , then sixteen years old , and the chiefs , some of them the veteran warriors and counsellors of Tamehameha , appeared at the head of their classes , and showed a laudable ambition to be first in knowledge as they were first in rank . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enunciation , and correctness of accent . At the same time was exhibited some needle-work , done by a class of young girls under the instruction of Miss Ward ; the articles were beautifully finished , as much so as if the work of a skilful mantua-maker . Many of the native females have become expert in dress-making , and obtain their support by the exercise of their art . ' Though there can not but remain some relics of the recent barbarism of the people , yet the progress made exceeds the most sanguine expectations . The visits of - foreign ships , and the trade in sandal-wood , have brought a good deal of profit to the chiefs , the effects of which might be expected to appear in a gau ( ly finery and extravagance . But it seems , on the contrary , that the islanders show a very considerable taste and sense of propriety in their luxuries and ornaments . Mr. Stewart particularly describes the furniture of the palace of the king , and of the houses of the principal chiefs , which , though in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is glaring and fantastical . In a letter addressed by the missionaries to Captain Finch , on the improvements made in the islands in the course of ten years , they say , No nation is probably more temperate and less addicted to gambling . Industry has been encouraged ; commerce has been increased about five hundred per cent. ; schools have been every where estatilished ; and about 30,000* of the inhabitants , perhaps more , brought under instruction ; about 500 pages* of different matter have been prepared for the press , in the language of the country , including more than half of the New Testament , and 100 hymns ; the whole printed and published in various forms by our press , amounting to about 7,000,000 pages . ' Mr. Stewart says , that if any of the missionaries could find time for editing a news-paper , we should soon see the Hawaiian Herald and Sandwich Islands Register , ' as the patronage * Now 50,000 , Mr. Stewart says . * Now , Mr. Stewart says , 13,632,800. t Now 800 pages . // would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to establish a body of written laws , but as yet with no great success . Some of the foreign residents ,  --  we are careful not to say all ,  --  have opposed the adoption of a written code of laws , and have absolutely denied the right of jurisdic-. tion over them , to the Government of the islands . It is their will and pleasure , in short , to be lawless , for they deny the jurisdiction of their own native Governments , as stoutly as they do that of the Sandwich Islands , so that they in effect deny their obligation of obedience to any laws whatever . And they have sustained this state of savage independence hitherto with some success . At the time of the visit of Lord Byron , the subject of a code was discussed , and he proposed some general laws , mostly however of a constitutional character , regulating the political relations of the rulers and people , but some also respecting the title to lands , and the regulation of commerce . It does not appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these has been very beneficial . The regents , who governed in the name of the young king , attempted about the same time to introduce some laws of a municipal kind , particularly in relation to crimes . Some of the missionaries were invited to be present at the discussion of this subject in the council , on information of which , a party of leading individuals among the foreign residents , violently and riotously interrupted the council , with such menaces and threats against the members of the mission , even to the taking of life , that the chiefs were actually intimidated , and , for the time , relinquished their purpose . ' Afterwards , however , in 1827 , notwithstanding the opposition from the same quarter had increased , the king and chiefs determined on the promulgation of laws against murder , theft , and adultery ; the first to be punished with death , the other two with imprisonment in irons . These laws were first proclaimed by the king in person , to an immense assembly of people , natives and foreigners , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , others were added against gambling , drunkenness , prostitution , and sabbathbreaking . An incident that occurred in the early stage of the mission , will illustrate the state of society at that time , and the disposition of some of the foreign residents . The pupils of the first female school collected by Mrs. Biugham , after being clothed and brought with much care and attention to habits of neatness // and propriety in their persons , and having become deeply interested in various branches of useful instruction , were borne off , openly and forcibly , by some of the foreign residents to become their mistresses , while their instructress could answer their appeals made to her for protection , only by her tears. * Some transactions occurred as lately as October , 1829 , in relation to one of the English residents , which are strikingly illustrative of the state of things at the islands . Near to Honolulu , the principal port , is a large common , on which the horses and cattle of both natives and residents are turned to graze . Adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an ancient custom of the island , if an animal break into an enclosure , it is forfeited to the proprietor . Proprietors do not , however , usually avail themselves of the forfeiture , but are content with a reasonable reparation in damages . A certain British resident , whose name is not given , being the proprietor of an enclosure , had adopted the practice of shooting every animal that broke into it . The same resident owned a cow , which was turned upon this common with the other cattle . To protect the plantations , an order had been passed , to secure the cattle in yards during the night . This order he neglected , and his cow broke into a plantation of a native , who detained her as a pledge for the damage she had done ; for which he was reproved and threatened by the owner , who made no reparation . Accordingly , on the cow 's breaking into the plantation again , she was shot by the farmer . The owner of the cow , on being informed of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without any order from the chiefs or consultation with them , they seized the farmer , and pinioning his arms , tied a halter about his neck , and rode off to town , a distance of three miles , with their prisoner . They rode with such speed , that the islander , after being exhausted with running , fell , and was then dragged along the ground until he was much bruised , several of his ribs being injured , and his sides excoriated . An islander seeing he was like to be strangled , had the courage , ' as Mr. Stewart expresses it , to run to his relief and cut the rope . He was , however , by the order of his captors , put into irons and imprisoned in the fort , the usual place of confinement , where , // says Mr. Stewart , he still remains , ' namely , on the 19th of October , being some two or three weeks from the time of his seizure . We presume the fort to be under the command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this native would be confined there , by the order of the two residents , as stated by Mr. Stewart . However this may be , Mr. Stewart says that the facts of the outrage were stated to him by a number of ' the chiefs and by others , and among the rest by the man who cut the rope to save the life of the person seized . Taking the facts as stated to Mr. Stewart to be true , and they are corroborated by a document published by the king and his council at the time , the outrage seems to resemble very nearly the transactions that recently took place in Georgia . The affair became one of much importance and interest at Oahu . The British residents drew up a formal memorial to the Government , representing their lives and property not to be longer safe at the islands ; with a request to Governor Boki , that an answer might be carefully prepared , as it would be transmitted to the British Government . A solemn meeting of the council of state was accordingly held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hawaiian languages . It assures the memorialists of the protection of the Government ; declares that all foreign residents shall be amenable to the laws ; replies , in relation to the seizure of the farmer , that he ought not to have been punished without a consultation with the Government , adding , you rashly and suddenly injured the man ; that is one of the crimes of two of you ; ' setting forth particularly the wrong and violence . This paper contains a touching expostulation to the foreign residents . This is our communication to you all , ye parents from the countries whence originate the winds ; have compassion on a nation of little children , very small and young , who are yet in mental darkness , and help us to do right , and follow with us that which will be for the best good of this our country . ' The memorialists were so little satisfied with this reply , that they threatened violence against any who should be concerned in its publication . Persons friendly to the missionaries advised them not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give rise to unpleasant consequences . They , however , printed it , and no violence seems to have ensued . Some of the residents are friendly to the improvements , which have been commenced in the islands , and if still more // of them would use their influence and lend all the aid they can in the establishment of laws and the introduction of morals and manners , they would have less reason to be jealous of the interference of the missionaries in the affairs of the Government ; for these little children , ' as the islanders call themselves , can only become civilized through the advice and assistance of the Europeans and Americans , and they must necessarily resort to those who are ready to lend them aid . They very naturally , and , indeed , under the present circumstances , necessarily , resort to the missionaries for counsel in state affairs , as well as in matters of faith and conscience , and it is desirable that they should do so , if there are among the missionaries , persons of sufficiently liberal views and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any desire to interfere , and are specially instructed by their patrons not to meddle with political concerns . Captain Finch was the hearer of a letter , dated January 20th , 1829 , addressed to the young king by the Secretary of the Navy , ( Mr. Southard ) by order of the then President , ( Mr. Adams ) inviting a good understanding between the United States and the islanders ; expressing the President 's admiration at the rapid progress made by the islanders in acquiring a knowledge of letters and of the true religion , . - the religion of the Christian 's Bible , ' - encouraging them to proceed in the course of improvement ,  --  recommending the missionaries to their favor , as persons who seemed to be sincerely desirous to be useful to them ,  --  intimating that foreign residents owed obedience to their laws , and by violating them , violated , at the same time , their duty to their own Government and country , and merited censure and punishment , ' - and saying that Captain Finch was commanded diligently to inquire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands ; and , as far as he had authority , to insure proper conduct and deportment from them . ' This communication was highly gratifying to the islanders ; the king and chiefs listened to a translation of it publicly read at the time of presenting it , with ecstacy , some being moved even to tears . They have a deep sentiment of their being as yet but half-reclaimed savages , that they are little children , very small and young , ' they feel that their own improvement is an arduous undertaking on their part , and , accordingly , any encouragement and recognition of them on the part of the Governments of civilized countries , are exceedingly cheering and gratifying . // The American residents were , however , exceedingly dissatisfied with this letter , and sent back a protest , of which Captain Finch was the bearer , which has not been published , but purports , as Mr. Stewart understood at Honolulu , that the letter from our Government should have come through the Secretary of State , and not of the Navy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the religion of the Christian Bible ' is the true religion , ' or to recommend the missionaries to his protection and kindness . It denies any ill conduct on the part of any American residents at the Islands , and asserts , that whether their conduct there he good or bad , the Government of the United States has no jurisdiction over it . It did not become the American residents to protest too strongly against any interference in their concerns and those of the islanders , when they were availing themselves of the assistance of the Government , through Captain Finch , to effect a settlement of their accounts with the chiefs , and obtain payment of the balance due to them ; and some of their objections to the letter seem to be quite frivolous , particularly their exception to the insertion of Mr. Stewart* s name in it . We can not but think , however , that the Secretary 's letter was a little unguarded in asserting , that a violation of the laws of the Sandwich Islands by American residents was a breach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been well to have expressed the right of our Government to interpose in relation to the conduct of those residents while on the Island , in terms still more qualified . But in determining which of the two parties to countenance , the resident traders or the missionaries , the Government certainly could not hesitate to choose as it did , whether it had regard to the welfare of the islanders themselves , or to the interests of our conimerce in the Pacific . We have omitted many things in these volumes , which would have been interesting to our readers , particularly the visit to the volcano , and the reception of Mr. Stewart at Lahaina , his former station as missionary ; and we shall pass over the part of the Journal relating to Canton , Manilla , and the Cape of Good Hope . We have said enough , we trust , to show to those of our readers who have not read this Journal , that it will be a very interesting work to them , and afford them a great deal of information to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of // the topics are hardly worthy of a place in the Journal , and others , if touched at all , should have been more fully treated ,  - -  and though a rigid revision , had it not been prevented by the domestic griefs of the writer , might have led him to expunge some things , particularly the passage in which he pronounces that a certain person who died in the course of the voyage had made a transition to torments , with a greater confidence than seems to us to be expedient , and more plainness than will be grateful to his relatives and acquaintances who may read the Journal ,  --  yet the work , on the whole , does great credit to the talent , literary taste , intelligence , philanthropic disposition , and piety of the author . The incidents of the voyage , as related by Mr. Stewart , will add to the reputation of the officers with whom he sailed , and all the proceedings of Captain Finch at the Polynesian islands , show that a better selection of a commanding officer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
