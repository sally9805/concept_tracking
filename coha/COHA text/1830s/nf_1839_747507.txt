txt /q/ration of human motives and actions , become the common medium of exchange , and the general measure of value , constitutes the money of the community ; and in this character it requires an additional value . Various articles , in different countries , and in different stages of society , have , in this way , acquired the properties of money . In nomadic nations , their flocks and herds become the general medium of commerce , and the measure of value . They can be kept until they are wanted , and though they may be a charge- in the mean time , yet their increase and their milk compensate for keeping them ; and they are , moreover , transported to distant places at little expense . Before the western states had the benefit of steam navigation , horses , cattle and hogs , there performed the functions of money , and merchants regularly received these species of live stock in payment for their goods , as they famished the readiest means of remittance to the Atlantic states , through which they received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of barrelled pork /q/ would generally be at least four times the cost of transporting the same quantity in a drove of live hogs . By reason of its superior cheapness , this mode of conveying the animal products of their fertile soil to market still extensively prevails , notwithstanding the present cheap and expeditious modes of transportation afforded by steamboats . Tobacco was also used as a universal equivalent in Maryland and Virginia , it being always readily purchased or taken in payment by their merchants for export to the mother country , to which the colonists were always indebted . To render the commodity more fit to perform the functions of a currency , it was carried to a public warehouse , where it was subjected to inspection by salaried officers , whose certificates passed every where as money , according to the quantity and market price of tobacco . Rice in South Carolina , and fish in some parts of New England , performed similar functions . But gold and silver have such peculiar fitness for the functions of money , that they seem to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commodity . In the earliest annals of Asia* and Africa , the precious metals are spoken of as money , and where other commodities have been used for this purpose , as cowrie shells , and salt , in different parts of Africa , and their staple products in new colonies , it has proceeded from an extraordinary scarcity of these metals . * See Genesis , Chap* 23d , &c.; /z/ Even in those places , they have had a concurrent circulation with their substitutes . Gold and silver were no doubt thus generally adopted by mankind as money , by reason of the following properties : First . Their beauty and utility . Their inherent splendor is particularly grateful to our organs of vision . It is this quality which makes them a means of decoration , both with the savage and the civilized man . The Indian of this continent suspends pieces of silver , ( for gold is generally beyond his reach , ) from his ears and his nose . Sometimes it hangs round his neck , and sometimes it encircles his wrists or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peruvians , * who had not yet learnt to use these metals as money . The London or Paris beau , on the other hand , makes use of gold as a case for his watch , or wears it as a ring on his fingers , or a broach , or a guard-chain , or on the buttons of his coat , the hilt of his sword , or the head of his cane . The civilized man every where fashions both metals , and especially silver , which is most abundant , into countless vessels and utensils , and uses thin sheets of it for the embellishment of his ornaments , his furniture , or his carriage . Without this intrinsic source of value , these metals never could have acquired their secondary , or monetary value . Secondly . Their scarcity . Nature has been comparatively frugal in her supplies of these metals , * Robertson 's America , Book VII . /q/ and very unequal in her supplies of the two . It is owing to their rarity , that they contain great value in small bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its exchangeable value is so much less than that of gold ; for the difference between them in intrinsic qualities and beauty seems too small to have had any effect on their market price . Had these metals been as abundant and attainable as iron , they had been of less value , inasmuch as they have not so useful properties as that metal . In consequence of this difference in the quantities furnished by nature , and of the different amounts of labor spent in searching for them , and extracting them from the mines , by reason of that difference , a pound of gold may now exchange in the market for 16 pounds of silver , for about 1000 pounds of copper , and 5000 or 6000 pounds of iron . But these proportions vary in different countries , and are liable to perpetual fluctuations . In the same degree that the metals have value in proportion to their weight , have they the quality of portability , or facility of transportation , this quality being inversely as their several values . Thus , supposing 1 pound gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5000 pounds iron , then , in transporting any given value in the different metals , One mile in silver =16 miles in gold . " " copper = 1000 miles in gold . " " iron == 5000 miles in gold . It is owing to their greater portability that the value of the precious metals , and especially of gold . /z/ approaches so near to uniformity throughout the world . Thirdly . Their durability . It is important that an article which was used as the general medium of exchange , and in which value was to be stored away for future use , should not be liable to waste or deterioration . There are few substances in nature which possess this quality in a higher degree than gold and silver . They are not liable to rust , as are most of the baser metals . They are less apt to wear away than lead or tin . The action of neither water , nor air , nor fire , impairs their value . Precious stones are as unchangeable , but if separated into parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pound of gold has the same value , whether it be in a hundred parts , or a single mass . Fourthly . Their uniformity of quality . Most useful commodities are very various in quality . This is the case with all animal and vegetable productions , and most minerals . But all gold and all silver are the same every where . Nor is their value liable to much fluctuation from difference of supply or demand . They have , from the earliest ages , been in universal request , and from the care with which they have been preserved , and their own enduring character , the variations either in their consumption or supply must be comparatively very small . The quantity annually extracted from the mines , or annually consumed by wear and tear , and in manufactures , is estimated not much to exceed one hundredth part of the quantity now in /z/ existence ; so that if the supply drawn from the mines , in a single year , could be doubled a greater increase than has probably ever yet taken place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently could at most depreciate it only to the extent of the excess above the annual consumption . And , although the American mines have for about twenty-eight years yielded , on an average , little more than half their former product , it is not universally admitted that the deficiency has produced any sensible rise * in the value of gold and silver . Fifthly . Their facility of separation into homogeneous parts , and of reunion by melting . By this quality coin is readily converted into ornaments and utensils , and they , in like manner , are converted into coin , as there happens to be a relative excess or deficiency of either , according to the varying wants of society . Into whatever number of parts a piece of gold or of silver may be divided , each part is , according to its weight , of the same quality and value ; and any number of pieces can be converted into one mass by the simple process of melting . There are few substances that could thus be * McCulloch , Comm . Diet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to be understood that he has any doubt of the rise in the value of the precious metals since 1810 . Not only was such rise to be inferred from the most satisfactory a priori reasoning , but it also appears from changes in the prices of commodities too numerous and general to admit of any other solution . But it is clear that such rise must have been very slow and gradual , when the accumulated effect of twenty-eight years was not clear and palpable to all . /z/ divided and reunited without undergoing some loss in quantity or some change in quality . Lastly . They are capable of receiving a plain and durable impression , by which their weight , value , and origin , are indicated by inspection . With these recommendations are mingled some inconveniences , to which gold and silver are exposed , as coin . They may be counterfeited or alloyed by base metals ; and they may be reduced in weight , without detection by the unassisted senses . These incidents , however , bear but a small proportion to their utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . /z/ A MONEY or medium of exchange , which unites so many advantages as are furnished by gold and silver , is of immense benefit in every civilized community ; and the benefit increases with the increasing wealth and commerce of- civilization . Every individual is thereby able to buy the precise article he wants , and nothing else , and just as much as he wants , and no more . He thus obtains a greater value for the products of his own industry , and imparts a greater value to that of others . Before the introduction - of such a general medium of exchange , when men could obtain the products of others only by barter , it would rarely happen that of two persons who casually met , each one wanted what the other wished to part with , and when each was prepared to give the precise equivalent and nothing beyond it . If a shoemaker , for instance , wished to turn his shoes into bread , the baker might not want shoes , or he might not want as many as the shoemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoemaker would be compelled to exchange his shoes for something that the baker wanted , and would be willing to take in exchange for bread ; or the baker might /z/ agree to take the shoes , which he did not want , in the expectation of exchanging them for something that he did . The difficulty would be yet greater , if the article which one wished to barter for several other commodities , would not admit of division , as a horse , a wagon , a boat , or a house . To convert its value into bread , meat , and clothing , to suit the necessities of his family , might require a dozen subsequent exchanges , even should he be so fortunate as to meet with an individual who wanted his property , had commodities sufficient to purchase it , and was willing to give the value of it . Where , indeed , two persons chanced to meet , whose several commodities were exactly suited , both in kind , quality , and price , to each other 's tastes , they might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , by money , would require two . But such cases would be extremely rare , as may be seen by comparing the cases of barter with those of sale , since the introduction of money does not prevent barter wherever that is found more convenient . We may , therefore , safely say , that the use of money , as the instrument of exchange , in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , saves time and trouble , and , in very many of them , effects the purposes of the parties , that would be unattainable by barter . The article thus readily convertible into every species of product , and which thus commands the industry , skill , and talents of the great mass of the community , is , on these accounts , an object of universal desire , and has a very important agency in the distribution of national wealth . /z/ BY reason of the readiness with which money enables every producer to dispose of his redundant products , that is , to convert them into what has a more unvarying and universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were the practice of barter to prevail , the fear felt by a tradesman , that he might not find persons who would both want his commodities , and have such as he himself would take in return , would check his industry , and he would generally wait , as is often the case with country workmen , for articles to be ordered before they were made . There is also , from the use of money , a great saving of time , as we have seen , which the industrious class can appropriate to the business of pro-duction* Money is , moreover , favorable to that separation of trades which is , of itself , so propitious to increased production , and to an improvement in the quality of the articles produced . If there was no general medium of exchange , men would often fabricate articles for themselves , from the trouble and delay of obtaining them by barter ; and great /z/ excellence in any species of handicraft or manufacture is attained only by continued and undivided practice . There is yet another advantage that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market price in the general measure of value , where there is one , every producer can thereby better adapt his supply to the varying demands and diversified tastes of the community . Money furnishes a very sensitive barometer of these variations , by consulting which the industrious classes will be less likely to misdirect their labor , and create redundancy on the one hand , or subject the community to scarcity on the other . Where the value of the articles produced had to be exchanged some three or four times before the producer obtained what he wanted , it would not be easy to say what was the market value of his commodity . The knowledge , at least , would be far less prompt , easy , and precise , than it is where there is a general measure of value . The introduction of money has also a manifest tendency to beget frugality , and encourage accumulation . Without such a convenient and unchanging representative of value , or mode of investment , many things would be wastefully consumed , supposing them to be produced , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being exchangeable merely for other merchandise . Most animal and vegetable products are liable to decay or injury from keeping ; and of such commodities as may be exempt from this inconvenience , many are bulky , neither easily /q/ removed from place to place , nor kept with entire safety . But gold and silver , by their great value , in proportion to their bulk , are easily removed from places of danger , and easily secreted from violence or theft . The practice of saving is so much encouraged by the facilities which the precious metals afford , that it occasionally grows to be one of the strongest human passions ; and mi* sers , who are instances of the abuse of frugality , and who are , in part , the creatures of a metallic currency , furnish striking proofs of its power over human action ; a power which , excessive in their case , exerts a healthy influence on the rest of the community . It is a further incentive to accumulation , that loans of capital on interest are greatly facilitated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barter presents to exchanges , it presents also to loans . The commodities which one individual has to spare , he may not find another willing to borrow ; and though he should , they vary so much in quality , there would commonly be ground for dispute in the repayment of the loan . The expense of transporting the articles , first from the lender to the borrower , and then to those with whom he would find it necessary to exchange them , would prove an additional obstacle to the loan . But , where a certain value or amount of materials and labor are embodied in the compact and portable form of gold and silver , which are readily exchangeable for every thing , the possessor can easily find borrowers who will be willing to compensate him for what may be so useful and /z/ even necessary to them . If the capital thus lent should be used by the borrower productively , as it often is , such production is a gain to the community that is fairly ascribable to the introduction of money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference which is commonly made between the terms of a contract in which payment is to be made in cash , and of that in which it is to be made in goods at the ordinary price ; which difference is so great , that most men prefer giving credit , inconvenient and pregnant with loss as that is , to barter . When money is found to be thus favorable to industry , economy , and the greater productiveness of capital , it must be regarded as one of the most useful of human inventions , and as most conducive to the welfare of states . Therefore it was , that , when politicians first began to speculate on the sources of national wealth , and on the best means of promoting it , perceiving that the prosperity of states was in proportion to their respective quantities of gold and silver , ( as will be the case , when they constitute the money of a country , ) they regarded those metals as wealth itself , instead of being merely among the signs of wealth . Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , and in directing their efforts to the exclusive purpose of increasing their quantity , they unconsciously counteracted their useful tendency to encourage industry and economy ; and they thus not only impaired the sum of national wealth , but eventually lessened the amount of the precious metals themselves . It can scarcely be doubted , that the quantity of /q/ gold and silver has , for more than a century , been greater in England than in Spain and Portugal , which received the whole product of the American mines , and through which England , in commerce with the rest of Europe , received nine tenths of her supplies of those metals . Those nations had not learned that it is industry , skill , and economy , which create national wealth , and that gold and silver , no more than any other commodity , and no more in the form of money than of ornaments and utensils , add to the wealth of a country , except so far as they cherish and promote those virtues . By way of illustrating the useful functions of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , it has been called the wheels of jcommerce , and the grease which facilitates the motion of those wheels . But its useful functions can be compared to nothing more aptly than to those of a canal or artificial road , by which the conveyance of articles from hand to hand is performed with greater ease , despatch , and safety , and which have always been found to give a great spring to useful industry and commercial enterprise , not only by improving existing markets , but also by creating new ones . Like such facilities of communication , too , a certain number may be required by the amount of commodities to be exchanged , and an increase beyond that number may be a waste of the national capital , by lessening the utility of those previously existing , without obtaining adequate remuneration for themselves . /z/ THE advantages afforded to a community by a currency of the precious metals , are not obtained but at a considerable expense , though that expense may bear a small proportion to its benefits ; but to acquire the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , a nation must part with no insignificant portion of its previous earnings ; and this , whether it have mines of itself , or procure the metals from abroad . Indeed , from the facility with which gold and silver are transmitted from place to place , and the consequent small difference of their value in different countries , very little is saved to a country by its furnishing its own gold and silver ; and , for reasons to be hereafter mentioned , this benefit is commonly outweighed by some disadvantages , so as to make it , generally , better that a nation should derive its supplies of the precious metals from other mines than its own . What , then , is the cost at which a nation purchases its gold and silver circulation ? The question admits of no very precise answer , as the amount is very different in rich and in poor countries ; in countries having a dense or a thin population /q/ ; and as they are more or less commercial. * The amount of money required being manifestly proportionate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , it will , therefore , generally be great according to the opulence , the density of population , the distribution of employments , and the activity of its commerce , foreign and domestic . But the amount actually current is not always in the precise ratio to these circumstances , since the money of one country may have a more rapid circulation , and be the instrument of more exchanges , than the money of another , just as one road or one wagon may transport more merchandise at one time , or in one place , than another . Thus , although money may be as abundant in France as in England , yet this fact would not indicate the relative wealth and commerce of the two countries , as money has a much brisker circulation in England , and more and better devices prevail there for dispensing not only with coin , but even with its proper substitutes . Other circumstances , making a difference in the practices of barter and of giving credit in the commercial dealings of a country , make a correspondent difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have affected to state the proportion between the circulation of a country and the value of its whole annual produce ; but , as Adam Smith properly remarks , it is , perhaps , impossible to determine the proportion . It is riot easy to /z/ ascertain the amount of money circulating in a country , and still less the value of its annual income . The proportion , too , between them probably varies greatly in different countries . It is , therefore , not wonderful , that this proportion has been variously estimated from a fifth to a thirteenth part of the yearly produce . The largest amount seems to be not far from the truth , in the only nation which affords us statistical materials for making any approximation to the truth . The annual income of Great Britain has been recently estimated , upon the imperfect data possessed , at about 300,000,000 sterling. * Supposing its circulation to be 60,000,000 , according to the last estimate , it is precisely one fifth of the annual income . Mr. Webster , in his second speech on the sub-treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circulation of the United States , paper and metallic , at $130,000,000 ; and although the proportion of currency to annual income is probably less in this country than in Great Britain , yet we can not greatly exceed the supposed proportion , without , at the same time , making an inordinate estimate of our national income . Thus , if we reduce the proportion from one fifth to one tenth of the annual income , it will make the latter $1,300,000,000 , which far transcends any estimate which has been ever made of that income , and is beyond any supposable rate of profits from our computed national capital . According to the assessed valuations of the real and personal es- /z/ tate in the State of New York in the year 1834 , the whole property of the State amounted to $459,672,135 ; and ' supposing the other States to have equal wealth in proportion to their numbers , ( which , however , they have not , ) the whole national capital would amount to $2,803,704,945 . Estimating the profit of this capital at 10 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , the whole annual income would be $560,740,989 , which is less than five times the amount of the supposed circulation . Though these estimates rest upon data that are not sufficiently authentic to conduct us to any accurate result , they afford persuasive evidence that the proportion , which the currency of a country ordinarily bears to the annual produce of its land and labor , has been oftener rated too low than too high by those who have speculated on the subject . One of the best modes of comparing the circulation of different countries is , to make the comparison in reference to their population ; that is , how much money each country has for every individual of its population ; as is exhibited in the following table : Countries . Population . Currency . Proportion to each individual . Great Britain , France.t Russia , * United States , /z/ 2400,000,000 livres 175,000,000 rubles /z/ 80 ta ; . =$15. /z/ * McCulloch 's last estimate . /z/ According to this comparison , money is more than twice as abundant in the United States as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain as in the United States . Although , in all these countries , a part of their circulating money is paper , yet , so long as its paper currency is redeemable in specie , it may be fairly presumed that gold and silver to nearly the same amount would have circulated there , if the paper had not been substituted for them . The value of that much gold and silver is a just item of the cost which a nation pays for the benefits and facilities afforded by money . To this cost must be added the expense of coin* age , and the loss which the coin undergoes from wear and friction . This is different on the two metals , ( as we shall see , ) and on coins of different value . Something may be added , too , for losses at sea , and by being buried in the earth . The whole of these losses together have been estimated at 1 per cent. * But this seems to allow far too much for casualties , as the loss by abrasion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver in Europe and America , to exceed 3 --  , or a quarter of one per cent. , in a year . This loss , whatever it may be , the cost of coinage , and the ordinary profits of the capital expended in the purchase of the precious metals , constitute the price which a nation annually pays for the benefits of a money circulation . If we take the state of New York as affording * McCulloch 's Couim , Diet. , Art . Precious Metals . /q/ a fair standard of this cost in the United States , then , as the whole capital of the state in 1834 was about 460,000,000 , * and its circulation at the same time was about 22,000,000 , the consideration which a state pays for this useful instrument of commercial intercourse is nearly 5 per cent. , or one twentieth of its whole capital . * The circulation of the state of New York , in the year 1834 , was as follows : w Notes of the state banks , according to official returns , $16,732,014 Notes of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then in circulation , ... 1,716,429 Specie , one sixth of the amount supposed to be in circulation , /z/ WE have seen that the amount of circulating money greatly varies in different countries . The causes of the diversity , to which we have already briefly adverted , may deserve a more particular notice . 1 . As the use of money is to facilitate the exchange of valuable commodities for their equivalents , the most efficient cause of the different amounts of circulation required by different countries is the difference of wealth . The more a country abounds in the conveniences and elegances of life , that is , the greater its opulence , the greater will probably be the number and value of its exchanges . 2 . The quantity of money which circulates in a country is materially affected by the distribution of employments . If an individual could furnish himself with every article he requires , he would manifestly have no occasion for money , unless he wished to hoard it ; and the more articles he fabricates for himself , the less money he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so distributed that every one is employed in his particular /q/ trade , he can furnish himself only with the single article he has fabricated , and must purchase every other . To make these purchases , his occasions for money are proportionally multiplied ; and where , by an extreme subdivision of labor , many concur in producing the same fabric , a piece of cloth , for example , then each workman requires money to purchase even the article he had contributed to make . The distribution of employments gives a further demand for money , by multiplying the sales of the same article , as it passes from hand to hand , on its way to the consumer . Thus , the farmer sells his wheat to the miller , who sells the same wheat , in the form of flour , to the baker , who again sells it , in the form of bread , to his customers . So , when a man buys a pair of boots , he pays for the leather a 's well as the work to the maker , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously paid for the hide to the butcher , which hide the butcher had purchased with the live cattle of the drover , who had , in turn , bought the same cattle of the farmer . The southern planter , in like manner , buys his goods of the shopkeeper , who has probably bought them of a jobber in New York , who has purchased them by wholesale of an importing merchant , who has bought them , perhaps , of the English manufacturer ; and each successive sale requires the original value of the goods to be represented by its equivalent in money or credit And , although the amount of capital required is thus multiplied , and every portion employed must /z/ have its separate profit , yet the consumer is benefited , rather than injured , by these intermediate agencies , as they never exist except where they are recommended by convenience and economy . It may be presumed that the southern consumer can now purchase any species of foreign merchandise that reaches him , by the same circuitous process , on better terms than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that produced it . In both the circumstances mentioned , we see a reason why there should be less money in the United States than in England or France . The comparatively brief existence of the former has not yet permitted the same accumulation of wealth , and their thinner population does not admit of the same thorough distribution of employments . The great bulk of the rural population in the southern states , comprehending nineteen twentieths of their whole population , provide themselves at home with all their meat and bread , most of what they drink , and nine tenths of what they wear . They deal with the merchant for salt , iron , sugar , coffee , tea , spices , a little imported finery for the females of their family , with now and then a suit for themselves ; which articles , being mostly paid for once a year by the proceeds of their crop , are purchased rather by a sort of barter than by money . A large proportion of all the articles consumed by the slaves linen , cloth , and shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less money /q/ necessary in the United States is , that most of their lands are cultivated by the proprietors ; and of the small proportion that is let to tenants , most pay a proportional share of the crop , and not a money rent . Where land is farmed out for a money rent , as it is throughout England , and in the north of France , a much larger amount of currency will be required , both by the class of tenants and of landlords . The heavier taxation of Great Britain and France , is another reason why they should have more money in circulation than in the United States . The annual taxes of England amount to 50,000,000 , to which , if we add 8,000,000 for the poor rates , the whole is equal to 3. 4s. 5d. to each individual , or about $15i ; whereas , in this country , the taxes , both to the general and the state government , do nowhere exceed from $3 to $5 per head . Some of the causes which operate to reduce die amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet greater extent in Russia , and S torch * remarks that there are many villages in the interior of that empire in which the inhabitants might do without money altogether , if they had no rents and taxes ( des redevances et des impots ) to pay . While , in the preceding particulars , *Econ . Pol. , Vol . II. , Chap . 11. /z/ the United States have less occasion for money than France and Great Britain , there are some which have a contrary effect . One of these is the greater facility with which land here passes from hand to hand , and the consequent greater frequency of sales . The equal division which both law and usage make of a landed estate among all the children of a deceased proprietor , as well as the roving disposition of the people , the great abundance of land , and , lastly , the facility with which it can be subjected to the payment of debts , all concur to make this considerable portion of the national capital require and circulate more money here , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The slaveholding states , too , which on so many accounts require little money in proportion to their capital or their income , have , in the institution of slavery , an occasion for money , which makes a large addition to their circulation . The slaves in the United States , according to the last census , at the average price of $300 , would amount to more than 600 millions . Although rich countries require a greater amount of circulating money than poor ones , it must not be inferred that the excess of money is in proportion to the excess of wealth . On the contrary , the amount of currency may , and commonly does , bear a less ratio to its wealth in a rich , than in a poor country . It owes this advantage to two circumstances . One is the greater rapidity with which money and /q/ every species of merchandise is transmitted from place to place , by means of good roads and canals ; the security of property , and the industry , punctuality , and business habits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred from place to place be doubled , then half the amount will perform the same offices in a given time , that the whole performed before . Thus , the same amount of capital employed between New York and Philadelphia may have twice or thrice the efficiency it had thirty years ago , because it can be turned over in a half or a third of the time . So , if steam ships could cross the Atlantic in half the time required by sail vessels , and make twice the number of voyages in a year , this advantage of the former would compensate for double the cost in the first instance , and double the daily expense of navigating them . But , even with this equality in the two species of navigation to the proprietors , the merchant might make ten thousand dollars as efficient in the steam ship as he could make twenty thousand in the sail vessel , since he could turn over his capital twice as fast . Another mode in which the quantity of money is lessened in wealthy and commercial countries is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mercantile credit . Bills of exchange , promissory notes , whether of banks or individuals , and bank checks , are there made , by reason of the public confidence in the ability and punctuality of those who issued them , to perform the functions of money yet better than the precious metals , where-/z/ by the use of these is proportionally diminished . In the progress of society , as barter is superseded by money , so , in its further progress , money is partially substituted by paper ; and , finally , the use of these substitutes themselves is abridged by checks , and by the mere entries of debt or credit in an account , all of which expedients , adapted to different stages of commercial wealth , have been devised and adopted solely because they saved time , trouble , and expense . We may form some idea of the saving that is thus effected , by a single example of what takes place in London at the Clearing House . To this house the principal bankers of that vast metropolis are in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , with the various bills drawn upon other bankers which his house has received . These he deposits in their appropriate drawers , ( each banker having one , ) and then credits each one for their respective claims against his house , as found in its drawer . " Balances , " says Mr. McCulloch , " are then struck from all the accounts , and the claims transferred from one to another , until they are so wound up and cancelled , that each clerk has only to settle with two or three others , and their balances are immediately paid . " * In this way , Thornton , himself a London banker , states that by this contrivance , payments to the amount of four or five millions a day are made by the actual employment of from 200,000 to 300,000 , in coin or bank notes . * Ccm . Diet. , Art . Clearing . /q/ On the whole , then , we may say that the more perfect the system of commercial credit , whether it arise from the influence of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts by law , or , as is commonly the case , from the two united , the greater is the amount of money that can be dispensed with . But the credit here spoken of , which is adopted for its superior convenience , must not be confounded with that which arises from the scarcity of cash , of which it is the forced substitute . In the one case it is , as we have seen , a labor-saving expedient ; in the other , it greatly increases the consumption of time and labor . Credit of this kind is far less convenient than money ; it is only more convenient than barter . It is the latter species of credit which is found extensively to prevail in all new colonies , in early settlements , and , indeed , in all countries that are rapidly advancing in population and wealth . Such countries always have less money than they could advantageously use , not only because they have less of every species of capital , but also because that portion which exists more readily admits of substitutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of capital , especially those which are essential to the employment of productive industry , food , clothing , tools , and machinery . We accordingly find that all the European settlements in America , not possessing mines , have always experienced an inconvenient scarcity of money , which they have endeavored to remedy , /z/ partly by making some staple product an universal equivalent , or a sort of currency ; and partly by the issue of paper money , on the credit of the colonial governments ; or by the familiar use of bonds , promissory notes , and sales on credit in private dealings . The same scarcity of money has prevailed in the French as in the English colonies , and is still found to exist in the more recent settlements in New Holland , though the latter , yet more than were the former in their infancy , are remarkably thrifty and prosperous communities . Their imports ( always nominally greatly exceeding their exports in amount ) * are as yet too exclusively appropriated to their more pressing wants , to admit of their obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imports of New South Wales amounted to 713,972 ; the exports to 394,801 . In 1834 , the imports into Van Diemen 's Land were 471 , 233 , and the exports 203,233 . Murray 's Encycl. , Book IV . /z/ THE amount of money which is wanted in a country to make purchases , whether for consumption or traffic , and to fulfil contracts , being dependent on the extent of such purchases and contracts , every country tends to attract to itself its proportion of the money of the world , according to the modifying circumstances that have been mentioned . For , if it has a less portion , the value of the metals there rises , and that of other commodities falls ; in consequence of which , there is a further exportation of merchandise and an importation of gold and silver , until the equilibrium is restored . If , on the other hand , the quantity of money should be greater than the circumstances of the country require , its value would fall , ' which would occasion its export . Such are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wants and means of a country . But it is not necessary that the supply should be accurately adjusted to the quantity required , as has been commonly assumed by writers on the theory of money , and that with every excess or deficiency /z/ in the quantity , there is a correspondent decrease or augmentation of the price . The quantity seems to admit of a considerable expansion or contraction , before its value is greatly affected , though it may experience sufficient change to cause its export or import . It is not with money as with perishable articles , which must find a market in a short time , or become valueless in the owner 's hands ; but the value of the precious metals being permanent and universal , when they are less in demand , the holder can either send them abroad , at a small expense , or he can keep them by him , in the well-founded confidence that their value will soon regain its natural level . Besides , there are , as we have seen , in every community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the occasional excess of money is absorbed by increasing the proportion of cash payments . As in this way the abundance of money does hot affect the relation between the supply and demand of commodities , it does not lower prices ; it merely lessens the number of credit sales , by substituting those for cash , either by the money-holders themselves , or those to whom they lend the money . Of that portion of money which does not merely take the place of credit , a part may remain idle , either in the hands of the owner , or on deposit in bank . This portion , we know , is liable to great fluctuation ; and it can have little or no effect on the market value of money , except by its small influence on bank discounts . The same proposition is thus maintained /q/ by a sensible correspondent of Mr. Tooke 's , * in the recent edition of his elaborate work on prices , ( Vol . II. , p. 371 : ) " But an unusual abundance of money does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite possible , indeed , that , contemporaneously with that abundance , the prices of commodities may be generally low . The increased issue of paper may fall into the hands of those , who , from habit and inclination , are averse from investing their money savings in commodities or services , with a view to reproduction and to profit , but whose desire it is to employ the money which comes into their hands , over and above their own personal and unproductive expenditure , in such a way as will bring to them an increased income , with as little risk and trouble as possible . But the opportunity of so employing this surplus money may not immediately occur . " When , on the other hand , there is a deficiency of money , either from a diminished supply , as where the balance of trade has occasioned a great exportation of specie , or from an increased demand , as where there has been a sudden advance in the chief staple products of the country , money , in these cases , does not proportionally rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on to a greater extent by means of credit . A brisker circulation , too , has the same compensating effect , when money is deficient , as a languid circulation has , when money is redundant . But when the excess or deficiency of circulation /z/ has passed beyond the influence of these correctives , as in case of the great and sudden enlargement or contraction of bank issues , then money experiences a correspondent rise in one case , or depreciation in the other , its value varying inversely as its quantity . Nor can it regain its proper level , until some alteration , either in the demand or supply , has restored the former proportion between them . Here , however , we must bear in mind , that this change in the value of money affects the prices of different commodities very unequally . Of the very large class of articles which enter into foreign commerce , whether of export or import , the price is but slightly affected . The price of cotton here , for instance , depends mainly on the price in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion between the general demand and supply of the world . It is no otherwise affected by the plenty or scarcity of money here , than as the market rate of interest and of commercial jprofits fluctuates , which fluctuations can seldom have much proportionate influence on price . The same remark applies to our tobacco , flour , and other articles of export , and to every species of imported merchandise . If the quantity of our money were suddenly doubled , it would not raise these articles , with a few special and temporary exceptions , ten per cent. , and very many articles not five . But as to that description of property , for the value of which there is no such standard of comparison , the case is very different ; such as lands , town lots , the /q/ wages of labor , and every article , in short , whether of luxury or necessity , that is of domestic origin , and relies exclusively on the domestic market . These will feel the full effect of the depreciation of money , or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change of price will be the greater in this class , because it has been less in the other . The excess or deficiency of money operating upon but a part of the marketable articles in the community , the elevation or depression of price on these articles must be the greater , to countervail the whole excess or deficiency . Accordingly , we find , that , when the circulation had , between the years 1813 and 1815 , increased from $70,000,000 to $110,000,000 , according to Mr. Crawford 's bank report , * and yet more in 1816 , while our articles of export rose , and those of import fell , in consequence of the change from war to peace , real estate of every kind , both in country and town , experienced a great rise , often as much as 200 or 300 per cent . When , a few years afterwards , the circulation was reduced , according to the same report , to $45,000,000 , real estate , especially houses and lots in town , fell almost as much as they had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had increased from about $63,500,000 , as it was estimated by Mr. Gallatinf in 1830 , to $140,000,000$ in 1836 , according to * Report of Feb. 24 , 1820 , p. 8. t Essay on Currency , p. 54. /z/ the computation of Mr. Woodbury , we know that city lots , the wild lands of the west , and all lands in the neighborhood of towns , existing or projected , experienced an exorbitant rise , sometimes several hundred per cent . ; while every species of imported merchandise continued nearly at former prices , and the prices of our articles of export bore their wonted proportion to their prices abroad . It is owing to this inequality of depreciation , that the fact itself may exist long before it is generally perceived , and that its existence even is sometimes disputed . In England , it furnished arguments of some plausibility to those who maintained that their bank paper had not depreciated during the suspension of specie payments . /z/ WHENEVER there is either a great redundancy or deficiency of currency , the mischief is very great in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money , as an instrument of exchange . In the case of excess , it is almost sure to engender a wild spirit of speculation , both by affording the means and by stimulating the inclination , by reason of the increasing fictitious value which it imparts to some species of property . This spirit , once excited , draws men off from their regular pursuits , makes them look with disdain on the slow but sure gains of ordinary business , and hazard their capital and credit on rash schemes of profit , which , in much the greatest number of instances , are followed by disappointment , and not seldom by bankruptcy . In the eagerness for gain , it often gives rise to deception and fraud , and it always more or less strengthens the selfish , and weakens the better principles of our moral nature . While the fancy is thus deluded with visions of future wealth , men are led to increase their expenses , not distinguishing between the money they expect to make , and that they already possess . /z/ During the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made hundreds of thousands of dollars , and who had indulged in a course of expense suited to their ideal wealth , in the course of a single year found themselves scarcely possessed of a competency . In short , by the suspension or diversion of industry from its usual employments , production is diminished ; and , by creating notions of wealth which are fleeting and fallacious , consumption is increased . The evils of a deficiency of money , though widely different , are scarcely inferior . A very large proportion of every commercial community find it necessary , or , at least , highly advantageous , to receive as well as to give credit ; and thus the faithful performance of their own engagements depends upon the punctuality of those to whom they have given credit . When the supply of currency is inadequate , some must fail to fulfil their pecuniary contracts ; and their failure may affect the punctuality of many others . This not only produces a series of disappointments , but often arrests the course of industry and trade . The manufacturer , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must discharge a part of his workmen , or is unable , from the injury his credit has sustained , to keep up his supply of raw materials . In this state of things , men become distrustful , and sometimes refuse credit where it might be given without risk . All the wheels of industry thus become clogged and sluggish ; enterprise is suspended ; and as excess of money had /q/ given preternatural activity , so the deficiency gives too little for the healthy condition of the community , which seems to suffer as much from the torpor of one state , as from the fever of the other . The United States have sometimes experienced this inconvenience , when , either from a sudden check in their ordinary exports , or a great decline in their value , there has been a large foreign balance due , which has either driven specie out of the country , or , from the fear of such export , has withdrawn bank paper from circulation . This was the cause of the pecuniary embarrassments and distress in 1819 . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced during the preceding war . Creditors could not collect their debts . Debtors could not comply with their most solemn engagements . Those who had traded profitably on credit , had to limit their operations to cash , scarce as it was ; and many , therefore , had to suspend them altogether . Ships lay idle at the wharves , because those who would have employed them had not the usual means of freighting them . The farmer , in disposing of his crop , was reduced to the alternative of selling at an undervalue , or of giving a credit when it was particularly hazardous . The manufacturer had the same difficulty in making sale of his fabrics , in addition to that of procuring his materials and paying his workmen . The merchant , who , as buyer or seller , always shares in the ill fortune of the other classes , had the further embarrassment of paying his note at the bank , when there was /z/ neither notes nor coin in circulation . The same distress would have occurred last year , ( 1837 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finding they must stop , either with money or without it , they decided on the former j and the public , objecting less to a vicious than a deficient circulation , sanctioned their decision . The evils which preceded and followed the suspension have been , certainly , very great ; but they were far less than they would have been , if that suspension had not taken place . While the effects of an excess of money , no less than of a deficiency , prove , eventually , so injurious , the period of transition from a less to a greater circulation has been thought very propitious to every branch of productive industry . " We find , " says Hume , " that , in every kingdom into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly , every thing takes a new face ; labor and industry gain life ; the merchant becomes more enterprising , the manufacturer more diligent and skilful , and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention . " These good effects are more likely to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of most things then moderately rise ; and the producer , being better rewarded than he expected , is stimulated to further production . He also finds it easier to sell for cash , or quick payments j and he thus has the ability , as well as the inclination , to extend his business . Nor does the effect seem /q/ likely to cease , as Hume* supposes , after there has been a general rise of prices j but most men , believing according to their wishes , will expect that their products , which have been recently * The mode in which this author supposes that an increase of money operates on industry is thus minutely detailed by him : " To account , then , for this phenomenon , we must consider , that though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the increase of gold and silver , yet it follows not immediately upon that increase , but some time is required before the money circulates through the whole state , and makes its effect felt on all ranks of people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the price rises , first of one commodity , then of another , till the whole , at last , reaches a just proportion with the new quantity of specie which is in the kingdom . In my opinion , it is only in this interval , or intermediate situation , between the acquisition of money and rise of prices , that the increasing quantity of gold and silver is favorable to industry . When any quantity of money is imported into a nation , it is not , at first , dispersed into many hands , but is confined to the coffers of a few persons , who immediately seek to employ it to advantage . Here are a set of manufacturers , or merchants , we shall suppose , who have received returns of gold and silver for goods which they sent to Cadiz . They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly , who never dream of demanding higher wages , but are glad of employment from such good paymasters . If workmen become scarce , the manufacturer gives higher wages , but , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willingly submitted to by the artisan , who can now eat and drink better , to compensate his additional toil and fatigue . He carries his money to market , where he finds every thing at the same price as formerly , but returns with greater quantity , and of better kinds , for the use of his family . The farmer and gardener , finding that all their commodities are taken off , apply themselves with alacrity to the raising more , and , at the same time , can afford to take better and more clothes from their tradesmen , whose price is the same as formerly , and their industry only whetted by so much new gain . It is easy to trace the money in its progress through the whole commonwealth , where we shall find , that it must first quicken the diligence of every individual , before it increases the price of labor . " Hume 's Essays , III . of Money . /z/ rising , will continue to rise ; and thus enterprise , skill , and labor will be stimulated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , when the circulation is decreasing , all the stagnating effects that have been already noticed begin to be felt . Every one obtains a smaller remuneration for his industry or skill than he expected ; and of those who do not curtail their business from necessity , many do so from choice . No new enterprises are then ventured on ; and those already begun , which , in the ordinary state of things , would have been successful , are abandoned . Every sort of business is engaged in hesitatingly , is prosecuted without vigor or confidence , and often , therefore , without success . It would , on these accounts , be desirable that a nation should always experience the salutary influence of an increase of money ; but , as this is practicable only in those countries that are steadily advancing in wealth and population , and not even in them but to a moderate extent , it would seem better for a country to dispense with the extraordinary stimulus than to take it , attended , as it too often is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild and ruinous enterprises , bankruptcy , and a general prostration of mercantile credit . This is the stimulus of the opium-eater , which always leaves the patient weaker , brings on pains for which his delirious dreams are no compensation , and , in time , ceases to give even the temporary relief it at first afforded . /z/ How far does the value of gold and silver in one country differ from its value in another , independent of the temporary fluctuations from excess or deficiency that have been mentioned ? The exchangeable value of these metals , like that of all other commodities , must be determined by comparing them with other articles ; and they are more or less valuable as they will exchange for more or less of such articles . But with what shall we compare them ? They will exchange for more of one article in one country , and of another , in another . They seem to have most value in Engr land , if we compare them with cotton goods , or hardware ; in France , if compared i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hemp ; and in the United States , if with raw cotton or tobacco . Nor is this all the difficulty . In making the double comparison between the precious metals and other commodities , in different countries , as the difference in their relative value may be owing to a difference either in the value of the metals , or in that of the commodities , we must ascertain /z/ which of these causes have operated , or how far the one , and how far the other may have prevailed . The inquiry then is a very complicated one , and it must be greatly qualified to admit of an answer either precise or satisfactory . Still there are general diversities , which it is proper to notice in a theory of money . 1 . As the chief part of the gold and silver of the world has been derived from the mines of America , it is clear that the value of these metals in different countries will be influenced by their distance from these mines . But this difference is not regulated solely by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to their volume and weight . This might have been the case , if other countries had received their supplies of gold and silver by emigrants from the mining districts , carrying heir property in the form of these metals with them . But such was not the fact . The rest of the world obtained their supplies of gold and silver , by exchanging for them their more bulky commodities ; and the value of the metals in each country 1 been enhanced by the expense of transporting their equivalents . It has not , however , been enhanced to the amount of the whole expense , since the merchandise received by Spain and Portugal , or their American settlements , has been increased in value by the exchange , as well as the gold and silver they have paid . The joint expense , then , of transporting both metals and merchandise is divided between the two , and each has /q/ an accession of value to the amount of one half . This was the only condition upon which they could be supplied . Hence gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico or Peru ; more in Poland and Russia , than in France or England ; and yet more in India or China , than in any part of Europe . They were , on this account , of much greater value in the Western , than the Atlantic states , until steam navigation lent its immense facilities to the interior commerce of the country . 2 . The market value of all commodities , apart from the fluctuations in the demand or supply , depends on the value of the raw materials and labor which produced them . Now these two elements change their relative value with the progress of population . As this increases , the value of labor has a tendency to fall , and that of raw produce to rise . The same soil being called upon in each successive generation to support a greater number , its products rise and command a greater amount of labor , for the same reason that they command more during a scanty season . Of two countries , then , equidistant from the mines , in the one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw produce , will have the greater value , and if compared with labor or manufactured products , will be the least valuable . An ounce of gold will thus generally buy more wheat and other raw produce , in the United States , than it will in England , and more cloth or hardware in England than it will in the United States . /z/ 3 . Let us , however , suppose two countries equidistant from the mines , and having the same density of population ; but one rich , that is , abounding in the necessaries and conveniences of life ; the other but scantily supplied with them . In which of these will gold and silver have the greatest value ? Adam Smith * thinks in the rich country , and Ricardo f maintains the contrary . It hardly seems to be a question for such discrepancy . If one country be richer than the other , by the greater fertility of its soil , then gold and silver will exchange there for more corn , and other products of agriculture , they being there produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , as to this class of commodities , those metals will be most valuable in the rich country . In the same way , we see grain bought for consumption , every year selling at a somewhat lower price on the fertile river bottoms , than on the poor lands in their vicinity . If a country be richer , by reason of a greater amount of capital , or accumulated wealth , then those operations of industry that can be facilitated and cheapened by capital will there be cheaper , and as to these , gold and silver will have a greater value . Lastly , if a country be the richest by reason of its greater science and practical skill , its superior industry , economy , and business habits , manufac- /q/ tured products will , as in the preceding case , be there cheaper , and , consequently , the precious metals have a greater value . They would exchange for more commodities of the same quality , or as many of better quality . These seem to be the only ways in which one country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two countries supposed was the richest in all three , while it would have far more of gold and silver than the poor country , the same quantity of either would purchase more of every species of commodity , and thus have the greatest exchangeable value . There is one article , and only one , which would exchange for less gold and silver in a rich , than a poor country ; and that is human labor , or services . These , by reason of their greater productive powers in a rich country , will there purchase more of all commodities , and , consequently , more of the precious metals . And , though in exchange for a month 's , or a year 's labor , those metals may be of less value , yet , if we take into account the possible difference of quality , and how much more productive and efficient the labor of one country may be than the labor of another , this scarcely deserves to be considered an exception ; and thus , Smith , though his proposition is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may admit of question , seems to be substantially right in asserting , that , while there is more gold in a rich country than in a poor one , the same portion of it will also there purchase more commodities . And , /z/ it may be added , that it will purchase a greater amount of human skill and talent , though it can purchase the services of but a smaller number of individuals . According to the preceding views , the value of the precious metals , besides the occasional fluctuations arising from excess , or deficiency , varies in different countries from three causes , to wit : First . According to their distance from the American mines j the value increasing with the distance . Second . According to their density of population ; the value being directly as the density compared with manufactures , and inversely as the density compared with raw produce . Third . According to their wealth ; the value being greater in rich , than in poor countries . /z/ To further the utility of the metals in their functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of different metals , and of various sizes and denominations , to suit the various payments , required in the ordinary traffic of society ; but every piece of the same metal and denomination having the same purity and weight , and characteristic inscription or device ; by which means their respective values may be known by simple inspection , and they can be transferred from hand to hand , without the trouble of weighing , or the yet nicer operating of assaying . This improvement , like the invention of money itself , seems gradually to have grown into use , as experience developed its utility , rather than to have been the contrivance of inventive sagacity . Gold , silver , and copper , appear , in the early ages , to have passed by weight , when used as money ; and in the first step towards coin , the rude pieces of metal , that were used as instruments of exchange , were of a known weight , as their names indicate . A talent was a measure of weight as well as of value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the money of that denomination at first contained a pound of copper . The uncia , in like manner , was the twelfth part of the as , both as a weight , and as money . The English pound sterling , in the time of Edward I. , contained a pound weight of silver ; and a shilling was also at first the denomination of a weight. * So also was the French livre ; and it is probable that the history of money , in all countries , would show the same fact , that the metals originally passed only by weight , without regard to their forms . Even after the convenience of having pieces of the same weight and fineness was perceived , it is probable that the office of providing them was left to private individuals , such as goldsmiths , and other workers of the metals , either on their own account , or employed by others , for the sake of giving despatch and facility to commercial transactions . Governments , however , seem everywhere to have soon taken upon themselves this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have regarded it as a peculiar attribute of sovereignty ; which , therefore , they have jealously guarded from invasion by the severest penalties . If we may infer their motives from their acts , they seemed to have reserved to themselves the exclusive right of making money , not more for the purpose of preventing the frauds to which the precious metals were exposed when coinage was unrestricted , than to secure to themselves the whole profit from * Wealth , of Nations , I. Chap . IV . /q/ their adulteration , whether by means of alloy , alteration of weight , or of denomination ; for they have practised all these modes of debasement , for their own benefit , and to the injustice of the public creditors . But a juster and more enlightened policy now prevails , and governments , still regarding the coining of money as an act of sovereignty , exercise it solely for the sake of securing to their respective communities a more accurate , convenient , and unvarying measure of value , and universal equivalent . To effect this object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have been suggested by experience , or a better knowledge of the laws of currency , and for the sake of obviating the evils which have grown up in the great extension of wealth and commerce . They have made no small addition to the civil code , and to the science of political economy . We will consider the subject under the several heads of the different metals used for coins , and their respective qualities ; their divisions and denominations ; their form and alloy ; their wear j the cost of coinage ; the policy of a seignorage ; a single and a double standard compared ; and the difference between gold and silver as a standard . Gold , silver , and copper are used by all modern nations for their coins , and they are the only metals so used , with the exception of platina , which has lately been coined in Russia . Each of these metals has its peculiar recommendations and inconveniences . Gold being about /z/ sixteen times as valuable as silver , and generally more than a thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion , more portable than either , and is therefore better suited for distant transport and large payments . But this very superiority of gold over other metals , in containing so much value for its volume , has its disadvantages . It , in the first place , unfits it to represent small values , such as are most in use with the greater part of mankind . A gold coin of the value of twenty- five cents , or even of fifty cents , would be inconveniently small , seeing that it would be but one sixteenth of the silver coin of that value ; but one worth only five cents , the value of our smallest silver coin , besides being exposed to extraordinary wear , by its greater proportion of surface to its weight , would be too minute for use . In the next place , as the base metals can be readily united with gold , so as to escape the notice of the unassisted senses , and the fact can be discovered only by resorting to the troublesome process of assaying , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adulteration . And though the laws punish this fraud with great severity , it is still extensively practised . Even when the purity of the metal is not impaired , gold coins are often made lighter by filing , clipping , and a simple chemical process , by which a thin scale can be taken from each piece without sensibly " altering its appearance or impression . And the uncertainty whether some of these modes /z/ of deterioration have not been practised , lessens the confidence of many individuals , and , at all events , often imposes on them the necessity of weighing the coins , and sometimes of assaying them . The first is an operation of some trouble , and the last , being one of more nicety , can be performed only by technical skill . On these accounts , the value of gold as a currency is considerably impaired ; and these inconveniences have contributed to produce that substitution of paper for gold , which so extensively prevails in the operations of modern commerce . Silver coins , being free from the same objections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counterfeiter , especially the smaller pieces , they are more likely to be pure , and to lose weight only by wear . They , however , are inconvenient for the large payments , that , in a wealthy community , are of familiar recurrence . One thousand silver dollars weigh nearly 60 pounds avoirdupois ; and , consequently , 10,000 dollars , 660 pounds , would be almost an ordinary cart-load . But no inconsiderable part of the small traffic of society requires coins of yet less value than the smallest silver coins fit for circulation ; and the greater cheapness of copper adapts it to coins of that description . There is , indeed , a much greater difference between the values of this metal and silver , than between those of silver and gold , the first being as 15 or 16 to 1 , and the last being perhaps as 50 or 60 to 1 : but , as the cost of coin- /z/ age bears a greater proportion to the value of copper coins than it does to that of gold or silver coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportioned to their monetary value , which would be inconvenient . There is also in some parts of Europe a mixed metal of silver and copper , called billon , which is used for small coins . It is commonly about three fourths copper . It fortunately happens , that of the three metals , the one which is most liable to rust is the cheapest , and that gold , the most valuable , is the least liable to tarnish , or to be acted on by other agents , there being few acids in the laboratory of the chemist which are its solvents . The proportion of the circulation , which is filled by each of these metals , varies according to the wealth , the habits , and the laws of different countries . A wealthy community can circulate a much larger proportion of gold than a poor one ; and it is only in those in which the precious metals have great exchangeable value , as in Russia , and Sweden , that copper can constitute a large part of its circulation. * Before the discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency of some countries than it now does . In some parts of Germany , it constituted the common currency in the 10th century . But there were no copper coins in England until 1665 . Before that time , the silver penny f was the smallest coin . This was * Storch , Liv . V. Chap . II . /q/ minted with a deep cross . When it was broken into two parts , each was called a halfpenny ; and when into four , each part was called a fourthing , or farthing. * By way , however , of making some approach to the relative quantities of these metals , we may take the circulation of the following nations as examples : In Great Britain , the gold currency is estimated at 22,000,000 , and the silver at 8,000,000 ; that is , gold at near three fourths , and silver at something more than one fourth . In Russia , according to Storch , that part of the currency which consists of the precious metals amounts to 45,000,000 of rubles ; and that which is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of silver rubles at 25,000,000 , then , of the whole metallic circulation in that country , two sevenths would be in gold , and , of the remaining five sevenths , half would be in silver , and half in copper . In the United States , the difficulty of ascertaining the proportion of the several metals is the greater , in consequence of a large proportion of the silver currency being in dollars , or parts of a dollar , coined in Mexico , or other parts of Spanish America . On this account , the operations of the mint do not furnish here as good data for comparing the relative amounts of the different metals , as in those countries in which foreign coins are regarded as bullion .

I. , Introduction , xxir. /z/ The whole coinage of the United States , from 1792 to the 1st of January , 1838 , amounts to $72,881,446 48i , and is thus distributed : In gold , 4,968,526 pieces , $23,250,340 In silver , 122,621,982 pieces , 48,835,192 In copper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the aggregate amount of money coined does not differ much from the probable amount of metallic currency now in the country , yet the proportion of the several metals is very different from that here indicated , not only from the amount of foreign silver coins in circulation , but also because a large proportion of the gold coins first issued from the mint were either exported or melted up , after the market value rose beyond the proportion settled by law . It is not easy to say what addition to the domestic silver coinage , or deduction from the domestic gold coinage , should be made on these accounts ; but , if we suppose that all the gold coined from 1834 to the present time to be in circulation , ( as it undoubtedly is , from the effect of the law of 1834 , which raised the mint value of gold somewhat above the market value , ) this amounted , on the 1st of January last , to about eleven and a half millions . And if we further suppose one fourth of the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , in the form of coin , which would be about three millions more , our whole gold currency may be set down at fourteen and a half millions , and , consequently , /q/ the silver at about fifty-six or fifty-eight millions . As to the copper coins , we might fairly presume the whole amount issued from the mint to be now in circulation , with a moderate deduction for loss , and for the melting up of those coined before 1795 , when it was found necessary to reduce their weight . According to this conjectural estimate , if our present metallic circulation be divided into one hundred parts , about twenty of these parts would be in gold , seventy-five parts in silyer , and one part in copper . Estimating our population , at the same time , at 16,000,000 , equal to 3,200,000 families , the average portion to each family would be somewhat more than one piece of gold , equal in value to $4 50 ; forty-seven pieces of silver , of the value of $18 12 ; and about twenty-four pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen that the precious metals were first used , as instruments of exchange , in rude masses , which passed by weight ; but , as soon as , with a view to convenience , they were made to assume the regular form of coin , they seem to have been invariably flat and round ; the first , for the advantage of packing and transport , and the last , because , in the circular form , they would lose less by friction than if they were square , or of any other rectilinear figure . It was also found , that there would be an advantage in mixing gold and silver with cheaper metals . Such a mixture gives to silver , and yet more to gold , a hardness they do not naturally possess , by which they are better able to bear the daily friction to which they are exposed . Nor is this all the advantage . The precious metals are seldom found entirely pure , but are , when most nearly so , more or less mixed with other metals ; and the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expensive . It is , then , economical to have a standard of purity that is of more easy attainment . The first , however , seems to be the principal reason , since most /z/ virgin gold is far purer than the highest standard that has been adopted . Copper is the metal that is generally used to give hardness both to gold and silver , and commonly in the proportion of from one twelfth to one tenth . By the act of 1792 , which established the mint , the gold eagle , of the value of ten dollars , was required to contain 247 2 grains of pure gold in 270 grains of standard gold : that is , one twelfth of alloy , which was required to be partly silver , to prevent the copper from giving too deep a hue to the gold ; but , according to Dr. Seybert , * it not being found necessary , it was virtually disregarded at the mint . The requisition has been continued in the act of 1837 ; and , since the alloy is now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . By the act of 1834 , for the purpose of raising the value of gold , ( which , by the act of 1792 , had become so greatly undervalued , ) an eagle was required to contain only 232 grains of fine in 258 grains of standard gold , which is very near nine tenths of pure gold to one of alloy . And by a subsequent act , ( Jan. 18 , 1837 , ) the eagle , containing 258 grains of standard gold , is required to have nine tenths of pure gold and one of alloy , which makeS the legal quantity of fine gold in that coin 232.2 grains ; that is , one fifth of a grain more than the act of 1834 required . By the act of 1792 , the silver dollar of the /z/ United States was required to contain , in 416 grains of standard , 37H grains of pure silver , and 441 grains of alloy ; or 1485 parts fine to 179 parts of alloy . But , by the act of 1837 , the dollar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one tenth is alloy ; which is now the proportion in all coins of the United States , whether of silver or gold . In estimating the intrinsic value of coins , the alloy is never regarded . The parts of an eagle , or a dollar , have , in just proportion , the same relative quantities of puie metal and alloy . The copper cent , which first contained 11 dwts. , or 264 grains , then 216 grains , is now required to contain 168 grains ; so that a pound avoirdupois is coined into 41f cents . The impression on coins , besides having some suitable device , characteristic of the country , or exhibiting its emblems , or the head of its sovereign , always has the date of its coinage , which contributes to the means of estimating the rate of loss on such coins from wear . /z/ IT is obviously important that there should be coins of different values , both of silver and gold , to suit the various occasions of life ; but two very different modes of dividing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , eighths , and sixteenths , each denomination just the half of the one immediately preceding it ; and the other by divisions having the proportions of 1 , 10 , 100 , so as to adapt the current money to the decimal arithmetic . The last mode is a great convenience , as it contributes to ease , simplicity , and despatch , in all pecuniary dealings , as well as in keeping accounts . Yet , it would seem , from experience , not to be so well suited to the mass of mankind , in their ordinary transactions , as the binary division . Wherever the laws have endeavored to introduce decimal divisions in any species of measure , it has been found extremely difficult to prevail upon the great body of the community to lay aside the divisions to which they have been accustomed , * and their preference for which , by reason of the greater simplicity of those divisions , and often greater /z/ facility of application , seems to have a foundation in nature . France , profiting by her experience on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of division , in her system of weights and measures , on which Dr. Kelly justly remarks : * " The decimal system is used in all wholesale and government concerns , and is well calculated to facilitate the operations of commerce ; but the binary system ( that is , dividing standards into halves , quarters , eighths , &c.); is found more convenient in the inferior departments of trade , and particularly in retail business . The former system is , both by its divisions and vocabulary , admirably adapted for universal communication among the learned j but it is , perhaps , too scientific for the common people , to whom the business of weighing and measuring the necessaries of life is chiefly committed in every country . 77 In like manner , the United States , with a view of obtaining the same double advantage , have adopted the decimal system in their computations and accounts , but have , at the same time , consulted the tastes and habits of the people , by coining halves and quarters of the eagle , halves and quarters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public content with that accommodation , but persists in using halves and fourths of the quarter of a dollar , even where the ten cent and five cent pieces are most accessible , and although the foreign coin , that represent the former , are not suited to our * Kelly 's Cambist , Vol . I. , p. 133. /q/ decimal system , and are becoming comparatively scarce . As the value of so many articles of commerce is measured by their weight , and as weight is one of the principal elements of the value of metallic money , it would be a great convenience , if every coin had a simple and known relation to the ordidinary weights in commerce ; and yet more , if its weight , as Mr. Say has recommended , was indicated by its name . Every coin would then be a measure of quantity as well as of value. * But , after a system has been adopted , and been long in operation , this benefit would , perhaps , hardly justify a change . The coins now issued from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quarter eagle , of gold j the half dollar , the quarter dollar , pieces of ten cents and five cents , of silver ; and cents and half cents of copper . There are also in circulation both gold and silver dollars ; but there have been none of the latter , nor of the eagle of ten dollars , coined at the mint for many years.f The following foreign coins are now made a legal tender in the United States , by the act of 1834 , to wit : the gold coins of Great Britain , Portugal , and Brazil , at 94.8 cents per penny- /z/ weight ; those of France at 93.1 cents ; and those of Spain , Mexico , and Columbia , at 89.9 cents . The dollars of Mexico , Peru , Chili , and Central America , and those restamped in Brazil , at 100 cents each ; and the five franc pieces of France at 93 cents each . All these coins are required to be of a given fineness , to be determined by regular assays at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money of account adopted by the government , and used by most men of business , consists of dollars and cents , so as to conform to the actual coins , as well as the decimal system , yet the former money of account , of pounds , shillings , and pence , is not yet laid aside , but , in almost all the states , still obtains the ascendancy in popular use . The pound , however , has four different values in the United States ; and each of them is inferior to the pound sterling . This inferiority had its origin in the paper currency , which the colonies , in the scarcity of money they experienced , found it convenient to issue , and which all underwent more or less of depreciation . These different kinds of pounds are thus valued and distributed : In New England , Virginia , Kentucky , Tennessee , Ohio , Indiana , and Mississippi , the pound is 3 , and the dollar 6 s . New York and North Carolina , 2 ? , " " 8 s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 7 s. 6 d . South Carolina and Georgia , 4 ? , " " 4 s. 8 d . In the other states , there is either no uniform money of account , ( but in one part that of one state , and in another that of another , prevails , ) or they reckon altogether in dollars and cents . /z/ THE loss , which different coins sustain in handling and friction , is different in silver and gold ; and it varies in both according to the size of the coins , to the different kinds of alloy , and to their being more or less adapted to familiar use . Gold coins lose much less from wear than those of silver , partly from the greater fineness of the metal , and partly from their being more carefully and less frequently used . Coins of gold that is pure or approaching to it , lose much more from wear than when mixt with alloy , and the loss is less with an alloy of silver , or half silver and half copper , than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins of the same metal , the loss by abrasion being in parity of circumstances nearly in proportion to the surfaces , the largest which contain more value , in proportion to their weight , lose the least . So also do those coins , which are in most frequent use , because they are best suited to the pecuniary transactions of the largest class of the community . Thus half dollars are more used than dollars , and quarters more used than either . These indeed , in some communities , may be in /z/ more frequent use than coins either of greater or of less value . So if gold coins were more common , half eagles might perhaps be more used than either whole or quarter eagles the first sharing the circulation with bank notes , and the last with silver . There will therefore be some difference in the loss from the abrasion of coins between rich and poor countries ; the coins most in use being of greater value in the former , and consequently liable to a smaller proportional loss . Nothing but experience could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to a set of experiments made under the authority of the British government , about the beginning of the present century , it appeared : That the loss from wear , sustained by standard gold having an alloy of one twelfth , was less than by gold of greater purity . That the loss on standard gold was also less than gold of less purity . That the loss was less with an alloy of silver alone , or of sirver and copper in equal quantities , than it was with copper alone , copper and tin , or copper and iron . That the loss on standard silver was less than on standard gold , and about equal to the loss on gold of the finest quality that can be worked , that is , 231 parts fine in 24 ; and which loses four times as much as standard gold . That silver loses less than copper . That coins lose more the first year after they are put into circulation , than subsequently . /q/ That the loss is greater on stamped pieces , than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than those that are smooth . That the degree of circulation the coins had undergone was better indicated by the dirt which was found , by washing , to adhere to them , than by the dates of their emission . The difference of loss from coins of different sizes , and in different degrees of use , has been also exhibited by experiment . Thus it appears by that of the officers of the English mint in 1787 , that of the silver coins then in circulation , the loss on crowns was , disregarding fractions , about 3 per cent . ; on half crowns , about 10 per cent . ; on shillings , 24 per cent . ; and on sixpences , 38 per cent . And by another series of experiments , made at the mint in 1816 , the loss on sovereigns for the average of five years was , 0.726 per cent . ; and on half sovereigns was 0.883 per cent . On half crowns , for the same average time , 2.28 per cent . ; on shillings , 2.88 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Agreeably to the experiment made at the mint of the United States , on the eagle , half eagle , and quarter eagle , the loss they severally sustained in fifty years appeared to be in the proportion of . 1 , 2 , 3 , and that sustained by the dollar , half dollar , quarter , dime of ten cents , and half dime , respectively , were as 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 10. /z/ Mr. Jacob estimates the loss on English gold coins , from the preceding experiments in England , at one part in 800 , yearly ; and the loss on silver coins , as exceeding one part in 200 . But , making allowance for the greater loss on the coinage of other countries , and for the greater value of circulating money in silver , than in gold , throughout the world , ( which he estimates at 4 to 1 , ) he considers the general loss of silver and gold , from wear , to be nearly the same in both metals , and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty , in a year . Whether , however , it is more or less than this average , in any particular country , must depend upon the proportion which gold and silver severally hold in its circulation , on the character and proportion of its alloy , and on the size of the coins most in use . The annual loss in the United States is estimated by Mr. Gallatin at not more than 70,000 dollars on a metallic circulation of 40 millions , or little more than a six hundredth part , annually . But , when it is recollected that our active metallic circulation is almost wholly silver , and that a very large proportion of this is in half dollars , * Mr. Gallatin 's estimate seems to be too low . It appears by the official experiment at the English mint , in 1826 , that the loss on half crowns was about the half of one per cent. , or one part in two hundred annually ; arid , by a previous experiment * Of the 46 millions of silver which had been coined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ in 1 798 , that the loss on shillings , for eleven years , had been at about the same rate , though those then in circulation had become so smooth from long use . that the loss from wear was much less than the average. * Supposing , then , the greater rate of loss on the smaller silver coins to counterbalance the smaller loss on our gold circulation r and on Spanish dollars , the loss on the half dollars may be taken as the average loss on the whole metallic circulation . Estimating this at a two hundredth part , agreeably to the experience of similar coins in England , and supposing the whole circulation of the United States to be $70,000,000 , the annual loss by wear would be $350.000 a year . And if we suppose the wear on ten millions of gold in the vaults of the banks to be absolutely nothing , ( and the loss on a very large amount must be very insignificant , ) this would reduce the annual loss on our whole currency , on the previous data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin money for themselves , a part of the price which each one pays for this instrument of commerce is the expense of its mint establishment . This consists of the cost of the buildings , of the machinery and tools required in coining , of salaries of the officers of the mint , its artists and workmen , and of the loss of the metals and other expenses incurred in the process of refining , stamping , filing , and the like . Sometimes , indeed , the expense of coining is immediately borne by the individuals who carry bullion to the mint to be converted into coin ; but the cost does not therefore the less fall upon the nation . In that case , no less than where the coinage is gratuitous , so much of the natural stock is expended to procure the benefit of coin . These expenses vary not only in coins of different metals , and of different sizes , but also in different countries , according as they vary in the price of ordinary labor , and yet more in that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires . The proportional cost of coining gold must be much less than that of silver , as the expense on a /q/ given quantity is nearly the same , while the value of gold is sixteen times as great as that of silver . The difference of expense is , however , much less than the difference of value , as the loss or waste from refining , melting , filing , &c.,; is proportionally the same , or nearly so , in both metals . More nicety , too , is required in adjusting both the alloy and the weight of gold coins . The smaller the coin , too , the greater must be the proportional cost of the coining . The die of a half eagle will cost far more than half that of a whole one . The mechanical force employed is greater in the smaller coins , in proportion to thenvalue ; and the time expended by the workmen , which is the most important item of the expense , is nearly the same in a small coin as a large one . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , Denmark , and Russia , is as follows : In France , on gold coins , 0.29 per cent . ; on silver , 1.50 per cent . In England , " " 0.70 " " 2.22 " In Denmark , " " " " 2 . In Russia , " " 0.85 " " 2.95 " Smaller coins of 25 copecs , " 3.47 " " of 10 copecs , 4.44 " There are no data for estimating the separate cost of the different species of coin in the United States ; but the whole annual expense of the mint establishment for sixteen years , from 180 to 1817 , was $352,853 , during which time the value of the coins struck at the mint was $11,138,672 , which is equal to a charge of about 3 per cent. * But , in /z/ the ten succeeding years , ( with the exception of 1821 , ) the expenses were $224,783 , on an amount of coinage during the same term , of $15,300,340 , which is equal to a charge of only 1 per cent . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense has been yet farther diminished . When the coinage was , in the seven years from 1824 to 1830 , $15,806,270 , averaging $2,258,000 a year , it scarcely exceeded one per cent . Dr. Moore , the former director of the mint , estimated the cost of silver , when it amounted to three millions , at about of 1 per cent. , and the charge on the same amount of gold coinage at of 1 per cent . This , however , is exclusive of wasteage , which , on gold , is about , and on silver about of one per cent. * The expenses of the mint establishment have been lately considerably increased by the creation of three branch mints , to wit : one at New Orleans , for the coinage of gold and silver ; one at Charlotte , in North Carolina ; and another at Dahlohnnega , in Georgia , for the coinage of gold only . As in the operations of alloying the precious metals , and of giving each coin its requisite purity and weight , perfect accuracy is not attainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their just proportion of alloy , and some less ; and there will also be small irregularities of weight ; by a general regulation of law , a stated allowance is made for their occasional deviations from the * Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on Coins , in 1831. /q/ standard fineness and weight of coins , which allowance is technically called the remedy of the mint . It is founded on the inaccuracies that are unavoidable in the practical operations of coining ; and it assumes that small errors of deficiency , in the coins examined , are compensated by errors of excess in the coins not examined . The remedy may be for the weight alone , or the fineness alone , but it commonly is for both . At the United States mint , the remedy for both gold and silver was , by the law of 1792 , one part in 144 . This was an unusually large allowance . By the act of 1834 , it was reduced , in gold coinage , to 1 part in 384 , in fineness , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of 1837 , the remedy for both gold and silver coins has been farther altered , and graduated to suit the different coins both of silver and gold ; and one rule of deviation is adopted for single coins , and another for 1000 , or other large number. * The depositor of bullion is also charged with the cost of refining , when it is necessary , and with that of the alloy , f But , besides these just allowances , there is , at some mints , a farther deduction made at the expense of those who have their bullion converted into coin , which , in some countries , is limited by the estimated expense of coining , and in others is * See Appendix , Note 3. t At the English mint , the remedy for gold coins is - g- J j in the weight , and - jhy in the fineness . For silver , it is g- for the weight , and the same for the fineness , by which the whole allowance may be yo- . The remedy at the French mint is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . In all cases in which the mint issues coins above their intrinsic value , the excess is generally called a seignorage , though some writers limit the term to the case when the charge exceeds the cost of coinage. * The charges for mint expenses are called , at the English mint , brassage . There are , then , three different modes pursued in different countries , as to the amount of coin returned for bullion brought to the mint . 1 . In some , as in the United States , Russia , and England , as to gold coins , no charge is made- , and no deduction from the intrinsic value of the coin , ( except the remedy should be so regarded ; ) but those who carry bullion to the mint receive the whole of it back in standard coin.f 2 . Another mode is to charge the expense of coinage on the bullion converted into coin , which is done by affixing a value to the coin beyond its value in bullion , to the amount of the expenses* This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lastly , governments not content with a mere indemnification , so raise the value they affix to the coin as to yield a profit . This is the case in most of the European governments , with all their coins ; in England , with its silver coins , and in the United States , with its copper coinage . The effects of these several plans will be considered in the next chapter.f * Storch , Say , &c.; /z/ THE arguments and considerations , which seem to have recommended the practice of converting bullion into coin , free of any charge , to the few governments which have adopted it , seem to have been the following : The intrinsic and permanent value of the precious metals is measured by their weight and purity , independent of their form ; and , however they may , by the force of law , have an artificial value imposed on them , in the form of coins , yet , when sent abroad , they will be estimated by the general standard of the world , which disregards any thing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real addition can thus be made to the value of the metals by coining , there can be no inducement to charge a seignorage for the sake of indemnifying the community , since the charge is borne by the nation in either case ; in either , the national capital is diminished by the cost of coinage , and the public finds , in both cases , its remuneration , in the utility of a metallic currency : that , as the cost and the benefit are in both cases the same , it is better that the legal value should /z/ conform to the intrinsic value , both at home and abroad , than that the former should be arbitrarily raised , as such variance produces embarrassment in commercial transactions , is unjust to creditors in the first instance , tempts to counterfeiting the coin by the profit made on bullion , and takes away all inducement from individuals to carry bullion to the mint ; in which case , either the nation is not supplied with domestic coins , or the government is subjected to the trouble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into circulation : and , lastly , that when once the line is passed , and money is made to circulate for more than its intrinsic value , governments will not be content with the mere expense of coinage , but will make the seignorage a source of profit , by which the evils already mentioned will be proportionally enhanced . On the other hand , in favor of a moderate seignorage , or charge sufficient ( to defray the expenses of coinage , it is urged , that it is not true , that coin has no greater intrinsic value than the metal it contains ; for the latter has acquired additional value by its new property of saving the trouble of weighing and assaying , as is proved even in England , where the gold coinage is gratuitous , and where , in consequence of the time which each person who carries bullion to the mint has to wait for his turn , coin is commonly worth f of one per cent , more that bullion : that , when the gold and silver of individuals have thus been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should not pay for this manufacture than for any other ; /z/ and although the community is also benefited , by being thus supplied with an useful instrument of commerce , yet it has been thought , in analogous cases , both politic and just , to let the expense fall on those who are immediately benefited , in proportion to the benefit they have severally received , as in the case of canals , turnpike roads , and the post-office : that there is the less objection to this course in the case of coins , because , when once the payment of a seignorage is the only condition upon which metal can be converted into coin , the amount of such seignorage then enters into the value of the coin , and consequently , he who has paid it receives it back when he puts the coin into circulation j the expense thus falls upon the whole mass of buyers and sellers , who receive the benefit , that is , upon the whole community . It is further urged , that this charge on the community is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin is really more valuable than the metal of which it is formed , yet , where the government charges nothing for its fabrication , it will be worth no more in the market ; the consequence will be , that , whenever gold and silver are wanted for exportation , or for the workshop , coin will be used as readily for these purposes as bullion ; whereas , when the value of coin has been enhanced by a seignorage , bullion would be preferred , inasmuch as the additional value would be lost in the foreign country , or by melting . This mischief is increased , when the coin has become much worn , and the market price of bul- /z/ lion , in such deteriorated coin , exceeds the mint price in coin of full weight . As the worn coins pass current , by the force of habit , at their original and legal value , in the common transactions of life , but a greater amount in the same coins can be obtained in the market , in exchange for bullion , the coins fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted up , and sold as bullion . Adam Smith , * adverting to this state of things in , Great Britain , a short time before he wrote , thus remarks on it : " There was an evident profit , therefore , in melting down new-coined money ; and it was done so instantaneously , that no precaution of government could prevent it . The operations of the mint were , upon this account , somewhat like the web of Penelope : the work that was done in the day was undone in the night . The mint was employed , not so much in making daily additions to the coin , as in replacipg the very best part of it , which was daily melted down . " Nor is this all ; for , when money charged with a seignorage is sent abroad , as it occasionally will be , from a deficiency of bullion , it is more likely to return than when it has been gratuitously coined ; as the latter is worth no more at home than its weight in bullion , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In consequence of this advantage , the coin that has paid a seignorage will commonly be worth something more , even in foreign countries , than the pure metal it contains . * Wealth of Nations , Vol . II. , Chap . vi . /q/ And , lastly , a seignorage not only renders less coining necessary , by preserving it from melting or exportation , but it also economizes in the quantity of gold or silver required for the same amount and value of coins . Thus , let us suppose the expense of coinage to be 2 per cent. , and that , by a seignorage , the value of the coin is enhanced to that extent ; it is clear , then , that 98 ounces of gold or silver are made to furnish as much coin , capable of performing the same purposes , as 100 ounces , where the coining is gratuitous . If , in the United States , we estimate our whole metallic currency at 70,000,000 , and the expense at 2 per cent. , the sum that a sfiignorage would save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These arguments in favor of a moderate seignorage seem greatly to preponderate ; and , accordingly , all writers on political economy have concurred with Adam Smith , in favor of that policy . It may seem to some to afford presumptive evidence against the soundness of the reasoning of these writers , that , in England , where the interests of commerce are so well understood , no seignorage should be charged on gold , its principal currency ; especially , as it is only since the year 1666 , that the coinage has been gratuitous , or duty free . But Smith* attributes the introduction of the law , which then passed " for encouraging of the coinage of gold and silver , " to the prevalent notions of the " mercantile system , " by which the wealth of a nation was /z/ supposed to consist in its money ; and its continuance , to the influence of the bank of England , which , to replenish its coffers , furnishes the mint with its principal supplies , and which imagined that the charge of a seignorage would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suggests , that the relative insignificance of the annual saving , to which may be added the force of long-established usage , have contributed to continue what Smith calls their " useless piece of public generosity . " The example of England may account for its adoption in Russia and in the United States , conjoined , perhaps , with the belief , that a gratuitous coinage was necessary to insure an adequate supply of gold and silver to the mint . While Great Britain coins gold free of charge , she receives a heavy seignorage on silver ; but its precise amount fluctuates with the market price of that metal . A pound of silver , according to the present standard , consists of 222 dwts. of pure silver , and 18 dwts. of alloy . This pound is coined into 66 shillings ; but its value , according to the ordinary market price of silver bullion , is but 62 shillings ; by which the government receives a seignorage of 4 shillings in every 62 , or 6f- per cent . To prevent , however , a redundancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the silver coinage is not , like the gold , left free to all , but is retained in the hands of the government . Nor is this overvalued silver a legal tender to a greater amount than 40 shillings . In their copper coins , all nations charge a large /q/ seignorage . In England , the avoirdupois pound of copper is coined into 24 pence , * which is equal to 224 per ton . But this is more than double its ordinary current price in Great Britain.f It is not , however , a lawful tender beyond 12 pence . In the United States , also , its copper coinage yields a considerable profit to the government . In 1731 , the director of the mint states , that , after paying the expense of distributing the copper coins to all parts of the United States , the profit on this part of the coinage , for the sixteen years preceding , was $86,000 ; and that it might , for the future , be estimated at $10,000 a year . This must be deducted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profit is as great as it is in England , there is always a probability that it will be shared by counterfeiters , as is said to be the fact in that country ; and if the same thing has not occurred in the United States , it is because the rate of profit is much smaller , and because the requisite skill and machinery can not yet be obtained here but at a much higher rate . In the preceding remarks in favor of a seignorage , it has been assumed that it should not exceed the cost of coinage ; and it is certainly the safest course , that it should be limited by that cost . It is clear , however , that , if the additional utility imparted to the metal by its conversion into coin , is such that Kelly 's Cambist , Vol . I , p. 217. t McCulloch 's Com . Diet. , Art . Copper . /z/ the public would pay more than the cost , rather than not obtain it , it would be in the power of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to exact more than the cost ; and nothing could hinder it from reaching the utmost limit of what the public would pay , but the rivalship of counterfeiters ; and the expenses might be doubled , or , perhaps , trebled , before they would be tempted to fabricate coins of the standard weight and purity . Adam Smith seems to think that the seignorage in England might have been four or five per cent , without inconvenience ; and Say , in opposition to Storch , thinks that coinage may not only defray its own expense , but yield a profit to the government . Whatever difference of opinion there may be on this point , there seems to be no room for any as to the limits of the profit it is possible for the government to make . Whether it be diminished by counterfeiters , or not , it can never exceed the additional value which coin has over bullion ; and every attempt to exceed this limit will eventually prove fruitless . Whatever maybe the price which the government arbitrarily affixes to its coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than its intrinsic value ; and the knowledge of this fact will prevent its excessive value at home . Holders of bullion will , therefore , not carry it to the mint to exchange it for coin by which they are certain to lose . If , however , the government itself becomes the purchaser of gold and silver for the mint , it may , indeed , put the money it has charged /q/ with an excessive seignorage into circulation , by paying it to its officers or its creditors ; but such injustice is sure to produce its ordinary reaction . The same overvalued money is repaid to it in all its levies on the community ; and , in its subsequent contracts , the depreciation will be taken into account , in the terms of such contracts . Nor is it easy to make such depreciated money perform the functions of currency ; but foreign coins , bankers ' drafts , and other substitutes , will be resorted to in preference . Some of the governments of Europe , having experienced these evils from a seignorage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their steps , and reduce it to the actual expense of coinage . S torch suggests , as a means of saving the coins of a country from the crucible , where the coinage is gratuitous , that there should be a somewhat higher standard for gold and silver plate than for coin , by which , as the workers in those metals would be subjected to the necessity of refining , to bring the coins to the legal standard for plate , they would , to avoid that trouble , endeavor to purchase bullion , in preference to melting up the coin. * And such is the practice in Russia . The expedient is , however , at present , impracticable in this country , where there is no legal standard for plate . The want of such a regulation gives some advantage to foreign manufacturers , whose work has /z/ been assayed and stamped by officers appointed for the purpose ; whereas , the purchasers of plate of domestic manufacture have to rely solely on the integrity of the manufacturer . Whether time may not bring a remedy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire that degree of confidence , which would make their plate equal in value to that stamped at the Tower of London , when such confidence would be a source of so much profit , or whether we shall continue to rely on protecting duties , in mitigation of the evil , or , lastly , whether some of the state legislatures may not , by assay offices , supply the remedy , is yet to be determined . /z/ WE have seen that each of the precious metals has its separate recommendations for coin ; that gold is most convenient for large payments , and silver for small ones . Both of them have , therefore , been used as money by all civilized nations . But , where both are used as measures of the value of other commodities , their value to one another must also be determined . If the same piece of merchandise may be purchased , or the same debt be paid , either by so many pieces of gold , or so many pieces of silver , the relative value of the silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these metals , like that of every thing else exchangeable , is liable to fluctuation . We have seen that their values have varied in different ages , that they are very different in different countries , and that they are subject to fluctuation in the same country . And although some of these changes are common to both metals , yet each is subject to its own change , by an alteration in its supply or demand ; and thus their relative value may be affected by the rise or fall of either metal . We accordingly find , that their rel- /z/ ative value has varied , at different times , and in different countries , from 8 to 1 to 16 to 1 , and that they have had opposite fluctuations in the same country , in the course of a century or less . The convenience of having both these metals as money , and the inconvenience arising from the unsteadiness of their value to one another , have given rise to the question , whether it is better for the law to make one metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts ; that is , whether every debtor should be compelled to pay in the metal selected as the standard , or have the option of paying in either . Though the writers on the theory of money have , with scarce an exception , since the days of Loclce , concurred in the advantages of a single standard , yet they have , as yet , prevailed but upon two nations to adopt it in practice : Great Britain , with some qualification , and Russia . In other countries , either the inconvenience of a double standard , which is only occasional , has been unheeded , or they have thought it necessary to make both metals a legal tender , to secure the benefit of both currencies . This has , apparently , been the case in the United States , where , after full and repeated discussions of the question , they decided , in 1834 , on continuing their first policy of making both metals equally the measures of value of all other commodities ; but , in readjusting their value to each other , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten dollars from 247 2 grains to 232 grains ; whereby , as the dollar contains 371 /q/ grains of fine silver , the proportion of gold to silver has been altered from 15 to 1 to 16 to 1 . The advantages relied on , in favor of a single standard , are , that it is more favorable to justice between debtor and creditor , in the execution of contracts , and that it is the only effectual mode of keeping a country adequately supplied with both species of coin . In the first place , as to its effect upon contracts . It is clear , that , as either gold or silver may , in any given period , either rise or fall in value , compared with other commodities , or remain stationary , there are nine contingencies to be considered , in estimating their relative value : one in which both metals remain unchanged in value , and eight in which one metal or both have undergone an alteration of value . Let us compare the effects of a single and a double standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , in the case of a single standard , which we will suppose to be silver : 1 . If both metals rise in value , then the creditor gains , and the debtor loses . 2 . If they both fall , the creditor loses , and the debtor gains . 3 . If silver remains stationary , and gold rises , then neither debtor nor creditor gains . 4 . If silver be stationary , and gold falls , the same , to both parties , as before . 5 . If silver rises , , and gold is stationary , the creditor gains , and the debtor loses . /z/ 6 . If silver rises , and gold falls , the creditor gains , and the debtor loses . 7 . If silver falls , and gold is stationary , the creditor loses , and the debtor gains . 8 . If silver falls , and gold rises , the creditor loses , and the debtor gains . Secondly , when both gold and silver are legal tenders : 1 . If both metals rise in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . If both fall , the creditor loses , the debtor gains . 3 . If silver is stationary , and gold rises , as payment in silver will be preferred , the creditor neither gains nor loses . 4 . If silver is stationary , and gold falls , as payment in gold will then be preferred , the creditor loses , and the debtor gains . 5 . If silver rises , and gold is stationary , the debtor will pay in gold , and , consequently , neither party will gain or lose . 6 . If silver rises , and gold falls , the creditor loses , and the debtor gains . 7 . If silver falls , and gold is stationary , the debtor will then choose to pay in silver ; by which he will gain , and the creditor lose . 8 . If silver falls , and gold rises , as before , the creditor loses , and the debtor gains . It appears , from the preceding comparative view , that , in both cases , there are two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debtors are unaffected ; that , in the other six , injustice /q/ is done by the absolute or relative change in the value of the metals ; and , consequently , that , so far as respects the invariableness of the standard , there is no difference , whether one or both metals be made a legal tender ; but , that , so far as it respects debtor and creditor , there is a very great difference ; for , of the six contingencies that work injustice , there are three , in the case of a single standard , by which the creditor gains , and three by which he loses , so as to make the favorable and unfavorable chances precisely equal ; but r in the case of a double standard , when the debtor may profit by the fall of either metal , there are five of the six cases of injustice in which the creditor loses , and only one in which he gains . It may , however , be remarked , that , as these changes in the value of the precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously stated , and can , therefore , only affect the small proportion of contracts which require many years for their execution , the objection to a double standard , on account of its influence on the execution of contracts , seems not entitled to much consideration ; and the less , when it is recollected , that the loss is most likely to fall on the party best able to bear it , and that even this probability may be taken into the estimate , when the contract is made . It is , then , on the second ground , that the advocates for a single standard must mainly rely ; that is , that it is most favorable to an adequate supply of both metals . /z/ Whenever the law has made both metals a legal tender , and , consequently , determined their relative value , if , in the fluctuations to which they are subject , their proportional value in the market should differ from that affixed by law , all debts will be paid in the overvalued metal , and that which is undervalued becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where it is more justly appreciated , or it is manufactured into plate . This was the case with the gold currency of the United States , when its price in the market had risen 4 or 5 per cent , above the price in silver affixed to it by law . Eagles then commanded a premium in the market , and , of course , ceased to circulate as money . It is , in like manner , imputed to the discrepancy between the legal and the market proportional value of the metals , that gold has become the principal currency of England , and silver that of France . When in England the law of 1717 rated the guineas as equivalent to 2 1 shillings , it is considered to have overvalued gold , compared with silver , Hf per cent. * And in France , before the recoinage in 1785 , the louis tfor was worth , in the market , 24 livres , 8 or 19 sous , though it was rated by law at only 24 livres . In this way , gold being overvalued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , and it became the only currency , except silver coins under weight ; while silver , being , before W85 , the overvalued metal in * Liverpool on Coins , p. 85. /q/ France , became there the exclusive currency . Since the error has been corrected by a recoinage , silver still continues to be the prevalent currency , partly from the force of habit , and partly from the frauds to which gold coins are , by their great value , peculiarly exposed. * If , however , but one metal is made a legal tender , then there being no discrepancy between the legal and the market value of the other , it will be taken by every one , according to its market rate , and there will be no inducement to export it , or to melt it , in preference to the other metal . Thus , when American eagles were worth , to brokers and goldsmiths , 10 dollars and 50 or 60 cents , if every one the banks , the custom-house , the post-office had been at liberty to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as readily and as generally , at those advanced rates , as when they had passed at $10 , saving the slight inconvenience of the fraction of a dollar , which , however , would not have been greater than guineas in England , when they were worth 21 shillings . But some have supposed that unless both metals be made a legal tender , and have their proportional values fixed by law , they will not circulate . They seem to have drawn this inference from assimilating domestic coins , that are not a legal tender , to foreign coins . But they are widely different . Coins struck at the mint by authority of law , will have , with every community , a warrant /z/ for their intrinsic value , that is , for their weight and purity , that foreign coins may not possess , and arc likely to obtain as general a currency from the public confidence , as if their credit was enforced by law . Let us suppose that English sovereigns issued from the mint as at present , but that creditors were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their debts , and that nothing was a legal tender there but gold or silver bullion of a certain fineness . Can it be doubted that they would , nevertheless , have the same general circulation then as now , and that the advantage they possess as coin , in saving the trouble of weighing and assaying , would compensate , and perhaps more than compensate , the single disadvantage of not being forced on a creditor ? In the reign of William and Mary , gold was not a legal tender ; yet , as gold coins were then struck at the mint , we must presume that they had g , general circulation . Sovereigns are now worth about or f of 1 per cent. , in that country , more than bullion , on account of the delay at the mint which each one must bear in turn , and they might have been worth as much at that time . So , if Spanish dollars were not a legal tender in the United States , they would not circulate a whit the less . On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . From the year 1797 to 1806 , all foreign coins , except " Spanish milled dollars , and parts thereof , " ceased to be a legal tender in the United States ; * * Seybert 's Slat , 543. /q/ yet , during that period , the gold coins of Great Britain , Portugal , and France , constituted a large part of the metallic currency of the United States ; and their market price , as compared with silver , , not then differing much from the proportion that had been previously fixed by law , they continued to pass at the same rate . In like manner , from 1809 to 1816 , foreign gold coins were no part of the currency recognized by the law , yet no one who had them found any difficulty in passing them at the same rate as the current coins of the country , especially if they were such as the public were familiar with . If they did not have quite as ready and general a circulation as our domestic gold coins , it was not because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of them being worn and clipped , it was necessary to weigh them ; an inconvenience from which the public were saved by eagles and bank notes . These bank notes themselves , that have so general a circulation , are never a legal tender . But , it will be said , they are payable in money which is a legal tender ; and they are taken on the faith that they can be exchanged for such money when it is wanted . Such confident expectation is indeed generally entertained ; but yet , when , last year , ( 1837 , ) it was disappointed by the suspension of specie payments , the notes of the banks did not the less circulate . How , then , can we doubt , that that which has the same intrinsic value as the standard coin will obtain circulation , merely because it has no aid from the law , when /z/ we see that which has as little aid , and no intrinsic value whatever , perform all the functions of a currency , by the mere credit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we want the light of European experience on this question , it is afforded in a solitary instance . Russia is the only country in which but one metal is made a legal tender ; and , there , according to S torch , payment is made indifferently in silver , the standard metal , or gold , according to its market value in silver . " Whenever , " he says , " the engagement to pay is in money , and not in paper , the price of every thing is regulated by the value of silver ; but gold is not on that account the less received in payments , provided it be valued in silver currency , according to the rate established by the course of trade . Neither of the contracting parties being able either to gain or to lose , in giving or receiving one metal or the other , it is equally indifferent to both , in what money payment is made , and the two metals circulate concurrently without injuring or depreciating one another. * /z/ BUT the advocates for making both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative value in the market differs from that fixed by law , so much as to begin to drive the undervalued metal out of circulation , a remedy for the mischief may be found in an alteration of the law , so as to make the legal proportional value of gold to silver conform to that of the market . To this there are two answers . In the first place , the remedy is not commensurate with the mischief . It will not be called for , until the evil is seriously felt from the exportation or melting of the undervalued metal ; and then the readjustment may be so delayed by the various impediments to which legislative action is exposed. , that , when it does take place , the country may be completely drained of the metal it had previously underrated . The policy of the change may be opposed by private interests , real or imaginary ; or by discordant plans of reform ; or be postponed to preponderating party or political objects . On this subject we may speak experimentally . The American eagles had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a remedy was at-/z/ tempted in congress , and the subject was there agitated some five or six years , before a remedy was provided , in 1834 , by raising the proportion of gold to silver , from 15 to 16 to 1 . But when this law passed , all the eagles and half eagles issued under the law of 1792 had found their way either to Europe , or the melting-pot . Let us , however , suppose that the same course of delay and contention , which occurred then , would not occur again ; the remedy itself would be productive of inconvenience . It would cure one evil , only by creating another . The adaptation of the coin to the altered relative value of the two metals , could be made only by changing the value either of the gold , or the silver ; and , supposing the alteration to be made in the gold coins , as was the case in 1834 , and as would always be done in this country , so long as silver constitutes its chief currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different values , in circulation at the same time ; and , the same thing recurring at every subsequent alteration in the relative value of gold , there would be as many varieties of coin , having the same denomination , as there had been changes in the value of the metal . Had congress , instead of waiting until all the American gold coins were driven out of circulation , reformed its legal value as soon as it was perceived to deviate from the market value , we might , by this time , have eagles of five or six different values in circulation together at first , worth $10 , then , in succession , , $10* , $10J , $10i , and $10 ; so that , none /q/ but mercantile men and money-changers knowing which was which , they would cease to have a general currency , and pass only by weight . Nor could this inconvenience be prevented , but by a recoinage with every alteration of the legal standard j a corrective of the mischief , which , to say nothing of the expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , that in the case of a single standard , in the fluctuations to which the relative value of gold and silver is liable , the same gold coins will pass at different values , at different times ; but it is surely a far less inconvenience that there should be a disparity of value of the same coin at different periods , and these probably distant , than that there should be a disparity in similar coins , circulating at the same time . If all the coins of the same denomination are always of the same value at the same period , it is probably of no more importance that they have borne a different value in the same place , at a different time , than if they have borne it in a different place , at the same time . It has been thought , however , by some , that the law of 1792 , in estimating the relative value of gold to silver at 15 to 1 , estimated gold too low ; and that it is to this error that the banishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the correctness of this opinion may well be questioned . In France , indeed , at the time the American mint was established , the value of gold to silver , by the mint regulations , was 15i for 1 , and that seemed very nearly to correspond /z/ with the market rate ; but , in England , with which country our commerce was principally carried on , and to whose relative value of the two metals it was therefore of more importance that ours should conform , the proportional value of gold and silver in the market was nearly that adopted in the United States . It is true , that , by the mint regulations of that country in 1774 , which , of a pound of standard gold , coined 44 i guineas , and of a pound of standard silver , 62 shillings , the proportion appeared to be 15.2 to 1 . But this proportion , it is agreed by all British writers , rated silver too low , and gold too high . Adam Smith distinctly states , that , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition , in 1784 , silver was underrated in proportion to gold , and that the market price of standard silver bullion was not five shillings and two pence an ounce , ( the mint price , ) but had been from five shillings and three pence to five shillings and five pence. * If we take the average at five shillings and four pence , then the market price of silver to gold is not quite as 1 to 14.75 , and of course rates gold lower than it was in the United States . The same fact is attested by lord Liverpool , after a most careful and thorough ex- amination of the subject . He estimated that , when , in 1714 , the English guinea was made equivalent to 21 shillings in silver , gold was overvalued lf. per cent. , and that the relative value of silver continued to increase during the greater part of the last century.t /q/ If , in addition to the preceding high authorities , we consult the state of the market for the precious metals in the United States , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the act of 1792 , rather overrated than undervalued ; for , during several years afterwards , silver regularly commanded a premium in the market , of from 3 to 5 per cent . The relative price of gold , however , began , about the beginning of the present century , to rise , and gradually advancing , in the course of some twenty years , that metal , instead of silver , at length commanded a premium in the market , correspondent to a like gradual rise in England . It can furnish no argument against the correctness of the estimate here made of the relative value of gold in England , that it differs more than a half of 1 per cent , from that of France . The relative value of the precious metals is very various in different parts of Europe , and often shows , between neighboring countries , a greater difference than we have supposed between England and Prance . Thus , in 1821 , it was , in Amsterdam 15.87 to 1 , but in Hamburg 15 to 1 ; so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 . In Leghorn 14.65 to 1 , and in Genoa 15.34 to 1. * But , admitting that the relative value at the mint in England showed the real relative value , and that the mint regulations in the United States had adopted it , so that , instead of gold being here * Kelly 's Cambist , Vol . II. , p. 14 ' /z/ 15 to 1 , it had been 15.2 to 1 , it would only have somewhat lessened the subsequent disparity between the mint price and the market price of gold . It would merely have delayed , not prevented , the banishment of our gold coins , that actually took place . The eagle would have been then undervalued about 13 cents less than it was , but it gradually rose up to be worth $10.66 ' . , ( its present price by law , if of full weight j * ) and before it had risen to half that value , it had disappeared from circulation . It thus appears , from what has actually taken place in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver has experienced since 1792 , it was not possible to have then fixed on any ratio , that would not have driven out of circulation one metal or the other ; and if the value of gold to silver had been higher than it was , although it would have retarded the expulsion of gold , it would have greatly aggravated the mischief first experienced &f; a comparative scarcity of silver , and a consequent premium on that metal . It deserves to be noticed , that , when Mr. Jefferson , in 1784 , proposed , in his new system of money and coinage , to rate the value of gold to silver as 15 to 1 , Mr. Robert Morris , then public financier , objected to it , as rating gold higher than the market would justify ; to which Mr. Jefferson acquiesced ; but he inclined , he says , to " give a little more /q/ than the market price for gold , because of its superior convenience in transportation . " * And Mr. Hamilton , in his report on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its value in Europe , and justifies it on the ground of our greater vicinity to the Mexican mines.f But , in opposition to these views , stress has been laid on the experience of France , which fixed the relative value of gold and silver in 1785 , and whose mint and people had since been adequately supplied with both metals . On this fact , Mr. Gallatin mainly relies in his excellent essay on the currency , and that example , together with the weight deservedly attached to his opinions , probably decided congress on the adoption of both metals as standards of value , as he had recommended , notwithstanding several successive reports to congress , in which the policy of a single standard was earnestly and ably recommended.J Jefferson 's Correspondence , Vol . I. p. 140. 1 See Hamilton 's report on the Mint Establishment , Jan. , 1791. t By Mr. Ingham , Secretary of the Treasury ; by Mr. Campbell P. White , of New York ; by Mr. John White , of Baltimore ; to which we may add the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , in an examination , in 1828 , before a committee of the house of commons , of which he was himself a member , on being asked whether he thought that the proportions between gold and silver could be so adjusted , as to prevent one being preferred , so as almost to exclude the other , answered , that he thought it not possible ; and he added , " The objections to the two metals is , that they are constantly varying ; and it may be doubtful , whether the fact of that tendency does not make it more desirable , in the case of a double standard , to /z/ The force of the example , however , is much weakened , when it is recollected that the currency of France is chiefly metallic , while ours is chiefly paper ; and that a discrepancy between the market value and the mint value of the precious metals to one another , which would produce no serious mischief there , might drain us of the undervalued metal altogether . In that country , where large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the metal has an additional intrinsic value , as a convenient and labor-saving instrument of commerce , there is a counteraction to the error of the mint regulations which does not exist here , where the functions of a gold currency are generally performed by bank paper . Since gold has risen in value , compared with silver , throughout the world , it has , indeed , generally borne a premium in France ; but that premium has not been sufficient to drive it out of circulation , in consequence of its superiority over silver for large payments , and their not having bank paper to supply its place . take something in the way of seignorage , or brassage ; in other words , something for the price of manufacture more than you otherwise would , so as to counteract , a little , the tendency to melt the one or the other down . This allowance would tend , in some degree , to meet an increased expenditure at the mint ; for the consequence of varying proportions between the two metals might increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rejected metal . On the contrary , if you put something of the value of manufacture into the coin , then , even supposing your coin goes abroad by any altered proportion , or any state of exchange , it is an inducement to the persons abroad to keep it in the shape of coin . " /q/ The seignorage , too , which is charged on coinage in France , contributes to prevent the exportation or melting of the undervalued metal ; for , though the additional value which coining gives to the metal is not wholly lost in a foreign country , it is very much diminished . On this account , an undervaluation of gold , compared with silver , which might not be sufficient , in France , to compensate for the loss on exporting or melting gold , might , in the United States , where there is no seignorage , drive it out of circulation . If the price of gold continues to rise , it may be confidently predicted , that the gold currency will be driven out of circulation in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , or makes a readjustment of the relative value of the two metals , which , besides the inconvenience of coins of different values under the same name , could not fail , in a country like France , whose currency is almost wholly metallic , greatly to disturb , for a time , private interests , as well as commercial operations . We have , too , against the experience of France , the more apposite and more varied experience of England . In that country , before 1664 , the relative value of gold and silver was regulated by the king 's proclamation . From 1664 to 1717 , silver alone was a legal tender , and gold left to find its value according to the fluctuations of the market . In 1717 , the law made both metals a legal tender ; and , in making a golden guinea equivalent to 21 silver shillings , it fixed the ratio of gold to silver /z/ at 15.2 to 1 . This law continued in force until 1816 , when the government adopted the policy of a single standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and reasoning could throw upon it ; only qualifying it so far as to make silver a legal tender to the amount of 40 shillings , and copper to the value of 12 pence . Though there was some diversity of opinion on the subject , when the law passed , yet the measure seems to have obtained unanimous approbation since . Mr. Ricardo , who , being a practical banker , is entitled to peculiar respect on the subject of money , thus speaks of the inconveniences that had been experienced from the previous policy : " It appears , then , that , whilst each of the two metals was equally a legal tender for debts of any amount , we were subject to a constant change in the principal standard measure of value . It would sometimes be gold , sometimes silver ; depending entirely on the variations in the relative value of the two metals ; and , at such times , the metal that was not the standard would be melted , and withdrawn from circulation , as its value would be greater in bullion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was highly desirable should be remedied ; but , so slow is the progress of improvement , that , though it had been unanswerably demonstrated by Mr. Locke , and had been noticed by all writers on the subject of money since his day , a better system was never adopted till the last session of parliament , when it was enacted , /q/ that gold only should be a legal tender for any sum exceeding 40 shillings . " * With such strong countervailing testimony of the mischievous effects of making both metals standards of value , in a country agreeing with our own in the commercial habits of its people , and in the predominance of paper in its circulation , the past impunity of France , under circumstances so different , seems not entitled to much weight . The precise effect of the acts of congress of 1834 , concerning the coinage , will manifestly depend upon the character and extent of the alterations that may take place in the relative value of gold and silver . Should gold , as compared with silver , continue its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was rated here somewhat higher than its average price in other countries , it will be some time before the alteration would have any effect in driving gold out of circulation . But if , on the other hand , its relative value should fall , a very small change will begin to expel silver . It will then happen , as it happened for some years after 1792 , that , whenever specie is to be transmitted to the United States , from a country in which both metals are readily obtained , it will be in gold ; but , when it is to be exported , it will be in silver ; by which process , the two metals will no longer exist in that proportion which is adapted to the wants and habits of the people ; and there will be a relative scarcity of the metal which we /z/ most use , and which can not , like gold , find a convenient substitute in paper . When either change may be brought about in so many ways , it is not easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers on the subject of money concur , that silver was rising in value during the greater part of the last century . In the year 1717 , the relative value of gold to silver , in the market , was not far from that fixed by law , 15.2 to 1 ; yet , according to Stewart in 1760 , and Adam Smith in 1774 , it was , at those periods , less than 15 to 1 . This opinion has been supposed to be contradicted by baron Humboldt , because he shows , from authentic data , that the quantity of silver furnished by the American mines gradually increased during that century ; and their average annual product , for ten years , was at its maximum from 1801 to 1810 . But this fact is not inconsistent with the relative rise of silver . During the same century , the product of gold was also greatly increased , by the working of the Brazil mines ; and its proportional increase , compared with the product of the preceding century , was much greater than that of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities , both metals diminished in value , by reason of their easier production and greater abundance , when compared with one another , gold fell in value , by its greater relative increase . Thus , while the whole product of both metals , which , in the seventeenth century , had been 1540 millions of dollars , had increased , in the eighteenth century , to /q/ 2960 millions , equal to 92 per cent. , silver had increased , during the said periods , from 1215 to 1850 millions , 51 per cent. , - and gold from 325 to 1110 millions , 241 per cent. * But , however silver may have risen in value for the first three fourths of the eighteenth century , yet , after that time , when the discovery and working of the great Valenciana mine had so greatly increased the supply of that metal , its relative ( as well as its absolute ) value began to fall , and that of gold to rise ; and the current , thus turned , has continued to set in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concurred to increase the relative value of gold . In the great increase of wealth which has taken place in the civilized world in the last half century , the use of gold for ornaments and utensils has had a greater proportional increase than silver.f As , from the same cause , the proportion of large payments would be greater , gold would , also , have been proportionally more used for coin , if the increase of paper money had not more than compensated this additional demand . Something , too , is to be ascribed to the smaller amount of silver that has been sent , of late years , to China . Our anticipations of the future relative value of the two metals will depend upon our estimate of the preceding causes . If the relative rise of gold has been mainly owing to the increased supply of /z/ silver , that cause has ceased , since the rise and continuance of the domestic troubles in Spanish America . There is no longer an over proportion of silver extracted from the mines ; but that of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , so far as the alteration of relative price was owing to the greater consumption of gold , that cause is likely to continue . This effect , however , may be counteracted , or more than counteracted , by the renewed demand for silver for the China trade . In any event , it is scarcely to be expected , that , contrary to past experience , the several causes that influence the supply or demand of either metal , and , consequently , their relative value , will so counteract each other , that , in thirty or forty years , and , probably , much less , that relative value will not change ; and when it does , we may find , that , in our mint regulations , we have adopted the worst features both of the British and the French system of- coinage ; and that the mischief of making , like the French , both metals legal measures of value , has been aggravated by making , like the British , our coinage gratuitous . /z/ IF only one of the metals be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one metal , and some of another ; and others , again , have deemed the question unimportant . There seem to be two reasons for giving a preference to one metal over the other . The first is , that the metal which , by the common usage of a country , has been the ordinary measure of value , and which is coined into the common money of account , is , for that reason , to be preferred . Of this character is the dollar in the United States . It is not only the money in which accounts are generally kept , but the value of gold coins , like that of all other commodities , is stated in dollars , to convey a precise idea of their value ; while that of a dollar seems to require to be compared with nothing else . This distinction is , indeed , nominal , and the difference imaginary ; but it seems better to conform even to fancied distinctions , when , to do so requires no concession of any thing useful or important . The second reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadiness of value that one metal has over the other ; for the changes to which the metals , in common with every thing else , are exposed , /z/ must affect the relative interests of creditors and debtors , in all contracts to be executed at a distant day , or enduring for a long term ; and , consequently , the metal least liable to change will do the least injustice . On this account , some have thought that gold ought to be preferred , because , they say , it approaches more nearly to uniformity , all over the world , than silver , and it has been less affected by the discovery of America ; silver being supposed to have been reduced in value in the proportion of 4 to 1 , while gold has been reduced only as 3 to 1 . But it does not follow , that , because the American mines have less affected the price of gold than that of silver , and that the former has been hitherto less changed in value , it will hereafter continue to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of that metal greater than that of gold , has long since produced its effect ; and the proportional price of the two metals , in the market , has been adjusted to it . Unless , then , some new disturbing cause arise , to vary the supply or the demand of either metal from what it is at present , their relative values will continue as they now are . And , though nothing but time can enable us to - say , which of these metals may hereafter experience the greatest change of value , there seem to be some reasons for expecting that it will be gold . There is , in the first place , so much less of it than of silver , that a change in the quantity produced , which would not be perceived in silver , might sensibly alter the relative value of gold to other commodities . As the principal mines of the /z/ two metals ( those of America ) are estimated to produce about 46 times as much silver as gold , an addition or diminution of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on their relative value as would be produced by 45 times that amount of silver ; and fluctuations , both of supply and demand , sufficient to affect the value of the commodity , seem somewhat more probable in the article that is scantily , rather than that which is abundantly , supplied ; in the same way , that the price of game varies more than that of butcher 's meat , and of rare and delicate vegetables more than of those that are used as bread . We have , also , a reason to expect an alteration in the supply , from the indications of gold , which have been given in the United States . Should this branch of the mining business settle down into a regular and steady employment of capital and labor , ( of which there are some symptoms , ) the quantity of gold which might be thereby added to that now in the world , would , in a few years , certainly have an effect on its price . On these accounts , it seems , that , though silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value more than gold , it is hereafter likely to change less . In the second place , for the same reason that gold approaches nearer to uniformity of value , in different parts of the world , it is more liable to temporary changes in the same place . It is much more sensitive to alterations , in the exchange , than silver is ; and a rise in the exchange , which would have no effect on silver , would cause an exporta-/z/ tion of gold , supposing that the laws had not given it a value different from the market value . Further reasons may be found , for preferring silver as a legal tender , in the following circumstances : Gold is more likely to be counterfeited , and , on that account , more often requires to be assayed ; is more apt to be filed , and made lighter , and , therefore , must generally be weighed ; and , lastly , gold is more easily substituted by bank notes than silver ; and , where they are issued of a low denomination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus enhance the difficulty , with debtors , of making payment , according to the strict requisition of law . On these accounts , silver seems the preferable metal to make a legal tender ; though the reasons for preferring it may not be of sufficient weight to justify a change in the law where gold , as in England , is already the legal tender , and the received standard of value . It may , however , be remarked , that this question , as well as that of a single or double standard , would lose all its importance , so far as concerns express contracts , if the parties would always agree on the metal or coin in which they were to be paid , and the law permitted either party to enforce the agreement . In this way , a contract to pay $1000 may be discharged in eagles , and a contract in eagles , in like manner , be discharged in dollars , if the parties could agree on the amount that was equivalent ; and , if they could not , the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all chance of injustice . /z/ ADAM SMITH considers that money partakes more of the character of fixed than of circulating capital , as , contrary to all the other kinds of circulating capital , it constitutes no part of the revenue of the society . He assimilates it , therefore , in its functions , to those machines and instruments which facilitate and increase production ; money performing nearly the same office in distributing other commodities , that those machines do in producing them . In consequence of its thus being a mere instrument of distribution , though a highly useful one , there is this difference between it and other commodities . While its increase or diminution seems to have the peculiar property of lowering or raising the value of every thing else , the intrinsic value of other commodities is indeed less affected by such alterations of the quantities of the precious metals , than by the increase or diminution of any other species of circulating capital . Thus , if the quantity of the precious metals should be quadrupled throughout the world , while such increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four times what they previously were , yet , as these commodities would remain in the same quantities as before , their real value would be unchanged , and there would be no addition to the wealth of the world. * In like manner , if those metals were to be greatly diminished , though the diminution would proportionally raise their value , it would leave the value of every thing else unaltered . But if the quantity of bread , or meat , or cloth , were doubled , though the price would be reduced one half , or near it , every thing else would be somewhat raised in value , by their then exchanging for double the quantity of those useful commodities . It is , in short , but a nominal difference in the value of any commodity , whether it will universally exchange for an ounce , or half ounce , of silver or - gold ; but it is a real difference , whether it exchange for a greater or less quantity of any other commodity . There seems , also , to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its profits . In general , the mere profits of both , apart from the risk and trouble attending any particular employment of them , must be the same , seeing that they are readily convertible into each other . But , by reason of the quality possessed by money , of being demandable by all creditors , and , consequently , of being required by all debtors , the profits * In this , gold and silver are regarded only as performing the functions of money ; but , like any other commodity , an increase of their quantity will add to the wealth of the world , so far as they are used for other purposes than money . /q/ of money , that is , its interest , may exceed the ordinary profits of other capital . This happens when there is an unusual amount of debt in the country , in consequence of overtrading , and excessive speculation . The extraordinary demand for money to meet previous engagements , by the increased competition of borrowers , necessarily raises the market rate of interest . Though this increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of money in circulation is comparatively small , that is , less than it ordinarily is , yet it may also take place when it is comparatively large . It is only necessary that the demand for money should be great in proportion to the supply , and this will be the case , when the circulation has been increased , if the indebtedness of the country has been yet more enlarged than the circulation . It may thus happen , that when money has become depreciated by the over issues of the banks , if , by reason of the overtrading and speculation that have taken place , the amount of debt contracted has been also very great , there will also be a proportional demand for money to discharge it , and the rate of interest will be raised accordingly . This was the case in New York , in the year 1836 . The high prices of every thing as well as the official statements of the condition of the banks , showed that the currency had experienced an unprecedented distention ; yet , by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town lots , in wild lands , and in every species of enterprise , the debts due to the banks , /z/ and to others , as well as for further speculations , occasioned a demand for money so far beyond the supply , that the market rate of interest rose to an unexampled height , so that money was attracted to New York from all the neighboring states , for the purpose of being lent out. * It may be asked why such high prices of property did not produce a proportional increase of sales , and thus make the supply of spare capital adequate to the demand ? The owners of property had the strongest inducements to convert it into money , when they could obtain high prices , and then make a profitable investment of the proceeds . The answer is , that , as to the debtors and speculators , they had not always property to sell ; and as to those who did possess it , though some did make the conversion and profit by the state of the money market , others were prevented from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high , it would be yet higher . Even many of the debtors prefer- * These facts of the enlarged circulation of the banks , the advanced prices of property , the unusual demand for money in the large cities , and the consequent high market rate of interest , are all noticed by the bank commissioners of New York , in their annual report of January , 1837 ; and they seem to consider the concurrence of the high prices of property , indicating a redundancy of money , with a high market rate of interest , as an anomalous fact , and inconsistent with the received doctrines of political economy . It is , however , in strict conformity with the principles of that science , that the market price of an article should rise , notwithstanding its increased supply , if the increased demand for it had been yet greater . Though money , as compared with other articles , had depreciated , yet , if increased as it was in quantity , there was not enough to satisfy the demands of debtors , and for further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /q/ red borrowing money at a high interest , rather than selling property while it was rising in value , just as a prudent man would prefer paying a high rent for a house , for a short time , to buying it at an exorbitant price . He may lose more thousands in the last case , than he would hundreds in the other . /z/ HAVING , in the preceding pages , considered the subject of money , let us now consider that of its substitute , credit . This is the transfer of something valuable to another , whether money , goods , or services , in the confidence that he will be both willing , and able , at a future day , to pay its equivalent* Credit , indeed , to a certain extent , must have existed , before the invention of money . In the earliest stages of society , it must have sometimes happened that one man would seek and obtain of another , some article which that other could spare , on the promise of paying an equivalent for it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of civilization ; and in the same way as money was found to be a convenient substitute for barter , credit has been found to be a convenient substitute /z/ for money . Both changes grow out of the altered circumstances of society ; both are contrivances for saving the time and labor of its members , by way of increasing their productive powers , and augmenting their wealth . Let us take a glance at the various occasions in which credit is sought by one party , and given by another . One of the first , and most obvious of these occasions , is when an individual has a sudden call for money with which he is then unprovided , and when the urgency of his wants will not permit him to wait until he receives his wonted income . In that case , he naturally seeks to borrow of one who has money unemployed , and who will be willing to lend for a remuneration , to compensate him for the risk he may run of losing his money , and for the accommbdation he affords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regulated by the wealth or ability of the borrower , his character for intregrity and punctuality , the scarcity of money , and other circumstances . A large portion of the community , too , find it convenient to purchase many of the articles of their ordinary consumption on credit , rather than for cash ; sometimes , because there may be additional trouble in making payment for very small sums , and at others , because they have not always the money . As a great many earn barely enough for the support of themselves and their families , and must sometimes give credit , they must also ask it . Those who have debts due to them can , on the faith of these debts , obtain credit ; and some , /q/ who have neither money , goods , nor debts , occasionally obtain it , if they have any reasonable expectation of acquiring the means of payment in a short time ; some additional profit to the creditor , in such cases , compensating his risk of loss . In these , and a thousand other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealings . Its benefits extend to all classes ; but while it is merely convenient to the rich , it is indispensable to the poor , and the intermediate classes . Without it , indeed , all contracts respecting the future would be at an end , from that of the landlord and tenant for rent , to that of the daylaborer and his employer for wages . In this last very numerous description of contracts , credit is always given by the employer , if the money is advanced , and by the laborer , if it is not . But credit , besides being thus useful in keeping the framework of society together , and facilitating its operations , is a powerful instrument of production . Thus , a skilful artificer is idle for want of* the raw materials to carry on his trade . By either purchasing these on a credit , or by borrowing the money to purchase them , he can so increase the value of the materials by his labor , as to repay the borrowed capital with a profit , and earn liberal wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active producer . Another is engaged in some useful branch of industry ironworks , or a coal-pit , for example and he finds that , by an addition to his capital of one half , he can double the quantity of iron or coal that he /z/ extracts from the mine . Not having the money , he is induced to borrow it . In this case , as in the other , the additional gains have been created by credit . The same thing may be said of any profitable enterprise , whether in agriculture , commerce , or manufactures . If he who engages in it has not capital of his own , and , consequently , carries it into execution with borrowed money , then all the profit beyond what will repay the loan and its interest , seems fairly the production of credit . Credit not only gives new employment to productive industry , it makes that employment more unremitting . By its means , the mamifacturer is able to dispose of his fabrics , as soon as they are made , to a responsible purchaser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who is able to pay for them ; and lie , in turn , is able , by credit , if he requires it , to make a further purchase of materials . But it may be said , that money would perform all these useful purposes as well as credit , and in general perform them better , as it would avoid the risks and uncertainty which must always accompany credit , and would at least save the trouble and expense of keeping accounts . One of the advantages of money we have seen to be its saving the necessity of credit . All this is true in general , and in most cases it would be better for both parties to buy and sell for cash , instead of credit , if these were equally attainable . But it must be recollected they are not : that money is a commodity which is purchased by labor ; that it is a costly instrument /q/ of commerce ; and that it would be far more so , if it were made sufficient for all the purchases that take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be so increased , but at the expense of some other important want . Although , then , credit may not be altogether as convenient as money , yet , as it costs little , and is substituted for an expensive instrument , the saving that is thus made may much more than compensate for the inferiority of the substitute . Besides , in some cases , credit may be more convenient than cash , as where purchases are very frequent and small , or where , ' when large , there are mutual debts and credits . There may be a saving of time and trouble , in settling with one 's family grocer , butcher , or baker , once a month , rather than to provide the change for every trifling purchase . So , where there are mutual dealings to a large amount , it might happen that nine tenths of the labor of making payments would be saved without any attendant inconvenience , when the writing of half a dozen words supplies the place of transporting perhaps a cart-load of siJver . Without a credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that are now so gainful , would be comparatively insignificant . Every merchant , no longer trusting to agents and factors , would be obliged to attend his merchandise in person , and , of course , could not engage in more than one adventure at once . Receiving money for all he sold , arid paying it for all he bought , his operations would be limited by the actual amount of capital /z/ he owned ; and he could derive none of the aid now afforded in distant traffic , from bills of exchange , by which the use of the precious metals is so much diminished . Credit , therefore , economizes the use of money , which , as we have seen , is a costly part of the machinery of commerce . It quickens industry , by enabling the whole of the productive classes to get their products sooner to market , and to continue their operations without intermission . In the small traffic of society , it saves time ; and , by enabling any one to anticipate his revenue and his profits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , a great convenience in the multifarious emergencies which life is ever presenting . By it , the inactive capital of one man is a source of profit and gain to himself and another , whereby the sum of national wealth is augmented ; and , lastly , as credit is in proportion to integrity , prudence , industry , and good faith , it is a constant encouragement to these virtues , especially in that class of the community where they are most useful . That it also has its abuses , can not be denied . It sometimes leads to knavery and fraud , that had not otherwise been practised , and sometimes invites to increased expense . These , however , are exceptions , which bear a small proportion to the general character of the cases of credit . Dr. Franklin , with his accustomed sagacity , saw the benefits it was likely to confer , when he directed , in his will , the proceeds of certain debts to be constantly employed , in lending money to /q/ young tradesmen ; for , though the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most useful direction . Credit enters so largely into the dealings and concerns of every civilized community , that , if any large part of its operations were suddenly suspended , the whole machinery of society would be at a stand ; and even those who had money would , for a time , not be able to exchange it for what they wanted . A considerable proportion of our foreign goods are purchased on a credit , by the importers . These extend a credit to the wholesale dealers in the large cities ; who , in turn , credit the country merchants , and they their respective customers . If it was suspended in any one class of the series , it must be injuriously felt in all below it ; and if suspended altogether , it might put a stop to more than half the commercial dealings of the community ; that is to say , more than half their present wants , dependent on commerce , would be ungratified . Hence it is , that , when , from any cause , it is impaired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt by all the others , in a general stagnation of business , and pecuniary difficulty . In general , what is called a scarcity of money , is nothing more than a deficiency of credit an impaired state of mutual confidence . The effect of such suspension , as has been mentioned , is not confined to those who receive credit , but also extends to those who give it . Thus , if the New York merchant is unable or unwilling to give credit to the country merchant , being , on that /z/ account , able to sell less , he , of course , is required to buy less . He , consequently , has less occasion for credit in England , and may limit his purchases to what he can pay for in cash . The effect of this reduction of demand is , a redundancy of those commodities he had been accustomed to buy , and which can find vent only by a diminution of price . The same consequence would follow , if the country merchants , generally , refused credit to their customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the difference of effect , in the different cases , is according to the amount of credit they severally give . Thus , as the New York merchant commonly gives credit to a greater amount than the country merchant , the effect , both on those of whom he buys , and on those to whom he sells , is proportionally greater . In short , in this great stream of credit , which turns so many of the wheels of commerce , if the current is arrested in any part of its course , it immediately occasions a redundancy in all above , and a deficiency in all below ; and these are the two great evils of commerce . It would seem , that , notwithstanding the functions of credit are often the same as that of money , of which it is merely the substitute , there are so many occasions in which it is more convenient than money , and its uses so multiply with the extension of commerce and wealth , that its place can never be supplied by any increase of the circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater is the amount of circulation in a country , and the greater its dealings for cash , the greater . /q/ also , are its dealings on credit . There is , for example , no country in which there is so much use made of credit as in England ; and there is none in which the currency is so large for its population . But , large as is its amount of circulation , it is small , compared with its wealth ; and it owes this economy of money to its more diffusive and more perfect system of credit . /z/ HAVING , in the preceding chapter , seen the utility of credit , let us now advert to the principal modes and forms in which it exhibits itself in commercial dealings . 1 . The most simple and most common form of credit is , where goods are sold , or services rendered , on the faith of the personal character and responsibility of the party receiving the benefit , without any written acknowledgment of the debt . Most of the goods sold by country merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the wares sold by their artificers , both in town and country , such as clothes , hats , shoes , household furniture , &c.,; are examples of a credit of this kind ; and it varies , according to diversities of usage , species of trade , and the personal character of the parties , from a few weeks to a year , or more . As a part of what is thus sold on a credit is never paid for , a small addition to the price , in cash , must be made , to indemnify the seller for the risk of loss , and to afford him the average rate of profits . When we recollect how much more most shopkeepers and tradesmen sell on a credit than for cash , and how large a proportion of the circulating cash is used /q/ for these purposes , we must be satisfied , that the whole amount of this class of credits , in the United States , must greatly exceed the amount of its currency ; and that it may reach several hundred millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits is , where the debtor gives to his creditor a written acknowledgment of the debt , accompanied with a promise to pay it on a given day . This writing not only facilitates the recovery of the money , in case the creditor should find it necessary or expedient to resort to the courts of justice to compel payment , but , by its formality , seems to impose a further obligation on the debtor , to make punctual payment . Some of these writings are of higher dignity than others j that is , they give greater privileges to the creditor , and subject the debtor to greater liabilities . Thus , bonds , which are papers under seal , are distinguished from promissory notes , by the English common law , and in all the states where that system prevails . By the laws of some of the states , bond creditors are . entitled , on the decease of the debtor , without leaving personal assets , to be paid out of the landed property , in the hands of his heir or devisee ; but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the states , too , when a deceased debtor 's estate is insufficient to pay both these classes of debts , bond debts are entitled to the preference . Whenever the debts of the first class are not paid at the time promised , or after the ordinary term of credit , they are often converted into credits of this class ; and the creditor has a right to inter- /z/ est from the day of payment of either bonds or promissory notes , both by law and usage . By far the largest proportion of this class of credits is in promissory notes , especially in the mutual dealings of mercantile men . We may form some idea of their vast amount , when we find those which were discounted at the several banks in the United States , amounting , on the 1st of January , to $485,000,000 , and on the 1st of January preceding , to 40,000,000 more . These discounts , moreover , constitute but a part , and , perhaps , not the largest part , of this description of credits . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the payer and the payee , yet the latter can , in writing , transfer his interest to another , which is called an assignment ; and such assignee will have the same rights as the original payee , either to receive the money , or to make a transfer of it ; and so with every successive assignee. 3 . Bills of exchange are a third species of credit , by which a man obtains money for a written order or authority to receive an equivalent sum , which he has in a distant place ; and they are so called , because the two contracting parties agree to exchange the money of one country for money in another . This species of credit consists of three original parties ; as one , the drawer , requests another , the payer , or acceptor , to pay a sum of money to a third , the payee . Like the promissory note , it is also capable of being transferred from hand to hand by writing , which is called an endorsement ; /q/ and every one so transferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a fourth party . Bills of exchange are chiefly used by merchants , in foreign traffic , to save the expense and risk of transmitting the precious metals . Whenever two countries are connected by commerce , there will be mutual debts and credits between them , which are adjusted by bills of exchange , to the convenience of all parties . Thus , A , in New York , consigns cotton or tobacco to B , in Liverpool , to sell on his account ; while C , in New York , is indebted to D , - in London , for j woollens and hardware . By means of a bill of exchange , which A draws upon B , and sells to C , who endorses it to D , A and D both receive the money respectively due to them in foreign countries ; C remits the money he has engaged to pay in London ; and , as to B , though it may seem the same thing , whether he pays the money he owes to one person or another , he is indirectly benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obtaining their debts . But for this exchange of credits , B 's debt to A must have been paid by the transmission of specie from Liverpool to New York , and C 's debt to D , by a like transmission from New York to London . Though , in general , the mutual debts between two countries tend to balance one another , yet , in the vicissitudes of commerce , they are , occasionally , very unequal . In that case , in the country most in debt , ( supposing it , at the same time , able and /z/ willing to pay its debts , ) there will be more persons desirous of buying bills , than there will be persons able to sell them ; and then bills will sell for a premium ; inasmuch as it will be better , for persons who have remittances to make , to pay such premium , than to be at the risk and expense of remitting specie . So , on the other hand , if there are more persons wishing to sell bills than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the drawers would rather make some abatement from their money in a foreign country , than incur the expense of transporting it . In this way , the price of bills of exchange fluctuates in the market , like any other commodity , according to the proportion between the supply and the demand ; but they can never rise above , or fall below , the value of the money they are drawn for , and the charges ( that is , the freight , insurance , and commission ) of transporting it from the foreign country . - Though it is the commercial dealings between two countries , which most frequently determine the price of bills , or , as it is commonly termed , the rate of exchange , between them , yet , any thing else , which may occasion money to be sent from one country to another , has the same influence ; as , money remitted to absentees , or sent abroad for the purchase of stock or land , or to pay foreign subsidies . The rate of exchange is therefore determined , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by the difference of sums then payable ; so that a debtor nation , if a /q/ part of what it owes is not yet demandable , may have more money to receive than remit , and , consequently , more sellers of bills than buyers . In this way , the loans and credits which citizens of the United States obtained in 1836 , and before , of the English banks , and other capitalists , while they swelled the amount of debt against America , contributed to keep down the price of bills on England . As by far the largest portion of cash payments between distant countries is made by means of bills of exchange , and their price rises or falls , like that of merchandise , their fluctuations are watched with great interest by the mercantile community ; and they are all estimated by a reference to a known standard , called the par of exchange . To determine what it is with exactness , is often a question of nicety and difficulty , from the different monetary systems that prevail in different countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The par of exchange between two countries is that quantity of the money of the one , which will be precisely equal to a given quantity of the money of the other . Thus , the number of dollars which are equal to 100 sterling , or the number of pounds sterling which are equal to $100 , is the par between Great Britain and the United States . The intrinsic par that which is always understood when no other is specially mentioned is , when stated quantities of the money of two countries contain equal quantities of the same metal , and of equal fineness . This par is easily ascertained . /z/ But the commercial , or current , or temporary par compares them according to weight , fineness , and market price . This last may be affected by the mint regulations of a country , by the wear of the coin , and other circumstances . Two sums of money are at par in the first sense , when they contain the same quantity of fine gold or silver ; but they are at par in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities. * When two countries adopt different ratios for the value of gold to silver , the intrinsic par will be one thing , when it is estimated in silver , and another , when it is estimated in gold . Thus , if the par between France and the United States be computed in silver , $100 will be equal to 534.53 francs ; but if in gold , then , as 10 eagles ( equal to $100 ) contain the same quantity of fine gold as 12 T V ( 7 2 tT French 40 franc pieces , they are equal only to 518.88 francs . So , if our silver coins be compared with those of England , 100 sterling will contain no more fine silver than is contained in $434.89 ; but if the gold coins be compared , then 100 sterling is , as we have seen it contains as much as 48 T 6 ? j 5 - eagles , equal to $486.65 . On this account , in countries where both metals are a legal tender , a medium between the two is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fluctuations of exchange , the money of each country is commonly made the fixed standard , and the alterations expressed in * Kelly 's Cambist , Vol . II. , 13. /q/ the foreign money . But this is not always the case ; for in the United States , in stating the rate of exchange with England , the money of that country is made the standard , and the fluctuations are expressed in dollars or pounds of current money . But in estimating the exchange with France , Holland , and other parts of Europe , the dollar is made the standard , and the rise or fall of exchange is expressed in French livres , Dutch guilders , &c.; ' The money which is thus , by usage , made the standard , is technically called the certain , and that which measures the fluctuations , the uncertain ; though the causes and the effects of the fluctuation belong as much to one as the other . When a given amount of money , in one country , will purchase a larger amount in another , exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfavorable to the last . Thus , supposing , when exchange with England is at par , 100 sterling is equal to $486.65 , and it should be worth , in the market , $490 , exchange would be favorable to England , and unfavorable to the United States . These terms have been used , because the state of exchange , when not at par , is considered to indicate which nation is creditor , and which is debtor . It follows , that a favorable state of exchange is that which is advantageous to the remitter or buyer of bills , and proportionally injurious to the seller ; and this rule holds , whether the money of the country be the certain or the uncertain ; but , in the first case , exchange will be favorable , when it is above par , and in the last , when it is below par . /z/ Thus , exchange with Paris will be favorable to the United States , when a dollar will exchange for more than the par of 5,34 livres ; and with London , when 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Besides the real par of exchange , which compares the actual values of the money of different countries , there is sometimes a nominal par ; that is , one that prevails by usage , and which does not compare equal values . Such is the par that is still referred to in the United States , in stating the exchange with England . It assumes a dollar to be equal to four shillings and six pence sterling , agreeably to the value of that coin when a general assay of foreign coins was made in England , by Sir Isaac Newton ; and on this basis all the states have compared the pound of their respective currencies with the pound sterling , and have estimated 100 sterling as equal to $444.44 . But the quantity of fine gold contained in 100 sterling is equal to that contained in 48 T Vy American eagles ; which are equivalent to $486.65 ; so that the real intrinsic par is 9 per cent , above the customary and nominal par . Whenever exchange is unfavorable , to the same extent the export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of 1834 , the gold eagle of the United Stales was required to contain 232 grains of fine gold in 258 grains of standard ; but , by the subsequent act of 1837 , the eagle is still required to weigh 258 grains of standard gold , but to contain nine tenths of fine gold ; which slightly alters the law of 1834 . The precise quantity of fine gold in an eagle should now be 232 1 grains ; and all the estimates in this work so suppose it , in conformity with the law of /z/ /q/ imports discouraged . When a given amount of money , in a foreign country , is worth a larger amount in this , the exporting merchant gains this difference by placing funds abroad , and can afford to give a proportionally higher price for articles of export . The importing merchant , however , must experience a correspondent disadvantage , in paying for foreign goods . Whenever , therefore , exchange with England is above the real par in the United States , the excess is a bounty on our exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our imports from it ; but this difference , it must be remembered , can never exceed the expense of transmitting the precious metals . But , as the debts and credits of a nation , like those of an individual , must , in time , balance each other , exchange can not be generally and permanently against any country ; and as the equilibrium can be restored only by increasing exports , or diminishing imports , when a nation has bought more than it has sold , or by the contrary course , when its sales exceed its purchases , the influence of exchange on the export and import trade contributes to accelerate the restorative process . Although the whole sum of a nation 's imports and exports must , on an average of years , be equal , yet this is not necessarily the case , in its trade with any particular country ; and with such , of course , exchange may be generally favorable or unfavorable . But , in such cases , the average deviation from the par of exchange will be balanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exchange are so very convenient , not only to merchants , but also to travellers , and all persons having occasion to send money abroad , and they are of so much importance to the parties confiding in them , that the codes of all civilized nations have attached to them peculiar privileges , which are enforced with great rigor . copious heads in commercial jurisprudence. * As a large number of our merchants are engaged , almost exclusively , either in the export or import trade , and as , when they engage in both branches , they often employ different agents , a considerable proportion , both of the imports and exports , are paid for by means of bills . These are mostly negociated in the United States ; and on much of the cotton and tobacco , bills are drawn , by the shipper , on the consignee , and accepted by him , before he has made sale of them . In the same way that the mutual debts between different countries are cancelled by foreign bills of exchange , so are those between different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . 4 . Evidences of the public debt , or certificates of stock . Governments , like individuals , sometimes find it expedient to anticipate their revenues by means of their credit . It is a most valuable * For all the diversities on the subject of money and exchange , whether from law or usage , the reader is referred to Kelly 's Cambist , a work which has no superior for clearness , accuracy , and precision . /z/ resource , in great national emergencies , whether for the defence or improvement of the state ; and if used , as it ought to be , only on those occasions in which succeeding generations will share the benefit with the present , it is no less just and wise than efficacious . The great Erie canal of New York had , probably , not been even now constructed , had not the state contracted a debt for that purpose . Pennsylvania has obtained a similar benefit by similar means . The purchase of Louisiana could scarcely have been effected without a public loan : the American revolution certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raising money , on the credit of future taxes , has been greatly abused . It has not seldom been employed to waste the national capital on objects in which neither the existing generation , nor their posterity , had a real interest . But , so long as the money is borrowed in the country , however uselessly or wastefully it may have been expended , it never can ruin the nation . As . the money was made before it was spent , by those who lent it to the government , it may be used to prevent the nation from being richer , rather than to make it actually poorer . Those who lend to the government receive certificates of their debt , which are called stocky which bear an annual interest , and are transferable from hand to hand . Where a government is in good credit , it can commonly borrow on better terms than individuals ; and thus it spends that capital which finds the least profitable employment . A /z/ large part of the English debt now yields to the holder but 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the debt was originally contracted , paid a much higher rate for most of it , by making itself a debtor for a larger amount than it actually received . This class of credits , in England , amounts to more than 13 times* the whole currency of Great Britain ; and it is an annual charge of - fa on the land and industry . Except the treasury notes , which have lately been issued by the United States , they now have no public debt . 5 . Bank bills . These are the promissory notes issued by banks , in exchange for the promissory notes of individuals , for bills of exchange , or specie . They are distinguished from the second species of credits in this , that they are not , like the former , payable to a particular person , but to the bearer , or holder of them . By reason of this circumstance , which makes endorsement unnecessary , and the confidence every one has , that he can convert them into cash whenever he chooses , and from the supposed wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have acquired the still more important distinction of performing the functions of money ; and , the better to fit . them for this important office , they are printed from plates skilfully engraved , as well as signed and countersigned ; by which the difficulty of * Estimating the currency at 60,000,000 sterling , and the debt at /z/ /q/ counterfeiting them is increased j and they are in sums convenient for circulation ; as in fives , tens , twenties , fifties , and yet larger multiples of the common money of account . In this acquired character of money , they have been found so much more convenient than the precious metals , that , in some countries , they constitute almost the entire currency ; and , in this view , may be regarded as one of the most important inventions of commerce . But , from the facility which this preference for bank paper gives to the banks to extend their issues , and the temptation they are under so to extend them , for the sake of increasing their gains , this species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given rise to much regulation by the legislature . It has , however , been doubted , whether the laws , in aiming to prevent some evils , have not , sometimes , created others still greater . The policy of several of these regulations is yet contested ; and they involve some of the most unsettled problems in political economy . They will be fully noticed in the succeeding chapters . The amount of the notes issued by the banks of the United States , on the 1st of January last , was 116,000,000. * To this maybe added their notes payable to order , and their drafts on each other ; which are a sort of inland bills of exchange , by which the public is further accommodated to a large amount . /z/ Though the amount of bank paper is far less than that of private promissory notes , or even of bills of exchange , yet , when we recollect how many payments each bank note makes in a year , it can scarcely be doubted , that , in the whole mass , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger amount , than are contracted by the promissory notes of individuals . Besides the species of credit that have been mentioned , there are others , in which property is pledged to the creditor , as security for the debt . When real estate is thus pledged , it is called a mortgage ; and when goods , it is called a pawn . But these transactions , though assuming the form of credits , are , in their essential features , sales . They deliver an equivalent for the money or property received j but the title is not complete , until the debtor has failed to make payment at the time stipulated . The nominal creditor then gives no confidence , and incurs no risk ; and the debtor parts with as much value as he gets , and commonly more . /z/ BANKS are of two kinds : banks of deposit , and banks of circulation . The first are so called , because they issue no paper but upon gold and silver deposited with them for safe keeping . They are comparatively rare ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable species of banks , they deserve a particular notice . The first bank of this kind was the bank of Venice , which was established in the twelfth century , during the most flourishing era of that celebrated aristocracy . Its origin is not accurately known ; but it is said , by the historians of Venice , that , in 1171 , the republic , being involved in war , levied a forced loan from its wealthier citizens , at an interest of 4 per cent . ; and that the lenders appointed a number of their body to receive and disburse the interest ; and that this committee finally became the bank of Venice ; but when , or in what way , is lost in the obscurity of time . In the absence of authentic records , S torch suggests , in the way of rational conjecture , that , as the interest on the loan was always punctually paid , every credit entered on the books of the as-/z/ sociated lenders might be regarded as a productive capital ; and that , therefore , such entries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , might be frequently transferred from hand to hand . This practice would , eventually , show the whole body of lenders how easy and simple it was to settle their mutual claims by transfers on these books ; and when they , at length , came to perceive the advantages that commerce might derive from this method of settling accounts , bank money was invented. * In whatever way it originated , says the same writer , this committee of lenders ( chambre des preteurs ) became a bank of deposit ; and its operations consisted in effecting the payment of bills of exchange , and of contracts between individuals . Though it was without capital , its bank credits commanded a premium in current money . It continued in existence until 1797 , when the invasion of the French , in overthrowing the govern ment , extinguished the debt of the state , and annihilated the bank . In 1423 , it yielded a revenue to the state of near a million of dollars an immense sum , in those days . The bank of Amsterdam , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of deposit . It was instituted in 1609 , by the merchants of Amsterdam , for commercial purposes , immediately after the independence of Holland was established by its pacification with Spain . Amsterdam was , * Storch , Pol . Econ. , Vol . IV. , p. 95. /q/ at that time , a place of great trade , which brought to it the coins of all countries ; and as these were often clipped and worn , the real value of the current money was about 9 per cent , below that of coins just issued from the mint . The consequence was , that these last were immediately melted up or exported , so that the merchants found it impracticable to pay the bills of exchange drawn on them in good coin , and the value of those bills was proportionally depreciated in the market . To remedy the evil , a bank was established under the guarantee of the city , and modelled after that of Venice . The plan of the bank was to receive the light and worn money , then in circulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a credit on its books for such value ; which credit was transferable by entry in the book of transfer ; and , to induce the merchants to make deposits , it was enacted that all foreign bills of exchange , of 600 guilders and upwards , should be paid in bank money . Under the operation of this enactment , and together with the inconvenience felt from a disordered currency , deposits were soon made , at first in ducatoons , which were Spanish coins then circulating in Amsterdam , and which the bank made its standard ; receiving them , however , at the value of 3 guilders or florins , which was 5 per cent , less than their current value , though probably little if any thing short of their real value . Other foreign coins were afterwards received in like manner , subject to a like deduction , and entitling the de- /z/ positor , as in the case of ducatoons , to a credit on the books of the bank ; which credit , as it performed all the functions of currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether of current or foreign coin , the bank riot only gave a credit in its books , but it also gave to the depositor a receipt or recepipc , which authorized the bearer to withdraw , at any time within six months , the same amount of the particular coins deposited , upon the conditions of his transferring to the bank as much bank money as the depositor had received , and on paying for the keeping of the specie , one fourth per cent , if in silver , and one half if in gold . This bank money , as the bank credits were called , seems from the first to have commanded an agio or premium over the current money . This arose partly from the fact , that the bank had received it only at about its intrinsic value , ( which was about 95 per cent , of its current value , ) and partly from the greater safety of the money in the custody of the bank , and its more easy transfer . By reason of these advantages the agio was commonly 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank money had no inducement to reconvert his bank credit into coin , especially as he could not do so without paying for its safe keeping . The consequence was , that nearly all the money first deposited became the property of the bank , at the price at which it had been received , that is , about 95 per cent , of its current value . It may , however , be presumed , that , after most /q/ of the Amsterdam merchants had obtained bank credits commensurate with their business , and the amount of bank money became equal to the wants of the city , the deposits did not continue to increase . As they took the place of currency , and , by the aid of bank transfers , were made to perform its functions , they could not much exceed the amount of money that would have circulated without them ; and being , in many respects , so much better than the money it superseded , it would not be less . But the bank did not confine its operations to coin . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount of gold and silver bullion was brought there , the bank , to give encouragement to a branch of trade then thought particularly advantageous , received bullion on the same terms as coin ; that is to say , it gave a credit on its books for 95 per cent , of its mint price , together with a receipt , by which the holder might receive it back , if applied for within six months , on his transferring his bank money , and paying for the safe keeping of the bullion . But , as the market price of bullion was commonly yet higher than its mint price the former being influenced by the deterioration of the current coin , and the latter being fixed by law the receipts given by the bank for bullion , unlike its receipts for coin , could generally be sold at an advance in the market , either to those who wanted them for the purpose of drawing bullion from the bank , or to those who bought them with the inten-/z/ tion of holding them , until they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered to run out of date , but if not used before the expiration of six months to obtain bullion , they were renewed . Bullion was thus continually flowing into and out of the bank ; it being most freely deposited when the market price was low , and most frequently withdrawn when the price rose ; but the average amount at all times in the bank was very great , and many times exceeded , it was believed , the sum that had been originally deposited in coin , for the purpose of furnishing the merchants of Amsterdam with money of a higher and more unvarying standard . The high credit of the bank made it the great negotiator of exchange for all the principal commercial cities of Europe , from which it was continually attracting gold and silver . Though the bank money and the receipts which were granted by the bank on each deposit of bullion soon separated and fell into different hands , the bank money being used as currency , and the receipt as an article of speculation , yet , as every one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both bank money and a receipt , and the value of the two united made up the market value of the bullion , there was a conflict of interests between the owners of bank money and the holders of receipts , and each class of bank creditors was interested in depreciating the claims of the other . Thus , the cheaper were the receipts , the better were the terms on which the owner of bank money could obtain bullion ; or , if /q/ he wished to sell his bank money , the higher would be its agio or premium in the market . On the other hand , the lower the holder of a receipt could depress the agio of bank money , the less would be the cost of bullion to him , or his assignee , and , ofcourse , the more valuable his receipt . To prevent the fluctuation in the value of bank money , and the stock-jobbing to which these rival interests gave rise , the bank had agents , or brokers , in its employ , who were ready at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. , and to buy when it fell to 4 per cent. , which was not only a remedy for the mischiefs previously experienced , but a further source of profit to the bank . This institution , which had been established for the purpose of correcting the evils of a vicious currency and an unfavorable exchange , proved a considerable source of revenue to the city of Amsterdam , as well as of extension to its commerce . Its gains were from the following sources , to wit : 1 . Its charge for safe keeping on all the money or bullion it paid out . 2 . The profits of such receipts as had been permitted to expire ; which profits , being the difference between the money deposited and the bank credit allowed on it , we have seen nominally amounted to about 5 per cent . 3 . The fees charged on every account opened , and every transfer . 4 . Penalties for overdrawing , &c.; 5 . Its profits by buying and selling bank money . The bank professed to lend out no part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , /z/ to have a guilder in gold or silver for every guilder credited on its books . Such was the guarantee of the city of Amsterdam , and such was implicitly believed to be the fact by its citizens . They remembered that , when , in 1672 , Louis XIV . invaded Holland , most individuals demanded their deposits , and the bank paid them with so little hesitation , as to inspire general confidence in the fidelity with which its affairs had been administered . Many of the coins , too , then paid out , showed marks of the fire which had burnt down the state-house , ( in which the bank was kept , ) soon after the bank was established . The affairs of the bank were managed by the four burgomasters of the city , who were elected annually . They received the funds of the bank from their predecessors , and , after having ascertained its amount , took an oath to deliver it over to their successors . Such was this celebrated bank , as it was exhibited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to 1784 , * on the authority of Mr. Henry Hope , at that time one of the greatest bankers and merchants of Amsterdam . But , ten or twelve years before Smith wrote , as appears by sir James Stewart , the popular opinion in Holland was , that coin had been taken out of the bank for the service of the state , though on the faith of the representations made to him , he did not credit the suggestion . But in no long time after Smith wrote , it appeared * The dates of the first and the last edition , published by Smith . /q/ not only that the public confidence , though well founded at first , had been finally abused ; and , what is far less usual , that the popular suspicion proved to be more correct than the opinion of the most intelligent part of the community . It appeared , by subsequent disclosures , that , about the middle of the last century , the bank began to make secret advances to the government and to the East India Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Storch , that the bank resorted to several devices , to prevent its dealers from drawing specie from its vaults , which , however , were so ingeniously contrived , and on such plausible grounds , as to excite no suspicion . Of this character , he says , was the ordinance which , under the pretext of placing all the dealers with the bank on the same footing , required the owner of bank money to procure receipts for the same amount , before he could withdraw gold or silver from the bank . But it is manifest , that , as so many receipts had run out of date , ( nearly all that had been given with the first deposits , ) there was not enough in existence to correspond to the whole amount of bank money , and , consequently , there was , of necessity , a large amount of the deposits , which , by the provisions of the new ordinance , could never be withdrawn from the bank . The blind confidence of the public , on this occasion , is imputed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements ; to the recollection of its proved fidelity in 1672 ; and to /z/ the respect entertained for the magistrates of the city . It may be farther added , that as no individual , who wished to draw specie from the bank could find any difficulty in obtaining a receipt , there being an abundance in the market on these accounts , the measure seems to have excited as little complaint as suspicion . But , in 1790 , when private interest was affected , confidence in the bank was shaken . It then published a declaration that it reserved to itself the right of determining the price of silver , from month to month , and it then began with fixing it at such a price , that those who had deposited ingots of this metal , sustained a loss of 10 per cent . It , at the same time , declared that it would not return the deposits , except to such of its creditors as had 2500 guilders in the bank . The general distrust which this declaration excited after a while passed away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , another declaration , signed by the representatives of the people of Amsterdam , put an end to the public confidence forever . The directors admitted that , about 50 years before , the bank had advanced to the East India Company , to the provinces of Holland and West Friesland , and to the city of Amsterdam , in succession , the sum of 10,624,793 guilders , equal to something more than 4,000,000 of dollars ; so that , although the debts and credits of the bank were equal , its coffers no longer contained the entire value of its deposits . A part of its funds had been lent to those who were not able to repay it . This /q/ amounted to an admission of bankruptcy ; and the bank money , which had borne a premium of 5 per cent. , fell to 16 per cent , below the current money , and thus lost its general credit in the commercial world , which it had sustained , at an unexampled height , for near two centuries. * Its operations were , however , continued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any formal declaration of law.f Its functions seem to have been superseded by those of a bank of circulation established in that year at Amsterdam . The details of this bank have been the more full , on account of its former celebrity , the complexity of its system , and the discordant and often unintelligible accounts that have been given of its operation by different writers . Though some of these can not be reconciled they , together , warrant us in deducing from its history the following conclusions /z/ It was a radical vice , in the plan of this bank , * Storch , Pol . Econ. , Vol . IV. , p. 102. t Kelly 's Cambist , Vol . I. , p. 17. t For example , Smith speaks of two species of receipts ; one given for deposits of coin , and another for those of bullion , while Storch mentions but one . Smith thinks that no specie or bullion ought to be drawn from the bank , without a surrender of both a receipt and a bank credit . According to Storch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullion , it was not so as to deposits of coin , and that the requisition was a device of the bank to keep its gold and silver , after it had been withdrawn to be lent out . It is to be wished that we were more accurately informed of the proceedings of this bank , not so much to gratify curiosity , but because a knowledge of its history may teach salutary lessons to bankers , and also warn the public against similar artifices in our own time . /z/ that the proprietors of its capital , that is , of its deposits , had no share in its administration or its profits , and were not even permitted to examine its condition , or inspect its books . As a disordered currency first suggested the bank , so it seems probable that , but for this evil , of which all felt the inconvenience , the merchants would not have made the deposits which constituted the basis of the bank money , on the condition of receiving less than its nominal amount . And , though such deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain , as bank money could then have borne no agio on current money beyond what might arise from its security from loss , and the saving the trouble of weighing and counting , real advantages , certainly , but for which men are not willing to pay much . And , lastly , we may infer that since private interest was not allowed to see to the faithful administration of the bank , greater publicity as to its transactions and the state of its funds would have been a better security for such fidelity than the annual rotation of its directors , and the solemnity of their oaths , on which Adam Smith seemed to place so much reliance . The bank of Hamburg is the next in celebrity of the banks of deposit , and it is thought to be the best constituted bank of that description in Europe . It was established in 1619 , ten years after the bank of Amsterdam , and on the same plan . Its treasure at first consisted of German crowns ; but , /q/ having in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency in Germany , at the end of the seven years ' war , it was obliged to close its vaults . It afterwards , in 1770 , agreed to receive ingots as well as crowns on deposit , and it had two treasuries , or receptacles , one for crowns , and the other for ingots or bullion . But , since 1790 , it receives only silver bullion , which has rendered the money of this bank the most invariable measure of value now existing in Europe . This silver is required to be 47 parts fine to one of alloy , and the expense of assaying the bars and making them of that degree of fineness is paid by the depositor . He also pays nearly 3 per cent , for safe keeping , when he withdraws his bullion . He , of course , is not likely to withdraw it , until there is a sufficient rise in the market price of bullion to indemnify him for these deductions , and yield a profit . The bank also lends money on Spanish dollars , for which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in Amsterdam . But it does not require a depositor to bring a receipt before he can receive his deposit , nor a borrower to return the same amount in bank money , before he can withdraw the dollars he has pledged . It lends money at the moderate rate of 2 per cent , a year , for three months . A large number of the citizens take part in its administration . Its affairs are managed with more publicity than were those of the bank of Amsterdam . Its directors are frequently changed , and they are subjected to an /z/ efficient responsibility . When , in 1807 , Hamburg was seized by the French , and attached to the empire , and when , in 1813 , it was alternately in the possession of the Russians and . the French , the credit of its bank was not affected ; and when the French general last took possession of the city , the funds of the bank , seized by his order , amounted to 7,489,343 , equal to more than 2i millions of dollars. * But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietors , on the approach of the French . The bank soon after resumed its operations with its former credit , and the French government have since made restitution of the money its army had seized . There are banks of deposit also in Rotterdam , Nuremburg , and some other places ; but they are more circumscribed in their operations , and less known abroad . There has never yet been a bank of this description in the United States , or in Great Britain . The advantages of banks of deposit are , that they secure to the public the most important advantages of paper currency without its dangers . They keep the precious metals secure from robbery or loss from wear . The public is saved the necessity of weighing and assaying them , and of transporting them from place to place ; and as the money of the bank can not exceed the gold and silver in its coffers , it can not become depreciated by excess . * Storch , Vol . IV. , p . IOC . Kelly 's Cambist , Vol . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they effect no saving in the precious metals , and that they present temptation to those who manage them , or those who control them , which will not always be resisted . The advantages of banks of deposit , compared with those of circulation , will be more fully exhibited in a subsequent chapter . /z/ THAT description of banks which exclusively prevails in the United States , and which they have borrowed from Great Britain , has been called , by way of distinction , banks of circulation . They are so called , because they issue paper which performs the office of a circulating medium , whereas , the banks of Venice and Amsterdam merely made transfers on their books of the money which had been deposited with them , on the written order of its proprietor . They issued , indeed , a receipt , or recepipe for every deposit of gold or silver they received , but this receipt never circulated as currency . It was merely a sort of document , to enable the owner of bank money to draw specie or bullion from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , of the sum it expressed , and often nothing at all . This point of difference has been attended with the most important results . It has given to banks of circulation a power and efficacy , in assisting the commercial and pecuniary transactions of society , as superior to those exercised by banks of deposit , as are the advantages of a modern rail-road over those of a common turnpike ; but , like the rail-road , /q/ to avoid the greater dangers incident to their greater powers , they require to be prudently managed and to be subjected to strict regulations . Their immediate and principal operations consist in discounting promissory notes and bills of exchange not yet due , that is , in lending money on the credit of these negotiable papers , after deducting or discounting the interest ; and in receiving deposits of money for safe keeping . It is then by being banks of discount and of deposit , that they have become banks of circulation , in the way that is now to be explained . The bank having , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current coin and of its own promissory notes , payable to bearer on demand , in convenient sums , as fives , tens , twenties , and the like ; when any holder of a negotiable paper not due , who wishes it cashed , obtains a discount , he is offered either specie or the notes of the bank . Now , as these notes are convertible into current coin at the pleasure of the holder , if the public have confidence in the solidity of the bank capital , and in the prudence and good faith of those who manage it , as they commonly have , most persons will prefer the notes to specie . They are more easily carried or transmitted from place to place , are more easily made secure from robbery , and are more readily counted . The trouble , moreover , of weighing coin , of assaying its purity , and of examining every piece to detect those that are spurious , is thus thrown on the bank . The same considerations which induced the original borrower to /z/ receive them from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus they obtain a general circulation . They share these advantages with banks of deposit . But , as , notwithstanding the convenience of bank notes , some persons will prefer specie , from whim , from want of confidence , or for distant travel or remittance , a certain proportion of all the loans of the bank will be made in coin ; and as its loans increase , its gold and silver diminish . The directors take care , however , not to let its specie be reduced so low as not to be sufficient to meet even extraordinary demands for cash . When their specie is reduced to this point , their discounts have reached their utmost limits consistent with prudence . The bank then keeps up the amount of its loans by relending what its former borrowers have repaid . What will be the amount of specie it will be prudent to retain , and what amount of paper they have been able to put and keep in circulation before their specie is reduced to this point , can be determined only by experience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at different times , in the same place . Some banks have thought it prudent to keep one dollar in specie for every three dollars they had in circulation ; while others deem it safe if they have one dollar for every six or seven . In places , too , not favorable to a diffusive circulation , a bank may be reduced to one dollar for six or seven , before it has lent to double the amount of its original stock of specie ; /q/ while another , under more propitious circumstances , may lend to more than twice the amount of its stock , when the amount of its paper circulation is not more than three times the amount of the specie in its vaults . As the profits of the bank are in proportion to its loans , and these , again , are in proportion to the extent of the substitution of their paper for coin , these institutions bend all their efforts to support the credit of their notes , and to give them as extensive a circulation as possible , consistent with safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a preference , in their discounts , to those persons who will draw notes from the bank rather than specie , and to those who will circulate the notes in distant channels , so that they will be long in returning to the bank . They invite deposits , especially of specie ; but , at the same time , are prompt to redeem their notes in specie , on application . They discount more freely , too , when the value of exports chances to exceed that of imports , so that gold and silver tend more to flow into the country than out of it j but are proportionally cautious , in an opposite state of the foreign commerce . In this way , under favorable circumstances , they can extend their loans often to more than twice the amount of their capital . . In this mode , and to this extent , the discounts of banks operate to give their paper circulation . But banks are also the chief depositaries of the money of individuals , whether specie or paper . This they keep without charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or check of the owner . In this character of a bank of deposit , they commonly receive a good deal of the money they have lent by way of discount . As these deposits can be withdrawn from the bank at the pleasure of the owners , and constitute a part of its liabilities , as much as its notes in circulation , they may , at first view , seem to be of no advantage to the bank ; but , since it is known , by experience , that , though they may all be withdrawn at once , they , in fact , never are ; arid , though the bank is continually paying off some deposits , it is continually receiving others the lowest amount which the bank has , at all times , from this source , is so much added to its ability to make loans , and , consequently , to its profits . The bank can venture to trade on this minimum amount of its deposits , on the same principles on which it issues paper to a greater amount than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own notes , except in exchange for the promissory notes or bills of exchange of individuals , or , perchance , in exchange for gold or silver , it must always have , in negotiable paper and specie together , a sufficient amount to balance its paper in circulation , exclusive of its capital stock . The public then has an ample guarantee for the stability of the bank , and the redemption of its notes , if they have been properly constituted , and prudently managed . The rules which experience seems to recommend for a wise organization of a bank , and to secure its skilful and prudent management , will be hereafter considered . /q/ Let us now notice some of the details of their administration , as they exist in the United States . The capital of the bank is owned by an association , who commonly obtain a charter of incorporation ; as , in most of the states , private banking , or rather issuing notes payable to bearer , is prohibited . This capital is divided into shares of a convenient amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the whole stock is subscribed , the stockholders , after making by-laws t for their government , elect a president and directors , who appoint the subordinate officers ; and the bank begins its operations with such part of its capital as is , by the terms of its charter , to be paid up . The paper offered for discount is submitted to the president and directors ; and sometimes a bare majority of votes is not sufficient to pass it ; but as few as a third may reject it . The board meet once a week , in some banks , twice , for the purpose of discounting . They commonly discount no paper that has more than 60 days to run ; but some extend the limit to 90 days . They require , in some banks , two responsible names on the paper ; and in others , three . When a note of 60 days is discounted , as , by the usage of merchants , it has three days of grace allowed after it becomes due , the note is not payable but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in precisely nine weeks after i't was discounted . If , then , the business of a bank was entirely uniform , in every week , one ninth of its lendable /z/ funds , deducting the interest , would be issued from the bank , and one ninth would be returned to it . Although banks profess not to lend money for more than 90 days , and some not for more than 60 , yet , as these loans are for too short a time to suit the purposes of many of their borrowers , they therefore not unfrequently renew the loan at the expiration of the term for which it was borrowed ; which process is sometimes continued for years , the borrower being merely required to give a new promissory note , and pay the interest at each renewal . Notes thus renewed are called accommodation paper ; and the same term is applied to promissory notes , or bills of exchange , which are not given in consequence of any real transaction between the parties , but merely for the purpose of raising money . Paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which has been given in consequence of a sale , or other regular mercantile dealings , and which , by way of distinction , is called business paper . Their greater willingness to discount the latter is founded on the following reasons : Where the note or bill was given in payment of merchandise , the bank has a greater security that the money which it has advanced will be repaid when due , and when the bank may greatly need it ; inasmuch as when the payer contracted the debt , he , at the same time , received its equivalent : whereas , in the case of accommodation paper , although that , too , may be vested in merchandise , it may also /q/ have been borrowed to spend , or to pay an old debt ; in which case , the borrower must rely upon some other resource to pay the bank . Again : by discounting business paper , the bank encourages commerce , by giving to merchants ' notes the same credit with the public as cash ; which is beneficial both to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merchants can , in this way , buy more freely ; and , affording to take smaller profits , can give higherprices . And , lastly , when the discounts are of this character , the paper thrown into circulation is likely to be more accurately adjusted to the wants and circumstances of the country . The facility of obtaining money on accommodation paper , furnishes at once the incentive and the means of overtrading . The rule , however , is a flexible one ; not only because , on the principles that have been mentioned , some accommodation paper is better than some business paper , but also because sudden and urgent demands for money , by responsible persons , who are not merchants , and for other purposes than to make purchases , will not be disregarded by institutions which profess to be established for the public convenience , as well as for private gain . They also , in deference to public sentiment , commonly refuse discounts to habitual usurers ; it being invidious in the extreme , for corporations , enjoying the privilege of furnishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrious mechanic , the enterprising merchant or manufacturer , or the substantial farmer , who wishes /z/ to anticipate the proceeds of his crop a few months , and grant it to the rich money-lender , who , in the relative scarcity of money , may be able to relend it to those whose claims he has intercepted , at a higher interest . But neither is this rule invariably observed . The board of directors have regularly laid before them , on every discount day , an exact account of their debts and credits , under a few general heads , so as to show the condition of the rank at the time , and any indications of change that may have taken place since the preceding discount day . The private accounts which individuals keep with the bank , and which show , not only what they have borrowed of the bank , but also their deposits and disbursements , can not be inspected by the board , without a special order for each individual case . This rule , however , does not extend to an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as payer or endorser . For the same reason that banks receive and disburse deposits without charge , they gratuitously collect all notes , drafts , and other negotiable paper that is entrusted to them , whether they are payable in the same place , or in any distant city in which there is a bank in friendly correspondence with them . As a matter of courtesy , which is now grown into settled usage , they give every one , who has a note due at bank , whether it was discounted , or put in for collection , a notice in writing , three days before the paper falls due . Besides the checks and securities that are afforded /q/ by their several accounts , and a daily examination of the money placed in the hands of the subordinate officers , a committee of the directors , at stated times , ( as once a month , or oftener , ) inspect the vaults of the bank , and see if the specie , bullion , and notes on hand , correspond with the books . A portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year . The president , and other officers of the bank , are permanent . In addition to the profits which the bank derives from discounting paper , and by which it receives the same interest from its notes as from its specie , it also , occasionally , sells its own drafts on distant banks for a premium , it having been previously arranged between them , that they would accept each other 's drafts . The interest they receive , too , in the way of discount , though nominally at the rate of 6 per cent , per annum , somewhat exceeds that rate ; partly because , being able to turn over their money nearly six times a year , ( when they lend only for 60 days , ) they receive compound interest ; and partly from their mode of computing interest . There are three of these petty sources of gain : 1 . When a promissory note is discounted , the interest for the time it has to run is deducted from the amount of the note , and the residue is paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually receives interest on the sum deducted , as well as on the sum paid . Thus , if the note be for $100 , payable in 60 days , its interest , at 6 per cent , a year , will " be 1 per cent . This interest is /z/ accordingly deducted , and the bank pays $99 on account of the note . As the borrower receives but $99 , the interest he will owe , at the end of 60 days , is only 99 cents ; whereas , he then pays , and the bank receives , 100 cents . The excess is sV of the interest . 2 . It is the practice of banks and bankers , to consider 60 days as the sixth part of a year ; and , in this way , they receive , for 360 days , the interest that is due only on 365 days ; and thus , in a discount for 60 days , they receive interest for f of a day more than is due ; and in leap years , for one day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal interest . 3 . We have seen , that a note drawn payable in 60 days is , by adding the three days of grace , not actually payable until 63 days . In some of the states , it is the practice of the banks , when they discount such notes , to deduct interest for 64 days . They justify the practice in this way : as soon as a note is discounted , ( which is in the earlier part of the day , ) the person entitled to the money may draw it immediately from the bank . But , at the end of 60 days and the three days of grace , the bank may not receive the money until the last moment of the natural day ; the law of the land giving this indulgence to the payer , so that the bank may thus be deprived of the use of its money for 64 days . As , in point of fact , the bank always receives payment on the sixty-third day , where it receives it at all , the excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /z/ The result of these several minor sources of profit is , that , together with the gain from compound interest , they give the bank about 6.42 per cent , a year on the sum loaned , and about 2 cents more every fourth year . This addition of 42 or 44 cents in the year on the hundred dollars , though comparatively light and insignificant to those who deal with the bank , makes an important item in the account of their annual profits . Thus , for every million of dollars lent in a year , the interest beyond 6 per cent , would be upwards of $4000 . But their chief source of profit is in being able to lend to a larger amount than their capital , by the substitution of their paper for specie . Their profits from these several sources they distribute twice a year among the stockholders , after deducting their expenses , and putting by a part , either to make good losses that have occurred , or such as may subsequently occur , or to supply the deficiencies of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes is suffered to accumulate , before it is reduced by an extra dividend . Their expenses consist of the cost and annual repair of their banking-house , of the salaries of officers , of postage , of stationary , of the cost of engraving and printing notes , and , occasionally , of the expense of transporting specie . The expenses of banks are very different in the different states . Thus , the real estate they hold , which ( except in a few cases , where it has been received or purchased to secure a doubtful debt ) consists of the buildings required for banking , /z/ amounts , in some states , to near 3 per cent , of the capital stock ; and , in others , to 10 per cent . On the 1st of January , 1834 , the average amount on all the banks of the United States was 5 per cent . There is , probably , a yet greater difference in their current annual expenses . Those of the banks of Virginia are about 2 per cent , on their capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent apiece , or $1200 for an impression of 80,000 notes . Their net profits vary from about 1 to 10 per cent . /z/ AFTER banks have been established in a community sufficiently long for the public to have acquired entire confidence in their solidity , and to have become familiar with their paper , this , by its superior convenience to the precious metals , is found to constitute a principal part of the circulation . The public , therefore , has ah interest that the notes of the bank should maintain their credit , and that they should be supplied in a quantity adapted to the wants and circumstances of the country . If , by the too great eagerness of these institutions to enlarge their profits , or from the mere disposition to accommodate the greedy spirit of speculation of a few favorites , they should throw too much paper into circulation , the public is injured in one way ; and , if , from too great timidity , or by way of counteracting the effects of their former rashness , or from the corrupt motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , they should too much or too suddenly contract their issues , then the public is injured in another way . The consequences of an excessive circulation are a depreciation of money , overtrading , with all its /z/ mischiefs , rash enterprise , and extravagance in private expenses . The regular course of industry is interrupted , for hazardous and unprofitable schemes take the place of those employments , whose gains , though sure , are slow ; importations are encouraged beyond the wants and the means of the country , and the foreign debt thus created , by drawing off the coin of the banks , either compels them to suspend cash payments , or to withdraw their paper from circulation , and thus produce the opposite evils of a deficient circulation . These evils , as was formerly shown , , are almost equally disastrous . If the over-issues of the banks injure creditors , a great contraction of them is yet more injurious to debtors , who are less able to bear the loss , and who are less able , generally , to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural level . Creditors , too , are often eventually injured by the loss of their debts . The wheels of commerce , industry , and credit , are stopped for the time , and every class of the community suffers more or less , except the small number who then embark in the business of moneylending . Such being the interest which the public has in the prudent and skilful management of these institutions , the privilege they possess of substituting their paper for money , has , in most countries , been subjected to the control and regulation of the legislature , who , besides making them pay for a privilege which is so profitable , imposes on them such restrictions as will be likely to prevent their abuse /q/ of it . These have not , however , been as yet sufficient to secure the public from the over-issues of banks , the mischiefs of which have been so serious , as to make many persons question whether the facilities they render to commerce are not outweighed by their inconveniences , and to incline some who more highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more effectually prevented , if they had neither privileges nor restrictions , and if the banking trade , like every other , were left to the free competition of individuals . To assist us in deciding these questions , let us consider separately the advantages and inconveniences of banks , and then inquire how far the one may be promoted and the other diminished by a judicious system of regulations . Banks of circulation seem to be useful to the community in the following ways : 1 . To the extent that the paper of a bank substitutes gold and silver , it saves that amount to the nation . The money of a community , we have seen , may be as much as one fifth of its annual revenue , and from one half , or perhaps to three fourths , of its currency may be in paper . It is supposed , by Mr. McCulloch , * that , by the facilities afforded by banks and bankers in Great Britain , the 50 or 60 millions which is believed to be the amount of its circulation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions of 200 millions ; so that , after deducting the 20 or 30 /z/ millions employed by the bankers , as a capital , in their establishments , no less than 120 or 130 millions cease to be employed as an instrument of circulation , and are made available in some mode of productive industry . But , without indulging in speculations founded on conjecture , we may fairly estimate this benefit by the actual extent of the paper circulation , after deducting the amount of specie retained by the banks to support that circulation . According to the report of the secretary of the Treasury , * the amount of bank paper in circulation on the 1st of January , 1838 , was 116,000,000 ; of the deposits , 84,000,000 ; of the specie in their vaults , 35,000,000 ; and the notes issued by one bank , but in possession of another , near 25,000,000 . As the deposits in a bank , by the facility of checks , perform the functions of currency , they should be added to the notes in circulation ; but from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , should be deducted . This will show the extent of the substitution to be 140,000,000 , or more accurately thus : Circulation , . . $116,138,910 Deposits , . . . 84,691,181 /z/ Deduct , Specie , ..... 35,184,112 Notes of other banks , 24,964,257 /z/ * June 7 , 1838. /q/ To the extent , then , of this 140,000,000 , we are warranted in inferring , that bank notes have saved the use of the precious metals in the United States , and that capital to that amount has been diverted to other objects . Or we may estimate the benefit by the annual profit which the country derives from the amount of capital thus disengaged . At the moderate profit of 6 per cent. , it would be more than 8,000,000 a year ; and if we rate the average profits of capital , as many would do , at 10 per cent. , the annual gain from the substitution is 14,000,000 ; to which we must add the loss from wear , shipwreck , and other casualties , which may be set down , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount , we must deduct the expenses of the banks . 2 . Banks not only substitute a cheap for a costly instrument of exchange , but also a far more convenient instrument . The saving in the precious metals is probably small , compared with the saving of time , which is effected by means of bank notes and bank checks . The payments which are made with so much facility , where there are banks , would be almost impracticable in the precious metals . Thus , in silver , 10,000 dollars weigh 660 pounds , and 100.000 dollars 6600 pounds , equal , in the transport , to two ordinary wagon-loads ; to say nothing of the time required to count it , and the precautions to protect it . If it were paid in gold , though the weight would be so much less , the trouble of weighing and assaying would be superadded . Nor is this all ; for , as bank paper , /z/ and checks , and drafts , can be so readily reckoned , and so expeditiously transmitted to the most distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much larger , to admit of the same operations . Private bills of exchange may , indeed , in like manner , save the necessity of transporting gold and silver ; but , besides that they are not quite equal to the drafts of a bank in good credit ; the paper of such a bank may have credit and currency in places on which a private bill could not be obtained . Suppose , for instance , it were necessary to transmit a sum of money from New Orleans to New York . Its amount might pass and repass between the two places two or three times , while the specie was on its passage , with no more expense than sending so many letters . And whenever it is necessary to transmit money to a place in almost any of the western states , it very rarely can be done by private drafts , but must be effected by the transmission of specie , or by bank paper . We can not estimate the saving of time and trouble , by simply regarding the amount of the metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take into account the great number of payments , which the same quantity ) f money , and especially of bank money , can make in a year ; for , as often as every bank note is used , or the same money transferred , by check , from one person 's account to another 's , to the same extent is the benefit multiplied . In a commercial city , banks greatly economize time and expense , in keeping accounts . In every /q/ counting-house in which much business is done , they probably save the expense of a clerk , in receiving and disbursing cash . If the labor thus saved is equal to the expenses of banks , as it may be in large cities , then the profits arising from the substitution of bank paper for specie are a clear gain to the community . 3 . They give the moneyed capital of a country a more useful direction . There is , in every community , a considerable class who are possessed of money , but who are not capable either of using it profitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will insure its safety . Of this description are orphans , widows , and females generally , aged persons , and , occasionally , public officers and professional men . The money of such persons , by being vested in a bank , and subjected to the management of directors , chosen for their knowledge of the credit and resources of individuals , can be lent out with equal safety to the proprietors and advantage to the community . They can distinguish between solid wealth and the deceitful appearances of it between real integrity and hypocritical pretension between the enterprises of prudence and industry and those of rashness and folly ; and they will be led by interest , as well as a sense of duty , to make the discrimination , in the distribution of their loans . As places of deposit , banks also receive all the small sums of unemployed money in their neighborhood , and which , useless when dispersed , become , when united into one mass , efficient in the useful offices of money . /z/ In this way , too , if the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with the average profits of capital , the increased demand for loans for safe and legitimate objects will , to some extent , enable the bank to increase its issues ; whereby its profits will be increased ; and thus the moneyed capital will be able to obtain the fair profit to which it is entitled . In this way , the chief mischief of the usury laws that of preventing capital from taking its most beneficial direction is , in a great measure , counteracted . By obtaining an additional profit for their money , in the form of bank dividends , those money-holders whom the usury laws might induce to engage in modes of employing their money , for which their other pursuits or their inexperience disqualifies them , will be less likely to do so ; and thus the spare capital of the community , to whomsoever it belongs , is placed in the hands of those who are most capable of rendering it productive of the most active , industrious , judicious , and enterprising portion of society . 4 . The creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , care , or risk , encourages economy and industry . Many a one , who would otherwise live up to his income , or exceed it , is encouraged to a more thrifty course of management , by having always at hand a ready means of investing his small savings . This tendency banks share with all joint-stock companies , whose dividends are regular . But it is particularly beneficial in agricultural arid slaveholding communities , where motives to thrift and economy are most needed . /q/ 5 . There is another advantage in banks , which is less obvious , and which applies only to young and growing countries . We have seen that such countries are , in general , inadequately supplied with money , in consequence of the extraordinary demand for capital there experienced , and their consequent inducement to supply its place with substitutes . Now , banks have the faculty of remedying this deficiency of money , without encroaching on the other demands for capital . By keeping up the quantity of currency to the level of the ever-growing demand , they extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way , they confer on the community the advantages of cash and credit united ; of credit , because the notes are of no intrinsic value , and are taken in the confidence that they can be converted into coin , at the pleasure of the holder ; and of cash , because , by reason of their general currency as money , they produce all the saving of time and accounts that specie could do . By this facility of throwing an additional amount of money into circulation , whenever a more enlarged or more valuable traffic requires it , they give a stimulus to productive industry , and prevent , or lessen , the stagnation of business produced by a deficiency of circulation . Enterprises of great public utility , requiring large advances of money , may sometimes obtain such advances from these great reservoirs of capital , when it might not be easy to obtain them from capitalists , by reason of the extreme caution of that class of men ; /z/ and when it might be utterly impracticable to obtain them from some twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . Lastly , banks may benefit the community , by lending money to the government , in seasons of great difficulty , or in sudden emergencies , when the ordinary resource from taxation would be too slow , and might be inadequate . On these occasions of extraordinary public demands for money , the sources of private income , which constitute the great fund for taxation , seldom fail to be impaired ; and , though that were not the case , it may afford great relief , for the time , to borrow the money , and either defer the repayment of it to a season of returning prosperity , or divide the burthen among several succeeding years . The banks of Virginia , during the last war , rendered essential service to the state in this way ; and similar services were rendered by banks in some of the other states . Such seem to be the benefits conferred by these institutions ; benefits which are so considerable , that they may be regarded as among the most valuable inventions of modern times . /z/ BUT the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to be , " are not without their alloy ; and we will now notice their attendant evils . 1 . One of the mischiefs of banks is , that , from the facility with which they can enlarge the currency , and the strong motive of interest they have to enlarge it , they often increase the circulation too much ; by reason of which , one of two consequences follows , namely , they are either obliged to contract their issues to the extent those issues have been redundant , and even to a greater extent , or they must stop payment . In the first case , the country suffers the evils of a deficient circulation ; which are the more felt , in consequence of the transition from the previous redundancy ; and , iii the last case , it suffers from a vicious circulation . And while the excess or deficiency of money can be so much more rapid where the currency is paper than where it is metallic , the mischief , in both cases , must be corrected , in general , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , are often greater , as well as more sudden , than they could be with a metallic /z/ currency . It is true , that , when bank notes have depreciated , by reason of their excess , the evil tends to work its own cure , as in the case of excess of gold and silver , by causing an export of specie , which , by reducing the currency directly , when it is metallic , and consequentially* when it is paper , raises the value of the remainder ; but , before this process by foreign commerce can do its office , or even produce any salutary effect , the redundancy of paper may have gone on increasing . In the case of the precious metals , our supplies are drawn from a distance , they are obtained in small quantities at a time , and , except when borrowed , only by giving an equivalent . But , in the case of paper money , our supply is at home and unlimited , except by our own politic forbearance . No one can suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1836 and 1837 , it could have mounted up to that point of redundancy which bank paper then reached . 2 . The deficiency of money is also occasionally greater , by reason of banks . As the credit of their paper rests on its ready convertibility into gold or silver coin , these metals are essential to its currency . They give it its vitality . It follows from this , that whenever bank paper forms a principal part of the money of a country , and the precious metals are exported to pay a foreign balance , the consequent deficiency of * By compelling : the banks lo call in their paper , to prevent its being returned to them for specie. /q/ money is far greater than if the circulation were purely metallic . By reason of the vicissitudes to which all foreign commerce is exposed , the whole amount of exports in the year occasionally falls short of paying for the imports . Exchange will , of course , be unfavorable , by the demand for bills exceeding the supply ; and the tendency of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , the banks , which are the great repositories of the precious metals , are the first to feel the demand for these metals for foreign export , and when they find their specie , the vital current of their existence , running from them , they are compelled , in selfdefence , to contract their issues ; that is , to require a part of their debtors to pay up what they owe ; which they have an opportunity of doing every discount day , to about a ninth of their outstanding debt . And if they aim to restore that proportion between their specie and their paper which is considered safe , they must withdraw from circulation paper to several times the amount of the specie that has been taken from their vaults . Thus , suppose the proportion of four dollars of paper in circulation for one of specie in their vaults and they often have a much greater disproportion then , after this proportion has been disturbed by the notes which have been returned to them in exchange for specie , if they would restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper as they have paid out in specie , which , with the one part of paper that was returned to be converted into /z/ coin , makes up the original proportion of four for one ; and the greater have been the issues of a bank in proportion to its specie , the more , when a run is made on it for specie , must the paper it withdraws from circulation be multiplied , if it would preserve its solvency and credit . When , however , the circulation is wholly metallic , the contraction of the circulation is only to the amount which we have supposed drawn from the bank for exportation , and which , even supposing the banks to be rigidly governed by the rules of prudence adverted to , would only be one third as much as when the circulation was principally paper . It is true , that , in point of fact , the banks may not feel it necessary , nor , indeed , quite practicable , to withdraw from circulation paper to so large an amount . That course would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly exercise greater forbearance , and aim to restore a safe proportion between their circulation and their specie , by a more gradual reduction of their paper , or until a change in the current of trade should bring back specie to the country ; and they generally trust to both these expedients ; but in part , also , they must resort to an immediate reduction of their circulating paper ; and when the run on them for specie has been considerable , they must at once engage in a course of vigorous reduction , which is very distressing to a part of their debtors , and , by the failures it occasions , often proves eventually injurious to themselves . /q/ This evil is inseparable from banks of circulation , and is one for which there seems to be no remedy , unless it be one which would prevent a nation from ever owing a foreign balance . The evil , too , is great in proportion as paper constitutes the circulation of a country , and as it exceeds the amount of coin in the vaults of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , when the demand on the banks was so strong , for the purpose of making remittances to Europe , that they were under the necessity of suspending cash payments , or be drained of all their specie . Their temporary stoppage , in consequence of their previous over-issues , and the change in the state of foreign trade , was inevitable , and all they could do was to choose whether they would stop , while they were in good credit , and they were known to possess a large amount of specie , or when that specie had been all drawn out , and when their credit would have been proportionally impaired . A similar course , under weaker inducements , probably would have taken place in the year 1819 , but for the dread of the public indignation , while the mischiefs of the suspension of 1813 were fresh in the recollection of all , and for the check presented by the bank of the United States , then recently established , and , of course , better able to stand the shock . Had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper would have been generally discredited , and driven out of circulation , which that of their great rival would have /z/ filled . They accordingly decided on weathering out the storm , and they succeeded ; but the withdrawal of their paper from circulation by themselves , or the return of it by others to be exchanged for specie , deprived the public for a time of all currency , and the pressure was severe beyond all former example . It deserves to be mentioned , that the suspension of 1837 , as well as that of 1813 , * had the subsequent sanction of the American public , as expressed by their legislatures. 3 . Whatever may be the mischiefs of overtrading , and a gambling , speculating spirit in the community and they are for the time very great banks must be considered responsible for a large portion of it . When the ' course of foreign trade is prosperous , and when specie consequently tends to flow into the country , or at least not to flow out , then the banks are strongly tempted to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can thus augment their profits , at the moment when the cheering influence of public prosperity has given a great spring to the spirit of enterprise . The banks , by affording aliment to this spirit , give it a force and vigor of mischief it could not otherwise attain . They are thus , without intending it , and in the mere pursuit of their vocation , stimulating the love of gain to all sorts of money-making schemes and adventures . The * In the suspension of 1813 , the banks of Boston , and some others in New England , were not comprehended . /q/ wild and extravagant spirit of speculation is never seen to prevail to such an extent , as in countries where there are banks of circulation , and in no part of such countries , as in those cities and towns in which banks most abound . 4 . In the same way that banks encourage overtrading and speculation , they encourage expensive habits . Those who can obtain money so easily , and can put off payment at pleasure , are often careless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of banks , in the great increase of buildings , and in the more costly character of the dwelling-houses , which is sure to follow the establishment of a bank in a town ; and also in the many examples of persons who have large accommodations " at bank , and live expensively , but whose affairs , when once fully made known , show that they have been long insolvent . All of these disadvantages , that have been hitherto found attendant on banks , may , by a course of prudent , firm , and judicious management , be avoided , except one , and that is , the extraordinary reduction of the currency , whenever specie is , by the state of foreign trade and exchange , driven out of the country . If banks would confine their discounts principally to the paper of those who are engaged in a regular course of business ; if they would refuse accommodations to the rash , adventurous , and over-sanguine , and , above all , to those who were disposed to live ostentatiously ; and if they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , they might do /z/ much towards keeping up the equilibrium between imports and exports . But such a result can not be expected , whilst bank charters are obtained with so much facility , have had their privileges so inadequately tempered with salutary restriction , and have been committed to the management of men without knowledge of the theory of banks , or that practical experience which might supply its place , and whose interests were sometimes promoted , or thought to be promoted , by a course certainly injurious tothe community , and too probably so to the bank . If no rational hope could be entertained , that the evils of banks would be remedied , it would behove us then to inquire whether they are outweighed by the benefits derived from those institutions ; but , before we institute that comparison , we are bound to inquire how far they may be prevented by a wiser course of legislation , /z/ IT is certain , that much of the mischiefs which the American community has experienced from banks is attributable to the legislatures of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under our system of restriction , than if the banking business had been entirely free ; since the banks which have been chartered have thereby acquired a credit with the public that they would have had to earn , if the field of banking had been open to the free competition of all . Let us , then , inquire , what are the duties of legislatures , in chartering banks , before they decide that those institutions should be subjected to no regulation whatever ? As the stability of a bank is the most important consideration that concerns the public , the legislature should , in granting charters , take every precaution to secure it . Before they authorize the establishment of a bank , they should be satisfied , not only that the business of the place is sufficient to require the facilities and to defray the expense of such an institution , but also that there is an adequate amount of capital that is ready to be so /z/ invested ; in a word , that there is a sufficient number both of safe borrowers and discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be very des'rous to see a bank established , where it may not be at all needed . They are those who expect to be employed in conducting it , and those who are anxious to become borrowers . Against their arts and representations the legislature should be on its guard , although they should have enlisted the cooperation of a few capitalists , as they are sure to do . To secure the requisite solidity , two things seem essential . One is , that the bank should have a sufficient amount of capital ; and the other is , that such capital should be real , not nominal or borrowed . The first requisite is necessary , to give the public assurance not merely of the solidity of the bank , but also that it will be conducted with skill and prudence . In general , men who have spare capital have made it by their own industry and frugality ; and these qualities particularly fit them for lending the funds of the bank with discretion , and keeping its issues within the limits of prudence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to embarrassment from causes that are merely local , without their being less exempt from those that are general . Thus , a panic may arise in a village , and extend no further ; and the hostility of one or two individuals , which could have no influence on a bank with a large capital , may be seriously felt by a bank with a small one . It is not easy to say what limit the legislature /q/ should prescribe to itself , on this subject , the wants and the capacities of different parts of the country being so different ; but it seems to be wise for the laws of every state to fix a minimum capital , without the possession of which no bank should be permitted to put its notes in circulation . There is , probably , no state in the union , in which any town , fairly entitled to a bank , would be deprived of one , if the minimum was fixed at $100,000 and the partial inconvenience might be more than compensated in security , ( to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even this sum would be entirely too small to afford the requisite security in a city ; but the city banks are commonly not deficient in this particular . They require other checks . It is only against the undue multiplication of banks in small towns and villages that this provision seems necessary . But the second requisite , that its capital should be real , and be paid up in gold and silver , is of far greater importance ; for this would form a salutary check to the undue multiplication of banks in cities as well as in the country , and add to the security of the large banks no less than the small ones . The capital of nearly all the banks of the United States is , in part , nominal . It is always , by the provisions of their charters , paid up in successive instalments of 25 per cent , each , or less ; and , as they commonly begin their banking operations as soon as the first instalment is paid , a considerable portion of the subsequent instalments is borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , /z/ that the capital of the bank is no more increased in this way than if it was not obtained ; and that the only capital of a bank that can be efficient in advancing money to others , and in supporting the credit of its paper , is that which the stockholders have contributed from their own resources . It is true , that those stockholders , who thus borrow money of the bank to pay up their last instalments , pay interest to the bank , like other borrowers ; but then they are likely to receive back the same amount in dividends . If the dividends exceev 1 the rate of interest , then such borrowing stockholder gains a larger share of the profits of the bank than he is fairly entitled to , at the expense of the more substantial and punctual stockholders ; and if the dividends are less , then the other stockholders gain at his expense . Such loans , then , affect the interests of the stockholders among themselves , but nowise add to the resources of the bank . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that banking capital seems to be distributed so unequally through the different states , not only in proportion to their numbers , but also to their commerce and wealth ; that the bank capital of Rhode Island is more than 50 per cent , greater than that of Virginia , and that of Mississippi greater than either ; that of Louisiana nearly equal to that of New York , and greater than that of Massachusetts ; and , lastly , that the bank capital of the district of Columbia is greater than that of North Carolina. * * See Appendix , Note 7. /q/ Nor does it materially vary the case , when the money that is to constitute part of the capital is borrowed from another bank . Whether such money be in specie or paper , in the same degree that it adds to the resources of one bank , it diminishes those of the other ; arid , at the end of sixty days , when the loan is probably repaid at the expense of the new bank , the situation of the two is precisely as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital had not been paid . In the mean time , the general accounts of the bank , professing to exhibit their condition , disclose nothing of these facts . The capital appears to have been paid up as well when its own paper has made the greater part of that capital , as when it was in gold and silver j as well , too , when it has been borrowed for a short time , to deceive the public with appearances , as when it is really the saving uf pusi industry or thnlt , seeiung profitable investment . It is in this way that the amount of bank capital in the United States , actually paid up , is dilated to almost twice the amount of that of England , as will thus appear : *Capital of the bank of England , 14,553,000 fCapital of joint stock banks actually paid , 5,792,524 Capital of private banks , ( estimated , ) 15,825 , 174 /z/ * McCulloch 's Com . Diet. , p. 92. /z/ This , at 4.61 dollars the pound sterling , ( the medium between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is $166,746,917 Banking capital of the United States , 317,636,778 Apparent excess in the United States , $150,889,861 In like manner , when the item of discounts , in the general statement of the banks of the United States , seemed to show that more than 500,000,000 of dollars had been furnished by the banks , to facilitate the operations of commerce , manufactures , or agriculture , the only effect of probably much the greater part of it has been to make some additional entries in the bank leger , by which particular stockholders are charged with the money borrowed , and credited with the same money , in payment of stock . By this practice , the public is deceived as to the real resources ol banks ; as , witn a view 10 me practice , legislatures have been beguiled into granting charters where banks were not wanted , or there was not the requisite capital to create them ; and unwary individuals , believing their condition to be what it professed to be , have been induced to become purchasers of stock at an advance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ployed in private banking in England . But the amount of the notes they circulate is known ; and , supposing that their capital bears the same relation to their circulation as is known to exist in the joint stock banks , ( that is , about double , ) the double of their circulation in September , 1835 , which was 7,912,587 , is here assumed to be their capital . /q/ condition of such banks , and the meagreness of their real capital , been fairly disclosed . The same practice , it seems , has been adopted in England , by the joint stock banks established in that country since the failure of so many private banks , in 1825 ; and it has been denounced , both in parliament , and by some of the most distinguished writers on banking , * as a most pernicious abuse , both in lessening the security of the public , and by encouraging the formation of companies for the purpose of " making a profit by jobbing in the shares . " But the fact , that only a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all , and is distinctly set forth in the prospectus that invites subscriptions . If the practice is v found to be mischievous there , where the fact is or may be known to all , how much more so must it be here , where it is often studiously concealed , and where , without any purpose of concealment , the plan and operation of the banks keep it entirely out of view ! The legislatures of some of the states , aware of the mischief of creating banks with a fictitious or even an insufficient capital , have thought " that they effectually guarded against the danger , by the provision , that the capital should be paid in gold and silver . But this provision is altogether inadequate to their purpose , unless they require the whole capital to be paid up at once . If the capital is paid by instalments , and the bank is allowed to begin /z/ business and issue notes before such instalments are all paid , then the last instalments , though paid in specie , will be paid by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the whole capital should be paid up in gold and silver before the bank should issue a note , or make a discount , would be liable to evasion . Money might be borrowed for a short time by individuals , to complete their subscriptions , with the confident expectation of repaying it by money borrowed from the bank , as soon as it should begin to discount . We are taught a lesson on this subject , by what has actually occurred . By the general banking law of Massachusetts , no bank is allowed to go into operation before at least 50 per cent , of its capital shall have been paid up in gold or silver , and verified by commissioners on oath ; yet it appears , by the report of a committee of the senate of that state , dated Feb. 13 , 1838 , in the case of the Kilby bank , that this provision was evaded by special loans of specie from other banks , to be repaid as soon as the bank went into operation ; and that the same mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks chartered in that state within the last ten years ; that is , ever since the law had been in operation. * It is not enough , then , for the law to provide for the payment of the whole capital in specie , before the bank begins its operations ; but the provision * See Appendix , Note 8. /q/ should be so framed as to increase the risk and difficulty of evasion ; and , not trusting altogether to the injunctions and penalties of the law , the legislature should carefully inquire into the history and circumstances of every bank charter applied for , and should firmly refuse every such application , in which it did not clearly appear that there was sufficient capital thus seeking investment . On this subject , there have been one or two prevalent errors , of which it is high time the people should be disabused . One of these is , that it is in the power of a bank , and one of its most useful functions , to create capital j and , believing this , in deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire whether money is wanted in a place ; and , perhaps , go a step further , and ask whether it could be usefully employed . But , however these questions may be answered , they do not decide on the expediency of establishing a bank of issue , unless it further appear , that there is also spare* capital , either in the place itself , or at a distance , seeking such an investment . Where such capital exists , banks that are well managed are admirably fitted for giving it activity and a more enlarged sphere of utility . They have , in this way , been of incalculable benefit to Scotland , * and to many parts of the United States ; but it must be remembered , that industry and See Adam Smith 's testimony on this subject ; and it is the more to be valued , as he seems to have had no partiality for banks , in consequence of some abuses that had recently taken place in Scotland . /z/ economy can alone create capital ; and when it is thus called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . They can put the money of the female or the minor into the hands of the active and capable man of business ; but they no more increase capital than a mill-dam increases the water . By stopping the courses of numberless petty rills , that would flow unprofitably by , they are made , in a mass , to fertilize the lands of one man . to feed the canal of another , and to turn the wheels of industry of a hundred more . But the water must be there , before all this can be done . Another error is , the opinion , that banks have exclusive privileges , by which a few are benefited at the expense of the many ; so that a business is confined to a few , which , if profitable , should be extended to all . But it must be recollected that , in establishing a bank , the legislature do not so much confer a privilege as remove a restriction they had previously imposed . If there were no law in the way , every individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use their money and credit in setting up a bank , and in issuing their notes payable to bearer , as in any other way . But the legislature , watching over the public welfare , and believing that the community would be injured by an indiscriminate exercise of this natural right , have forbidden it. * They assume that * la many , perhaps most of the tnles , there are penal provisions against issuing notes payable to bearer . /q/ many persons , taking upon them the semblance of wealth and integrity , may obtain , for a time , a false credit , by which hundreds of innocent people may be injured ; and that therefore an act , which may be so extensively mischievous , shall not be exercised at all , without their special sanction . When , then , cases occur , to which the reasons of the prohibition do not apply , ( that is , when persons , who afford them satisfactory evidence of their wealth and probity , , seek to become bankers , ) they remove the prohibition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is incident to it , by issuing their promissory notes to those who are willing to take them ; and , at the same time , lay them under such conditions as promise the most benefit , and will best secure the public from the mischiefs that first suggested the prohibition . But , lot cm cjkGiiipiiuii rrom a prohibition , in a case in which the reason of the prohibition does not apply , be regarded as a privilege ; yet , similar privileges are granted and justified every day , on the ground of public benefit . If banks render to the community the important services that have been mentioned , if they save capital , save trouble , save time to every one , and assist the government in time of need , and their mischiefs are comparatively few , and admitting of remedy , then the same principles which justify a charter to a canal company , or a rail-road company , apply to a bank . By means of your charter , you enable them to enforce their own engagements with one another /z/ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights with them , and levy executions on their property with more ease . As their purpose , which we are supposing to be some work of public utility , can not be effected without the cooperation of many , you enable them to act in unity of purpose and of will . You confer on them such rights , and impose on them such duties , and no more , as will enable them to accomplish their object ; and , while their duties are weighty and sometimes onerous responsibilities , their rights are little more than the removal of difficulties which the civil code itself had created difficulties growing out of the proceedings of courts , the law of partnerships , and the artificial rules of property . Supposing the charter justified by considerations of public utility , it must be exclusive , to effect its purpose , or , at least , the charter must permit to some what the law does not permit to all . Trno would be at the expense of constructing a rail-road , or of building a bridge , when the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the work should prove profitable , any one would be at liberty to place another road or bridge along side of his , and intercept his profits ? This is so obviously against both justice and policy , that the legislature always secures to the first enterprise the exclusive right for a time . In conclusion , it may oe remarked , that the net profits of banks , from their " exclusive privileges , " are often under legal interest ; and if the average profits of all the banks , for a sprips of years , be /q/ estimated , they will be found to be under , rather than over , the average profits of capital in other branches of business ; there being an over-proportion of capital attracted into this employment by the arts of interested persons , the sanguine- hopes of the borrowing class , and other extraneous influences. * The profits of a bank can never long exceed the average profits of capital , without successful applications for new banks ; which will be sure to reduce them . /z/ THE legislature having ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new bank , will be materially aided by its establishment , and that there is unemployed capital sufficient for a bank , it should then incorporate in its charter such provisions as are likely to secure its safe and beneficial administration . As an over-issue of paper is one of the greatest mischiefs of banks , and one to which they are most strongly tempted by the desire of increasing their profits , it would seem wise to impose a limit upon their issues , which should not , under any circumstances , be transcended . The checks , which have been adopted by some of the state legislatures , have been to restrict the amount of their loans the amount of their debts generally , and of their notes in circulation in particular . But , in some of the states , the only restriction in their charters is , either that the amount of their loans shall not exceed three times the amount of their capital stock , or that their issues shall not exceed that proportion j but both these restrictions /q/ are merely nominal ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , under the show of imposing a restraint on banks , leave the safety of those institutions to their own discretion . It seems not improbable , that when the first charters were granted , the legislatures , being then little familiar with the subject of banking , and understanding from English writers that the bank of England considered it a rule of safety to have in its vaults one third as much specie as it had notes in circulation , they conceived that , after having required the whole capital stock to be in specie , they were adopting the same rule as the bank of England , in limiting the amount of circulation to three times the capital stock , without adverting to the fact , that , as the bank could not issue paper without at the same time issuing specie , they might reach the prescribed proportion of three times as much paper in circulation as specie in bank , before the former had even doubled their capital stock , or even before their loans , made partly in paper and partly in specie , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way into early charters , was afterwards copied in others , on the presumption that it had been tested by experience . It seems difficult to account , in any other way , for such a latitude of discretion given to institutions that were known to be objects of popular jealousy , and which the legislature evidently meant to place under salutary restraints . There is , no bank in the union in which the discounts and loans are three times the amount of /z/ the capital ; and , in 1837 , when the issues had been greater than at any former period , in only ten of the states the discounts were more than twice the amount of the capital ; and there were but nine states in which the issues and deposits together exceeded the capital. * But , by general provisions in some of the states , and as to most of the late charters in all the states , more effectual restrictions have been introduced . By the general bank law of Massachusetts , passed in 1829 , every bank established after that time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond its capital stock ; and the debts of the bank of every kind are not to exceed twice the amount of its paid-up capital , exclusive of what it owes on account of deposits . Mr. Gallatin f thinks that the limit of the loans of a bank to twice the amount of its capital allows a greater latitude than is consistent with safety , and the events of 1836 and 1837 give confirmation to his opinion . In a season of unwonted prosperity , when every article of exports commanded a high price abroad , and when specie was more disposed to flow into than out of the country , all the banks were tempted to extend their loans to an unprecedented amount , yet , in a majority of the states , they did not reach twice the amount of their capital . In these states , however , as well as the others , the undue extension of their loans , and , * See Mr. Woodbtiry 's bank report of Jan. 8 , 1838. t Gallatin on Banks and Currency , p. 66. /q/ consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend cash payments . With many of the banks , especially when the legislature has taken the requisitive precautions in establishing them , the best security is perhaps to be found in their own prudence , and the lights they have drawn from their late experience ; but with many others , legislative restrictions can not be safely dispensed with ; and , probably , for such , none that have been as yet mentioned are sufficient . Mr. Gallatin * further recommends a restriction on the issue of notes to two thirds of the capital . If the capital of the banks was real , and really consisted of coin , this might be restriction enough , and , perhaps , more than is necessary ; but , constituted as most of these institutions really are , it would give an unsafe latitude to all that class which require restriction . It appears by Mr. Woodbury 's bank report of Jan. 8 , 1838 , f in only eight of the states , ( Delaware , Virginia , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , New Jersey , North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of the capital stock . The most effectual restriction would be one which should compel them to regulate their loans and issues by the amount of specie in their vaults . This is a matter of some practical difficulty , inasmuch as no course of prudence , consistent with the useful functions of a bank , could secure them from great and sudden demands of specie , by /z/ which their quantity on hand would be reduced below the prescribed rule . But , as in that case they could restore the proportion either by a contraction of their issues , or an augmentation of their specie , or by both operations together , ( and they ought to do so , ) the law may require the performance of that duty in a given time . Thus , after the legislature had determined what should be the proportion between the specie and their circulation , in which deposits should be comprehended , they might provide that when , for a stated number of weeks together , or for a certain number of weeks in a stated number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the profits of its loans and discounts , beyond a certain amount , should be forfeited to the state . The scale of forfeiture might be graduated according to the deficiency of specie . If , for instance , the bank were required by its charter not to extend its discounts or loans beyond twice the amount of its capital , and were also required to have one dollar in specie for every four dollars it owed on account of notes in circulation and deposits together , then , in the same proportion that the specie in their vaults was less than one fourth of its debts , should they contract their discounts within a limited time ; and , on failure to do it , the profits beyond the point of contraction should become the property of the state ; and in this way , if the specie was reduced to one half of the amount prescribed , ( that is , to one sixth of the debts , ) and were suffered so to remain for the time stated , then all the discounts beyond the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some penalty , too , when they fail to redeem their notes in legal coin , on application , would also be a useful provision . In some of the states , a failure in this respect by a bank produces a forfeiture of its charter . In this case , they will never stop payment so long as they have any means of paying , unless they have the sanction of the public and the legislature . It might also help to prevent their making this experiment on the public liberality , except in cases of extreme urgency , to have a general provision that their profits , during suspension , should not exceed 6 per cent. , and that even that should be reduced or postponed , if the suspension exceeded twelve months . The great additional profits made by the bank of England , during the latter part of its suspension , must have pleaded strongly with its stockholders against a return to cash payments ; and the same cause was found to operate in the same way during the first suspension in the United States . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ground of complaint in this respect ; but , satisfied that the pecuniary difficulties of the country were in part owing to their sharing in the general intoxication produced by the public prosperity , they , at once , and in good faith , set about contracting their issues and preparing for resumption . Such right-minded views might not always be counted on , if suspensions should become more familiar ; and , at all events , the moral duty is not likely to be weakened by adding the injunctions of law . /z/ By the general law of Massachusetts , banks are subject to an interest of 24 per cent , a year for all notes they shall refuse to pay . Perhaps a lower rate of interest would be more efficient , as more likely to be enforced . Such was the opinion of the Pennsylvania legislature , which has given an interest of 12 per cent . That interest , growing out of the late suspension , in some instances , has been demanded and paid without suit . Among all the checks that have been devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater efficacy than giving publicity to their actual condition ; and this has been a discovery of modern times , and seems to be due to the United States , or rather to the character of their political institutions . The banks of Venice and Amsterdam studiously and effectually concealed from the public a knowledge of the amount of their treasure , and of the transactions of those who managed those institutions . The bank of England followed their example , and the great rule of one third as much specie as the amount of their circulation was the inference of an industrious German writer , * deduced from facts which were of general notoriety , and was never , until lately , avowed by them , as the rule of their conduct . The same air of mystery , and aim at concealment , prevailed in the first banks of the United States . They seemed to have been thought essential to the safety of the banks . But sounder views being entertained by some of * See Stewart 's Political Economy . /q/ our statesmen , and supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in a greater or less degree against these institutions , and which their very secrecy tended to heighten , they gradually began to lift up the veil that had hitherto concealed the condition of banks from the public eye , and at length tore it off altogether . In the first instance , the banks resisted these disclosures as fraught with danger , from popular ignorance and misapprehension ; and they often resisted them successfully . But the controlling power which the legislatures exercise , both in granting charters , and in the management of some of the banks , having been partially exerted to show the condition of those banks to the people , particularly after the first suspension , without being folio ved by any of the apprehended mischiefs , the practice was extended , until it became general ; and now nothing seems to be better established , than that , as the former mystery and secrecy of banks was the parent of fear , suspicion , and ill-will with the people , so nothing is more certain to strengthen confidence , where confidence is due , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVery one is satisfied that , while the bank ha*s not specie enough in its vaults to redeem all its notes , it has enough to redeem all that will probably be returned to it at any one time ; and , although , in an extraordinary state of things , its specie should be exhausted , still , as it has debts due from other people correspondent to its own debts , and its capital stock besides , it will eventually be able to pay off its notes . /z/ While publicity increases the public confidence in substantial and well-managed banks , it exposes the weakness of those that are poor in means , or are ill-conducted ; and thus it operates as a check to the creation of some , and to the imprudence of all . It was not , indeed , sufficient to check such imprudence in 1836 , because the same delusion then possessed both the banks and the people ; but it does not follow , that similar imprudence , both now , and so long as the history of the late suspension shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprehension that the banks would be obliged to respect . They have also become fully sensible of the advantages of publicity in Great Britain , as the bank of England , since the renewal of its charter in 1833 , sends in to the government weekly returns of its coin and bullion , of its circulation and deposits , and monthly abstracts of these are regularly published . Quarterly returns of the issues of the country banks are also returned and published . As a further check to bad management of banks , and a better security to the public for an accurate knowledge of their condition , some of the states have subjected them to periodical visitations from commissioners , appointed by the state for that purpose . This policy was first adopted by New York , in 1829 , by a provision in its safety-fund act , by which three commissioners are appointed , two by the banks jointly , and one by the state , to visit every bank at least once in four months , examine into its affairs , and report them to the legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Mississippi , have also appointed bank commissioners for the same purpose . The measure seems to be one which may be productive of much benefit , without being attended with any objection ; unless it should be found that it gave an influence over the banks to those who wielded the power of the state ; which , in times of great party excitement , might be abused . In the states in which the policy has been tried , no complaint of such abuse has yet been made . In many of the state banks , the state owns a part of the stock ; by reason of which , it appoints a part of the directors ; and this was a provision in the charters of both banks of the United States . As this portion of the directors are likely to feel an especial responsibility to the public , they afford some additional security against excessive issues . They will always incline to look more to safety than profit ; and the public will be more disposed to have confidence and favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has guardians to watch over that interest . But this interest of the public ought not to be made the plea for giving to the state the whole power of management , by giving it the appointment of all the directors , or in a greater proportion than the interest of the state bears to the whole stock . This objection lies to the charter of the bank of Virginia , in which the state owns one fifth of the stock ; but , by the practical operation of the char- /z/ ter , the public authorities , under the form of an election , virtually appoint all the directors . To this course , there seem to be the following objections : It is against natural justice , that , in a partnership , the several partners should not have a voice in some proportion to their respective interests ; and flagrantly so , when the proprietor of one fifth prevails against the other four fifths . It is unfavorable to the prudent management of the bank , as the self-interest of the stockholders will quicken diligence and sagacity far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Public sentiment , too , has an influence in appointing directors , whereby persons but little qualified for the office are often appointed . Thus , members of assembly , living in the bank district , who have been chosen for very different qualifications , and sometimes merely because their personal or moral qualities had won the regards of the majority , or because warmth of party zeal had supplied the place of every other recommendation , are generally appointed ; and their wishes are consulted , in making the other appointments . This power is the more objectionable , as it is exercised without responsibility . The agent of the state , who is dependent on the legislature for his continuance in a lucrative office , will naturally accommodate himself to the wishes of the members ; and the influence they have thus exercised not being visibly exerted , they are not held accountable to the public for its abuse , except in such flagrant cases as will be of very rare occurrence ; and , although the /q/ effect may not be to appoint directors who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the appointment of the best , or , at least , to make fit appointments a matter of chance . It has been owing to this feature in the charters of the Virginia banks , * that the most decided instances of their mal-administration may be traced ; of their imprudent and excessive loans to individuals ; and of their over-issues , when the eagerness for speculation was the strongest , and most required a check . To these objections it may be replied , that the banks of Virginia have been as prudently conducted as any other . They have , indeed , twice suspended cash payments ; but it was at times when nearly all the banks in the United States had done so . They have , occasionally , lost by bad debts ; but so have all the other banks . Even the charge of favoring particular individuals , and persons of great popularity , has been often brought against other institutions , whose directors were chosen principally or wholly by the stockholders . All this may be very true , and yet furnish no satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lucky escape , rather than that there was no danger . The hazards of the voyage may have been great , and have justly entitled the insurer to a high premium , though the vessel has arrived safe . Besides , there may have been counterac- /z/ tions that were temporary . But it is not conceded that there has been no practical mischief . That has been great , frequent , and still continues to operate . As to similar mischiefs in other banks , they may have defects in their constitution from which that of the Virginia banks are free : and their abuses and losses may , in like manner , be traced to the defects in their respective charters . As a general rule , no one is likely to take such good care of money , as he to whom it belongs . So long as the use of money is considered an advantage , and especially so long as banks lend at less than the market rate of interest , it will be desirable to secure , as far as practicable , as impartial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and safety . To prevent favoritism , therefore , and a particular party or clique from obtaining an exclusive control over the bank , a certain proportion of the bank directors should be changed every year . Such a provision is now contained in most bank charters ; but the change is too small to be of much efficacy . They who go out are commonly those who have the least influence , and for whom , of course , the rule was least made . On this account , it would be better that no one , except the president , should be a director more than so many consecutive years . It would also have often proved a very salutary provision , if the loans to the directors had been limited to a fixed sum . It would seem to be the safest course to fix the limit very low ; and when a director wants a larger sum , he can then resign . /q/ One of the most effectual means of securing impartiality in banks , and of lessening their power , is , to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will justify it . But , after the salutary effects of competition are obtained , the farther multiplication of banks is injurious ; both by increasing the expense of the banking machinery to the community , and by lessening the security of the individual banks . In determining how far they will increase the number , the legislature will have , as on very many other occasions , to compromise between conflicting con* siderations , and take the course that promises the greatest proportion of good , and the smallest chance of evil . To increase the number of banks unnecessarily is liable to the same objection as to allow a new rail-road or canal beside an old one . The profits of the business may bear division ; but , what the new company gains , the old one loses ; and as to the public , supposing the means of transport not improved , the cost of the new work is so much of the national capital wasted . If the wealth of a community consists in the wealth of its members , and every one has an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly better that one set of men should obtain an extra profit , than that all should incur a loss . Besides , the smaller the number of banks , the more diffusive is their circulation , and the greater their safety , with the same amount of profit . On the other hand , the public has an interest /z/ that the banking business should not be concentrated in a single institution ; not only that the benefits of competition should be secured to the public , but also because they furnish , or may be made to furnish , one of the most effectual checks to each other 's imprudence . In the same degree that the profits of one bank are increased by an extensive circulation , those of its neighbors are diminished ; and as , when the issues of any one are excessive , most of the excess finds its way into other banks , they may , by frequent settlements with one another , effectually curb the disposition of any part to appropriate to itself more than its proportion of the circulation . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will greatly tend to pre-vent the farther multiplication of banks , as well as the odium of excessive profits , to make the state a sharer in their gains , to some extent . This may be effected in various ways . The state may own a part of the stock ; for which , ' instead of advancing the money , it may agree to pay a moderate interest ; and , in such case , its profit will be the excess of the dividends beyond the interest . This was the case with the banks of the United States , and also with the principal banks of Virginia . Or , the bank may be required to pay a certain sum for its charter , generally in. instalments . This was also done by the bank of the United States to the general government ; and its successor has since done the same to the state of Pennsylvania . Or , it may be subjected to a tax on its capital , as are /q/ the banks of Massachusetts . Or it may be required to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessen the net profits of banks , they tend to discourage the application for charters , and so far to lessen the cost of this instrument of commerce , without at all impairing its safety . A further benefit may be derived from making the state a sharer in their dividends , in this way . If the state should be entitled to share in the profits only after they exceeded 6 per cent . ; and if , moreover , the share of the state should be in a greater ratio , as the excess increased , it would lessen , and might entirely remove , their strongest inducement to excessive issues . In this way , the advan tages of economy , safety , competition , and moderate profits , may be united . Among the regulations of banks , that may be considered conducive to their utility , and also to their eventual safety , is , the payment of interest on deposits . The interest - they pay will , of course , be at a lower rate than they receive . In the Scotch banks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This practice has been found to produce an admirable effect on the poor and working classes in Scotland , in encouraging industry and economy ; and , long before the establishment of savings or providential banks , the Scotch banks had produced all the beneficial effects now generally imputed to those institutions . But they also contribute to the solidity of the banks themselves . Their deposits will thus be manifestly larger than if no interest was paid . No /z/ one will keep money in his possession , or withdraw it from the bank , except his occasions make it necessary ; and , though withdrawn by one person , it is often immediately re- deposited by him who received it . Hence , the sum ordinarily deposited in the Scotch banks has been estimated to amount to about 24,000,000 sterling . Though the payment of interest must make a considerable deduction from the profits of banks , in proportion to its extent , yet , on this very account , there will be a smaller number of banks ; and in the consequent diminished competition and greater extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit . If the practice of paying interest had not prevailed in Scotland , the number of their banks might have been , perhaps , as numerous , in proportion to its population , or nearly so , as in England . With the present number of banks in the latter country , they could not afford to allow interest generally on their deposits . But , in the same proportion that the number of banks is reduced , the greater is the economy to the community in this instrument of commerce , and the greater is the safety of the banks themselves . The payment of interest to the depositors will have the same salutary effect , in short , that has been imputed to the payment of a bonus to the state. * We have seen that one of the inconveniences of banks , and the only one that seems inseparable from them , is , that , when the course of foreign * See a further view of this subject in chapter XI . /q/ trade expels specie from the country , they make the deficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious metals . Now , although this evil may not admit of a complete remedy , it does admit of great mitigation in this way . If the banks be prohibited from issuing small notes , their place will be filled up with specie ; which will thus make a reservoir , on which the banks can draw when their coffers have been drained for foreign export . To this extent , indeed , the advantage of cheapness , in substituting paper for gold and silver , would be diminished ; but we might be content to give up something in economy , in exchange for greater security against the loss , the embarrassments , and the stagnation of business , arising from a deficient circulation . In other respects , the change would produce as much convenience as it would take away . A silver dollar is more convenient than a dollar bank note ; and , if gold currency could make a part of the circulation , half eagles are quite as convenient as notes of five and ten dollars . If inferior in some particulars , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbable , that the states will be ever induced to give up the use of ten dollar bills , or even of fives ; and , unless gold should constitute a fair proportion of our currency , they must be considered as more convenient than the silver they represent , in every respect but in that of lessening the evil of a great afflux of specie. /z/ ONE of the expedients which has been adopted to secure the public against loss from banks , is the safety-fund system of New York . By this system , every bank then in existence , acceding to the plan , and all banks thereafter created , were required to set apart a small portion of their dividends , ( half of one per cent , of their capital , ) to constitute a general fund for the payment of the debts , except the capital of such banks as should become insolvent ; which fund , when reduced , was to be kept up in the same way . The act also makes provision for the disposition of the effects of an insolvent bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bank commissioners , to visit the banks subject to the act , and to arrest the business of any bank it shall discover to be insolvent , by an application to the court of chancery . The issues of the banks are limited to twice the amount of their capital , and their loans and discounts to twice and a half the same amount . The considerations which recommended the plan to the legislature were , that , in the first place , /q/ the public have an additional security against loss to the extent of the fund ; in the next , as the fund is the property of the whole , and it may be endangered by the conduct of any , every bank has an interest in the prudence and good management of every other ; and by the visitations provided for by the act , and which can be increased on application of any three banks , they have sufficient means to learn the actual condition of each other . On the other hand , the plan was objected to , as unjust , in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the imprudent and ill-managed ; and that it would be more likely to produce their mutual forbearance , than to increase their vigilant jealousy of each other 's dealings , by which it would be favorable to overissues , the chief source of danger . That the fund might be sufficient to indemnify the creditors of some two or three banks of small capital , but would be totally inadequate to make good the losses that might arise from the failure of a bank of large capital , or of many small ones , in any sudden and general embarrassment of the money market ; and even where it might be adequate , it would be quite as fruitful of litigation as relief . Without stopping to weigh these opposite arguments , for and against the system , it may be remarked , as affording some evidence against its efficacy , that though several states have adopted that provision of the law of New York , by which bank commissioners are appointed to visit the banks periodically , and report their condition , not /z/ one has adopted the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits , do we see any evidence of greater caution or forbearance , either in the amount of their loans , compared with that of their capital , or the amount of their circulation , compared with that of their specie . If the safetyfund banks of New York be compared with the banks of Pennsylvania , on the 1st of January , 1837 , then , while the former had a somewhat larger proportion of specie , ( the safety-fund banks having something less than one fourth of its circulation , and the banks of Pennsylvania something less , ) in the extent of its loans , the advantage of moderation was greatly in favor of the banks of Pennsylvania . So , if we leave out the city banks of New York , and compare the rest of the safety-fund banks with those of Rhode Island , we find that , as to discounts , the latter has been more moderate , and as to circulation , equal ; and , lastly , if we compare the ninety safety-fund banks with the eight not subject to the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter are greater for their capital , the proportion of their specie to their circulation exceeds that of the safety-fund banks in a yet greater ratio , as may be seen by the following table , made up from Mr. Woodbury 's report of Jan. 1838 . Banks . Capital . Loans . Proportion of Loans to Capital . Specie . Circulation . Proportion of Specie to Circulation . 90 N. York safety fund 8 not subject to the law , Ponn. banks , N. Y. country banks , R. I. banks , /z/ 206 per cent . /z/ 25 per cent . /z/ /q/ The system , too , had no influence in preventing the general suspension of cash payments , or even delaying it ; for it so happened that New York was the first state that suspended. * Another expedient which has been viewed with favor , both in this country and England , for giving stability to banks of circulation , is , to require every bank to vest a part of its capital in public stock , or , in lieu of that , in mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creditors of the bank from loss under any supposable state of pecuniary embarrassment in the country , or of imprudence in the bank . And the state of New York has lately passed a general banking law , by which the ordinary privileges of a corporation are extended to any voluntary association of individuals , who are permitted to carry on the business of banking , and to issue notes to the extent that they have previously deposited stock , or mortgages , with the comptroller of the state . Assuredly , the less the banks lend , the less is their risk of loss ; and if they keep a part of their capital employed , not in the business of banking , but invested in the public funds , or joint-stock companies , or land , they are , to that extent , exempt from the hazards of banking , but to the same extent they must forego its profits , and substitute the dividends or profits derived from these permanent investments in their stead . /z/ This exchange may give the public additional security , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public debt of a government faithful to its engagements , it would afford higher security than any loans on personal credit ; but there may be no national debt , as is now the case with the United States , and there may be no public debt in the state where the bank is to be established . If , then , the money be vested in the stock of canal , rail-road , insurance , or other joint-stock companies , as has been sometimes proposed , there would be the same uncertainty of profit , and the same hazards encountered as in the ordinary business of banking . The stockholders would certainly prefer employing their capital in discounting such paper as they approved , both for profit and safety , to vesting it in the stock of a company , over whose management they had no control ; and to the creditors of the bank , the security would be the same . Let us , however , suppose that stock issued by the states could be procured , although the bank may be somewhat more safe , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doubted whether capitalists will be disposed to advance their money for a bank , in which , to give greater security to the public , their means of profit are diminished , and their hazard of loss is increased . Let us see the operation of a bank on the plan proposed in New York . We will suppose an association formed for the establishment of a bank with a capital of 2,000,000 dollars , for the whole of which the members /q/ must provide approved stock of the state to the same amount . As this is taken at its market value , it is the same to the proprietors as furnishing so much cash . For this stock they are entitled to receive notes for circulation to the same amount of the comptroller of the state . But they must also provide a stock of specie . The law requires that the bank shall have in specie not less than one eighth part of its notes in circulation . Besides , they can not get their notes into circulation without paying away a certain proportion of specie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their notes will be returned to be converted into cash . What that proportion will be , nothing but experiment can deter mine . Let us , however , suppose that , for every four dollars in paper , one in silver has been required . Then , to have lent out the $2,000,000 , the sum of $500,000 was required in specie , to which must be added one eighth of the notes issued , or $250,000 , to be retained in their vaults , agreeably to the requisition of the law . In that case , their profits would be as follows : Interest on $2,000,000 stock , at 5 per ct . $100,000 Dr. on $2,500,000 , discounted at 6 per ct . $150,000 /z/ Which , on $2,000,000 stock and $750,000 specie , is something more than 9 per cent. , from which if we deduct 1 * per cent , for expenses , would leave 1 per cent , for the net profit on the whole capital invested . The expenses , it must , however , be /z/ remembered , will be greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , both for legal advice , and in collecting the interest . But , if the proportion of specie required by the bank should exceed what has been supposed , as it probably would , the dividends would be proportionally diminished . It must be recollected , that the means of circulating the notes have not been at all aided by the stock , except so far as , by increasing the public confidence , it may have extended their circulation . But this effect might be insignificant , and could not be much . Bank notes do not circulate at all , unless the public have entire confidence in the solvency of the bank that issued them ; but , whatever may be the confidence , they will still be converted into specie for the various purposes of being sent , or taken to a distance , of being wrought into plate and jewelry , and of being placed in another bank . It is then the $750,000 of specie , in the case supposed , which has put and keeps in circulation the notes . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum would be adequate to loans or discounts for $2,500,000 , or more than three times its amount , is against all experience . It might not be sufficient for more than two thirds of that amount ; of course , to put the whole $2,000,000 of notes into circulation , a much larger amount of specie will be required . Nor is this all . The proportion of 12 i per cent , of the notes in circulation for the specie the /q/ minimum required by the law although it might be sufficient for country banks in prosperous times , is not enough for them in ordinary times , and not enough for city banks at any time . The banks of the city of New York , on the 1st of January , 1837 , when their loans were unusually great , had $3,854,453 in specie , to a circulation of $8,155,883 ; that is , 47 per cent. , nearly four times as much as we have supposed . To be prepared , then , for the smallest fluctuations in the money market , the bank would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much above 12 per cen-t. , and , if it should resort to the sale of its stock , in times of emergency , the same pressure for money which has driven them to this expedient will lower the market value of stock , and they may lose in one sale the amount of seven years ' dividends . And , so far as real estate is substituted , the hazards of loss , as well as the expense of management , will be greatly enhanced ; so that the plan does not seem calculated to invite prudent and substantial capitalists , who have no other purpose to serve than to make safe and profitable investments ; in which case , the public must eventually find its best reliance is on a well-organized bank , with a capital of gold and silver , placed under the management of cautious , judicious , and experienced men . Of a similar character to the deposit of stock , as affording additional security to the public , is the expedient of making the individual stockholders liable in their private capacities for the debts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and some of the bank charters in the United States contain a provision for a general , and some for a special , liability . But , as such a provision would have the obvious tendency to prevent that class of men from vesting their capital in banks who are best qualified to manage them that is , men of solid wealth and great prudence the public would be likely to lose more by such exclusion than they would gain . It would have the effect of consigning the business of banking to the sanguine , the adventurous , and the inexperienced . These superadded securities do not seem at all necessary , where the other legislative precautions have been attended to ; and the history of banking in these states , for the last thirty years , warrants us in believing that , if the legislatures of the states would faithfully discharge their duty when establishing banks , we might have the benefit of these very useful instruments of commerce and laborsaving institutions , with as little alloy as is consistent with any human contrivance ; and , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hazard . The legislative precautions relied on in the preceding pages will be here recapitulated. 1 . To establish no bank without a respectable capital , and without satisfactory evidence that the business of the place requires the aid of a bank , and that there is a sufficient capital seeking such investment . 2 . To require the whole capital to be paid up /q/ before the bank goes into operation , and to be in gold and silver . 3 . To limit the amount of the bank 's loans its debts and the proportion of its circulation to its specie. 4 . To prohibit the circulation of small notes . 5 . To provide for frequent publications of its condition , verified on oath , and to subject it to periodical visitations by bank commissioners . 6 . To subject it to penalties for refusing to redeem its notes , by a high interest , and a diminution or suspension of its dividends . 7 . To make great annual changes in the directors , to allow none to hold the office permanently , and to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To allow the principal share of the management to the stockholders. 9 . To make the public a sharer in the profits of the bank . 10 . To limit the duration of its charter to a reasonable term . 11 . And , lastly , whenever the business of a place will justify it , to divide it between two or more banks , rather than to give one a monopoly . With whatever care the charter of a bank may be framed , it should not be perpetual , nor extend to a very long term . Policy would seem to recommend that it should last long enough for the bank to acquire stability , and the public to acquire confidence ; but not long enough to prevent the legis- /z/ lature from profiting by experience , to correct its former errors , and supply its omissions . The rapid changes which are ever taking place in our country , and the new light that time is ever casting on the theory of banks , suggest further reasons why bank charters should be subjected to periodical revision after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the extremes which they should not transcend either way . /z/ BUT , since banks require so much regulation , to insure their safety , and legislatures , judging from all past experience , are so likely to mistake their duties in this particular , or to neglect them , some have thought that it would be better to do without such regulation altogether ; that , by means of a currency wholly metallic , although we might appear to travel the road to wealth more slowly , we should travel it more steadily and safely ; and that , in thus avoiding the dangers of banks of circulation , we might secure to ourselves their chief benefits by banks of deposit , and the bills of exchange and other negotiable paper of private bankers . To this it may be replied , in the first place , that , under a system of banking confessedly defective , and susceptible of great improvement , the public does not sustain loss from one bank in a hundred , in a year ; and to suppose that these partial and occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like supposing that men will forbear to ride , because now and then a horse runs away with his rider , or falls with him , and makes him a cripple . And in the same way that /z/ steamboats continue to ply on the Mississippi , notwithstanding the disastrous explosions that have occurred there , and no one thinks of returning to the keel-boats by which they once carried on the commerce of the river without danger ; so will commercial communities continue to avail themselves of the facilities afforded by banks , in spite of their occasional failure , and other concomitant evils . How far these facilities may be afforded by banks of deposit and private bankers , we will now examine . The advantages of mere banks of deposit are these : They , in common with banks of circulation , save to the community the trouble of counting , weighing , and assaying coin , of keeping it secure from robbery and other accident , and , by means of simple transfers on their books , on a written order , correspondent to the checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in making payments . In affording these benefits of a paper circulation , they are exempt from its principal inconveniences . They never can occasion the suspension of cash payments , nor those great and sudden fluctuations of currency , which , whether of excess or deficiency , are so pernicious ; and , whenever the course of foreign trade tends to expel the precious metals from the country , the evil is not aggravated by banks of deposit , as it is by banks of circulation . They are , on the other hand , inferior to banks of circulation in the following particulars : /q/ First , they do not economize in the use of the precious metals , like banks of circulation , the same amount of those metals being required as though the banks did not exist . We have seen that the use of bank notes as a currency now saves to the United States a capital of at least 140,000,000 , which has been diverted to other objects . This advantage , according to the views that have been taken in the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two circumstances . One is , its inadequate supply of currency , in consequence of its rapid growth , the supply being regulated by the previous demand , which is always inferior to the existing demand . The other is , , the great variations , in the demand for money , in consequence of the greater fluctuations of price , to which their staple commodities are subject . While the merchandise which constitutes the materials both of foreign and interior traffic in Europe , with the single exception of grain , seldom varies more than 10 or 15 per cent. , our cotton and tobacco occasionally undergo sudden changes of from 50 to 100 per cent . Secondly , the transfers on the books of banks of deposit are less convenient than the notes of a bank of issue . The latter are passed simply by delivery ; but the former require a written order from every one who uses them in making a payment . They are therefore chiefly useful to commercial men and to capitalists . In the bank of Amsterdam , as every payment of bank money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money /z/ was not as convenient as the ordinary checks in our banks , which are payable to bearer , and , of course , pass by delivery . The transfers of bank money might , indeed , have been transferred in like manner ; but , in that case , the bank would have lost the small sum it received on each transfer ; which was one of the sources of its gains . If , however , those transfers had , like the checks of modern banks , passed by delivery , they would not have been as fitted for circulation as bank notes , which , being of various convenient amounts , can be adapted to any payment . If the bank money of Amsterdam had been represented by a visible sign , like a bank note , which had also passed by delivery it scarcely can be doubted , that , finding the convenience of such paper , the bank of deposit would have gradually become a bank of circulation . Thirdly , banks of deposit also have their peculiar dangers , by which the security they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are first established , and for many years afterwards , the money deposited with them may be faithfully kept , and only paid out as it is demanded by its proprietors , yet , when it is found that , after satisfying these demands , there is always a large sum on hand untouched , the temptation to make use of this idle capital , and to make it profitable , will be very great , and may be too strong to be resisted . Such is the history of the bank of Amsterdam . Coin to the amount of more than 4.000,000 of dollars was secretly withdrawn from /q/ its vaults , in the confidence that it would not be known , and lent to the government , to the corporation of Amsterdam , and to the East India Company . Notwithstanding which , four new burgomasters , every year , went through the formality of counting the money , of swearing that the whole sum due to its creditors was in the vaults of the bank , and that they would faithfully deliver it over to their successors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , privy to this fraud on the public , for near half a century , were the four principal magistrates of the second most commercial city in the world . Without doubt , other and better guards and defences may be devised ; but what scheme could human ingenuity invent , that human ingenuity would not find means to evade , if so disposed ? Agents must be employed ; and some of them , at some time or other , might violate their duty , under the very powerful temptations to which such large accumulations of unemployed treasure would expose them . Let us , however , suppose that the temptation was resisted by individuals , and that men could every where , and at all times , be found , to keep the treasure confided to them untouched ; is it certain that it would always be respected by the legislatures of the several states in which it was deposited ? that , when they found , after the ex* perience of forty or fifty years , or even less , that credits , in a bank of deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , preferred to cash , they would /z/ not , in a season of national difficulty , or even of great commercial embarrassment , be induced to use those credits , or authorize the banks to use them , so as to increase the currency , as a resource against the evil of the moment ? nay , seize upon , or tax , or borrow some of the hoard , which , they would say , might as well be returned to the mines from which it had been extracted , as to lie forever hid in the vaults of a bank ? Laws but reflect the passions and feelings of men ; and who can doubt , if there had been banks of deposit in the United States , that the general government and the states would , during the last war , when the difficulty of raising money for national defence was most seriously felt , have either borrowed the gold and silver , or authorized the issue of notes on its credit ? And whenever either expedient is resorted to , the bank of deposit becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by banks of deposit are so moderate , they neither using their capital , nor deriving interest from their credit , that it is only in large cities , and places of great trade , that they could have sufficient business to defray their expense . The accommodation , then , which such banks could afford , would be denied to all smaller communities . Fifthly , if there were no other chartered or joint-stock banks permitted by law than banks of deposit , then private banking would produce all the mischiefs of banks of circulation , in an aggravated form . After a nation has made much progress in the /q/ accumulation of wealth , and in the pursuits of industry and commerce , the precious metals , we have seen , gradually find substitutes in paper credit , as they had originally superseded barter . The large amount of values , gradually increased by each succeeding generation , that are then transferred from hand to hand , would require great masses of gold and silver ; which , to transport from place to place , to count , weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the proprietors , to say nothing of the expense . They therefore , to save this labor and expense , have invented such signs or representatives of those metals as bills of exchange , bankers ' certificates , and bank notes paper credit , in short , which is made to perform all the functions of currency . This substitute for gold and silver will be certain to exist , in some shape or other , after a nation has become opulent and commercial ; and it will be used not merely to the extent of the gold and silver that would have circulated in the country , but to a much greater extent , by means of the drafts , promissory notes , or other negotiable paper , of private bankers . As soon as a banker of great capital and high credit finds that his paper is generally current , from its greater convenience than coin for many purposes , he avails himself of the circumstance , to extend its circulation , and thus to derive the same profit from his credit as his capital ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prohibitions that would strike at the root of all com- /z/ mercial credit whatever . So far , then , as paper currency has an advantage over gold and silver , and is fitted to supersede them , it will thus be furnished by private bankers , where there are no incorporated banks of circulation . The process here described may be very slow in some countries ; but in those which , like the United States , have once been familiar with a convertible paper currency , and by that familiarity have been taught to know all its convenience , and to disregard its risks , the paper of private bankers would obtain circulation immediately , if our banking corporations were abolished . Supposing , then , the currency which is now supplied by joint-stock and chartered banks to be supplied by single bankers and capitalists ; in what respect is the public a gainer by the exchange ? We have the means of answering this question , by adverting to the state of things in England ( where private banking prevails ) in 1825 ; when the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these banks , exceeded any thing ( it was affirmed in parliament ) which had occurred in Europe since the failure of the Mississippi bank in France , about a century before . The sufferings of no part of our community , from the failure or even general suspension of banks , have ever approached to any thing like what were then experienced in England ; and it was the lesson then taught the nation , which induced it to change its banking system , and to erect joint-stock banks , such as exist in this country , as safer and better than private banking . /q/ Banks formed ' by large associations of individuals , besides the probability of their greater wealth and stability , can be subjected to a system of regulation , of inspection , and control , that would be impracticable with private bankers . No one would think of extending to these the supervision which is now exercised by bank commissioners , in some of the states ; and , though it were , it would be far more easily evaded . Nor can chartered banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to much extent , entail on the community the evil consequences of their own bankruptcy . The speculations which are so feasible to an individual banker , and to which he is so strongly incited by the facility afforded by the credit of his paper , and by the gain being exclusively his own , are impracticable to a bank . There is far less temptation ; and to do it with secrecy and impunity is impossible . It will , then , always happen , where there are private bankers , whose paper obtains credit and currency , that some of them will distend that credit until it bursts ; and then the evil , great as it is , will not be confined to their creditors , but it brings the paper of other bankers into suspicion , involves some in the same common ruin , and , for a time , embarrasses the operations of all . If such would be the result of banks of deposit ; if they will not supersede banks of issue , but merely substitute private bankers to chartered banks ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the former are exposed , it /z/ conclusively follows , that our present system is better than the one which some have recommended in its stead . Nor can it be supposed , that the bills of exchange or drafts of private bankers will answer all the purposes of bank notes , for safety and facility of transport ; as it is known , that those expedients often subject the traveller to charges which are sometimes heavy , besides the trouble of compelling him to betake himself to a banker , in every town he passes through ; whereas , if he has the paper of a bank in high credit , this trouble and expense is saved . Private bankers may , indeed , be very useful where there are no banks , whether such bankers issue notes or not ; but their drafts would commonly prove a poor substitute , in this country , for the notes of an established bank in good credit . /z/ BUT some , who are entirely satisfied of the benefits of banks of circulation , think those benefits can be best attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great advantages of freedom in commerce , and in the employments of industry and skill generally , they believe it would prove equally beneficial in banking . They maintain that , if the business be left open to the free competition of individuals and associations , the public will be better supplied with banks , precisely as they are with mills , ships , manufactories , and every thing else . Banking will then obtain its full share of capital , from which it is now partially excluded by legislative restrictions , and it will obtain no more than its share , as capital will take this direction , just as far as it can be used more productively to its proprietors , and no farther . But while , as a general rule of policy , the public is supplied with better articles on better terms , where the supply is left to the unrestricted competition of individuals , yet to this rule there are some exceptions , which derive their authority from /z/ the same consideration of public utility as the rule itself . Thus , in any supposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the same measures of quantity that the laws have prescribed ; many articles must be submitted to official inspection before they can be vended in open market ; and some branches of industry are subjected to taxes from which others are free . No government has ever yet allowed its citzens to coin gold and silver at pleasure . They all , too , occasionally grant an exclusive right to particular individuals or companies , to build a bridge , keep a ferry , or construct a road , on the ground that the public will be thereby better accommodated with these useful works , than if they were left open to the voluntary enterprise and free competition of all . The question , then , still recurs , does the case of banks of issue come within the rule or the exceptions ? Let us bring it to the test of reason , founded on experience . There are some points of difference , between banking and other species of trade , that have an influence on this question . In the latter , every trader seeks to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surest means of effecting this object is to improve in the quality and cheapness of his products . In this , his interest is identical with that of the public . The bank , too , has a like interest in the extension of its business ; but the public is not in like manner benefited by its extension . They , on the contrary , may be injured by his success , as certainly as by his failure . The /q/ excessive issues which have enriched a bank may be very injurious to the community . Self-interest has not , therefore , the same conservative power in the case of banks that it has in other branches of trade . When , moreover , the creditors of a trader lose by his bankruptcy , they , for the most part , have received some compensation in their previous dealings , or if they have not , they have voluntarily incurred the hazard of giving credit . But , in the case of the failure of a bank , whose paper has constituted a part of the currency of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with it , and have not voluntarily given it credit . They have taken its paper because they found it current , and because , perhaps , they must have taken that or nothing . The prudence which may protect one in his ordinary mercantile transactions , may not avail him here . The bank notes are not , indeed , a legal tender , but he is practically obliged to receive what other people agree to consider as money . There is yet another point of difference . The failure of one merchant , or tradesman , does not affect other merchants , or tradesmen , who have had no dealings with them ; but the failure of a bank whose paper has had much circulation , affects the credit , for a longer or shorter time , of all other bank , paper , and thus injures not only the banks , but the holders of their notes , and impairs the usefulness of paper circulation . It is not improbable that the failure of Law 's Mississippi Bank in France , and /z/ the wide-spread mischief it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , which it required more than a century to subdue , and which is not yet eradicated . On these accounts , the public has an interest in the stability of banks , which it does not have in the solvency of ordinary traders ; and it is therefore justified in laying them under such restrictions as will best insure that stability . It was on this ground , that congress , in conformity with the public sentiment , lately subjected steamboats to such restrictions and regulations as seemed most likely to render them safe , and which the selfinterest of competitors had not been found sufficient to secure . On this subject Adam Smith well remarks , " To restrain private people , it may be said , from receiving in payment the promissory notes of a banker , for any sum , whether great or small , when they themselves are willing to receive them j or , to restrain a banker from issuing such notes , when all his neighbors are willing to accept of them , is a manifest violation of that natural liberty which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to support . Such regulations may , no doubt , be considered as , in some respects , a violation of natural liberty . But those exertions of the natural liberty of a few in dividual s , which might endanger the security of the whole society , are , and ought to bo. restrained by the laws of all governments of the most free , as well as of the most despotical . The obligation of building party walls , in order to /q/ prevent the communication of fire , is a violation of natural liberty , exactly of the same kind with the regulations of the banking trade which are here proposed . " Let us now consider the effects of unrestricted banking more in detail . If all the legal restraints which at present exist against the creation of banks of issue were abolished , the natural and probable effects would every where be an increase in the number of banks , and a further investment of capital in the business of banking . The greater competition among the banks , which would thence arise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase of capital , but would also tend to produce a further accommodation to borrowers , either in the amount lent , or in the time for which it was lent , or in the rate of interest , or as to the individuals themselves to whom loans were granted . In some one or more of these ways , and , probably , in all , the profits of bank capital would decrease , until they reached the general average of other employments exposed to the same risks . So far as the change in the law had the effect of giving employment to idle capital , it would benefit both the class of lenders , and that of borrowers ; it would add to production , and thus benefit the whole community . It is not , however , reasonable to suppose , it could have much effect in that way . Money naturally seeks , and is sure to find , means of profitable investment . It may always be thus vested in joint-stock companies , or /z/ in private loans . Nor must it be supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie there for want of means of profitable investment . They consist principally of the money wanted for the purposes of daily consumption , or the occasions of commerce ; and such part as is intended for permanent investment is merely awaiting a choice of modes , and does not wait long . So far as the change has diverted capital from other employments to that of banking , as it has probably passed from a less productive to a more productive employment , it would be so far beneficial both to the proprietors and to the community . And , lastly , so far as the change has increased the accommodations to the borrowers beyond the addition made to the banking capital , that is to say , by the extension of bank credit , it may be advantageous to the community , or it may not . Supposing the additional loans to have been made to the prudent , the judicious , or even the fortunate , they would be beneficial ; but if the increased competition of the banks should have the effect , as we have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wealth of the community would probably be more impaired than augmented . Should the number of banks be also increased , the additional cost of the banking machinery would be a clear loss to the community . Let us , however , suppose that the sum of direct gains would exceed that of losses ; yet it must be recollected , that a part of these gains is at the expense of the safety of the banks . To the same /q/ extent that the same amount of capital is distributed among a greater number of banks , or that the loans are extended in proportion to the capital , is their stability put to hazard , and thus the loss that would eventually accrue from the failure of banks is to be added to that which would arise from over-trading . The additional profit , then , is dubious ; and , supposing it certain , the public would make a bad exchange in commuting security for profit . Experience furnishes us with much to confirm these views . In perhaps every instance of the failure of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its organization , or to some mismanagement that prudent legislation would have prevented . The failing banks have either had an insignificant or a fictitious capital j they have not been sufficiently restricted in their loans , or their issues ; their affairs have not been subjected to official inspection , or even to the public scrutiny . It will also be found that , in those states in which the banking business has been carried to the greatest extreme , in proportion to their population and trade , bank failures have been the most frequent . The tables exhibited by Mr. Gallatin , in his Essay on Currency and Banks , may seem 2ft first to furnish evidence to contradict this position . Thus , it appears that , in 1830 , New England , with a population of less that two millions , ( 1,955,207 , ) and a bank capital of $34,505,269 , equal to more than , 17 to each person , has had twenty bank /z/ failures ; whilst the middle states , including the district of Columbia , with a population of 4,151,286 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $9 to each person , ) have had forty-seven bank failures ; and the four southern states , with a population of 3,047,400 , and a bank capital of $14,125,129 , ( equal to less than $5 to each person , ) have had fifteen bank failures ; so that the middle states , with little more than half the relative amount of bank capital of the New England states , have had more than twice as many bank failures ; and the southern states , with not one third of the bank capital of New England , have had three fourths as many bank failures . But it does not follow , because an amount of banking capital of 39,000,000 for the middle states was less than that of 34,000,000 for New England , in proportion to population , it was not greater in proportion to the means and wants of banks ; especially , if we regard the localities of the respective banks . Thus , no one can doubt , that a banking capital of $3,875,794 for the district of Columbia ( equal to near $100 to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of New England . The banks , also , which have failed in New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Maryland , being geugrflly located in places of little trade , must be regarded as furnishing examples of greater excess in banking than those of any part of New England . As to the failures in the southern states , the ten set down to Virginia ought not to be comprehended in this class . They were self-created institutions , /q/ which arose during the suspension of specie payments , or a short time before ; and which , for a brief period , in the extreme scarcity of currency , contrived , by an evasion of the law against private banking , to throw their notes into circulation . In 1815 , they petitioned the legislature to grant them charters ; which being refused , and new laws being passed , to reach their evasion , they wound up their affairs , without loss to any one , unless , perhaps , a partial one was sustained by the stockholders ; so that these ten cases referred to were rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank failures . If , then , they be deducted , the number of failures in the southern states will be reduced to five . There has not been a single instance of the failure of a chartered bank in Virginia . Since 1830 , there has been scarce any failure of a bank in any of the Atlantic states , except in New England , and principally in Massachusetts . In all these last instances , ( so far as their circumstances have been disclosed in the public journals , ) they have committed gross violations of the general law of that state for the regulations of banks . If we look to England , we shall find still more satisfactory evidence of the danger of unrestricted banking . In that country , every one may engage in the banking business who pleases ; but , by way of favoring the bank of England , no company or association of more than six persons , until lately , could unite for that purpose ; and there , the number of failures has far exceeded any thing which /z/ has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of country bankers who were bankrupts was twenty-six ; but the actual number that stopped payment was one hundred. * From this time to 1810 , eighty-seven commissions of bankruptcy were issued against country banks ; in 1810 , twenty-six commissions were issued : and , between 1810 and 1814 , twenty-nine commissions . In the years 1814 , 1815 , and 1816 , the number of commissions was ninety-two ; from that time to 1825 , sixty-two more ; and , between October , 1825 , and February , 1826 , no less than fifty-nine ; making , in thirty-four years , three hundred and eightyone bankrupt banks . Nor is this all ; for it is said , " that the actual commissions sued out do not show the extent of the failures ; but that to these should be added the private compositions , which are commonly estimated to be to the number of commissions in the proportion of four to one . " The number of country banks which stopped payment in 1793 was supposed to be one third of the whole . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil ; as the average number of failures , so far as we have published accounts , continues to be about fifteen in a year ; f and this , too , when the law which restricts the number of partners in a bank to six has had no existence since 1826 , except within sixty-five miles of London . * Tooke on Prices , Appendix to Part I. t McCUlloch 's Com . Diet. , p. 95. /q/ The calamitous effects of these failures of country banks in England are attested by all their writers . Mr. McCulloch remarks , ( and in so doing he merely repeats what had been declared in parliament : ) " The destruction of country banks has , upon three different occasions , in 1792 , in 1814 , 1815 and 1816 , and in 1825 and 1826 , produced an extent of bankruptcy arid misery that has never , perhaps , been equalled , except by the breaking up of the Mississippi scheme in France . " * After such frequent and dire experience of the evils of the system of banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1806 , in joint-stock banks , by a qualified repeal of the restriction on the number of partners ; but , this having proved insufficient , they seem , now , generally to admit the necessity of subjecting all banks , whether carried on by individuals or companies , to regulation ; and the only question is as to the character and extent of their restrictions . Whether they shall not be prohibited from issuing any notes but those of the bank of England , which would then be the only bank of issue ; whether they should be allowed to begin their operations until their whole capital is paid up ; whether they shall not give security to the extent of their issues ; whether the stockholders of a joint-stock bank shall be subject to the ordinary liabilities of partners in trade , or to the limited liability of the members of a corporation ; and /z/ whether the public should not be more fully and frequently informed of their dealings and condition . On all these questions , there seems to be great diversity among their statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be finally settled , they concur to show that all deem their past system a bad one ; and that the source of the evil having been , in the past , freedom from regulation , the only remedy is , to subject them to such restraints as experience has recommended . The arguments thus drawn from the experience of England and the United States , against unrestricted banking , would seem to be conclusive , but for the counter-experience of Scotland . There , banking is yet freer than it is in England , the limitation on the number of partners in a bank never having extended to that part of the kingdom ; and there banking has been comparatively safe . There had been no panic among the people , causing runs on the banks , and but few failures ; so that the whole loss sustained from that source , in more than a century , had amounted only to 36,344 ; much less , no . doubt , than had been often sustained in England by the failure of a single bank . How , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of diversity between them , as to legal restraint , is , that in Scotland there is no limit to the number of partners , as there is in England ; but the greater stability of the Scotch banks can not be referred to this , as more than one fourth of the Scotch banks have /q/ six partners , or . less , arid more than half have less than twenty partners . The cause of their greater safety must be found , then , in the superiority of their system . Let us notice its principal features . The number of banks in Scotland which issue notes is thirty . The three oldest are incorporated , with large capitals , and numerous partners . The other twenty-seven have been established since 17G6 , and are all unchartered . The thirty banks have one hundred and thirty-three branches ; of which , the chartered have forty-four , and the unchartered , eighty-nine . The mode of transacting business seems to be the same in all . They differ from the English banks in the following particulars : They pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than they receive , * ) and on sums as low as 10 , or even 5 . They grant cash cred , its to tradesmen , shopkeepers , and farmers , who are able to furnish two sureties . These credits are generally from 200 to 500 . They differ from ordinary loans or discounts in this : the interest is not paid at once on the whole sum , but only on such sums as are drawn out of the bank ; and it is farther understood , that all payments and receipts of money by the persons to whom these cash credits are granted , will be made through the bank ; so that the amount of both payments and receipts , in the year , is supposed to average , at least , five times the amount of the grant . The aggregate of these cash credits is estimated at 6,000,000 sterling . /z/ Another important point of difference is , that all the banks of Scotland have a settlement twice a week , in Edinburgh ; and the balances they severally owe , on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their London bankers , with whom they have deposited their securities , bearing interest , and which drafts are equivalent to gold . Whenever , then , any bank is led to an over-issue of its notes , the excess is sure to find its way into the other banks , to which it must be paid in London drafts . It seems reasonable to refer the greater stability of the Scotch banks to these peculiarities ; and we see in all of them a conservative tendency . In consequence of a draft on London , at short sight , being equal to gold in Scotland , they are able , by means . of depositing their funds in London , where they are carrying an interest , to pay off their notes , in drafts ; and are thus saved the necessity of keeping any part of their capital in gold . And as their notes , when issued in excess , would promptly reduce their deposits in London , the difference between the profits they receive on their money in Scotland and in England is too small to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit with the other banks and the public , as over-issues would be sure to do . They will therefore not aim to issue notes to a greater amount than can ordinarily be kept in circulation . Their cash credits greatly assist them in circulating their notes . They are granted principally with that view ; and where they are used as a /q/ mere loan , without frequently drawing out and paying in money , they are discontinued . But no part of their system has , perhaps , done so much , either for the community or themselves , as the payment of interest on deposits . By this , they receive all the unemployed money of the country , and some that would have sought other modes of investment , that might promise greater profit , but at greater risk . Hence , their ordinary deposits are estimated at upwards of 20,000,000 sterling . They are also made , thereby , better acquainted with the pecuniary credit of individuals , and of the precise monetary condition of the community , and regulate their dealings and issues accordingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more influence in increasing the solidity of the Scotch banks , by lessening their number . It is obvious , that a bank which pays interest on its deposits can not make as much profit on the same amount of business as one which does not pay ; and the only mode in which the former can be compensated for this additional charge is by a proportional extension of its business . That field for banking operations , therefore , which would be lucrative to an English bank , might not pay expenses in Scotland . The field in the latter must , on that account , be larger ; or , what is the same thing , the number of banks must be smaller . Hence it is , that there is so great a difference between the two countries in this respect . In the year 1800 , when the number of country banks in /z/ Great Britain was three hundred and eighty-six , * the banks of Scotland were only eighteen ; and now , when the Scotch banks have increased to thirty-three , ! the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than nine hundred in 1813 ; and the number of joint-stock banks , in 1836 , was ninety-eight. ; ) : This payment of interest on all deposits as low as 10 , or less , has the same effect in lessening the number of banks , as the bonus that is exacted in some of the states ; and , as we have seen , tends to increase the security of the public , by lessening the number of banks , without impairing the safety of those who pay it . But , to whatever cause we may attribute the small number of banks in Scotland , it can scarcely be doubted , that their stability has been increased by their fewness . While , then , we may fairly ascribe the greater safety of the Scotch banks to their paying interest on all deposits , their frequent exchanges of notes , their cash credits , and their being few in number , to the prudent regulations they have prescribed to themselves , rather than to their being free from any regulation by law , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , would produce the same effects . That excellent regulation , of having a general settlement and exchange of notes twice a week , would be scarcely practicable here , both on account of the greater dispersion * Thornton on Paper Credit , Chap . VII . /q/ of our banks , and of the want of that facility of adjusting their mutual accounts by drafts , equivalent to specie . New York may , in time , come to be the London of the United States ; but it is far from having the same relation to other parts of the union , as yet . And , above all , if the partners of a bank were individually liable for the debts of the bank , as is the case in Scotland , few men of prudence would embark their capital in a large association ; and few are rich enough to command the public confidence without associates . Nor do we know how much the success of banking in Scotland may be owing to traits of national character , or to local circumstances . Few of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stress on the remarkable prudence , frugality , and steadiness of that people ; and , though these qualities might , with them , supply the place of legal restriction , it does not follow , they would do so every where . We know that the ardor of enterprise , which characterizes the people of the United States , often betrays them into rashness ; that in nothing has that rashness been more strongly exhibited than in banking . The single example of Scotland , then , furnishes no more argument , that banks may be left to their own discretion , than , because there had been few or no explosions of steamboats on the Delaware or Hudson , it was unnecessary and unwise for congress to subject them to regulation . In steamboats and banks , though extraordinary profits may justify /z/ to individuals , or seem to justify , great risks , they afford no adequate compensation for the injury done to the public . But , in thus acknowledging the superiority of the Scotch system of banking over the English , or that which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overrate its merits . Free banking there has not gone unscathed . Five of its unchartered banks were stated to have failed , in the evidence given to a committee of the house of peers in 1826 ; and another , since that time , is said to have been embarrassed. * This , then , though implying great comparative safety , is not that degree of stability which we ought to aim at , and which is attainable under a course of judicious regulation . It is not , indeed , as great as that which has already been reached in at least one state , and possibly in others . It has been thirty-two years since banks were introduced in Virginia ; in which time , no chartered bank has ever failed ; and all others have been prohibited by law . The system in that state has , however , considerable defects ; and the banks owe their safety more to the caution with which the legislature has granted charters , than to the sufficiency of the restrictions which those charters have contained . hi the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , banking may , under peculiar circumstances , be conducted with prudence * Speech of William Cl*y , ESI. , M. P. , p. 100. /q/ i , and safety , when left to the sole guidance of an enlightened self-interest , yet , from the more enlarged and varied experience of England and the United States , the chances are against such a result ; and , in a branch of business in which the success of many is no compensation for the failure of a few , it will be wise te enforce moderation and forbearance by the sanctions of law . /z/ WHEN the profits of banking are so great , where banks have not been too much multiplied , that the banks , after paying a bonus to the government , are able to makeliberal dividends among the shareholders , it has been asked why the state should not , in its corporate character , appropriate this benefit to itself , and so far lessen the burden of taxation ; and the rather , as the furnishing the community with money has always been regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper province of the government to provide the coins of gold , silver , and copper , which are wanted for the currency of the country , and one which it jealously maintains and enforces by the severest penalties , why should it not also furnish it with the paper representatives of those coins , when , in the progress of society , they constitute much the largest part of the currency ? If , too , it be considered as much the duty of the government to provide a standard of value , as standards of measure and weight , it is particularly incumbent on it to regulate bank paper , which participates in all the fluctuations and uncertainty to which coins are /q/ exposed , and is liable to others that are peculiarly its own . That the banking of a commercial country , if the government thought proper to take the business into its own hands , might prove a great and continual source of profit can not be doubted . Let us , for instance , suppose that the whole banking operations of the United States were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital gradually accumulated by the excess of income over expenditure , and which excess , the business of banking would contribute rapidly to enhance . The whole amount of loans and discounts of all the banks in the United States , by Mr. Woodbury 's last report , * was , on the 1st of January , 1838 , $485,000,000 . But , as this amount is swelled by the loans made of the banks to pay up the capital stock , in the way that has been already explained , which loans would not have existed if the government was the only banker , a deduction to that extent from the gross amount of discounts should be made . There are no data before the public for ascertaining the amount of money so borrowed ; but , let us suppose that one half of the capital stock paid up has been thus obtained , and still constitutes a part of the debts due to the banks . One half of the capital is 159,000,000 , ( within a fraction ; ) and , if this be deducted from the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing loans from the government to /z/ the people . This sum , at 6$ per cent. , would yield an annual income ' of upwards of 20,000,000 , of which , if the amount be deducted which had been drawn from the people in the way of taxation , and which would constitute the banking capital , and a farther deduction be made for extra expenses and losses , about one half , or 10,000,000 , would be net profit , arising from the substitution of paper for the precious metals . But , if it be supposed , as some may be inclined to do , that the whole 485,000,000 , and yet more , might be safely lent by the government , and that a large sum might also be made , as undoubtedly would be practicable , by premiums on drafts for ' the purpose of distant remittance , the profits would be proportionally increased , and might , perhaps , in the gross amount , exceed 30,000,000 a year ; which is nearly double the regular and necessary expenses of the government . In like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states to be monopolized by their respective governments , each would experience a correspondent increase of revenue beyond its increase of taxation . Thus , in New York , the excess of loans made by the banks beyond their capital on the 1st January , 1838 was 36,000,000 , although they had , in the previous year , been reduced 18,000,000. * Taking this difference as the measure of the profits of banking in New York , it *See bank commissioners ' report to the legislature of New York , Jan. 24 , 1838. /q/ would exceed $2,000,000 annually . And , in Virginia , which has less banking capital than any one of the Atlantic states , except North Carolina , the difference between the discounts and capital is about 9,000,000 , which , after paying expenses , yields a greater annual profit than the ordinary expenditure of the state . But , as the capital , after it was once obtained , would be permanent , and would no longer require taxation , the whole profits of the bank , deducting the expenses , would then be public revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , would be about $4,000,000 , and , in Virginia , about $1,000,000 . Supposing the profits arising from this substitution of paper for coin to be vested in roads , canals , and other public improvements , what a magnificent result would it produce in half a century , or even in twenty years ! It might already have doubled the canals of New York* But , - notwithstanding these results , as plausible as they are splendid , there seem to be insuperable objections to this mode of supplying the community with a paper currency . First , if the profits of banking were derived , as they now are , from discounting promissory notes and bills of exchange , then every argument which could be urged against the government 's engaging in any other branch of business agricultural , commercial , or manufacturing for the sake of profit , would apply to this . We can not look for the same prudence , diligence , and economy , in conducting the affairs of the public , that individuals /z/ exert in the management of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but governments must necessarily act by agents . Besides , the business of lending the money of the /q/
