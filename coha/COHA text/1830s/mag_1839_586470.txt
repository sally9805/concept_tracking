txt CHARLES JARED INGERSOLL was boru at Philadelphia the third of October , 1782 . Unlike many distinguished Americans , whose just pride is to be rather founders than offspring of established families , Mr. Ingersoll 's descent is from historical forefathers . His maternal grandfather , Charles Pettit , served in the Commissariat of the army of the Revolution , also as Member of Congress , and was a prominent person in the Democratic party . His paternal grandfather , Jared Ingersoll , held several offices of the British crown , and was one of the first victims of what is called Lynch law : having been compelled by a well.organized mob , in 1763 , at Hartford , Connecticut , to resign , under duress , the office *f Commissioner of Stamps , so odious to America . On his gray horse , surrounded by a multitude threatening to injure , if not destroy him , if he did not instantly lay down his office , he jocosely remarked to a friend that he was like Death in Revelations , mounted on a pale horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , the only child of this tory parent , although in England completing his professional education , whew the revolution broke out , instantly declared for it and retired to France , till by a perilous winter navigation he escaped to America , to share the fortunes of his country . Among the many eminent public stations he held , ( and he declined still more , ) he was one of the members of the illustrious Convention which conferred on the United States that admirable modern modification of representative government in a constitution , more liable to injury by construction , to which Jared Ingersoll was uniformly opposed , than by any other infidelity to it . Thus descended , and moreover closely connected by marriage with another honorable tory , who was appointed by a democratic Governor to the highest judicial post in Pennsylvania , it was while warmly repelling a sweeping curse of all tories , pronounced by a friend , that Charles J. ingersoll uttered the honest vindication of some of his most revered connections , for which party malediction has been showered upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tory , he would probably have been one himself It is easy now to chime in with overwhelming success in revolution , and to condemn all who happened to take the wrong side . But a manly and speculative apology for kindred , bound by oaths of office and other strong inducements to the royal government , are not premises from which to infer tory poitics , to the prejudice of one with a character established by a life of ad* hesion , under trying circumstances , to the principles and patriots of the // American revolution . Mr. Ingersoll had lived down this absurd calumny when it was revived by garbled extracts of an angry letter long gone to oblivion , being treacherously sprung in his late election .. contest . The trick did not produce the slightest effect , however , although very many of his supporters were sons . of whigs of the revolution , bred llt* deep abhorrence of tories ; for while the well-born , as they are sometimes styled , of America , seldom have distinguished ancestry to boast of ; it is surprising how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that tried men 's souls , and how nobly they cherish the honor of such a lineage . Of a kin to this disparagement is another charge , so often repeated that it has , perhaps , acquired* some credence : that Mi . Ingersoll wtts once a federalist . The facts hereafter stated will settle that point .. As Madison , and Crawford , and other apostles of the democrati party were calie&amp; federalists , so might the subject of this sketch be . Jef-* ferson , in his celebrated inaugural. , said that Americans are all federa1ists* and all republicans . In the mutations of parties and of men , Mr. luger*oll , who has always , ao in the instance of his apology for tories , been chara*terised by the utmost independence of opinion , has no doubt occa* sionally opposed those with whom he has generally coincided . But his principles have never changed . While a boy of thirteen years of age , he electioneered the democratic ticket in the warm contest between Swawwick and Tilghmaii to represent Philadelphia in Congress . While a youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rank federalism , the only newspaper he teok was the D*mocratic.Journal , then edited by Mat -- thew Garey , and on innumerable memorable occasions Charles J. IngersoIl has given- too many and too costly proofs of his ingrain attachment to democracy , to leave a doubt of his sincerity . Few men s induce -- ments to desert and deny it have been stronger . None , living as he has been in the very focus of contumelious and exclusive city aristocracy , . has stood fast firmer . or spoken out freer for the whole code of the De-. claration of American Independence . During the hostilities with France in 1798 , when still a mere lad , he shared the martial enthusiasm which the federal administration labored to excite against an insolent foe : and he is yet , no doubt ,  --  willing to acknowledge that with the progressive development of political experlence , his mind has gradually opened- to convictions of democratic excellence , which at first it paused upon . But , from first to last , from early boyhood to advanced age , tried by all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachments and his aversions* his intimacies and estrangements , thirty years of unquestionable credentials , private and public , attest that he has always been among the hardiest pioneers of the loftiest American patriotism , lived in the full faith of the real presence of popular sovereignty and radical politics , inflexibly an ' *-tagonist to English tory or federal party doctrine , and always openly and heartily opposed to them . Brought up in all the elegant accomplishmento* beside the ordinary tendencies of collegiate education , but unspoiled by such endowments , he studied , practised , and inculcated. the stoic philos*- // phy of republicanism , and preferred the done to the corinthian order of politics , while cast in the " corinthian order of society . " His opinion indeed has always been that weak government is a national calamity ; but that a government in which the people are really sovereign is the strongest of all , and that the popular sovereignty should be not merely proclaimed , but carried into full effect . After undergoing the usual routine of school and college education in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of polite education , with a temperament inclined more to the poetry than the prose of learning , but admitted with credit to the bar , before coming of age , he was sent to Europe , there to finisb , as was then considered useful , the formation of American character . While there he was attached to the diplomatic family of Mr. King , the American minister at London , travelled with him in Holland , Belgium , Switzerland , Germany and France , and returned to America , cured of whatever preference he might have entertained for the old world , and thoroughly American . The great events anJ personages of revolutionary France headed by their wonderful leader , the institutions and attractions of England , the classical scenes of Flanders , Switzerland , and the valley of the Rhine ; the placid despotism of Germany , and the fettered republicanism of Holland , were subjects of Mr. Ingersoll 's observation , and stored his mind with recollections for after-thought and ethical disquisition , of which a specimen has been lately published in the Democratic Revie*v , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1805 , he was appointed by Governor McKean to an inferior office , neither solicited nor expected : and thus began political association with what was then known as the Third Party , a section of the democratic , headed by McKean , Dallas , Jones , afterwards Secretary of the Navy , and other prominent republicans , which was eventually overcome and reinstated in the great democratic family of which Governor Snyder became the successful head . He likewise conferred on Mr. Ingersoll an office of some importance , which he did not long hold , without giving him the least notice or expectation of it . In 1808 , he published a pamphlet , entitled the Rights and Wrongs , Power and Policy of the United States of America , which was much circulated and applauded by the republican* , being an extensive defence of the commercial and maritime policy of Jefferson 's administration , founded on the positions taken by Madison 's resolutions of 1794 , to resist the aggression of the great European belligerents . This pamphlet was revised before publication by Charles Brockden Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Register , a retiring , but decided advocate of democratic principles . Several years before , Mr. Ingersoll had published a Tragedy , which was performed with some success ; as since he has submitted to the press a more elaborate dramatic poem which has never been brought upon the stage . In 1809 , Inchiquin , or the Jesuits ' Letters , from his pen , appeared , anonymously , and indeed clandestinely , ( as the object was to give the work // an European appearance , ) which was the first , most.decided , and successful vindication of the abused character , institutions , manners , politics , and literature of this country . It is difficult at present to appreciate the independence which such a work then required . The United States were yet British in almost every thing except government ; in which , too , the federal party desired them to remain , without a spark of American selfsufficiency . A declaration of literary , social , and moral independence , was almost as bold a stroke as the great declaration of political independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere political severance . Not only was every thing and almost every thought colonial , but a large party insisted that they ought to be . To deny this federal dogina ,  --  the idolatry of English every tl*ing ,  --  was heresy , causing , if not physical , at any rate , social and political dissolution in all the tortures of contumelious exclusion from respect . Mr. Ingersoll led a forlorn hope in the desperate encounter with this deep-rooted prejudice , but has lived to see it considerably dislodged , and completely rebuked . The poetry of Barlow , the history of Ramsey and Marshall , the eloquence of Congress , the superiority , not merely the equality , of the American character compared with that of Europe , . were the postulates of his task ; and its sensation was great throughout the whole country . It was no party appeal , or merely passionate , but an address , however fervent , to the reason and the realities of America , demonstrating that American mind and American matter of all kinds , under the vivifying influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent natural capabilities , are not and can not be inferior , but ought to be and must be superior , to those of an old world without the same advantages . In the Jesuits ' Letters , also , Jefferson* s aversion to the navy was combatted , and the preeminence of this now universally recognised right arm of American safeguard indicated and predicted . Mr. Ingersoll , by numerous publications since the Jesuits ' Letters ,  --  particularly a discourse before the American Philosophical Society , which has been reviewed in the Revue Encyclop*dique of France , and an Oration before the Society for commemorating the fourth of July , without distinction of party , which is quoted by Buiwer in his Rienzi ,  --  followed up the lessons of that first appeal of American patriotism by further views of a similar stamp , till there are now legions of converts from even those at first the most inexorable to his strains , ready to second them ; and American independence ig a moral as well as a political reality , even along the Atlantic sea-board , where every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subjugate us . While opposed to the code which excludes or retards the incorporation of European laborers with our o** , in a vast country so much in want of labor , deeming the whole system of naturalization laws injurious to American growth , and reckoning adult men and women among the most valuable of American importations , Mr. Ingersoll has always been the uncompromising antagonist of the travelling vagabonds who come among us , not to settle but revile . The battle with them is // nearly won . Still there are some , among whom he is one , who reckon Jefferson 's aversion to English ascendency in this hemisphere a cardinal point of American politics ; that society as well as government should be remodelled here ; and that whether by laws , arms , commerce , manufactures or currency , we never should suffer the Laocoon of British tastes , with giant arms , to hug the young America to death . In 1811 , Mr. Ingersoll was an unsuccessful cardidate on the democratic ticket , by regular party nomination , for election to the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same means triumphantly elected to Congress . His literary vindication of his country was such as has been sketched . We come now to the more serious undertaking , by the war of 1812 , of which he was not merely a zealous advocate but an ardent instigator-that war which in blood sealed the moral sovereignty , as the war of the revolution had the political independence , of the United States of America . In 1805 , our maritime troubles became intolerable ; and from that time till declared , war , as he thought , was only deferred by a series of merely palliative and procrastinating expedients . Still , in all Jefferson 's restrictive measures , preventive of hostilities , Mr. Ingersoll supported him , though without confidence in their result . It is an aphorism of Montesquieu , that " happy are the peopl&amp;whose annals are dull . " Yet war is an evil occasionally unavoidable and full of interest . Throughout all the preliminary warlike steps of Madison 's administration , Mr. Ingersoll was an active agent with the press , and in primary assemblies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before the Congressional declaration , when the Administration was thwarted by an adverse Senate , a doubtful I-louse of Representatives , and at least one lukewarm member of the cabinet itself ; a formidable opposition and a divided people , the very shout of the onset went up from a meeting of ten thousand democrats in the yard of Independence Hall , Philadelphia , where the resolutions and address moved and made by Mr. Ingersoll , were carried by *nthusiastic popular acclamation , and all government doubts silenced by such an outburst of the voice of the people for war . Never was war more just or necessary : but never was a nation worse prepared for war , beyond the mere good will of the democracy . It was declared , however , forthwith , and while the rankest of federal opposition denounced it as execrably unnatural , wanton , absurd and wicked , all who fought for it as murderers , and all who paid or loaned money for it as deserving its utter loss by confiscation , Charles J. Ingersoll was among the first to subscribe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was soon , by disaster and abuse , down more than thirty per cent . In May , 1813 , he took his seat in Congress at the special session , convened by the President , to lay taxes , raise armies , equip squadrons , and otherwise place the nation in the armour and attitude of hostilities so long waged against us , that we must sink in disgrace and weakness , as the President 's Message argued , unless we also took up arms to retort hostilities on our assailants . Mr. Ingersoll was one of the youngest // members of the war Congress ; and so juvenile in appearance that the doorkeeper refused him admission , when he went to take his seat . Appointed by Mr. Speaker Clay , ( for whose brilliant and commanding talents he entertained the highest admiration , ) chairman of the Committee on the Judiciarr , and also a member of the Committee of Foreign Relations , of which Mr. Calhoun was chairman , Mr. Ingersoll entered with alacrity upon : he duties of his place , and during the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoked by President Madison under the emerfencies and disasters of the war , he was always at his post , took an ac:ive part in almost every debate , and , as the Journals attest , voted for every measure necessary to sustain and abridge the war by vigorous prosecution . Though an adherent of the Adininistration , his first speech contained an attack on a member of it , suspected of overweening anxiety for pence by means which Mr. Ingersoll thought neither the most politic or dignified : and the final attachment of the Post Office Department , as now arranged , to the other dependencies of the Executive , instead of revolving in a sphere of its own , if not originating with , was accelerated by a movement of Mr. Ingersoll against the then Postmaster General , who was also suspected of disaffection to the war . All laws for increasing the army and navy , for first creating , and afterwards , when Secretary Dallas declared the abunpance of national resources , by the bankruptcy of the Treasury , for doubling them , for the conscription of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raising armies which Mr. Ingersoll pronounced much more republican and effective than voluntary enlistment , and finally for a bank of the United States , as recommended by President Madison and Secretary Dallas-in a word , whntever the country needed for the war , found in Mr. Ingersoll an unwavering and determined advocate , lie also took a leading part in obtaining public funds for the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal , as an indispensable natural highway ; for the purchase of Mr. Jefferson 's Library , and above all for securing a naval ascendency on the lakes . lie was the open advocate of carrying the war into Canada and not confining it to the ocean , which was one of the specious subterfuges of an unprincipled opposition , while he insisted that victories in Canada were the best means of peace . When Mr. Clay , in 1814 , was appointed one of the commissioners for negotiating peace , and Mr. Cheves was elected Speaker , by a union of the federal minority with a part of the democratic majority , Mr. Ingersoll was one of the fifty-seven Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the democratic administration paper , contains many of his speeches and motions , some of which are yet also extant in pamphlets . At the close of the session of 1813 , he addressed to the people of his district a long letter on the subject of French and British influence , at that time the great topic of party recrimination . One of the last of his speeches , in 1815 , was on seconding the resolution submitted by Governor Troup , of Georgia , for thanking General Jackson , and his brave army , for their // exploits at New Orleans , on which occasion , the war being then closed in a blaze of glory , Mr. Ingersoll gave vent to a hearty declamation of patriotic gratitude , which was republished with applause in England , as it has been often since in this country . He had taken an active part in removing from military command the antiquated generals at first appointed , and bringing forward their abler juniors , Brown , Scott , McComh , Jackson , Gaines , and others by whom victories were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of War , he was privy to the measures devised by him for imparting fresh vigor to it , in Canada , where it was intended to carry it with great force if it had continued another year . He was acquainted with General Jesup 's being stationed at Hartford , Connecticut , ostensibly recruiting , but really to suppress by force* if necessary , any attempt thereabouts to execute the treasonable designs of the Convention at that place . He was present when their emissaries came to Washington and appeared with some of the federal members in the lobby of the House of Representatives , on an errand which , but for their meeting the news of peace on their way , was undcrstood to be to demand that Madison should resign , and a federalist be made President in his place , on pain of the separation of New England from the Union . This , however odious , is wholesome reminiscence , which ought to be from time to time , like fi*st principles , recurred to . While too many of the educated and opulent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were leagued in factious opposition to a war , which now al regard as the great producer of American peace and prosperity , striving to disgrace its advocates , cripple its resources , and dishonor its heroes , Mr. Ingersoll was their enthusiastic and fearless champion ; instead of quailing at disasters , rising to a higher tone of energy , and encouraging the people of all parties to maintain the war as the only salvation of the country . The advantage which the opposition took of public calamities , particu - larly the capture and sack of Washington , to discredit the administration , lost him his re-election to Congress . But after this discomfiture , his term being as yet unexpired , he repaired to thi seat of government , at the special session of September , 1814 ; and in the midst of the smouldering ruins of the capitol , the autumnal diseases of a sickly season , and the confusion of undisciplined soldiery encamped about Washington , Congress , then sitting in the Post Office , ( since burnt and now rebuilding , ) the only public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was denounced by a numerous party as a shame and a folly to attempt to resist , Mr. Ingersoll took his seat with the Lowudes , the Macons , the Pleasants , the Eppes , and the many other now sainted representatives of an unterrified people , resolved with the yeomanry , the mariners and others , who had the good sense and the patriotism to endure to the end to rise or to fall with their country . The end has crowned the work . It was Mr. Ingersoll 's fate , like them at that time to be reviled and despised by malevolent , timid and merce // nary men . But it has been a consolation and a blessing to reflect , as it will be historical distinction , that in those disastrous days he never faltered . Dallas had been called to take his noble stand upon the ruins of the Treasury , in some degree on Mr. Ingersoll 's suggestion , who enjoyed that eminent statesman 's close intimacy while devising the financial plans which restored confidence and resources to the United States . His admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the war , but , having been published after peace took place , was necessarily ushered forth with less authentic and imposing effect than would otherwise have been the case . That ablest vindication that has ever appeared not only of that struggle , but of the whole policy of American government , was communicated ira manuscript to Mr. Ingersoll , with an intimation from Mr. Dallas , that he should propose Mr. I. to the President as Mr. Dallas 's successor in the District Attorneyship of Pennsylvania , to which he was accordingly appointed by President Madison , at the close of the war Congress . In that responsible office Mr. Ingersoll remained fourteen years successfully cultivating the arduous profession of which it was the aid , not interfering , but on the contrary harmonizing with an extensive and lucrative private practice , during the successive administrations of Presidents Madison , Monroe , and John * Adams , until displaced by President Jackson , in 1829 , at the instigation , as General Jackson has since explained , of an enemy of them both , then a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Mr. Ingersoll had always preserved a good uraderstandin.g ,  --  having much respect for his learning , probity , and patriotism ,  --  selected his most intimate friend , Mr. Rush , for Secretary of the Treasury , and re-appointed Mr. Ingersoll District Attorney , under circumstances exceedingly gratifying . Although , therefore , none more openly condemned the union of Mr. Adams with Mr. Clay , or questioned Mr. Adams 's claims to the Chief Magistracy , yet Mr. I. would not cast his vote against that gentleman in the contest between him and General Jackson . Nor would he vote against the hero of New Orleans . Upon these grounds he did not vote at all at that Presidential election . At the prior contest , when Messrs . Crawford , Adams , Jackson , and Clay , were candidates , Mr. Ingersoll warmly sided with Crawford , not only because he was the regular nominee of the Democratic party , but because Mr. Ingersoll knew him to be eminently qualified for its head , and for the Presidency . With the bulk of the Democracy which supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of whose public services and noble character he was among the most grateful admirers . On the occasion of the . controversy respecting his incursion into Florida , Mr. Ingersoll published , as early as July , 1818 , in the Philadelphia Democratic Press-then the leading journal of Pennsylvania-an argument which was the first vindication of the General on the grounds of international law , at the succeeding session of Congress , so ably urged by the Administration . Notwithstanding his removal from office by President Jackson , Mr. Ingersoll , far // from taking part with his enemies , seized the opportunity of a public dinner to Mr. Poinsett , to declare his cordial approval of the General 's personal conduct , as well as that of his administration ; and in all the banking and currency exigencies of the Jackson Administration , he was among its most thoroughgoing advocates . Shortly before General Jackson s retirement from the Presidency , he tendered through Mr. Secretary Forsyth , an old friend and college classmate of Mr. Ingersoll , an office more profitable and less laborious than that from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. I. not choosing that his support of the Jackson Administration should be subject to the slightest imputation . He moreover preferred popular to executive place , and , soon afier his removal from the District Attorneyship , accepted an unsought nomination of the Democrats of Philadelphia , for a seat in the State Legislature , to which he was elected by a considerable majority . In that capacity , constant opposition to all corporate , particularly banking priviLeges , and a steady advocacy of the main arteries of the vast system of territorial improvement designed to render Pennsylvania the heart of the American Union , were the outlines of his service as a member of the Legislature . At the Canal or Internal Improvement Convention , as it was called , which met at Harrisburg , in 1825 , to devise and originate this system , Mr. Ingersoll submitted a resolution for trying the then unknown merits of railroads with locomotive engines , just introduced in England . Mr. Ingersoll 's resolution for that purpose was seconded by Professor Vethake , who has lately published an excellent work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of transportation by which four thousand miles are now accomplished in America , was strenuously opposed by some leading men , and voted down by a large majority of the Convention as an impracticable scheme , attempting which would be disadvantageous to canals , which they insisted were the only means of locomotion , to which even the mighty rivers of this continent were to be mere tributaries . Mr. Ingersoll had been much connected with Oliver Evans , and familiarized by his confident predictions with the miracles of steam on land , long before they reached any degree of its now established superiority by steam carriages as well as steamboats . Two remarkable measures of Mr. Ingersoll in the Legislature of Pennsylvania deserve particular notice . One was a set of resolutions urging the Federal Government to extend and animate the commercial intercourse between the United States and France , by carrying into full effect the fine theory of Franklin 's treaty of Versailles , the first of American treaties , not only in date , but in principle  --  the great principle of national equality and commercial reciprocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one country to find free welcome in another . It is a favorite speculation of Mr. Ingersoll , that by such simple enactment of the unquestionable economy of free trade , the coal , cotton , tobacco , rice , . peltries , and other indigenous articles of all parts of this country , may be exchanged // for the wines and other products of France , to the great increase of French manufactures and wealth , and incalculable benefit of the United States , not only commercially but politically , rendering us less dependant than now on great Britain , and counteracting our natural British influences by profitable relations with France and other nations of Europe . Mr. Ingersoll 's other resolutions in the Legislature were those which , encountering great difficulty at first , finally prevailed ( as did those concerning France ) by large majorities , recommending to Congress a bank , and in fact the Bank of the United States . Taught by authority , for which he felt filial reverence , to doubt the constitutionality of a Na4ional Bank , but intimately associated with Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing that institution as the great security and remedy of the crisis , Mr. Ingersoll voted for it , as his speech published in Mr. Clarke 's historical account of the Banks of the United States shows , as a necessary evil , at a moment , when , as Monroe said , no American had a right to be tao strict in constitutional scruples , against irteasures deemed indispensable for the welfare , if not existence , of the country . " After the war w&amp;ll think of constitutional points , " was a saying of Monroe . The great convenience of the Bank as a public agent , having induced every Secretary of the Treasury and every President , including General Jackson , to bear testimony to its public usefulness . Mr. Ingersoll was one of the many members of the democratic party with Madison , Monroe , Crawford , and others of indubitable rectitude and authority , who thought it best to preserve it . The published letters of Madison and Crawford , in vindication of the Bank , were addressed to Mr. Ingersoll , whose endeavors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1816 , a democratic measure . Posterior to the f deral constitution , and unforeseen by , if not violative of it , several hundred State banks had sprung up , which rendered , as was thought , a National Bank to regulate them , at least a necessary evil , if not a positive good . Mr. Ingersoll therefore proposed its advocacy to the constituted authorities of Pennsylvania , and , althoegh at first his motion miscarried , it was eventually adopted , with modifications , arid became , for several successive sessions of the Legislature of that State , the rubric of similar resolutions i*ecommending the Bank to Congress , where the Pennsylvania delegation in both houses were nearly unanimous in its favor . This biographical sketch is not the place for a full elucidation of the reasons who , i those who were the best friends of that institution were found by its misconduct to become its uncompromisiag opponents . President Jackson 's veto acknowledged that he might have been induced to affix his signature to a proper bank bill . His chief and most confidential Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign a bill if duly guarded and not forced upon him out of time , and in a menacing manner . But when a mere corporation was arrogantly , madly raised into another estate of the realm to control all the rest , and by a career of infatuated misdirection verified every prediction of its constitutional enemies , they // who made the greatest sacrifices to uphold it were driven from its side , and constrained to abandon it to its fate . Leaving out of view the charge of corruption , Mr. Ingersoll deemed its faults as blameable as even crime , and was one of the foremost to induce the democratic party of Pennsylvania , whom he largely contributed to enlist in its behalf when many of its leaders were fearful and wavering , to sustain the President and check the Bank in its war on the Government . In all the contest between the Bank and the federal administration , which it audaciously strove to put down , it is well known that he was the constant supporter of the Government , always confidently predicting that universal suffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong in the days of the Bank reign of terror , when it was often said that its few opponents dare not hold up their heads in Philadelphia , yet Charles J. Ingersoll 's pen and speech were fearlessly devoted to its resistance , without individual recrimination , at every peril of personal , social , professional , and political indignity and privation . It is a fact too true , though almost incredible , that when one of its immense meetings , said to be fifty thousand strong , after transacting their business in the square of Independence , marched with banners streaming in thick array along the street , they first cheered the residence of Mr. Duane , Ex-Secretary of the Treasury , and then , as they filed by Mr. Ingersoll 's house , who was sitting with ladies at the window , to look at the multitudes , insulted him by groans and hisses . And when he proposed a gentleman for membership at the American Philosophical Society , ( who had been admitted long before , but owing to absence was inadvertently overlooked , ) his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an efficient part in sustaining the Administration against a corporate body which attempted to rule society , the Governmen , and the people . These , like the before-mentioned recollections of the Hartford Convention , are profitable memorials of the times . During the war with England . as in that with banks , Mr. Ingersoll , besides the vituperation of the press , was subjected to much of this kind of personal detraction , which he not only bore with equal equanimity , but indeed mentioned as a title to consideration . In his speech on currency in the reform Convention of Pennsylvania , surrounded by a brilliant audience of Philadelphia , nine-tenths of them adherents of the banks , he spoke of the wounds which calumny inflicts as not only harmless , but titles and trophies of those who are thus recommended to ultimate respect . Among the other incidental stimulants of the war to American development , was its great encouragement to manufactures , so as with its termination to leave a strong feeling for their durable establishment as one of the best foundations of general welfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of encouraging domestic industry , whether by tariff laws or by free trade , a very large majority of wellinformed Americans think that , however encouraged , it ought to be so by whatever may be the proper economy . // In the severe conflict that ensued from 1816 to 1830 , Mr. Ingersoll was a zealous and disinterested promoter of national encouragement to manufactures ; holding that without them a nation can not be independent , or rich , or prepared for wa*r ; and that least of all others could this infant country prosper without counteracting the selfish contrivances of foreign nations by acts of its own . Convinced of the constitutional power , and the obvious policy of fostering manufactures as well as navigation , he actively engaged in various public proceedings , by primary assemblies and more formal conventions , to enlighten the public mind and bring about suitable acts of Congress for this purpose . Always maintaining that freedom is the only basis and spring of this national resource , he nevertheless contended that mere free trade , like free banking , is incompatible with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental action is the happy mean between impracticable and intolerable extremes . Professor List , a German jurisconsult , expelled from Bavaria for his liberal sentiments , and introduced here by La Fayette , addressed to Mr. Ingersoll a series of very able views of this subject in the National Gazette . The address of the Harrisburg State Convention of 1827 , anl most of that of fthe New York National Convention of 1829 , were written by Mr. Ingersoll , who still , we believe , uses American manufactures , and abides by his original opinions concerning them ; but having no personal or lucrative end in view , he steadfastly at all times refused to make this a party question ; and it is said that his peremptory resistance to such attempts in the Conventions stifled them in the overture , and thereby prevented mistaken partisans from destroying their own work . At the New York Convention , Mr. Ingersoll instnntly encountered and dispelled such a movement made by a member of the Hartford Convention . Interference of masters with the votes of workmen , incorporated factories , extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sectional , party , or selfish contamination of what he has promoted as only a great national interest , have met his prompt and positive opposition at all times : and when the Union was brought to jeopardy by the struggle for manufactures , he was for preserving it at some industrial cost . In fact , he has always deemed encouragement a temporary policy-assistance to beginners , to those too weak to stand alone , but not to be upheld when , by proper superintendenceat the outset , they are enabled to take care of themselves . In this spirithe urged at the New York Convention that the duties on coarse cottons should be withdrawn entirely . In his discourse before the New York Institute in 1835 , these views were inculcated : that liberty , union , labor , and ( as his speeches since have frequently added ) gold and silver money , are the most effectual protection of that wonder-working mine of wealth-domestic productions , without which mere tariffs are but vexatious fetters . Cotton , in particular , he has always regarded , like steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the northern and middle States make up // 351 more of southern cotton than any foreign nation , except Great Britain , it is of vital importance to encourage , extend and perpetuate this reciprocity of the States . In his discourse before the New York Institute , the ? hilosophy , social and political , of this immense staple , is explained as follows : " Nearly simultaneous with the Navigation Act , cotton sprang unexpectedly from the mother earth of this country , to become a miracle of agriculture , of commerce , of navigation , and of manufactures . Its increase is more incredible than the fabulous story of the armed men , who are said to have started from the soil of Greece , or the armed hero leaping into the gulf of Rome . Four hundred millions of pounds is the annual crop of a small part of the American soil , rather more than one-half of which is wrought by the artisans of England , with a profit that is the root of British power , and must in time become the greatest power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided between the manufactures of France and our own . Cotton fabrications now more than treble those of iron , and , in combination with steam , have changed the whole face of civilization . A seed , fertilized by the waters of freedom , though cultivated by the hand of slavery , has rendered the English race on both sides of the Atlantic the workmen of the world . Almost superseding linen , eclipsing silk , and vying with wool , cotton is the cheapest , finest , warmest , cleanest , strongest , most beautiful lastino- and wholesome  --  the safest and best , material for cloth ing , bedling , many parts of furniture , and , it is believed , the canvass of shippin* . If all Christendom were clothed in cotton , or even cotton mixed with woollen , as it is admirably manufactured in this country , the economy of cost would equal the whole expenditure of many nations , maintaining large standing armies . If iron is the basis of boasted British superiority , it may be affirmed of cotton , that it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , but that it is an element of American sovereignty and universal equality . While ever silk , velvet , and fine linen , were the dress of upper classes , they were distinguished from common people as much by garb as by rank . It was impossible for the poor to look like the rich , who in costume were their betters . But cotton has levelled this distinction , and destroyed inequality in the appearance of the different classes more effectually than American legislation , or even the French revolution . All classes now look alike in an article of universal habiliment , which the poor can always get , and the rich can not dispense with . If equality be essential to the perfection of liberty , cotton , sprung from that part of this country where the utmost inequality prevails , superadds equality to the liberty which it has been attempted to be shown came into being with the discovery of America . ' The Reform Convention of Pennsylvania , which sat at Harrisburg in 1837 , and at Philadelphia in 1888 , was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trying both the sincerity and the moderation of his politics . Accordingly , while no member of that assenbly // 352 Political Portralts. - No . XVI . was more radical , yet none evinced a stronger attachment to ackno*v* ledged principles of public authority and private property . His reforms* appear to have been restorations of establishments unduly supplanted by later alterations , but never destructive of any ascertained benefit . Attributing American progress rather to liberty than government , his plan was to infuse as much liberty into every vein of government as its vital ity , from experience , will bear , to make the experiment of self-govern ment whenever it can be safely done , and , instead of merely proclaiming the sovereignty of the people , to carry it into actual operation . While wonderful progress has been made within the last few - years in every thing else , why should government remain almost stationary ? Convinced that the second Constitution of pennsylvania bad improved less than generally supposed on the more democratic first , of which Franklin was the chief architect , Mr. Ingersoll held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just and durable institutions , in after times , had been erroneously departed from , and which ought to be reinstated . Most men are inclined to let what they consider well enough alone . But from the second constitution of that State in 1790 , there was a large number of the people constantly requiring more Democracy in some of its provisions . Mr. Ingersoll , long apprehending the danger of change , was finally brought to the conclusion that the right of suffrage might safely be extended , the judiciary rendered more responsible without impairing its independence , the Executive advantageously stripped of enormous patronage , which degraded it into mere agency for faction , incessantly stimulated , the legislature restrained in its alarming proneness to excesses , and the constitution itself rendered capable of occasional alterations , without a civil revolution , so as to keep pace with the progress of the age and the wants of a prudent people , neither studious of change nor fond of novelty . The modern science of political economy , with its great discoveries , is of itself enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of those who think that when steam has within a short time past removed Europe from its old place to within two weeks of America* it is impossible for America to stand still without retrograding and falling behind Europe . With these impressions he took his seat in the Convention , in which it so happened , by unlookecl-for conjunctures , that there was a large party more anxious to maintain themselves in possession of the Slate government , and to get possession of that of the Union , than to reform the Constitution ; and not a few bent on converting a convention for constitutional reform into a cabal for mere party purposes . The history of the proceedings of that Convention being published in no less than fourteen volumes of journals and debates , even a brief view of the doings of one of its members can not be extracted from such voluminous materials , without omitting much of them : wherefore this sketch will but cursorily allude to a few of the most important measures in which Mr. Ingersoll took a prominent part . The Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which cast Mr. Ingersoll into the minority , he was not placed at the head of any standing committee , and experienced great difficulties in raising one specially on currency and corporations , of which , though he was made chairman , care was taken that there should he a m*jority opposed to his views . Notwithstanding these obstacles , he produced a report , which , though denounced , and denied publication by the Convention , was warmly welcomed by the community , and rapidly published , or noticed in most of the newspapers of the United States . An excellent judge declared that almost every line of it contains an axiom , and its doctrines have been generally sanctioned . On the kindred subject of legislative control over hank charters as public acts , and not private contracts , Mr. Ingersoll , at the second session of the Convention , submitted an elaborate argument , ( published in the thirteenth number of the Democratic Review , ) which doctrine has since been adopted by the legislatures of the States of Ohio and New Hampshire , and seems to bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also addressed the Convention on the subject of finance and the constitutional treasury , and in an arduous midnight session succeeded , with the rest of the democratic members , joined by a few of their opponents , in imposing some c onstitutional restrictions on the legislative power to charter banks and other corporations . Mr. Ingersoll 's speeches on the judiciary and on slavery , as delivered in that Convention , have been extensively laid before the public in pamphlets and newspapers . In a letter written at Harrisburg during the first session of the Convention , and addressed to the people of the third Congressional district of Pennsylvania , in June , 1837 , thus by some months anticipating President Van Buren 's message at the special session of Congress , of September of that year , Mr. Ingersoll suggested a return to the treasury and the money of the federal constitution as the best close of the unfortunate banking and fiscal experiments , which since bank notes were by treasury order first alloxved to be paid for public dues , together with national and State banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property , and unsettled the values , of the United States . His many speeches , letters , and other public appeals , since then , to the same effect , make it unnecessary to dwell on his connection with that reform , of which he has uniformly been a warm supporter , under circumstances which seemed , not long ago , to doom all its supporters to political downfall . Besides the political productions before-mentioned , Mr. Ingersoll has published at various times , a View of River Rights , a View of the Committee powers of Congress , together with various other tracts and reviews ; among the rest , a Defence of the principle that free ships malre free goods , published in Hall 's Law Journal . Avoiding details , and with few comments , this sketch of his public life is a mere narrative or statement of public transactions . It is not thought proper , therefore , to notice in it and portion of his professional life , omitting even those arguments on questions of constitutional , na* // tional , and other higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the volumes of reports , down to his argument last winter in the Supreme Court of the United States , on the right of corporations to act in a corporate capacity out of the States incorporating them . Twice chosen , as we sincerely believe-once at a special election in 1837 , and again at a general election in 1838  --  to represent the northern parts of the county of Philadelphia in Congress , his will probably be one of the remarkable cases of contested elections , to be judged by the approaching House of Representatives , whose determination , it is to be hoped , will display that rectitude which ought to distinguish every judgment of that high court involving so important an element of freedom as the elective franchise . Since the last election , in the fall of 1838-when a majority of the judges gave Mr. Ingersoll the certificate of election over his competitor , Mr. Naylor , by rejecting , as vitiated by fraud or irregularity , the returns from a portion of the district which had cast a heavy Whig vote-some of Mr. Ingersoll 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking a seat thus given by a doubtful proceeding , at a time of high and not over scrupulous party excitement , in the face of a considerable apparent majority in favor of his antagonist . But Mr. Ingersoll , in common with all the Democratic party of his district , has throughout entertained a most profound conviction that he had been twice defrauded of his election fairly won by the majority of the popular suffrage ; and he has determined to maintain bis claim to the seat , in the confidence of being able to overthrow , before any impartial tribunal , the fairness of the apparent popular majority exhibited by bis opponent . At the recent election-which , *under the operation of the election law passed by the Legislature at its last session , precluded the possibility , on either side , of any such fraudulent proceedings as were charged by the Democrats to have been committed by their opponents on the two preceding occasions  --  the Democratic party succeeded in Mr. Ingersoll 's district by an overwhelming majority . The bearing of this fact upon the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increases the responsibility incumbent upon Mr. Ingersoll , as a duty alike to his party and himself to insist upon either his absolute right to the contested seat , or at least a reference of the question back to the people themselves by a new election-upon the issue of which there can scarcely be any doubt.
