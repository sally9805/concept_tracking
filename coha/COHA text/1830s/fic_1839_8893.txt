SCENE I. Before the Castle of De Lerma  --  Time , sunset . ( Enter Velasco in the full costume of a knight of the eleventh century , followed by Alfonzo , his squire . ) VELASCO . Velasco Home ! home , at last , Alfonzo ! There they shine , The old ancestral bulwarks , in the rays Of the declining sun ! A year has passed Since last I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as when a careless child I play 'd Beneath their mighty shadows . How each nook Prates of the olden time ! The very air Is fragrant as the breath of infancy ! Old towers ! I bring you no unworthy inmate , No spotted scutcheon , no inglorious name ! Alfonzo ! By the calendar , what day ? Is it not Santiago 's ? ALFONZO . Alfonzo Ay , my lord . VELASCO . Velasco This day completes my term of banishment . ALFONZO . Alfonzo Banishment ? VELASCO . Velasco Hast thou never yet divined The motive which has kept my vizor closed Now a long twelvemonth to all human eyes , Save thine alone ? that , after victory , The king himself has sued to me in vain T ' unbar the iron mask that hid my features ? Had I complied , and he redeem 'd his oath , My instant death had followed the disclosure . ALFONZO . Alfonzo My lord ! The cause did not affect thy honour ? VELASCO . Velasco Ask'st thou ? The cause was trivial ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanced : The Count Gonzalez and his majesty Were altercating in the hall of council ; As I approach 'd , the king upraised his arm To strike th ' impetuous peer ; I interposed , Perhaps ungently in a monarch 's quarrel , And turn 'd the royal anger on myself . He banish 'd me the kingdom for a year  --  The penalty being death , if , in that time , Castile saw my return . This night completes My banishment  --  unveils my countenance To king and father . They will start , Alfonzo , In the mask 'd cavalier , the sable knight , Or whatsoever name they choose to give me , To find Velasco ! ALFONZO . Alfonzo Whose renown shall be  --  VELASCO . Velasco Spare me thy herald 's bombast . I would see My father  --  yet , I dally with the joy , Now it is in my reach . To-night , the king , In honour of the unknown cavalier Who fought beneath his banner ; whose return Is promised on th ' occasion , gives a banquet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One blast to call the warder ! Quick ! Alfonzo . Alfonzo sounds a bugle . ALFONZO . Alfonzo Dost thou not close thy vizor . VELASCO . Velasco ( closing his vizor . ) Well bethought . I wonder if old Nuno yet is warder :  --  Far back as memory goes  --  ( Enter Nuno . ) ALFONZO . Alfonzo My lord , behold ! VELASCO . Velasco Nuno ! ALFONZO . Alfonzo Would you betray yourself ? VELASCO . Velasco Not yet . NUNO . Nuno Who calls ? VELASCO . Velasco Is Count De Lerma in his hall ? NUNO . Nuno Who may it be that asks ? VELASCO . Velasco A Christian Knight . No farther title will thy master need . NUNO . Nuno Thou'rt right in that . But he is not within  --  Gone with the rest of Burgos to the palace , Where the king banquets the mask 'd cavalier . Sir knight ! thou'rt mask 'd ! VELASCO . Velasco I shall continue so . Know'st thou , old man , aught of the son , Velasco ? NUNO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't recall it . VELASCO . Velasco Sorry ? what mean you ? NUNO . Nuno He , sir  --  poor Velasco  --  When last we heard of him , had join 'd the Moors ; Turn 'd infidel , and fought against Castile . VELASCO . Velasco Nuno ! ' t is false . Turn infidel ! He 'd sooner Die by the torture . Pray you , pardon me . That is the rumour ,  --  that he join 'd the Moors ? NUNO . Nuno Ay , sir : it makes my master wondrous sad . But why art thou so moved ? VELASCO . Velasco I knew Velasco . Farewell . I 'll seek thy master at the palace . Exit . NUNO . Nuno A single word with you , sir  --  who 's your master ? ALFONZO . Alfonzo You 'll be surprised to learn . NUNO . Nuno I am all ears . ALFONZO . Alfonzo Then , by thine own admission , thou'rt an ass . NUNO . Nuno Thou'rt keen , sir varlet : from Toledo , eh ? ALFONZO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! then your master is  --  ALFONZO . Alfonzo Precisely . NUNO . Nuno Yes ; I thought so . ALFONZO . Alfonzo You have hit it . NUNO . Nuno Now , to surprise me with his name  --  ALFONZO . Alfonzo His name ! You 'll be discreet ? NUNO . Nuno Oh ! trust me . Who 's your master ? ALFONZO . Alfonzo ( hesitating . ) I shall not tell you . Exit . NUNO . Nuno What a close-lipp 'd rogue ! Just as my ear was ready for the secret , To draw it back ! I 've surely heard that voice  --  But where , or when ? to whom may it belong ? Well , well ; I will not puzzle my old brains . Exit . SCENE II . An ante-room in the Royal Palace . ( Enter Favillo and a Knight . ) KNIGHT . Knight Do the guests yet assemble ? FAVILLO . Favillo Ay , pass on , sir . They fill the vestibule . KNIGHT . Knight The vizor 'd knight  --  Is he arrived ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his approach . KNIGHT . Knight And know you not , Favillo , Whose face that vizor hides ? FAVILLO . Favillo No more than thou . But that he is the bravest in Castile I can attest . Twice in the last campaign . He saved our sovereign 's life  --  twice madly brave , Did he roll back the crimson tide of war Upon our foes , doing such deeds of wonder , Our troops regarded him as more than human , And raised the battle-shout of Santiago . But , look , more guests arrive . KNIGHT . Knight Farewell , Favillo . Exit . ( Enter De Lerma . ) FAVILLO . Favillo Welcome , De Lerma . I had fear 'd thy absence . ' T is the first time since thy son 's  --  Pardon me ; I did not mean rudely to touch that chord . DE LERMA . De Lerma A transitory pang ! I come to see This knight , whose fame has pierced my solitude . Alas ! Favillo , such a champion I fondly hoped , one day to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Enter Gonzalez , hastily . ) FAVILLO . Favillo Gonzalez , welcome ! May I speak with you ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez When you are not attended as at present . Exit . FAVILLO . Favillo The feud between you still is warm , my lord ? DE LERMA . De Lerma His anger I regard not . But more guests Claim your attention . I will to the king . Exit . ( Enter Hernando , Mendoza , and Carlos . ) FAVILLO . Favillo On to the presence , gentlemen ! Hernando , Your bride that is to be , fair Izidora , Will grace our fte ? Why comes she not with you ? CARLOS . Carlos She better likes her brother 's company . MENDOZA . Mendoza Peace , boy ! Who question 'd you ? CARLOS . Carlos I like that . Boy ! HERNANDO . Hernando In sooth , Favillo , Izidora chose Th ' attendance of her brother . FAVILLO . Favillo Is't not strange ? MENDOZA . Mendoza ' T was maiden delicacy  --  that was all . CARLOS . Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were betroth 'd . HERNANDO . Hernando True ; by our fathers , at an early age . FAVILLO . Favillo And she consents ? HERNANDO . Hernando The bridal day is fix 'd . CARLOS . Carlos Consents , my lord ? How could you ask the question ? She saw him , sir . Consent was then no virtue . MENDOZA . Mendoza Chatterling ! Hush ! CARLOS . Carlos Look you ! I wear a sword . Exit . FAVILLO . Favillo A forward boy !  --  I envy you your lot , sir : The Lady Izidora is most fair . MENDOZA . Mendoza Shall we attend the king ? HERNANDO . Hernando Come on , Mendoza . Exeunt . FAVILLO . Favillo Now , were I only younger by a score Or two of years , that laggard should not win So fair and rich a prize as Izidora . And she forsakes the lover for the brother ! Strange wooing this ! ( Enter two Ladies . ) Ladies , your servant ever . Shall I be your conductor ? Offering his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECOND LADY . Second Lady Wears he his vizor yet ? FIRST LADY . First Lady What is he like ? SECOND LADY . Second Lady Complexion light or dark ? What colour 'd hair ? FIRST LADY . First Lady Is he not handsome ? SECOND LADY . Second Lady Tell us , are his eyes The true Castilian brown ? FIRST LADY . First Lady What sort of features ? Exeunt omnes , talking incessantly . ( Enter Julio and Izidora . ) JULIO . Julio Now , by the faith of knighthood , sister mine , This unknown and redoubted cavalier With the barr 'd vizor , seems to have usurp 'd The empire of thy fancy and thy heart . IZIDORA . Izidora Alas ! a wider empire should be his . He must be youthful , Julio , handsome , noble ? Why does he hide his face behind a vizor ? JULIO . Julio Oh ! how a little mystery will pique Thy sex 's wonder and let loose surmise . In sterling prose , he hides his face , most like , To hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They say , and I believe , that he has made An oath to mask his face from human eyes , Till he shall find the lady of his heart . JULIO . Julio Nay ; he has proved himself no carpet knight . IZIDORA . Izidora No carpet knight indeed ! It must have been A brave scene  --  his first entrance to the field ! Our routed troops were flying in dismay Before the turban 'd Moors , when from the gloom Of a green thicket rush 'd a mounted knight ! His charger , white as snow  --  his battle-axe Poised in his right hand , while his left uprear 'd The Christian ensign blazoning the cross ! And , as he spurr 'd his steed , he cried aloud : " Castile and Freedom ! " Then arose the shout From the awed soldiers , check 'd in their retreat : " A miracle ! a messenger from Heaven Fights with us ! To the charge ! a Santiago ! " One thrill of inspiration heaved their hearts . They follow 'd him through seas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mask 'd cavalier Had fought the battle and redeem 'd the field !  --  Nay , do not laugh at me . JULIO . Julio He will not need A herald 's clamorous voice to sound his praises , Nor the soft numbers of a troubadour , While thou shalt live to be his chronicler ! I should be jealous now , were I Hernando . So scornful at the mention of his name ! Thou lov'st thy kinsman ? IZIDORA . Izidora Tell me what love is ; And , in all candour , I will answer thee . JULIO . Julio A cloud steep 'd in the sunshine ! An illusion , On which concentrate Passion 's fiercest rays ! Your Lover 's little better than a Pagan : On the heart 's shrine he rears a human idol ; Imagination heightens every charm , Brings down celestial attributes to clothe it , And dupes the willing soul , until , at length , He kneels unto a creature of the brain  --  A bright abstraction ! But the cynic , Time , Who holds the touchstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigious folly ! Say ; art thou one of these idolaters ? IZIDORA . Izidora ' T is very plain to me , I never loved ; And least of all , Hernando . Trust me , Julio , I ne'er shall be the Pagan you describe If I depend on him for my conversion . JULIO . Julio ' T were best , perhaps !  --  But didst thou never love ? Is there no flaw , no dent upon thy heart ? Did ne'er a random arrow even graze it ? IZIDORA . Izidora Dost thou remember in our childhood , Julio , A dark-hair 'd boy  --  the foremost in our sports  --  De Lerma 's son  --  what was his name ? JULIO . Julio Velasco . IZIDORA . Izidora Velasco . When the feud between our fathers Disparted us , we lost a welcome playmate . For years we did not meet . When last I saw him , ' T was as he went forth to his banishment ; And mail 'd in armour , he was on his steed . He saw me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his saddle-bows , rode on :  --  I watch 'd him till my eyes were dim with tears ! JULIO . Julio Prithee , what inference wouldst have me draw From this pathetic story ? IZIDORA . Izidora Inference ? Nothing  --  it cross 'd my mind  --  I know not why  --  It is a pity he has join 'd the Moors . JULIO . Julio Oh ! thou capricious ! But a moment since , The vizor 'd knight claim 'd all thy Fancy 's dreams , And now  --  IZIDORA . Izidora Ah ! ' t is a noble champion ! I have not waver 'd in my admiration . Happy the fair dame , at whose feet he kneels ! ( Carlos enters , and is crossing the stage . ) JULIO . Julio Carlos ! Boy ! Page ! IZIDORA . Izidora Don Carlos ! CARLOS . Carlos ( turning abruptly . ) That 's my name . Lady , I shall be honour 'd in your service . IZIDORA . Izidora Is he arrived  --  the cavalier ? CARLOS . Carlos ( with dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They think of nothing but the cavalier , And will not waste a single smile on me . The cavalier ! Ha , ha ! a man ashamed To show his face  --  I 'm not afraid of him . Exit . JULIO . Julio Shall we not in , to see the festal show ? IZIDORA . Izidora He is not there ! Why should we be in haste ? A trumpet sounds sharply . He comes ! he comes ! It was his trumpet peal ! JULIO . Julio How know you it for his ? IZIDORA . Izidora It was a note So clear and bold ! JULIO . Julio Why , how thy heart is beating . Come ! we 'll not lose the pageant of his entry . Exeunt . SCENE III . A Hall of State . The King on his throne , surrounded by his Court , among whom are De Lerma , Gonzalez , Hernando , Favillo , Ladies , &c.; Julio and Izidora enter and mingle with the groups . A flourish as the scene opens . FERDINAND . Ferdinand ( Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How on our army broke that trumpet voice , When he rose up before our flying hosts , And cried " a rescue ! " Trumpet from without sounds twice . FAVILLO . Favillo He is here , my liege . ( Enter with vizor closed , Velasco . He kneels to the King . ) FERDINAND . Ferdinand Rise up , sir knight  --  no vassal , but our friend . VELASCO . Velasco ( rising . ) My gracious sovereign ! FERDINAND . Ferdinand Nobles of Castile ! It needs no commendation of our own To gild his fame , or to confirm his welcome ; We hail him as his country 's well-tried soldier , And her just pride . VELASCO . Velasco Could I believe , my liege , Your praises were not the unbidden impulse Of a too partial kindness , I should be Elated on the wings of conscious glory ; But the poor bark freighted with my deserts , Too light a ballast has , to carry sail Before the fameward breath of your applause . ( Enter Carlos . ) CARLOS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Claims instant access . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Let him be admitted . ( Enter a Messenger in the livery of the Pope . He delivers papers , which the King peruses . Velasco goes toward De Lerma , but abruptly checks himself , and bows profoundly . ) DE LERMA . De Lerma Sir knight , you leave no vantage-ground for envy , If with so meek a grace you wear you laurels . FERDINAND . Ferdinand ( rising in great agitation . ) No , no ! it shall not be ! the Pope once more Urges upon us his presumptuous mandate , That we shall bow the neck to Germany , And hold our crown as Henry 's willing vassal . We 'll send our answer back . Exit Messenger . Affairs of moment Claim the immediate hearing of our council . Pardon us for a while , sir knight . My lords ! On to the hall of council ! Exit Ferdinand , followed by De Lerma , Gonzalez , Julio , and lords . Izidora goes up the stage followed by Hernando . The groups gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I err not , It is the daughter of the Count Gonzalez ? FAVILLO . Favillo You 're right , sir . One would note her ' mong a thousand . VELASCO . Velasco She 's passing fair . FAVILLO . Favillo Look you , she turns away , As conscious of our notice . ' T is a pity She weds that recreant kinsman by her side . VELASCO . Velasco Weds him ? Hernando ? Can she love him , sir ? FAVILLO . Favillo Love him ? She 's been instructed to regard him As her intended lord , but as for love  --  VELASCO . Velasco A cruel fate ! They come this way again . Now could you help me to an audience  --  FAVILLO . Favillo If there be any virtue in my wand , Thy wish shall be complied with . Don Hernando , Touching the subject of our late discourse  --  Exit , leading him . VELASCO . Velasco Fair Izidora , might I claim from thee A moment 's converse , it would be more prized Than all the honours Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight ; we knew of thy transcendent valour : We did not know thy gallantry kept pace , In its excess , with thy superior virtue . VELASCO . Velasco Gallantry , lady ? ' T is too cold a word . Devotion is a better , where thou art . IZIDORA . Izidora Nay , tell me of thy battles and thy perils . Dost thou not sigh already for the gleam Of hostile steel  --  the neigh of pawing chargers  --  The cymbal 's clash , the trumpet 's thrilling shriek ? VELASCO . Velasco I have encounter 'd perils ere to-day , But never one so imminent as that Which bids me now surrender . I have seen The Moorish army in their bright array , Send back the sun-shafts brighter than they fell : But not the sheen of all their scimetars , In one small point concentred , could eclipse A single ray shot from those lustrous eyes . Nay , turn not from me , lady . I have heard The neigh of steeds  --  the trumpet 's thrilling note  --  They can not stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is't not the common rhetoric of the court That thou hast cull 'd for me ? Think'st I believe I am the first to whom it has been offered ? VELASCO . Velasco Ah , lady ! poorly can the heart disguise , In flippant Fancy 's garniture of words , Its true emotion . Love 's a sorry masker . IZIDORA . Izidora ' Then Love bears no similitude to thee . ' T was of the wars we spake . VELASCO . Velasco Enough of them . Oh ! ne'er did mariner long toss 'd at sea , With no benignant star to point his course , Hail with more rapture the first gleam of land , Than I from War 's seam 'd visage and wild glance , Turn to the blue eyes of maternal peace ! Oh ! not the joyous shout of victory Was e'er to me so grateful as the sight , Which the declining sun this day revealed . IZIDORA . Izidora What sight ? VELASCO . Velasco My boyhood 's fair and happy home ! The past again was mine ; and memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish beauty so enthrall 'd my heart ! IZIDORA . Izidora Of her ? Of whom ? VELASCO . Velasco Alas ! I must forget . But thou shalt hear my story : we were playmates In the confiding hours of early youth . I was the mimic champion of her wrongs , And with my shield and lance I rescued her From many a fabled giant . Ah ! those days ! At length a feud broke out between our fathers ; And we were parted  --  but I kept the faith , Which in my boyish earnestness I swore : She was my paragon , my dream of joy ! Years past . I went forth to my country 's wars , Dreaming of fame , but as a galliard 's wreath , To grace me in her eyes . When I return 'd She  --  false one !  --  was betroth 'd unto another ! IZIDORA . Izidora Velasco ! VELASCO . Velasco Hush ! Betray me not . The king ! They retire up the stage , conversing .

Ferdinand Julio ! with all despatch thou wilt prepare To be our envoy to the court of Rome . Exit Julio . Sir knight , we 've cut the Gordian knot of counsel To play the host to thee . Hast thou no boon To crave , within our royal power to grant ? Unless thou proudly wouldst refuse to cancel A portion of the countless debt we owe thee . Give us the clew whereby our gratitude May lead unto the dear wish of thy heart . VELASCO . Velasco Behold it here , my liege ! Pointing to Izidora . Could thy decree Make this fair hand mine own , I should be blest Beyond requital in a gift so rich . FERDINAND . Ferdinand A gallant boon ! We 'll be thine intercessor . Gonzalez , speak ! thou wilt not thwart our wish ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez The Lady Izidora is affianced Already to her kinsman , Don Hernando . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Wouldst thou constrain her choice ? and , Don Hernando , Wouldst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Gonzalez , listen to us : We will not speak of favours shower 'd upon thee , Of injuries forgiven : but , in justice , Say , dost thou leave thy daughter free to choose ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez My liege , I do . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Bear witness to it , all ! Now Izidora , use thy privilege : Choose as thy heart may dictate . She gives her hand to Velasco . It is well ! VELASCO . Velasco My liege , thou hast endear 'd me to thee ever ; Now that the occasion for disguise is past , I will repay thy courtesy . Advances and uncloses his vizor . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Velasco ! DE LERMA . De Lerma My son ! GONZALEZ . Gonzalez ( Aside . ) The heir of my detested foe ! It is unnatural ! It must not be ! FERDINAND . Ferdinand Velasco ! thou art welcome  --  this surprise Has pluck 'd away the only sharp regret That rankled in our breast . Let music hail The lost one found , the banish 'd one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will we pledge Joy to this fair alliance ! May the stars Shed their auspicious influence upon it ! A flourish .

( Enter Favillo and Carlos . ) FAVILLO . Favillo Cease flouting , boy ; ' t is not for thee to laugh  --  And yet , I know not why thou shouldst be stinted . ' T was a most rare , unlook 'd for counterplot . Ha , ha ! poor Don Hernando ! CARLOS . Carlos Santiago ! Were I so ousted from my lady 's favour , Though by the fiercest knight in Christendom , I 'd brain him  --  ' Sdeath ! I 'd teach him the passado . ( Laughing ) Look there ! he comes  --  the flower of chivalry ! Hernando , with the man that 's not his father . FAVILLO . Favillo Be quiet , Carlos . Show some reverence .

Carlos So soon ! ah ! happy bridegroom ! beauteous bride ! FAVILLO . Favillo My lord , I give you joy of the alliance , Walk you in the direction of the palace ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez The opposite , Favillo . FAVILLO . Favillo Fare you well . ( Carlos is about to say something to Hernando . Favillo draws him away and exit with him . ) GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Hernando , thou hast set me an example Of meek forbearance , I should strive to follow : Like thee , I 'll make a virtue of compulsion . HERNANDO . Hernando It is the part of wisdom .

Hernando Revenge ! Ha , ha ! revenge ! GONZALEZ . Gonzalez It rouses thee ? HERNANDO . Hernando Oh no ! you see , I laugh at it , my lord . There 's no revenge can find a harbour here . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez I do believe thee , kinsman ; thou art bless 'd In a forgiving and an equal temper : And when I see with what philosophy This loss is borne by thee , I am disarm 'd Of half of my objections to the choice My daughter made . Farewell . Go , till the ground ; Get thee a shepherd 's crook ; and , prithee , pardon The rustic who may rob thee of thy Phyllis . Exit . HERNANDO . Hernando Scoff on , my lord , while yet thou hast the breath . Short-sighted fool ! He thinks , because I rave not , Clenching my hands or smiting my hot brow , That the barb does not rankle .

Mendoza Ay , from the palace ; where dispute runs high Upon De Lerma 's counsel to the king , Touching the Pope 's new mandate . HERNANDO . Hernando Am I right ? De Lerma spurn 'd the mandate ? MENDOZA . Mendoza And Gonzalez , ' T is said , is for submission to the Pope . HERNANDO . Hernando Mendoza ! we can trust not to Gonzalez For farther opposition to these nuptials : We 're thrown upon ourselves . MENDOZA . Mendoza What 's to be done ? HERNANDO . Hernando ' T is forming in my brain  --  the embryo vengeance ! Mis-shapen yet it lies and indistinct , But fast matures  --  and now the mist scales off From its appalling lineaments ; and there Reveal 'd it stands , an invocated fiend ! Folly !

Thy steeds caparison 'd ? Attendants ready ? JULIO . Julio Ay , father ; and the morning shines propitious . But there 's a boding raven at my heart . What says Hernando ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Out upon him , Julio ! He is submissive as a priest-led lamb . JULIO . Julio ' T is that submissiveness which makes me fear him . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Fear him ! He is an inoffensive craven !

Gonzalez Ay ; he has proved it . JULIO . Julio His father , too , though war-worn and in years , Has been the pattern of a Christian knight . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez There is no Christian reverence in his heart ! This very moment , Julio , he disputes The sovereignty the German emperor claims Over Castile  --  a claim , the Pope admits ! De Lerma yet withstands the will of Rome , Derides its menace and defies its thunder . JULIO .

Should we ne'er meet again ! I fear his sudden and remorseless temper ! And Izidora  --  when I parted from her , Why did that sickening premonition start Into my brain , and weigh on me , as if Some inner , finer sense had felt the pang Of a sharp agony which was to come . She seem 'd too happy  --  a delighted thing , Just on the margent of life 's sunny stream ! She comes . ( Enter Izidora . ) You see I 'm yet a loiterer . IZIDORA . Izidora ' T is well thou art ; for I would ask thee , Julio , Why , when we parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was utter 'd in such tones , As breaking heart-strings might have given forth . ' T was not the common grief of parting , Julio ; For hitherto , when at the trumpet 's call , Thou hast gone forth to battle , in thine eyes , A sunny hope has danced ; but now a tear Breaks from its rayless gloom . What means it , brother ? JULIO . Julio Alas ! I never yet have parted from thee With the sad thought , that ere we met again Thou wouldst be all another 's  --  never more The gay , free-hearted , fond , and careless girl , Whose laugh in bower and hall was sweetest music . Is not the thought well worth a casual tear ? IZIDORA . Izidora Why should I be less happy or less fond ? The influences of all outward things  --  The sky , the sunshine , and the vernal earth , Beauty and song  --  will they not be the same ? Ah ! there are spirits in this fretful world Which grow not old and change not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that assure thee .

Izidora Now , out upon this sullen humour , brother ! Have done , or I , in sooth , shall wish thee gone  --  Ah no ! not gone ! but I would have thee glad , Even though from me thou goest far away . JULIO . Julio ( Regarding her steadfastly . ) I see it now  --  now , in that earnest smile  --  Now , in the pallor of that tranquil brow  --  The doom , the curse ! Heaven shield thee , Izidora ! Farewell ! farewell ! Rushes out . IZIDORA . Izidora Oh ! do not leave me thus , Julio ! ' T is very strange . He made me tremble ; And , as his eyes glared on me , they appear 'd Lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Didst see my brother ? Is he gone , Velasco ? VELASCO . Velasco Impetuous in his haste , he has departed . He sprang into his saddle  --  waved his hand In token of farewell ; then at full speed , Follow 'd his train along the winding road . You parted kindly ? IZIDORA . Izidora He was strangely moved ; Wherefore I know not . VELASCO . Velasco He has left thee sad . IZIDORA . Izidora And full of wonder . What could be the cause Of such a sudden frenzy ? He would stay  --  Poor Julio ! he would stay to see our nuptials : That must have been his motive . VELASCO . Velasco Thinkst thou so ? Our nuptials , Izidora ! Oh ! speed on . Ye lagging hours that would defer their date ! IZIDORA . Izidora Dost thou not recollect , when first we knew The well-kept secret of each other 's heart , I shudder 'd at the frowning obstacles , Which intervened between our sever 'd fates ? What doubts and fears and anxious fantasies Clouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear 'd Hope 's blue horizon ; and we see Nor rock nor quicksand , which can threaten wreck . Ah ! will the prize so lightly won be prized ? VELASCO . Velasco Above all earthly treasures ! for to me , Thou'rt the fulfilment of the brightest dreams Of young romance  --  the goal on which my hopes Fall down and rest . But we must part awhile . I go to seek my father . IZIDORA . Izidora Dost remember ,  --  A favourite haunt with us in former days ,  --  A spot , the peasants call , King Roderick 's glen ? I shall be there by twilight . VELASCO . Velasco Not alone ! There from all sides shall start bright recollections , And Hope shall catch new lustre from the past . IZIDORA . Izidora The present ! Oh ! the present ! ' T is so bright , Mem'ry can lend no radiance from the Past , Hope can reflect no glory from the Future ! Exeunt . SCENE III . A street in Burgos . ( Enter Gonzalez and Hernando . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguous hints , We spake of old De Lerma ; and you said , It was the dotard 's privilege to slander .  --  To slander whom ? the king ? yourself ? myself ? You signify no negative to that . What is't , Hernando ? Speak with more direction . HERNANDO . Hernando My lord , you must forgive me . Press me not To more disclosures  --  for my peace and thine . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Well , well ; ' t were better that it should not be . De Lerma and myself must soon be fathers To the same children . HERNANDO . Hernando That shall curb my speech . Let base Detraction slur thy honour 'd name ; Can I regard thee as less brave or loyal , Though others prate of cowardice and treason ! GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Those words were never coupled with my name ? HERNANDO . Hernando It happen 'd thus : Dispute was running high color=redPage 46 Upon the German Emperor 's new pretensions ; Some did admit them ; but De Lerma cried : " If Henry claim dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword ! And cursed be the cravens and the traitors , Who would submit to such a vassalage ! " " There are good men and true , " was my reply , " Who favour his pretensions . "  --  " No , not one ! "  --  " What sayst thou to Gonzalez ? " GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Ah ! what then ? He did not dare  --  HERNANDO . Hernando Ay , kinsman ; he did dare To stigmatize thee as a craven traitor . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Hernando ! if thou play'st me false , thy life Shall be an immolation to my fury ! Seizes him and looks intently in his face . HERNANDO . Hernando I can bring proofs , my lord . Nay ; is this courteous ? Well : gives my face the lie to my assertion ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez How couldst thou dare , even in repetition , To breathe those words of me ? HERNANDO . Hernando My lord , forbear . ' T was zeal for thine own honour made me bold . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Zeal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernando Hold ! if thou dost not shrink from actual proof , Here comes De Lerma ; charge it home on him . If he deny it , spurn me as thou wilt . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Leave me . HERNANDO . Hernando ( aside . ) The spark has caught ! it kindles fast : The conflagration blood alone can quench ! Exit . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Should it prove true ! He comes ! I must keep down These throes of passion . ( De Lerma enters , and is crossing . ) Sir ! a word with you . DE LERMA . De Lerma I am a listener  --  an impatient one  --  ' T were best that this encounter should be brief . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez This haughtiness ! My lord , the king , ' t is said , Refuses to admit the Emperor 's claim . DE LERMA . De Lerma Thank heaven the king 's no recreant , no coward , But a Castilian , heart and hand , my lord : Would I might say the same of all his subjects . GONZALEZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LERMA . De Lerma Wherefore this rage , If thou art innocent ? GONZALEZ . Gonzalez De Lerma ! Dotard ! ( Half unsheaths his sword , but instantly dashes it into the scabbard . ) No , no ! thou'rt old and feeble ; and our children  --  Oh ! do not tamper with my desperation ! ( In a sudden burst of passion . ) Retract what thou hast said ! DE LERMA . De Lerma Not , while the proofs Appear even now in all thy looks and actions . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez ' T is false ! Thou urgest me to frenzy  --  thus ! ( Strikes him . ) It will find vent ! DE LERMA . De Lerma A blow ! dishonour 'd ! struck ! ( Draws . ) Defend thyself , ere I commit a murder . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez With thee I 'll not contend : thy arm is nerveless . The odds are too unequal . DE LERMA . De Lerma Then I rush Upon thee as thou art . ( As De Lerma rushes upon him , Gonzalez wrests away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) GONZALEZ . Gonzalez I spare thy life . DE LERMA . De Lerma Oh ! spare it not , if mercy thou wouldst show . Thou givest me back only what thou hast made A misery , a burthen , a disgrace ! It is a gift , for which I can not thank thee . GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Keep it , my lord : and let this lesson teach , What thy gray hairs have fail 'd to bring thee  --  prudence . Exit . DE LERMA . De Lerma ( taking up his sword . ) Thou treacherous steel ! art thou the same , alas ! Of yore so crimson 'd in the Moorish wars ? Methinks there should have been a soul in thee , The soul of victories and great achievements , To form a living instrument of vengeance , And , in the weakness of thy master 's arm , To leap spontaneous to his honour 's rescue . Go ! ' t is a mockery to wear thee now . Throws down his sword . Struck like a menial ! buffeted ! degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh Time ! Why , when ye took away From this right arm its cunning and its strength .

Velasco The peerless Izidora ! how my thoughts , Swept by the grateful memory of her love , Still bend to her like flowers before the breeze ! They paint her image on vacuity  --  They make the air melodious with her voice ! And she  --  the idol of my boyhood 's dreams  --  Is now mine own betroth 'd ! Benignant heavens ! The gulf is pass 'd , which threaten 'd to divide us , And the broad Future unobscured expands ! DE LERMA . De Lerma ( advancing . ) Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father here !

And in thy waning age , this arm shall be Thy shield and thy support ? DE LERMA . De Lerma Thou art my son !

The will was strong , although the nerveless arm Dropp 'd palsied to my side . VELASCO . Velasco My father ! speak ! Explain this mystery . DE LERMA . De Lerma I have been struck ; Degraded by a vile and brutal blow ! Oh ! thou art silent . Thou wilt not despise me ? VELASCO . Velasco Who was the rash aggressor ? He shall die ! Nay , ' t was some serf  --  there 's not the gentleman In all Castile would lay an unkind hand Upon thy feebleness . Then , do not think Thyself disgraced , my honourable father , More than if smitten by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling of a rafter ! Know'st thou th ' offender 's name ? DE LERMA . De Lerma Alas ! no serf , No man of low degree has done this deed  --  The aggressor is our equal . VELASCO . Velasco Say'st thou so ? Then , by my sacred honour , he shall die ! DE LERMA . De Lerma Thou wilt hold true to that ? VELASCO . Velasco Have I not said ? Were it the king himself , who dared profane A single hair upon thy reverend brow , I would assail him on his guarded throne , And with his life-blood stain the marble floor ! DE LERMA . De Lerma Thou noble scion of a blighted stock ! I yet am strong in thee . Thou shalt avenge This ignominious wrong . VELASCO . Velasco Who did it ? Speak ? DE LERMA . De Lerma Gonzalez did it . VELASCO . Velasco No , no , no ! the air In fiendish mockery syllabled that name . It was a dreadful fantasy ! My lord  --  DE LERMA . De Lerma Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LERMA .

( Enter Gonzalez . ) GONZALEZ . Gonzalez Why should I , with a vain regret , deplore This deed , to which my just resentment forced me ? Did not the provocation justify it ? An injury , my nature can forgive ; An insult wakes the instinct of revenge . Yes ; I was right . He merited the blow . Yet for her sake  --  for Izidora 's sake  --  Would that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Lerma ; on my knees Solicit his forgiveness .

I am the man ! Well mayst thou look aghast . A peal of thunder . Izidora falls to the ground .

What do I here at such an hour as this ? It was no dream ! It is reality ! VELASCO . Velasco Oh ! let me palliate the dreadful act . Thou dost not know  --  but thou art faint , my love . IZIDORA . Izidora Stand back ! sir knight ! thy arm no more shall clasp me . Think of my oath ! it yet must be fulfill 'd . Before the king himself I will arraign thee , To answer for this deed .  --  I am devoted To the fulfilment of a sacred duty ; But did not think to find in thee the man  --  VELASCO .

It is strange indeed ! FAVILLO . Favillo But still more wonderful , that Don Velasco Should not be eager to avenge his death ; At least to ferret out the murderer . FERDINAND . Ferdinand A mystery involves the deed , which time Must speedily unfold . Shouts are heard . What shouts are those ? What crowd is that beneath the porch ? ( Enter Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gonzalez and her kinsman . Thy presence seek . The people gather round , And , in their pity , shout aloud for justice . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Admit her .

Izidora kneels to the king . ) FERDINAND . Ferdinand Rise up , fair mourner ; we will hear thy griefs . IZIDORA . Izidora I am the orphan daughter of Gonzalez : He was , great king , thy brave and loyal subject , And has done service in his country 's wars . By violence , his death has been accomplish 'd . Oh ! grant , my liege , redress against the man Who has my father slain . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Who is the man ? IZIDORA . Izidora Ah me ! the last who should have done the deed . His name  --  I am a feeble advocate Against so potent and renown 'd a foe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Reach him upon his pinnacle of fame . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Ha ! name thy foe . IZIDORA . Izidora His name  --  I can not speak it HERNANDO . Hernando Velasco ! IZIDORA . Izidora Ay , ' t is spoken ! FERDINAND . Ferdinand Heavens ! Velasco ? Thou hast amazed us , lady , by thy charge ; The proofs , that could have urged on thee conviction , Can not be such as will admit our doubt . HERNANDO . Hernando My liege , he deigns not to dispute the charge . FERDINAND . Ferdinand What madness drove him to the ruthless deed ? HERNANDO . Hernando My liege , we must conjecture that he hoped , By virtue of his marriage with this lady , To gain possession of the seignories Gonzalez held . IZIDORA . Izidora Never ! thou dost malign him ! Never could such a motive sway his heart ! Oh ! judge not thou of motives , if none better Thou canst attribute , sir , to such as he  --  A knight , a man of honour , a Velasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with folded arms , while Hernando is speaking . HERNANDO . Hernando My liege , I did but venture a surmise . His motives to the crime I may misdeem ; But of his agency , what doubt remains ? Much cause have we to fear , it was no duel , By knightly laws , in which Gonzalez fell , But an assassination , in which honour  --  He suddenly sees Velasco , and is silent . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Go on . Why dost thou hesitate , Hernando ? Behold th ' accused ! Confront him with thy charge . HERNANDO . Hernando My liege  --  VELASCO . Velasco Has my arrival struck thee speechless ? Why , what a type of infamy thou standest ! Traducer ! thou art sunk beneath my scorn . But where is he , who will maintain thy charge ? I slew Gonzalez as becomes a knight , In honourable combat , sword to sword ! ( Throwing down his gauntlet . Behold my gage ! who will gainsay the truth ? FERDINAND .

Velasco , we know not What provocation drove thee to this deed , But that thine honour suffered in th ' encounter , Thy own attesting word could not persuade us . ( Enter De Lerma . ) DE LERMA . De Lerma My liege , this is my quarrel ; and , be sure , Justice holds me alone responsible . Velasco was the weapon in my hand , Wielded for the redemption of my honour . Know that I was insulted by Gonzalez ,  --  Struck , like a very beggar , in the street ! I drew my sword upon him , but alas ! My arm had lost its vigour ;  --  and , with scorn , He dash 'd aside my unavailing blade , Then left me crush 'd beneath a load of shame ! Could I exist , my liege , while lived the man Who had disgraced me ? No ! I had a son  --  He has but done his duty . FERDINAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Velasco yielded up Love , life , ay , more than life , rather than honour . For thee , unhappy lady , who hast been Deprived at once of bridegroom and of father , We can not punish where we find no guilt  --  No treacherous action nor intent is proved . We can but say : bring forth thy champion ; Velasco promptly will obey his summons . The feud admits not of our interference . We have decided . Follow me , Hernando . Exeunt all but Izidora and Velasco . Carlos , as he goes out , returns the latter his gauntlet . VELASCO . Velasco Thou hast heard all which can extenuate The perpetration of the deed we mourn : Oh ! wilt thou not believe , that when mine arm Was raised to strike , my heart was torn with anguish ? That I did love thee better at that moment , While severing the tie between our fates , Than when exulting hope was all mine own ? IZIDORA . Izidora Call it not love , Velasco ; hadst thou loved , Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this weight of misery upon me . VELASCO . Velasco Oh ! sound the dreary depth of my despair , Then , if thou canst , measure my boundless love . IZIDORA . Izidora Call'st thou that love which pride can subjugate ? Which can be quell 'd by what the world call honour , Or made to yield even by filial duty ? No ! to all these true love is paramount ! VELASCO . Velasco Oh ! my fair name had been for ever lost , If I had tamely borne the unmeasured insult . IZIDORA . Izidora No ! One appealing word had wrought compunction In the offender 's heart ; but Pride withheld thee . A human victim was the sole oblation Which could appease thy Moloch ! and revenge Was dearer to thee than the hopes of love ! More sacred than thy plighted faith to her , Who to thy trust gave all her happiness ! Oh ! what a reckless steward hast thou been ! VELASCO . Velasco Could I behold a venerated father Crush 'd by a sense of unrequited wrong , Wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to save , deny redress ? IZIDORA . Izidora Thou dost but point the sting of mine own conscience . If to redress a blow , thy sacrifice Was the aggressor 's life , what should be mine , Who have a father 's slaughter to avenge ! VELASCO . Velasco Oh ! worse than death thou dost inflict on me , Now by thy hate . IZIDORA . Izidora My hate ! VELASCO . Velasco Thou dost not love me ? IZIDORA . Izidora Love thee ? oh , no ! I should not , would not love thee  --  I will fly from thee  --  VELASCO . Velasco Stay ! before we part  --  Which parting is for ever  --  may we not Forget the sad divulsion of our fates , And sail together down the sunny past ! IZIDORA . Izidora How every tone brings back the happy days ! I fear ' t is sin to listen  --  but there is Such sweet enchantment in it  --  VELASCO . Velasco ' T is in vain ! I can not rid me of the recollection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the scourge , the awful instrument ! IZIDORA . Izidora Canst thou recall not that delicious twilight , When , venturous children , careless of time 's lapse , We traversed in a skiff the wood-girt lake , While from the rosy west , the drooping clouds  --  Ensanguined banners of the captive day  --  Threw o'er the purple wave their glowing shadows ? VELASCO . Velasco I can but sigh for what we might have been ! IZIDORA . Izidora And memory need not travel far to bring That hour , when we two parted light of heart , In the near prospect of a joyous bridal . Oh ! little did we dream , that ere we met Strange horror would disjoin us ! VELASCO . Velasco Oh ! forget ! Or ere we part , vouchsafe one last embrace . IZIDORA . Izidora Forbear ! This is impiety , Velasco . ' T is not for thee to clasp me . Think ! my father ! Dying he drew from me a sacred oath , And , as a legacy , bequeath 'd this dagger ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do not quail  --  Now , ere thy purpose flag  --  strike ! I will bless thee ! She raises it , as if to strike him  --  he extends his arms , inviting the blow , whereupon she drops the dagger , and rushes out . Were I the only victim , I could brave , Methinks , Fate 's worst infliction ; but my heart Breaks when I see her suffer . I look round For refuge , but can find one only haven  --  The quiet grave ! As if to point the way , Taking up the dagger . The steel she left gleams on me ! If Despair Could ever justify self-sacrifice , Now 's the occasion , when my forfeit life Is claim 'd by her , to whom it was devoted . A sinew 's quick contraction and ' t is done !  --  No , no , Velasco ! ' t is a weary march ! And many droop and falter by the way , And many , treading in forbidden paths , At their great Captain 's sacred laws rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obeys , and presses forward to the last ; While on the streaming flag , that marshals him , And lifts the emblem of his faith , he reads , By this sign shalt thou conquer ! . Exit . ( Re-enter Carlos . ) CARLOS . Carlos Poor Velasco !  --  Ah ! who approach ! Hernando and Mendoza . Some knavery 's afoot . I 'll stand aside . ( Re-enter Hernando , with Mendoza . ) Carlos seats himself unperceived upon the chair of state . HERNANDO . Hernando Art well assured of the fidelity Of him thou hast employ 'd in this affair ? MENDOZA . Mendoza Don Julio stands no longer in thy way . Our agents bring such proofs as will convince thee . How wilt thou mould the sister to thy purpose ? HERNANDO . Hernando She will be mine , Mendoza ; and at once  --  If not by fair compliance , by compulsion ! I have possess 'd the castle with my creatures  --  Ridding its precincts of the old adherents . She returns home  --  to my home  --  dost thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masterpiece ? MENDOZA . Mendoza A rare one . Carlos in drawing his sword rattles it . HERNANDO . Hernando Ha ! a listener ! MENDOZA . Mendoza It is Carlos ! HERNANDO . Hernando Confusion ! he has heard us ! Boy ! come hither . Carlos hums a tune and bends his swordblade against the floor . MENDOZA . Mendoza ( going towards him . ) So ! I will drag him to you . Meddling page !  --  CARLOS . Carlos ( starting forward . ) Stand off , sir ! off ! My rapier is not squeamish ; It may take up with offals . So , beware ! Go , frighten women . Think not that I fear you . HERNANDO . Hernando Nay , Carlos ! Tempt him not , Mendoza . Hold ! Didst hear the import of the brief discourse , Which pass 'd between this gentleman and me ? CARLOS . Carlos Oh ! traitors ! every villanous word ye utter 'd , I overheard . HERNANDO . Hernando Thou'rt jesting with us , Carlos . CARLOS . Carlos Flatter yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not jest with traitors . To Mendoza , who is trying to circumvent him .

MENDOZA . Mendoza Wilt report Aught thou hast heard ? HERNANDO . Hernando Nay ; Carlos knows his friends . There is an Arab courser in my stables , Fleet as the wind , clean-limb 'd and tractable ; And of a size just suited to thy height . I would not part with him for money , Carlos ; But , if thou'lt be our friend , and keep our counsel , He shall be thine . MENDOZA . Mendoza ( aside . ) Well put . The bribe has won him . CARLOS . Carlos Hast thou so brave a steed ? HERNANDO . Hernando Ay , Carlos . CARLOS . Carlos Black ? HERNANDO . Hernando Black as a raven . CARLOS . Carlos Fleet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos Then , prithee , mind my caution . Mount at once ! And , swift as thou canst spur him , leave behind The gallows that awaits thee . HERNANDO .

Stand back , or thou shalt rue it . HERNANDO . Hernando Boy ! beware ! Thy life shall be the forfeit of thy treason . What wouldst thou do ? CARLOS . Carlos Expose you ! baffle you ! Oh ! fume not . I shall haste to Don Velasco , Tell him what I have heard ; and , if he have not Two knaves ' heads dangling at his saddle-bow Before the nightfall , I 'm no conjurer . Exit . MENDOZA .

Enter Izidora . IZIDORA . Izidora My home seems changed : new faces stare upon me ; Familiar ones are miss 'd : or , do I dream ? Was it not all the mere fantastic play Of brain-sick fancy ? No . I stood before The king , and claim 'd redress against my lover . Oh ! hypocrite ! thy tongue besought a boon Thy inmost heart rejected !

Hernando ( speaking as he enters . ) Ay ; close the gates , and man the outward towers . Let no one be admitted on thy life . IZIDORA . Izidora Let no one be admitted ! Close the gates ! What mean'st thou by such orders ? HERNANDO . Hernando I have cause . Fair cousin , to mistrust Velasco 's purpose ; One of our house he has already slain ; May he not meditate against another A like attempt ? ' T is well to be prepared For a surprise ! IZIDORA . Izidora Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits ? HERNANDO . Hernando Nay ; be not hasty . Hear me ; and deign to do my motives justice . IZIDORA . Izidora Oh ! may I trust thee ? HERNANDO .

Hernando Thou'rt now , fair cousin , left in the wide world , An unprotected , solitary orphan . Thy brother gone  --  perchance , not to return  --  The man who was betroth 'd to thee become The man whom , of all others , thou art bound , With a relentless hatred to pursue  --  Methinks the path of wisdom and of duty Is plain before thee .

Consent ! consent to be my wedded wife , Or I will drag thee , by thy braided hair , To yonder chamber !

With earnest plea I urged , that she was left An orphan  --  brotherless  --  but in reply She raised her eyes to Heaven in silent trust . A holy priest I sent to sway her soul , And offer absolution  --  but his craft Did not avail .

And ere thy husband 's kiss is on thy cheek , May thy wrong 'd father 's image shoot between , And with his angry eyes transfix thee , till Thou'rt petrified with horror ! If thou hast Children , may they be fratricides , avenging Upon each other 's head their grandsire 's doom ! IZIDORA . Izidora Now do I fear , that those keen miseries , Those bitter pangs that should have broke my heart , Have made it hard as adamant , or else Why quail 'd I not beneath thy imprecations ? Music heard . The bridegroom waits . JULIO . Julio By force I will withold thee . Sister ! thou shalt not go to him . IZIDORA . Izidora Stand back ! ' T is Fate 's coercion hurries me along ; And Death must drag me at his chariot-wheels , Ere we again are parted ! Exit . JULIO . Julio She is gone . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , no ! it must not be . The terrible alternative is left . Exit . SCENE III . The royal banquet-room . A banqueting table superbly set out with vessels of wine , goblets , &c.; ( Enter Julio through the folding doors . ) JULIO . Julio How like a cautious , trembling , guilty thing , I glide with stealthy paces toward my purpose . Can that be good , of which the outward signs Are the thief 's posture and the coward 's tread ? Away , reflection ! ' T is too late to waver When half the crime is in th ' intent committed . Decision gives a virtue even to vice , And gilds its black deformity . Oh ! think Of all the fierce incentives to the act . Quick ! or the occasion 's gone ! He advances rapidly towards the table ,  --  hesitates as he is about to poison the goblet , and finally , recoiling from the undertaking , rushes to the front of the stage . Was I struck blind ? Ere I could do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flashing board Changed to funereal blackness ! Indistinct Was every object to my blasted sight ;  --  And the gemm 'd goblet faded , and the floor Sank in and reel 'd like the sea 's undulations ! I 'll not renew th ' attempt . A burst of sprightly music is heard from a distance . Ah ! they approach ! With dulcimer and cymbal , they approach ! Ghost of my slaughter 'd father ! Now transfuse Into this frame thy immaterial essence ! Nerve the obedient muscles of mine arm , And be thine own avenger ! He again approaches the goblet and with a steady hand infuses the poison . Just as he is turning from the perpetration of the deed , Carlos and Izidora appear at the door in the back ground . The former , after a significant gesture , withdraws ; and the latter comes forward unperceived by Julio , and lays her hand upon him , which causes him to start with terror It is done ! IZIDORA . Izidora What hast thou done ? JULIO . Julio Sister ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evasion ; for I know What thou hast done . Art thou my brother , Julio ? Undo thy foul attempt ! undo it quickly , Or , by my hopes of heaven , I will proclaim it ! JULIO . Julio Hold ! ' t is my turn to be obdurate now . Dare to reveal it , and the lightning 's flash Is not more nimble than this steel shall be To make my vengeance certain . Hush ! They come . IZIDORA . Izidora My brother ! do not  --  I will  --  stop these  --  JULIO . Julio Hush ! He supports her . ( Enter to music , Ferdinand , with Velasco , followed by De Lerma , Favillo , Carlos , Ladies , Knights , and Banner-bearers , who form in the back-ground . ) FERDINAND . Ferdinand Julio ! thy prompt compliance claims our thanks . I bring to thee a brother . In that pledge , Which is the sacred symbol of forgiveness , Greet ye each other first . Then , trumpets ! sound ! And let us all hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My liege , my heart goes with it :  --  And I will play the Ganymede myself . He leaves Izidora , who stands motionless and unconscious , but gradually revives as Velasco speaks . Julio fills two goblets , and hands the poisoned one to Velasco , who replaces it on the board so abruptly as to excite Julio 's apprehensions lest he is aware of the treachery . But Velasco advances and frankly offers him his hand . VELASCO . Velasco Julio ! thy hand ! thou makest me , by this act , Bankrupt in gratitude . I slew thy father  --  My honour forced me , while my heart revolted ! I will requite thee with a brother 's kindness , Cherish thy sister with a parent 's care , And with a lover 's duty . To our union ! As Velasco lifts the goblet , Izidora utters a faint exclamation , which arrests his hand . JULIO . Julio ( aside to Izidora . ) Beware ! VELASCO . Velasco What says the bride ? JULIO . Julio ' T was naught  --  the joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Izidora ( seizing the goblet from Velasco . ) Give it me . Trembling she returns the goblet to the cupbearer . VELASCO . Velasco What wouldst thou , Izidora ? IZIDORA . Izidora Taste it not . Thou wouldst not quaff before the bride has sipp 'd ? JULIO . Julio I 'll not be thwarted by thee . FERDINAND . Ferdinand Ah ! Prevent him . JULIO . Julio My father aims the blow ! It is Gonzalez ! ( As Izidora springs to meet Velasco , he falls at her feet . ) IZIDORA . Izidora ( bending over him . ) Oh , fatal treason ! terrible revenge ! VELASCO . Velasco Thy love supports me  --  and thy arm enfolds me  --  My ebbing sight heaves its last glance on thee  --  Thus dying , death is grateful . Oh , farewell ! Dies . IZIDORA . Izidora Are ye all speechless ? I should be , were't not I know that I full soon shall follow him . Faint ! very faint ! Seizes the poisoned goblet . Here 's that which shall revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poison 'd goblet ! IZIDORA . Izidora Not a drop Remains for thee . Gazing upon Velasco . Alas ! my only love ! The brave , the glorious , and the beautiful ! In death we are united ; never more To part ! The expiation is complete ! She sinks gradually from the arms of her brother towards Velasco , and dies . CURTAIN FALLS .
