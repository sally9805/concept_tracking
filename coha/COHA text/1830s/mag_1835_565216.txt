txt October 13 . I have spent the day in visiting ancient Rome . Setting out early in the morning , with two companions , we went first to the forum . It is astonishing how this ground has been filled up with earth : the arc of Septimus Severus , which stands near the Capitoline hill , is at least half buried ; and in order that it may be seen , the ground has been carried away for a space of several feet around it , so that it appears to stand in a cellar . The surface of the ancient forum being nearly twenty feet lower than at present . In order , therefore , to bring the whole of these ancient monuments to light , it has been necessary to make large excavations in every part of the forum , which now resembles more a brick-kiln than anything else , being full of great pits dug in the sand . Along the north side is a shady avenue ; but , upon the field itself , there is no sign of vegetation . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and exquisite proportions , indicate the site of the ancient temples . The place is pointed out where the temple of Concord was ; but there are now no remains of it . Indeed , of all the temples which surround the foruin , I do not think anything more remains than thirty or forty columns . But the whole ground about it is covered with ruins . On the right hand of the sacred way , are the ruins of the palace of the emperor iDomitian , on the left of the temple of Augustus and Faustina , consisting of a beautiful portico , with some portion of the ancient wall ; farther on , are three immense arches , a part of the temple of Remus ; and passing through the triumphal arch of Titus , you have still on the left the extensive remains of the temple of Venus and Rome , consisting principally of broken walls ; part of the celIa remains , however , with a richly fretted semi-dome , that was probably inlaid at one time , with plates of bronze and silver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to the church of St. Pietro in vinculis - a small building , interesting chiefly for twenty marble IDoric columns , ( taken from the baths of Dioclesian ) and the famous statue of Moses , by Michelangelo . This represents the patriarch sitting and holding the tables in his right hand and resting them on his knee . His robes are long , flowing and graceful ; the countenance , which is turned to the the statue is colossal ; the arms and legs , which are partly bare , are very fine , and the whole is filled with dignity and inspires awe . In the same church are preserved the chains with which St. Peter was bound in Jerusalem and at Rome ; but we were not // permltted to see them . Passing on , we came at length to the magnificent church of St. Giovanni , in Laterano . The hill is said to be thus named from the palace of Plautius Lateranus , put to death for conspiring with Seneca against Nero . It stood upon this spot , and the property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Constantine built the first Christian church on this hill . It has been burnt and otherwise injured at different times ; but the popes have raised the present magnificent edifice upon the same spot , and some parts of the ancient church are still seen there . Near the church is an Egyptian obelisk , a hundred and fifteen feet high , covered with hieroglyphics , and the largest in Rome . It was originally placed in the temple of the Sun , at Thebes , and was brought to Rome by the son of Constantine the Great . Pope Sixtus V. had it placed upon the spot which it now occupies . There seems to be an eternity in these Egyptian monuments ; like the everlasting hills , they defy the hand of time ; a double antiquity rests upon them , and yet they seem to have but just issued from the hand of the artist . The three finest , I think , are , the one before the church of St. Peter 's , that in the piazza del Popolo , and the one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation , having nothing of that appearance of age which mark the remains of Roman sculpture . From this we went to the tomb of the Scipios , on the Appian way , near the Porta Capena . The front is of the Doric style , find in very good preservation . We entered with lights , and plunged into the cavern ; deep , dismal and cold , it seemed indeed as if we were entering the city of the dead . We followed our guide through many a winding gallery and many a silent chaml*er , pausing every now and then to read the inscriptions engraved upon marble tablets and fastened to the wall ; these , however , were only copies , the originals having been removed to the Vatican . At length we arrived at the end of this labyrinth , and joyfully retraced our steps to the cheerful light of day , for the night of ages seemed to dwell in the cavern . TIen following the city wall , we came to the pyramid of Caius Cestius , probably erected in the Augustan age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see within . It is somewhat overgrown with wild plants , but is very well preserved ; the beauty of the monument , however , is not very remarkable . Adjoining this is the burying-ground of the Protestants , and chiefly filled with English and American monuments . What a combination ! the tombs of a Roman priest , who died two thousand years ago , and an inhabitant of the distant western world , * built side by side , // and their ashes reposing peacefully together . This little burying ground was very interesting . There is something peculiarly mournful in contemplating the graves and the monuments of those who have died far away from their home , in a strange land . We are insensibly led to think of the last moments of these unhappy wanderers , perishing in the midst of strangers ; the wild grass which waves over their tombs and conceals their names , is an emblem of the loneliness of their death-bed . It was very touching to me , also , to read the inscriptions in my native tongue , so far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country , they are a dead letter ; they s*peak to the traveler alone ; they tell him of the strong love of distant friends which has claimed this little spot for its kingdom , and has here raised its simple memorials of respect and affection amidst the ruins of a perished nation , and on the soil where bigotry now reigns ; they warn him , too , that , like those who slumber beneath , he may here find the end of his wanderings ; and then his thoughts turn towards home , as to a lost Paradise which his feet are never again to press . Near this , rises Monte Testaccio , said to be formed entirely of broken earthen-ware that has been cast there . From the summit , we had a fine view of an extensive country , bordered by hills , which the pens of Cicero and of Ovid have rendered classical . Beneath our feet rolled the Tiber , and on the other side rose Mount Aventine and Palatine , and all the ruin-covered soil on which stood ancient Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I have already mentioned . Nineteen of the columns are there , one only having been carried away . The whole portion which originally rested upon them is gone , and the temple is now surmounted by an ugly little roof , which accords very ill with the solid materials and elegant workmanship of the ancient parts , and looks like a Chinese hat on the Venus di Medicis . Near this is the temple of Fortuna Virilis , which has been patched up , and forms now part of a church . The columns , of the Ionic order , along the side and front , and the portion of the pediment which formed the front , are undoubtedly ancient . On the other side of the street , is the house of Rienzi - a strange looking and ruinous edifice , loaded with ornaments in stone , which savor of the middle ages ; they are very rich , however , and the house forms an interesting contrast to its classic neighbors . Continuing our walk , we stopped a moment to look at the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a block of houses - about a quadrant of the circle remainin** . It was built like the Coliseum : first , a story supported with Tuscan columns and arches between them , then of the Ionic order , and finally I suppose the Corinthian , though none of the columns // are left . This small portion of the edifice was all we could see , the other part being entirely absorbed in the surrounding houses . It probably never constituted more than a semi-circle ; the stage might have been square , without any pretensions to architecture . Passing on , we came at last to the Tarpeian rock , or what purports to be such . It is easy to see that the precipice was originally of more than twice its present height , and it would be a very awkward thing to tumble off , as it must be nearly forty feet high now , and II think may have originally been a hundred . October 14 . Visited the palazzo Borghese . The gallery of paintings is the only part exhibited . There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed the following . First , there were two small pieces by George Vasari : Leda ' and Lucretia . ' They are remarkable for the style , which is quite original , both as to drawing and coloring . The faces are both beautiful , but entirely different ; Leda has an innocent , smiling , open face , and might pass for an American or French woman ; but Lucretia has the true Grecian face , with all its majesty ; despair and determination , outraged honor and the fearless contemplation of death are displayed in her magnificent countenance , and you feel that you are in the presence of a superior being . The were two or three paintings by Valatin , ( I never heard of him before ) which pleased me much . His Joseph interpreting ' is a fine piece ; the young Hebrew is passing fair , and inspiration lights up his features . Then there were some splendid works of Titian , in his own style ; the Three Graces ' and the Sacred and Profane Love . ' Vandyke was a glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' show genius in every line . I did not think he was so fine a historical painter ; his portraits are the best I have ever seen . There were two or three pieces by Andre del Sarto , on his favorite subject , the Holy Family ; and a Prodigal Son , ' by Guercino . There is certainly a similarity in the style of these two artists ; a softness , purity and dignity , withal , which I find only in Raphael . Guercino is my favorite of all , except Raphael and Titian ; the latter excels him in power , and there is a heavenliness in the paintings of Raphael which no other man ever attained to . Guido is sometimes more sublime than Andrea del Sarto or Guercino , but he often falls below them ; yet the glory of Guercino 's Sybil ' is unsurpassed . I stopped a long time at the portrait of Cmesar Borgia , by Raphael , for , independently of the splendor of the painting , I was interested in studying the countenance of this man . Cresar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near it ; crime was his foster-brother , and the bowl and dagger his playthings . He was an elegant looking fellow , just a hero for the Pelbam novels ; and his rich doublet , with sleeves of velvet , displays his form to advantage ; the small cap , with its long , // bending feather and costly ioop , shades , but does not conceal his comely features ; his lofty brow announces deep thought and sage counsel ; yet there is an air of rakishness in his curly hair , in his deep , dark eyes , and his satirical mouth . At first , it seemed impossible that this should be the countenance of a monster , whose very name inspires horror ; but the longer I contemplated it , the more evident were the traits . Among the most famous of the paintings in this gallery , is one by Domenichino , representing Diana and her nymphs ; and the Danae of Coreggio . October 15 . A party of us went out to Tivoli to spend the day . It was here , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that M*ecenas erected his villa ; here he entertained his gifted friend Horace ; here were the haunts of Virgil and Ovid and here Augustus retired from the dust and noise of the city . Tivoli is on the spot where stood the ancient city of Tibur , which did not come under the Roman sway till the year 400 , A. U. C. It is most romantically situated on a hill , from which the Anio falls into the valley beneath . As we approached the town , nothing indicated the beauties we were to find there . Ascending a long hill , we came into a dirty village , with narrow streets and staring inhabitants , and soon reached our inn , which proved to be better than the outside indicated . A ride of nearly twenty miles , in the sharp morning air , had sharpened the edge of our appetites , and temples , *vaterfalls and ruins were forgotten , while sundry quantities of beefsteak , eggs , omelets , coffee , bread and butter , &amp;c. , were undergoing an animated discussion . At length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of a half savage cicerone , to see the wonders of Tivoli . Five minutes ' walk brought us to the edge of a hill , from which we looked down upon the Anio , which was hastening to its fall . Continuing onward , we passed through a gate , and came to the temple of the Sybil , as they call it . It is an exquisite ruin , circular and surrounded with fluted columns . The position of this beautiful temple shows all the taste and romance ( if I may so call it ) of classic days . It stands on the edge of a precipice , and the river pours into the gulf beneath . On the opposite side of this deep and dark ravine , the Sabine hills rise suddenly to a greater height than these we stood upon . To have a view of the cascade , however , we descended by a winding path till we reached the lowest point . We here found ourselves in a deep gulph ; on three sides , the perpendicular walls of mountains rose abruptly round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-arched with vast rock , and christened Neptune 's Grot , ' was the receptacle of an impetuous torrent which came bursting in through a narrow aperture above . On the other side of the gulph was the cascade ; the water fell in an unbroken sheet of silvery foam , and the rising spray , wafted in billows down the ravine , displayed for a moment its rainbow // hues in the sunlight and vanished in the air . Far above us , on its hold , jutting rock , stood the classic temple I have mentioned , and seemed to preside over the scene as the genius of the place . At a distance , on the opposite side , were extensive ruins , which might have once formed part of some Roman villa . We lingered an hour on this delicious spot , and then ascended to the town , which traversing , we came to the remains of the villa of M*ecenas , on the other side . The situation is very beautiful . An amphitheatre of hills stretches round behind , and in front is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant city . Of the villa , ( if such it was ) a number of long , arched galleries remain , through which a stream rushes and carries several mills , which have been constructed here ; they stand on the edge of the hills , and the little brooks , escaping from the sides , fall into the valley . Near the city of Tibur , but on the other side , are the remains of the villa of Adrian , one of the most superb retreats which the magnificence of any monarch has formed . Some of the finest ancient statues - the Venus di Medicis , for instance - were found among the ruins . At present , they have but little interest , except as indicating the site and extent of the palace and its ap-* purtenances , and perhaps assisting the antiquarian in his investigations . They are too much decayed and crumbled for imagination ever to build its fabrics upon them , and the beauty of a ruin ' is hardly discoverahle in them . Like almost all Roman remains , they astonish by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arch , especially among ruins , which conveys the idea of grandeur ; and the vast span of some of those in this villa , as well as in other ruins I have seen here , seems to make them the very emblems of sublimity . Having passed the day on these hallowed spots , we returned to Rome . Near Tivoli , on the road to Rome , is a circular tomb of the Plautian family . It is much in the style of the mausoleum of Adrian . We were not permitted to enter . Not far from this is a stream , which might pass for the Styx or Cocytus , or a branch at least . The waters run white with the sulphur , and such a stench issues from the rushing torrent , that we were glad to let curiosity rest , and hurry by . In general , the country between Rome and Tivoli is a desert ; and the ruined towers and castles , scattered over the wide plain , are the only mark that man has dwelt there . October 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing between the statues of Castor and Pollux , till we reached the summit . Here we stopped to look at an equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius , in bronze , made I know not when , but antique . It is very beautiful , particularly the horse . The emperor appears in the act of addressing the people or receiving // their salutations . I was not exactly pleased with his position as he sat on the horse ; still it was merely because I had been accustomed to the statues of knights mounted on the high saddles with stirrups . This one had neither ; a simple housing , spread upon the back of the horse , is all the harness . The emperor is clothed in the armor of the time ; the legs bare , with sandals on the feet ; his head and arms are also uncovered . The whole was originally gilded . It is a most interesting work , the first antique equestrian statue I had ever seen , and gave me a better idea of the Roman cavalry than I ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues on the right hand . Near the door , is a colossal statue of Minerva , armed . It is full of dignity , and the countenance is proud and threatening ; it accords with my schoolboy ideas of this goddess - l ) roud , revengeful , unapproachable but still more , perhaps , because there is a picture in Home Tooke 's Pantheon something like the statue . Near this , is the statue of Diana , hunting with her dog . She is crowned with the crescent . The piece is full of lightness , life and beauty ; and as I gazed on her chaste features , animated with exertion , I thought the lines of Shakspeare , in the Midsummer Night 's Dream , might be better applied to her than to the detestable old woman for whom they were written . After this , we roamed through numerous apartments filled with interesting objects , among which I noticed the celebrated mosaic of the doves drinkiug , from Adrian 's villa . There were several beautiful statues , also ; one was a Cupid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose celebrated , as I have seen many casts of it . It is represented not in the usual manner , as a chubby infant ; yet you would , without hesitation , say this was the statue of a young child . The form has the proportions of a grown man , but the softness and delicacy of a child . The face , too , is not that of a common child ; the proportions are perfectly developed and of great beauty . In reality , it is a monster , as are the children in the famous group of Laocoon ; yet the form and face are well suited to the Deity , who knows too much to be represented as a common baby . One room contains busts of the ancient philosophers and poets - an interesting study , but requiring too much time for one visit . Among these , I could not , however , help noticing a bust of Michelangelo , by himself , made in dark-colored marble . The head is very fine , and the countenance full of dignity and even majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its having been broken . Three more remarkable countenances I have never seen than those of Michelangelo , Dante and Petrarch . Once seen , they are indelibly fixed in the mind . The stern , mournful and hard features of one , the classic and beautiful face of the other , and the majestic mien of the third , are becoming // to men who were to rouse a slumbering world from the lethargy which the night of ignorance had brought upon it . We came , finally , to that masterpiece of art , the Dying Gladiator . ' The effect it produces upon the feelings , is entirely different from that occasioned by the Venus , and others of the same character ; yet the marble is so wonderfully wrought , that you cease to regard it as a work of art ; these thoughts are lost in the emotions of pity and distress . The wounded man rests on one arm , the blood trickles from the deep wound in the side , his head droops , and his hair , clotted with perspiration , still shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conflict which he has sustained . Agony seems struggling with courage and despair in his manly face . There is no thought of those who are about him ; perhaps some would say that nothing of the intellectual is in his countenance . I think Byron has well represented his mind as wandering to his home , his young barbarians and their Dacian mother . It is a wonderful piece . I think its character may be best expressed as the representation of suppressed and conquered agony . The deep impression it makes upon the minds of all spectators , is a proof of its excellence . Passing to the gallery on the opposite side of the square , we observed on the stairway leading to the paintings , and in the court , several ancient works in marble , some of which I thought very good , particularly a group of a lion tearing a horse . Among the paintings , was one which I was so much pleased with , that I turned from the works of Titian , Guido , Guercino and Domenichino , to gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising of the sun ; and though small , is a most sublime piece . The god of Day is rising in all the splendor of a tropical climate and the gorgeous clouds , which hang upon his pathway , have that peculiar richness and magnificence which I have only seen in Cuba . The prostrate travelers are offering up their prayers at this impressive moment , and their devotion is not misplaced . I thought of Scott 's beautiful description of an eastern morning , in the Talisman , ' for it seemed to be realized in this piece . One of the most interesting objects in this part of the gallery , was the wolf of Romulus and Remus , in bronze . It is supposed to be the one which Cicero speaks of , as having been struck with lightning . A part of one of the hind legs has evidently been melted , and appears to have been struck by lightning . At any rate , it is , without any doubt , of great antiquity , and I was quite ready to take the word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , is a statue , in bronze , of the young shepherd , who , running to tell the Senate of the approach of the Gauls , was wounded in the foot by a thorn , which he did not attempt to extract till he had conveyed the news . He is here represented as // taking out the thorn . I was interested in the piece , because engravings of it are common at home , and because it is a beautiful work of very remote antiquity . The middle building on the Capitoline hill , is called the Senator 's palace . This Senator is the fittest emblem I can imagine of the present condition of Rome . When I think of the dignity , the venerable majesty of ancient Roman Senators , of the men who , sitting in their state in the forum , could meet death , but not brook an insult , of the men who became more and more haughty and unyielding the nearer Hannibal came to the city , and who finally passed the terrible decree , iDelenda est Carthago ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings , and who came to rule the world- and then see the poor , insignificant , powerless creature , the shadow of a Senator , and not even a Roman by birth , * who now represents that once mighty body , and bears that once majestic name , it seems , indeed , that Rome has fallen and her virtue and worth have passed away , and she submits to be marked with a degrading pageant , which only speaks of her degeneracy . October 25 . I went , for the scond time , to the Vatican . The first time I went there , I had merely time to walk leisurely through the labyrinth of rooms filled with sculpture , and to give a glance at the paintings . I now paused to look more closely at those which I had before fixed upon as the finest , passing by the others . In the first room , a statue of Fortune ( found , I believe , at Ostia ) afforded me more pleasure than any one , saving the three or four finest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cornucopia in one hand , while the other holds a rudder , which rests upon a ball . Her face is full of dignity and beauty , and is interesting as the model of all modern statues of a similar character . I have seen many of equal beauty , especially by Canova ; but it seems as if this one were the original of all . But I hurried on to the temple of the Apollo Belvidere ; for , after all , the interest of the Vatican centres there . The statue stands in a small circular apartment , and is very favorably placed for the light , which comes from above . Time has spared the marble , which looks as white and fresh as if just from the hand of the sculptor . The statue has always been supposed to represent the Deity at the moment he has slain the Python . Antiquaries know better about this than myself ; but I always thought his contest with the serpent took place when he was yet a child ; and the flush of anger , ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the marks of revenge , traced in that wonderful countenance , make me more inclined to believe that he is here portrayed as destroying is but one man who hears the sinecure of Roman Senator ; and it is provided by law , that he shall always be a foreigner by birth . // the Cyclopes , who had caused the death of his son Esculapius . But this is of no consequence . This is the noblest work of art I have ever seen in any shape , or ever expect to see . it is the embodying of genius itself in the human form . The countenance e4resses the passions , powers , pride and majesty of a being more than mortal . He hardly deigns to watch the flight of his arrow , and the flush of victory spreads over his face even before the foe is destroyed ; his light and graceful form hardly appears to touch the ground , nor the grass to bend under his feet . But it is useless to attempt describing it . One could almost worship this wondrous representation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
