Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : Died he as the soldier joys to die from " Died he as the soldier joys to die " ( 1830 ) Died he as the soldier joys to die , When the banner he follows is waving high , And from voices , whose tones he remembers well , Loudly the cheers of triumph swell ; ' Till victory 's shout on the free breeze floats , He hath caught its sound , ' mid the wild war notes ,  --  One flash of hope , his eye grows dim  --  The land he hath served will remember him ? Died he as the patriot prays to rest , His labors all crowned , and his country blest ; Garrulous age , his echo of fame , Repeating the proud and cherish 'd name ; While the spirit of youth , like a charger stirred By the clarion 's swell , at the glorious word , Thirsting for danger , and spurning at fear , Bounds to follow his hero 's career ? He died , but not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain ! Nor the rolling drum , nor fife 's shrill tone Nerved him to stifle the low death groan : Nor the clasp of a comrade his cold hand thrilled , And bade his heart leap ere its pulse was stilled , That a message of love from his lips would be borne To the fond friends who never might greet his return . He died , and his memory passed away , Like the rain-bow gleam from the torrent 's spray ; And ne'er at his country 's high triumphs was heard His name , that should be the signal word , When from learning 's halls , and bowers of mirth , Young genius at Freedom 's call , starts forth , And ye read in the fearless , flashing eye , He comes to the battle , ' to do or die ! ' He died , and ' t was by the foeman 's hand , But not like a soldier by ball or brand ,  --   --  A felon 's fate was his fearful doom ! Yet gather young flowers to deck his tomb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopes that woo 'd him to victory  --  O , bright they shone ,  --  but there came a frown And his sun in its morning light went down ! And he died , and his death was a bitter one , For taunting foes were gazing on ; He heard their scorn on his lov 'd land poured , Yet his fettered hand could not grasp his sword .  --  He stood beneath the fatal tree , And gazed on the cord undauntedly !  --  If there came a pang , it blanched not his cheek  --  And the wish they had mocked , he disdained to speak . He died when the war-cloud was gathering fast , When havoc and horror were borne on the blast  --  But sure to the martyr of Freedom is given A glance of the future , when ripe for heaven  --   --  O didst thou not see , young Hale , in that hour , The eagle 's broad pinions in pride and power , Bearing the banner of liberty , Shadow thy own land from sea to sea ? And didst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty done , plucks the sting from death ?
