txt The undiscovered country , from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will . IF a man were to have eyes sensitive to some of the object in the prospect , but partially or totally blind to others , we should at once pronounce the organs of his vision to be defective ; because a good eye implies equal sensibility to whatever is revealed by the light of Heaven . Such a defect is known in those curious cases , in which some people are incapable of distinguishing some colors . Now , in all languages , knowledge has been expressed by a metaphor , or half-metaphor , borrowed from seeing ; which shews there is an analogy ( perhaps the closest in nature ) between the perception of the mind and the function of the eye . In some cases , they act together ; and it is impossible to separate them , though we may he able to distinguish . We may say , then , that a good mind should resemble a good eye , and he awake to all the proofs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of knowledge , has spread around it . It is natural to consider our perceptive faculties , intuition , reason , or whatever we choose to call it , as a kind of mental eye . All the possible arguments or proofs , which can be adduced on any side of any question , are a kind of complex landscape , lying around the investigating mind ; and , as a good eye discerns all the bright spots and dark corners in the literal horizon , and especially discerns what is the limit of its vision , and where are the boundaries between the clear and obscure ; so , I suppose , it is the office of a well-balanced mind , to take all considerations into view - to weigh the force of all proofs , and make its inward belief an exact picture of the external world . The field and the forest , the mountain and the meadow , are not more exactly pictured on the retina of the pleased spectator , than the parts of external truth are reflected in the cautious conclusions of a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearness to discern all that is true , and willingness to be impressed by it , certainly implies that we know the weakness of our powers as well as their strength . A good eye discerns not the light alone ; it distinguishes the faintest shadow that passes beneath the sun . To see , implies that we clearly know when we do not see . If a man is walking around mountains and comes to a cave , if he have good eyes , he as clearly knows that the cave is dark , as he knows that the atmosphere above it is light . Hence , one of the first articles of knowledge , in a well-regulated mind , is to know its own ignorance . On this , Socrates valued himself ; and thi* part of // knowledge he carefully taught . The wisest and best men have always delighted to dwell on this theme . They have considered a conscious sense of our ignorance as the best motive to awaken that curiosity which leads to improvement . The man that never makes the negative discovery , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler , is absolutely and entirely out of our depth , and beyond the extent of our utmost reach . * * * It is , indeed , in general , no more than effects , that the most knowing are acquainted with ; for , as to causes , they are as entirely in the dark as the most ignorant . What are the laws by which matter acts upon matter , but certain effects ; which some , having observed to be frequently repeated , have reduced to general rules ? The real nature and essence of beings , likewise , is what we are altogether ignorant of . All these things are so entirely out of our reach , that we have not the least glimpse of them . * Such is the condition of man , with all his boasted powers ; the best penetration only leads him to discover their weakness . Our knowledge , however , of the fallacy of any instrument we use , naturally leads us to distrust that instrument ; and all the objects it may assist us to accomplish . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the instrument by which we investigate and discover the truth . As the telescope is the instrument by which we look at the stars , and as the magic tool has converted their glittering points into worlds and systems , so reason-which is but the mind reasoning-is the instrument by which we have discovered the truths which lie in the remotest circle of our intellectual vision . But , if the instrument be so very fallacious , how can we help distrusting its results ? or , in other words , must not the known ignorance of man produce and justify a very large degree of skepticism ? It has always been pretended by infidels , that their doubts in religion were but the result of their superior discernment ; their skepticism was but the effect of selfknowledge . All men teach that man has very limited powers - that he reasons to be deceived , and asserts to be confuted . The best men have made it a motive of humility that we know so little . The ignorance of man is the universal theme ; even revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , if man be ignorant , he ought to know his ignorance ; he ought to know it to the utmost extent . Self-knowledge , then , leads to a distrust of his powers ; and distrust of our own powers is but another name for skepticism . It is obvious , too , that some of the finest minds have been remarkable for this suspending of the balance ; for this dubious , rather than settled , state of the intellect . Socrates made it his // glory . Cicero considered it the foundation of philosophy . We trace the fragments of it in the writings of Pascal , warm as he was in the cause of religion . Dryden tells us that , being inclined to skepticism in philosophy , he had no reason to impose his opinions on a subject which was above it - namely , religion . Franklin was inclined to the same state of mind ; and the most learned men , who have been without this latent skepticism - namely : sense of their own ignorance , sensibility to the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power over the human mind . I will adduce two examples , of men embracing opposite principles - Calvin and Hobbs . It is well known , that Hobbs has lost his power , as a philosopher , chiefly by his dogmatism . He is a very peculiar instance of a man , opposed to implicit faith , and yet demanding an implicit faith of his own . Of Calvin , I am free to say , that the chief impediment to profit in perusing his writings , is the want of sensibility to human ignorance . He seldom feels the force of an objection . Now , such a man we distrust . We feel as little inclined to allow the force of his conclusions , as we should be to weigh guineas in a pair of scales , which could only turn from an equilibrium on one side . Such , then , is one of the essential elements of human nature . So is man constituted by God . His powers are weak and fallacious ; and it is his duty to know it ; knowing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never doubt ; the intelligent must . And this broad propensity must be met some how by the claims of religion . When we turn to the Bible , at first view it may seem to be very little calculated to meet this state of mind . It requires a confident belief in all its doctrines ; it even suspends.salvation on the condition of that belief , lit seems to be addressed to our fears more than to our reason . When we read the history of some notorious impostor - such , for example , as Matthias , in Luther 's day , and Matthias , recently in New-York - we always find two ingredients in his delusion : one is implicit belief in what he says , and the other is , terror used as the chief argument to enforce that belief . In such cas*s , confidence is the great virtue , and incredulity is the only crime . Now , I apprehend , one of the greatest impediments to the general reception of the gospel , is an apprehended resemblance between its claims and the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on avowed infidels . Many have felt it secretly checking their confidence in the gospel , who are far from the concltision deliberately to reject it . They seem to half suspect , at least , that faith is the abandonrtient of reason ; that it is some* thing which sets aside all the ordinary operations of the human powers ; something which mistakes the nature of man , and puts confidence and credulity in the place of those very arguments on // which confidence and credit can alone justly be built . Hell-fire , it may be said , is a powerful motive when proved , but a very weak argument when it stands nakedly in place of a proof . My design shall be to prove , that the Bible does shew this very knowledge of human nature which is denied to it ; and that this natural skepticism , in well-regulated minds* is the very thing * hich makes it meet the wants of man . In the first place , then , this skepticism is not universal ; or , in other words , knowledge is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide in certain cases is as much a law of a well-regulated mind as to doubt in certain cases . The fallacy of the skeptic consists in this : that he concludes from the partial to the universal ; we are ignorant of some things , therefore we are ignorant of all . But this is exactly contrary to the spirit of induction , which requires us to bring in all the items which bear on the case . If I were to enter an orchard , in which there were an hundred trees , and , after examining ninety-nine of them , and finding no fruit , were to conclude , without examination , the same of the hundredTh , it would be hasty reasoning ; for that may be the only fruitful tree . Yet , this is what we are strongly tempted to do . Nay , we stop short of this , and jump to general conclusions , from a very inadequate number of observations . Sometimes , under strong prejudices and passions , the mind will sweep to the most general result from one excepted case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when be found , or thought he found his wife to be unfaithful to him - We are bastards , all And that most venerable man , which I Did call my father , was , I know not where , When I was stamped ; some coiner with his tools , Made me a counterfeit . Yet my mother seemed The Dian of that time ; so doth my wife The nonpareil of this . ' So Mrs. Page says , in the . Mierry I ' *ives of Windsor , ' after having heard Falstaff talk morality and tempt her virtue- ' Well , ' she says , I will find you twenty lascivious Turks ere one chaste man . All this is beautiful , considered as picturing our propensity to general conclusions ; but it shews how general conclusions , from inadequate premises , mislead us . When Sir Walter Raleigh burnt a part of his history because he was deceived as to a scuffle , which he saw through the window of his prison , he reasoned like a blockhead ; and I hope , for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human life is a compound scene ; if there is darkness in which we wander , there is daylight in which we can see ; and both these belong to human nature . To confound these distinctions , does not prove that skepticism is necessary , but that the skeptic has made a bad use of his eyes . There is no // universal midnight , Oh thou universal doubter , hut in thine own soul But , secondly , I will go farther , and say that the darkness illustrates the light ; as , without a metaphor , our ignorance proves our knowledge . In order to shew this , let us suppose a case . Suppose some metaphysician should come and endeavor to perplex my notions of perception . He sheuld say it is no proof , because you see a tree , that that tree exists ; for there is such a thing as dreaming ; and life may be but little else than a protracted dream . This , you know , is the philosophy of the Hindus ; and the great Berkley came very near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a man ? I should say to him , Sir , I have dreamed ; and my own experience informs , as clearly as I can conceive human information to speak , that a tree seen in a dream is a very different thing from a tree seen when awake . The error reflects light on that knowledge which stands in contrast with the error . If all perceptions were alike ; if I had never seen the dream in contrast with the reality ; I might suppose that seeing was dreaming . Or , to state the case stronger , ( for this comparison hardly comes up to the point ) if , when I turn my eyes on vacancy , 1 discern no tree , and when I turn my eyes to one point in the orchard , or forest , I perceive one , the negative perception strengthens the positive one , and rescues a comparing mind from all the sophistry of the skeptic . When we have completed the catalogue of the objects unknown , hy a kind of intellectual subtraction , we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the infancy of our reason , the objects of creation lie before us in a kind of magical chaos ; and we have not yet had leisure to separate the confusion into its elements . A partial discrimination may lead to a very general skepticism ; hut , as we proceed to discriminate , we know better when we ought to doubt and when to believe . So that skepticism , on some subjects , is so far from justifying skepticism on all , that it is the very thing that brings the mind to an intelligent conclusion . Perhaps the best illustration of these remarks might be borrowed from a department deeply connected with religion . It is well known that the genius of skepticism has attempted to pour her shadows over the page of history . There can be no doubt , that there are great uncertainties as to the origin of nations . Invention has supplied the place of investigation ; and imagination has spread her colors over the canvass which should have been filled with the images of truth . The first history of Greece is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the imposition of Lycurgus 's laws , on the Lacedemonians , appears more like the work of some rhetorician than the wisdom of a real statesman . And the early history of Rome is considered by many as very doubtful . Now , from all this , some hasty minds // would conclude that history is false . So with regard to characters and motives , how little can he known ! how much painting is mixed with the best authenticated narratives ! I have noticed that some of the most experienced statesmen , who live to a period just after the important events in which they have been active , are extremely apt to represent the history of their own times as uncertain . 0 , tell not me of history , ' said Sir Robert Walpole , for that I know to be false . ' The late President Adams considered , in one of his letters to Mr. Niles , of Baltimore , the real cause and character of things in our revolutionary war , as buried in oblivion ; and Aaron Burr , according to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , what a strong case ! Here are living witnesses , sagacious men , the very agents of the events , who represent history as uncertain . But a little reflection will shew us that even the wisest men , the Walpoles and Adamses , are deceived by their partial views . They stand in the very spot to generate doubt . Truth is the daughter of time ; and the agitated water must settle a little before it can become so clear as to allow us to see to the bottom . The first historians are always mistaken ; they are not only misled by their prejudices , but they have not the full amount of materials ; for history is a hemisphere , where star after star rises to complete the fullness of the sky . I regard the proofs of history like the dead bodies , after some great naval battle ; at first , they seem to be buried forever in the secrets of the ocean ; but they arise continually , one after another , and it becomes possible almost to count the number and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history are as clear as the minuter ones are obscure . There appear to be general laws of probability - a level of evidence , into which all things settle . These laws are just as certain as any other laws of nature ; and produce as deep a conviction in the mind of him who knows them . Skepticism in history has run through the same round it has in most other subjects . There are three states through which the mind commonly passes : first , we begin with a general confidence in all that is told - a blind credulity , often the parent of an equally blind uncertainty : secondly , comes the first period of discrimination , when the vision , knowing some things to be false , begins to doubt of all : then thirdly , follows the period of a more careful discrimination , when the mind , knowing what to receive and what to reject , settles into a rational doubt of some things , and equally rational confidence in others . This is the process of most inquiring minds . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion ; for public opinion , as well as individuals , has its childhood , its adolescence , and its maturity . There was a time when all writers , in Latin or Greek , were believed ; then , almost all were doubted ; an&amp;now , the current is // manifestly turning - applying severe laws of evidence to the witnesses of time . There can be no question , that the latter state is more clear from the proofs through which it has passed . No doubt that Niebuhr had a deeper conviction of the luminous points of Roman history from the dark spots he had detected , and the skill with which he had discriminated them ; and thus our position is true , that a rational doubt leads to a firmer belief . But , in the third place , skepticism - that is , the doubts of minds which doubt because they are discerning ; that healthful skepticism , which springs from knowledge , and leads to knowledge 's increase - must be regarded as the antithesis , not of revelation , but of reason ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to what man can discover by the legitimate use of his own faculties . I have already remarked , that man is ignorant , and that the wisest men have known this ; and , knowing this , they must feel a degree of skepticism . This was the foundation of Socrates ' doubts ; this made Cicero an academician . But , if this be the origin of skepticism , where does it terminate ? Certainly not in weakening the dictates of revelation , but in weakening the conclusions of that human reason which is so often opposed to revelation . Respecting revelation , there are two questions : what proves it a revelation ? and next , what does the revelation prove ? Now , supposing our faculties competent to answer the first question , notwithstanding their weakness , skepticism is scarcely at all opposed to the second ; because a revelation is given , on the supposition that man is too weak , in any other way , to find out its truth . In other words , our distrust , in the fallacy of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know comes from the reason of God . If I could prove that all the lamps in the world shed a feeble and fallacious light , it would be no evidence against the clearness of those beams which come from the sun . Perhaps , however , it will be asked , will not the alleged feebleness of our powers affect the first question ? Have we power to see the evidence of revelation ? Now , be it remarked , that all that is said of the mysteries of religion , the incomprehensibleness of its doctrines , the deep abyss of the divine essence , the whole subject being above reason , &amp;c. does not affect this question in the slightest degree . Religion may be compared to the patriarch 's ladder : if the height is lost in the clouds , the foot is on the ground . Only once allow that the evidences are on the level of human reason , and you have a succession of rounds to climb up to the other mysteries , which are settled on the authority of God . These two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion are of three kinds : first , the adaptation of its truths to our wants and consciences ; secondly , the prophecies and their fulfillment ; and thirdly , the miracles.
