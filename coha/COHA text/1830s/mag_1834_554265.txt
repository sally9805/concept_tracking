txt THOSE , who have been in the habit of regarding the Americans as a plain , matter-of-fact , unimaginative race , may be disposed to question the truth of the remark , that there has never been a people , whose fortunes were invested with a more romantic interest . Nothing could be more full of exciting and sometimes almost startling change , than the great panorama of our country 's progress , from her birthday to the present hour . We have before us the spectacle of two races , of opposite and very striking characters , brought into collision m the way best fitted to display their peculiar traits , and under circumstances requiring the exertion of their highest energies : of a handful of resolute individuals , erecting in the desert , not merely a temporary asylum for their own security , but the firm walls of a mighty and enduring empire , destined to exert a most momentous influence over the interests of the sons of men ; of cities , lifting their spires and turrets amidst the gloom of the scarcely trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in abundance to a shore , known only within a few generations to the charts of the adventurous mariner* of armies , marching forth to meet the hosts of powerful nations on the spot , where , but a century ago , the dead repose of the wilderness had been unbroken by the sounds of strife . These are hut a few of the circumstances , which constitute the strongly marked peculiarity of our national pr%ress ; yet even these are quite unlike any thing else , which history had ever exhibited before , and are of far higher interest and attraction . Our fortunes have not resembled those of the Eternal City , whose towers were reared with the rewards of rapine , and whose dominion was sealed exclusively with blood : they are not like those of England , rising by the painful and slow gradations of successive centuries from the very depths of barbarism but they are those of a nation , starting from an advanced point to enter on the race of glory , and unfolding all the moral and physical capacities demanded by its new position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , in which they were required . // A national condition , thus novel in its aspect , must naturally give occasion to an exhibition of character , not often witnessed in the stages of national advancement . The scene of action is a vast one , and requires more than common energy in the personages of the drama . In such an enterprise as the building up of an empire , the erection of a noble and comprehensive system , without any charts to guide those who are employed in the achievement , without any models which they are to imitate , it is not enough , that the leaders should be gifted with commanding power : the centurions , the captains of fifty , and the captains of ten , must rely upon their own resources for the execution of their subordinate , but most important duty . They must have understanding to devise , as well as hands to execute ; in those exigencies which constantly occur , where the file affords no precedent , their talent must find its own way , and they must meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are able to command . And it will be found , on the most cursory examination of our history , that every kind and degree of capacity have actually been displayed . At an early period , we see the high-souled chivalry of Smith ,  --  the far discerning wisdom and fixed resolve of Winthrop ,  --  the stout heart and vigorous arm of Standish ,  - -  and the various qualities of an almost countless host ,  --  all employed , each in its appointed sphere , in accomplishing the different portions of the same great task . Coming down to later times , to the period of the Revolution , we are presented with even more striking illustrations of the force of individual character ; they crowd upon the recollection of all who are familiar with our history . We are led by these considerations to regard the work before us with more than common interest . It would be a very superfluous task , to explain the qualifications of Mr. Sparks for the labor which he has undertaken ; apart from any others , the peculiar nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public in many valuable forms , is such as to afford him unusual facilities for its proper execution . His plan embraces the lives of all persons , who have been distinguished in America , from the date of its first discovery to the present time . The completion of this scheme , as he very justly observes , C would embrace a perfect history of the country , of its social and political progress , its arts , sciences , literature , and improvements of every kind ; since these re* // ceive their impulse and direction from a comparatively few eminent individuals , whose achievements of thought and action it is the province of the hiographer to commemorate . A hint of such a result , ' he proceeds , ' would certainly not be ventured by the editor , if he were not permitted to rely on the aid of a large number of coadjutors , whose names might afford a pledge of its attainment . ' Whatever may he thought of the practicability of this scheme , in its full extent , no one can doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if any thing were required to demonstrate its importance , we should find it in the volume , which is already finished . *It is precisely such as we had wished and hoped to see ; and it affords a happy augury of the character of those which are to follow . They will supply a very important deficiency in our literature . We do not mean to intimate , that the biography of eminent individuals in this country has been very much neglected ; on the contrary , a vast number of memorials , from the kingly pyramid to the lowly headstone , have been already reared in memory of the honored dead ; but there are many others , to whom a nation 's gratitude is due , and to whom this debt of justice has not yet been paid ; there are many , whose history is not yet recorded , or if it he so , not in such a form , as would be likely to survive them long . In the very volume before us , we find the lives of four individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of decided claims to notice and remembrance , whose names required this conimemoration , to give them their just place in the public view . We shall endeavor to give our readers an idea of its contents , by borrowing from it a brief sketch of the history of these individuals , together with such extracts as our limits will permit . The first in the series is the biography of General John Stark , the well known hero df Bennington , whose adventures are here related by Mr. Edward Everett , with his usual elegance ; and the account of them is full of interest . General Stark was one of those men of iron ; formed by the harsh discipline of border warfare , who are insensible to fear , and indifferent to danger . He resided in early life at Derryfield , now Manchester , in New Hampshire . At the age of twenty-four , while on a hunting excursion at a distance from the English settlements , he was taken prisoner by the Indians , and soon overcame their prejudices and commanded their respect by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his habitual contempt of peril , of those qualities which they recognised as the highest virtues . Several curious anecdotes , illustrative of this fact , are related in the volume . He was soon after ransomed ; hut he remained long enough in the somewhat unpleasant society of the Indians , to acquire a full acquaintance with their habits and character , and a familiarity with suffering and privation , which qualified him for the rough service in which he was subsequently to engage . In 1754 , the Seven Years ' War began : the great school , as Mr. Everett very justly terms it , in which were trained the leaders of the Revolution . An expedition against Crown Point was included in the plan of campaign for the following year , and Stark received the commission of lieutenant in a corps of rangers , enlisted for this purpose . He continued in the service until nearly the close of the war ; rose very early to the rank of Captain ; and exhibited throughout , in some very critical emergencies , the cool sagacity and daring bravery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following anecdote sufficiently illustrates his possession of the former quality . In the month of March , 1757 , Fort William Henry was saved by the forethought and vigilance of Captain Stark , then , in the absence of Major Rogers , acting Commander in Chief of the rangers . While going the rounds on the evening of the 16th , he overheard some of his rangers , planning a celebration of St. Patrick 's ( the following ) day . A large portion of this corps was , like himself of Irish origin . Knowing that there were also a great many Irish among the regular troops , he justly foresaw the danger to which the post would be exposed , at the close of a day to he spent in excess and intoxication . He accordingly gave directions to the sutler that no spirituous liquors should be issued , except by authority of written orders from himself ; and when applied to for these orders , he pleaded the lameness of his wrist , produced by a wound , as an excuse for not giving them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Irish troops of the regular army , forming a part of the garrison , celebrated the day with their accustomed license and excess . The French , acquainted with the Irish custom , and calculating upon the consequent disability of the garrison , planned an attack for that night . They were , hawever , repul3ed by Stark 's sober rangers , while the stu* pified regulars were coming to their senses . * 34 . At the opening of the Revolution , Captain Stark did not // hesitate to sacrifice all his emoluments and prospects as a British officer , by embracing and actively maintaining the patriotic cause ; and he labored with extraordinary zeal in preparation for the conflict , which was coming on . His military talent and experience were too well known to be overlooked . On receiving the intelligence of the battle of Lexington , he hurried to the scene of action , with many volunteers from New Hampshire , who were shortly after formed into two regiments by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts . The command of one of these was given to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail-fence at the memorable battle of Bunker Hill , he exhibited anew the same cool bravery , for which he had now become distinguished . At Trenton and Princeton , also , he was by the side of Washington . In 1777 , some junior officers , for what cause is not explained , were promoted over him , and he retired from the service ; even then , he fitted out for the army all the members of his family who were old enough to join it , and continued to exhibit his attachment to the cause , by all the means remaining in his power . But this very neglect of Congress , which was then the subject of general regret , became the means of giving new lustre to his name . The situation of the patriots was at this time very critical . Burgoyne , with his well-appointed army , was advancing from the north , and the important post of Ticonderoga was surrendered without a blow . The frontier was therefore left defenceless . It is animating to survey the conduct of New Hamnpshire in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminated : but , at the summons of the Committee of Safety , it was convened anew ; the whole militia of the State was formed into two brigades , the command of one of which was given to Stark ; and he was ordered to march immediately at the head of a suitable force to stop the progress of the enemy on the frontier . He accepted the command , on the condition , that he should be responsible only to the authorities of New Hampshire ; and it is a curious fact , that his refusal to march ivest of the Hudson , according to the orders of General Schuyler ,  --  a refusal which was no less judicious in itself , than beneficial to the country ,  --  was the means of placing him in a position to strike the vigorous and effective blow at Bennington . B urgoyne , confiding in his own strength or the weakness of his enemy , detached a body of troops , under the command of // Lieut . Colonel Baum , with orders to obtain supplies for the army , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconcert the councils of the patriots . This detachment was put in motion at the very time when Stark arrived at Bennington . His dispositions were promptly made , and on the 14th of August , he met the enemy . On this and the following day , some skirmishing took place , but nothing at all decisive . The subsequent occurrences can be properly given only in the words of Mr. Everett . On the morning of the 16th , General Stark was joined by Col. Symonds , with a body of Berkshire militia , and made preparations for an attack , according to a plan proposed by the General and agreed upon in a council of war . The German troops , with their battery , were advantageously posted upon a rising ground at a bend in the Wollamsac ( a tributary of the Hoosac , ) on its north bank . The ground fell off to the north and west , a circumstance of which Stark skilfully took advantage . Peters 's corps of Tories were intrenched on the other side of the stream , in lower ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little river , that meanders through the scene of the action , is fordable in all places . Stark was encamped upon the same side of it as the Germans , but , owing to its serpentine course , it crossed his line of march twice on his way to their position . Their post was carefully reconnoitred at a mile 's distance , and the plan of attack was arranged in the following manner . Colonel Nichols , with two hundred men , was detached to attack the rear of the enemy 's left , and Colonel Herrick , with three hundred men , to fall upon the rear of their right , with orders to form a junction before they made the assault . Colonels Hubbard and Stickney were also ordered to advance with two hundred men on their right and one hundred in front , to divert their attention from the real point of attack . The action commenced at three o'clock in the afternoon on the rear of the enemy 's left , when Colonel Nichols , with great precision , carried into effect the dispositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other portion of the little army . General Stark himself moved forward slowly in front , till he heard the sound of the guns from Colonel Nichols 's party , when he rushed upon the Tories , and in a few moments the action became general . " It lasted , " says Stark , in his official report , " two hours , and was the hottest I ever saw . It was like one continued clap of thunder . " The Indians , alarmed at the prospect of being enclosed between the parties of Nichols and Herrick , fled at the commencement of the action , their main principle of battle array // 472 April , being to contrive or to escape an ambush or an attack in the rear . The Tories were soon driven over the river , and were thus thrown in confusion on the Germans , who were forced from their breast-work . Baum made a brave and resolute defence . The German dragoons , with the discipline of veterans , preserved their ranks unbroken , and , after their ammunition was expended , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but they were overpowered and obliged to give way , leaving their artillery and baggage on the field . They were well enclosed in two breast-works , which , owing to the rain on the 15th , they had constructed at leisure . But notwithstanding this protection , with the advantage of two pieces of cannon , arms and ammunition in perfect order , and an auxiliary force of Indians , they were driven from their intrenchments by a band of militia just brought to the field , poorly armed , with few bayonets , without field pieces , and with little discipline . The superiority of numbers , on the part of the Americans , will , when these things are considered , hardly be thought to abate any thing from the praise due to the conduct of their commander , or the spirit and courage of his men . The enemy being driven from the field , the militia dispersed to collect the plunder . Scarcely had they done so , before intelligence was brought that a reinforcement from the British army was on the march , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colonel Breyman , which had been despatched by General Burgoyne , on receiving from Baum intelligence of his position . The rain of the preceding day and the badness of the roads had delayed his arrival : a circumstance which exercised a very important influence on the fate of the battle . On the approach of Breyman 's reinforcements , the flying party of Baum made a rally , and the fortune of the day was for a moment in suspense . Stark made an effort to rally the militia : but happily at this juncture , Colonel Warner 's regiment came up fresh and not yet engaged , and fell with vigor upon the enemy . This regiment , since the battle fought at Hubbardston , had been stationed at Manchester . It had been reduced , by the loss sustained in that action , to less than two hundred men . Warner , their Colonel , as we have seen , wa* at Bennington , and was with General Stark on the 14th . The regiment at Manchester was under the command of Major Samuel Safford . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on a scouting party , and other causes , it was not possible to put the regiment in motion on the 14th ; on the 15th they marched for Bennington . Owing to the heavy rain of that day , it was near midnight , when the troops arrived within a mile of l3ennington . Fatigued with the march of the preceding day , their arms and equipments injured by // the rain , and their ammunition scanty , a considerable portion of the ensuing day was exhausted , before the men could prepare themselves for battle . The first assault had been made in the manner described , and the enemy driven from the field , before this regiment came into action . At the most critical moment of the day , when the arrival of Breyman 's reinforcement threatened a reverse of its good fortune , Warner 's troops appeared on the field . Stark , with what men he had been able to rally , pushed forward to his assistance , and the battle was contested with great obstinacy on both sides till sunset , when the.enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying forces until dark , and was obliged to draw off his men , to prevent them from firing at each other under cover of night . " With one hour more of daylight , " as he writes in his official report , " he would have captured the whole body . " The fruits of the victory were four pieces of brass cannon , several hundred stand of arms , eight brass drums , a quantity of German broadswords , and about seven hundred prisoners . Two hundred and seven were killed upon the spot ; the number of the wounded was not ascertained . Colonel Baum was wounded and made a prisoner , and shortly after died of his wounds . The loss of the Americans was thirty killed and forty wounded . ' - pp. 84-89 . Several anecdotes of this affair have been recorded , and the following deserves a repetition . Among the reinforcements from Berkshire county came a clergyman , with a portion of his flock , resolved to make bare the arm of flesh against the enemies of the country . Before daylight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows . " We the people of Berkshire , have been frequently called upon to fight , but have never been led against the enemy . We have now resolved , if you will not let us fight , never to turn out again. ** General Stark asked him " if he wished to march then , when it was dark and rainy. ** " No , " was the answer . " Then , " continued Stark , " if the Lord should once more give us sunshine , and I do not give you fighting enough , I will never ask you to come again . " The weather cleared up in the course ti ' the day , and the men of Berkshire followed their spiritual guide into action . ' - p. 97 . The consequences of this battle were no less striking , than the skill and conduct of the conqueror . Burgoyne 's operations were completely paralyzed , and , in the following month , he capitulated with his army . Stark received the thanks of his own State , and of Congress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued until the close of the aelixe period of the war . The remainder of his life // presents no incident of material importance ; he died in 1S*2 , at the age of ninety-four , having survived all the generals of the Revoh*tion , with the single exception of Sumpter . His history is , however , very interesting and instructive ; it shows how much may be effected by resolute patriotism , under circumstances of the most unfavorable character ; and we are happy that it has been at length presented to the public in the very attractive form , in which every thing from the pen of Mr. Everett is sure to be invested . The life of Charles Brockden Brown is the second of the series ; and presents us , in the history of an amiable and retiring scholar , with a striking contrast to the adventure of the bold and active l ) artisan . It is written by Mr. William H. Prescott , and executed with great discrimination , as well as with his usual taste and elegance . We are inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day , fully appreciated : the circumstances of the country , particularly as relates to literature , are so altered since his time , that we can hardly represent him to our fancy as entering upon a scarcely trodden track , and , though acquiring reputation , deserving even more than he acquired . Though gentle as a child , and with more than just humility in his estimation of his own deserts , there was something bold and original in his character ; his tastes and pursuits were formed by solitary musing , instead of being stimulated by the example or success of others . In the outset of his career , this spirit of independence led him into the adoption and defence of many wild theories ; but his natural good sense found its own way , and he returned to the true path , as the tempest-tost vessel , after falling for a moment from her course , again obeys her helm , and walks in triumph on the sea . He was one of those , who take more pleasure in communion with their own hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow men ; a deep shade of melancholy , the result perhaps of constant bodily infirmity , hung over him ; and he fled to literary engagements rather as a relief than as a welcome task . His melancholy and retirement were not , however , of that kind , which render the soul insensible to any happiness or suffering but its own . Mr. Prescott has given a delightful IJicture of his character and social feelings , particularly at the period , when , after having accomplished many of the purposes of life , he was sinking to the grave by slow decay . The false opinions , by which his earlier years were overclouded , had // then yielded to the convictions of his manly and discriminating intellect ; and he went to his rest , not only in the full persuasion of religious truth , but exhibiting a fine example of its power . It is upon Brown 's romances , that his fame will principally rest , though they were evidently written with little care , and with a rapidity which gave no indication , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , was published in 1798 , when he was at the age of twenty-seven . This was some time prior to the period , which may be not inappropriately termed the era of romances . They were then the reader 's luxury , rather than his daily bread ; the embroidery , and not the texture of the literary garment . The sentimental novel had not yet made its first ascension ; and the historical romance was still to he discovered . As far as he can be said to have followed any model , it is Godwin ; though even here , as his biographer remarks with truth , there is no servile iniitation : the resemblance consists rather in some characteristics of style and subject , than in the substance ; and it is worthy of remark , that these are the precise qualities in which he least excels . His leading defect is a want of taste , rather than of power ; he wished to make an anatomical dissection of the heart , to develope all its qualities and passions ; but he forgot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , are not remarkably poetical . in laboring to be striking , he lost sight of truth and nature . There was a fearful grandeur in his exhibition of the soul , driven onward by resistless passion ; but the different portions of the picture are not in perfect keeping , and the imperfection of some impairs the effect and impression of the rest . The real secret of the art was yet to be revealed ; Scott , perhaps , was the first to disclose it : it was , that the heroes of romance may live and move and act like other men , without ceasing to be heroes . The error of Brown consisted in his acting on a false theory ; but it is perhaps the strongest proof which could he given of his real power , that , be his imperfections what they may , his works are still read with admiration , if not with pleasure , and that , even while we most regret the selection of his subjects , we are not the less impressed with respect for the talent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is applicable to his style ; it sometimes repels us by its affectation , or oflbnds us by its want of taste : but it is manly and peculiar , and when the subject rises to a certain level , is full of life and strength . // Mr. Prescott , though a liberal biographer , has not suffered his partialities to render him insensible to the defects of this amiable writer ; he has , on the contrary , pointed out several of them with great taste and judgment , in commenting upon the romances . His remarks on Wieland , in particular , are a model ofjudicious criticism . In this tale , the whole machinery is set in motion by the agency of ventriloquism ; the hero is thus wrought up to the murder of his *vife and children , the secret agent all the while being actuated by no other apparent motive , than a wanton spirit of mischief . The improbability here is too violent for the credulity of the easiest believer . We are led onward by the strong painting of fiery passion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equally illsatisfied with the author and ourselves . It is but just to say , however , that all these tales were written before the author reached the age of thirty-four , and that the residue of his life was devoted to other labors , in the field of politics and general literature . In the year 1809 , the illness , which had so long attended him , began to assume a more serious aspect , and , being very averse to foreign travel , he made some journeys with the faint hope of restoration . The account of the conclusion of his life will best be given in the words of Mr. Prescott . Finding these brief excursions productive of no salutary change in his health , he at length complied with the entreaties of his friends , and determined to ' try the effect of a voyage to Europe in the following spring . That spring he was doomed never to behold . About the middle of November , he was taken with a violent pain in his left side , for which he was bled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His malady was not attended with the exemption from actual pain , with which nature seems sometimes willing to compensate the sufferer for the length of its duration . His sufferings were incessant and acute ; and they were supported , not only without a murmur , but with an appearance of cheerfulness , . to which the hearts of his friends could but ill respond . He met the approach of death in the true spirit of Christian philosophy. , No other dread , but that of separation from those dear to him on earth , had power to disturb his tranquillity for a moment . But the temper of his mind in his last hours is best disclosed in a communication from that faithful partner , who contributed , more than any other , to support him through them . " He always felt for others more than for himself ; and the evidences of sorrow in those around him , which could not at all times be suppressed , appeared to affect // him more than his own sufferings . Whenever he spoke of the probability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indirect and covered manner , as " you must do so and so , w henl am absent , " or " when I am asleep . " He surrendered not up one faculty of his soul but with his last hreath . He saw death in every step of his approach , and viewed him as a messenger that brought with him no terrors , lie frequently expressed his resignation ; hut his resignation was not produced by apathy or pain ; for while he bowed with submission to the Divine will , he felt with the keenest sensibility his se parat*on from those who made this world but too dear to him . Towards the last he spoke of death without disguise , and appeared to wish to prepare his friends for the event , which he felt to be approaching . A fe*v days previous to his change , as sitting up in the bed , he fixed his eyes upon the sky , and desired not to be spoken to until he first spoke . In this position , and with a serene countenance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , " when I desired you not to speak to me , I had the most transporting and sublime feelings I have ever experienced : I wanted to enjoy them and know how long they would last ; " concluding with requesting her to remember the circumstance . A visible change took place in hiixi on the morning of the 19th of February , 1810 ; and he caused his family to he assembled around his bed , when he took leave of each one of them in the most tender and impressive manner . He lingered however a few days longer , remaining in the full possession of his faculties , to the *25*d of the month , when he expired without a struggle . He had reached the thirty-ninth year of his age , the month preceding his death . The family which he left , consisted of a widow and four children . ' There was nothing striking in Brown 's personal appearance . His manners , however , were distinguished by a gentleness and unaffected simplicity , which rendered them extremely agreeable . He possessed colloquial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the practised and ready writer . His rich and various acquisitions supplied an unfailing fund for the edification of his hearers . They did not lead him , however , to affect an air of superiority , or to assume too prominent a part in the dialogue , especially in large or mixed company , where he was rather disposed to be silent , reserving the display of his powers for the unrestrained intercourse of friendship . He was a stranger , not only to base and malignant passions , but to the paltry jealousies which sometimes sour the intercourse of men of letters . On the contrary , he was ever prompt to do ample justice to the merits of others . His heart was warm with the feeling of universal be // nevolence . Too sanguine and romantic views had exposed him to some miscalculations , and consequent disappointments ; from which , however , he was subsequently retrieved by the strength of his . understanding , which , combining with what may be called his natural education of soul , enabled him to settle the soundest principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after life . ' - pp. 170-173 . Such were the last hours , and such the character of one , to whom his countrymen have scarcely yet been just ; who cultivated literature , at a time when literature in this country bad few rewards or honors to bestow ; and who amply merits the still higher praise , of adding to his literary ardor a still warmer zeal for manly sentiment and virtue . We next turn to the history of the chivalrous Montgomery , one of the earliest and noblest victims of the Revolutionary cause ; and the purity of style in which General Armstrong has related it , only increases our regret , that so little is remembered of his short , but honorable career . Short as it was , it acquired for him an enviable name ; at a period when noble qualities were by no means rare , he was distinguished by his combination of the sterner with the gentler virtues ; and though he perished at the very opening of the war , and in the moment of disaster , his loss was universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is briefly told .

At the age of eighteen , be procured a commission in the British army , and began his career of active service in this country ; the regiment to which he belonged being attached to the expedition , prepared in 1758 , for the capture of Louisburg . In this enterprise , and in two subsequent expeditions for the reduction of St. Pierre and Fort Royal , in Martinico , and of Havana in Guba , his bravery and talent were equally conspicuous . From the period intervening between the termination of the war , and his retirement from the army in 1772 , nothing relating to his personal history appears to have been preserved ; and there is no evidence , excepting that of vague tradition , of the causes which induced him to retire ; it is rumored , that it was in consequence of a persuasion , that the agency of government was twice employed to prevent him from procuring a majority . Imme .. diately afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the peaceful pursuits of agriculture , until in April , 1775 , he was elected a member of the first Provincial Convention // held in New York . Two months afterwards , when the National Congress began to organize an army , the commission of a brigadier-general was bestowed on him . The attention of that body was very early directed towards the invasion of Canada : it was proposed to effect this object by two routes , one by the Sorel , the other by the Kennebec ; and for these purposes , two armaments were formed , the more important of which , designed for the first mentioned route , was assigned to General Montgomery . The history of his efforts to accomplish this enterprise is very generally known : in two months from the time of his departure from Ticonderoga , he entered Montreal , and though laboring under the discouragements arising from the inadequacy of his means , prepared himself for the great object of his hopes , the reduction of Quebec . - He determined , if possible , to effect this by an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the history of this assault , and its unfortunate result , in the animated language of the author . The troops were ordered to parade in three divisions in the morning of the 31st of December ; the New York regiments and part of Easton 's Massachusetts militia , at Holland House ; the Cambridge detachments and Lamb 's company of artillerists , with one field piece , at Captain Morgan 's quarters ; and the two small corps of Livingston and Brown , at their respective grounds of parade . To the first and second of these divisions were assigned the two assaults , to be made on opposite sides of the lower town ; and to the third , a series of demonstrations or feigned attacks on the opposite sides of the upper . Under these orders the movement began between three and four o'clock in the morning , from the heights of Abraham ; Montgomery advancing at the head of the first division by the river road , round the foot of Cape Diamond to Aunce au Mere ; and Arnold , at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saut des Matelots . Both columns found the roads much obstructed by snow : but to this obstacle on the route taken by Montgomery were added huge masses of ice , thrown up from the river , and so narrowing the passage round the foot of the promontory , as greatly to retard the progress , and disturb the order of the march . These difficulties being at last surmounted , the first barrier was approached , vigorously attacked , and rapidly carried . A moment , and but a moment , was now employed to re-excite the ardor of the troops , which the fatigue of the march and the severity of the weather had somewhat abated . " Men of New York , " exclaim- // April , Sparks 's American Biography . ed Montgomery , " you will not fear to follow where your General leads ,  --  march on ; " then placing himself again in the front , he pressed eagerly forward to the second barrier , and when but a few paces from the mouths of the British cannon , received three wounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , in the first month of his fortieth year , Major General Richard ALontgornery . ' It is needless to add , that this event decided the fortune of the day ; the subsequent efforts served only vainly to display the gallantry of the assailing army . The corpse of Montgomery was interred within the walls of the city , which he had nearly made his own ; all hostile recollections yielded to the respect and admiration due to a gallant and honorable foe . The following is the estimate of his character and personal qualities , which is formed by his biographer . In this brief story of a short and useful life , we find all the elements which enter into the composition of a great man and distinguished soldier ; " a happy physical organization , combining strength and activity , and enabling its possessor to encounter laborious days and sleepless nights , hunger and thirst , all changes of weather , and every variation of climate . " To these corporal advantages was added a mind , cool , discriminating , energetic and fearless ; thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of the day , and habitually directed by a high and unchangeable moral sense . That a man so constituted , should have won " the golden opinions " of friends and foes , is not extraordinary . The most eloquent men of the British Senate became his panegyrists ; and the American Congress hastened to testify for him " their grateful remembrance , profound respect , and high veneration . " A monument to his memory was accordingly erected , on which might justly be inscribed the irnpressive lines of the poet . " Brief , brave and glorious was his young career : His mourners were two hosts , his friends and foes ; And fitly may the stranger , lingering here , Pray for his gallant spirit 's bright repose ; For he was Freedom 's champion , one of those , The few in number , who had not o'erstept The charter to chastise , which she kesto*** On such as wield her weapons ; lie had kept The whiteness of his soul , and thus men o'er him wept . " ' The volume closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary personage , Ethan Allen ; who added very few of the graces of chivalry to his iron nerve // and unconquerable spirit . This is the production of Mr. Sparks , who has brought to light many particulars of Allen 's history not generally known , and presented them in a very clear and interesting narrative . The precise time of his birth is not ascertained , but , with several bther members of his family , he emigrated in early life , from Connecticut , his native State , to the New Hampshire Grants , which have since been erected into the flourishing State of Vermont . The title to these Grants had long been the subject of controversy between New Hampshire and New York ; Wentworth , the royal governor of the former , had issued patents , under which tracts had been sold to a great number of settlers , among whom were Allen* and his brothers . New York , in order to assert her claim , granted new patents to other persons , covering the same lands on which the grantees of New Hampshire had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were not quieted for many years . Allen , whose boldness and energy gave him a strong ascendancy over the minds of those , around him , took a very leading part in the vindication of what they deemed their legal rights . We have not room to relate the history of these transactions . The settlers , or , as they were called , Green Mountain Boys , resisted the New York claim in the courts of Albany , but the judgments of the courts being unhesitatingly pronounced against them , they took decisive means to prevent their execution , by dispossessing those who entered under them , and treating the civil officers with the least imaginable ceremony . We may perceive to what extent the exasperation on both sides was carried , from the fact , that a proclamation was early issued by the Governor of New York , offering a reward of twenty pounds for the apprehension of Allen , and that of ei ht other persons , who were associated with him . A law of a most remarkable character was enacted by the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This law began with naming Allen and several others ; it then empowered the Governor and Council to issue an order , requiring these person to surrender themselves to justice ; if they neglected to do this , they were to be adjudged and taken as convicted , and to suffer death if indicted for a capital offence , and the Supreme Court was empowered to award execution , in the same manner as if there had been an actual trial and sentence . As Allen himself remarked , these printed sentences of death were not partic // ularly fatal , but it is difficult to say to what extent the contest would have been carried , had not the Revolutionary troubles at this time begun to absorb all others . The capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point , which was effected by parties from Connecticut and the New Hampshire Grants , with Allen at their head , gave an indication of the spirit with which he was about to enter on the new scene of conflict . When this had been accomplished , he took command of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an enterprise , the credit of suggesting which belongs to him , and which , had it been undertaken by Congress with more activity and vigor , weuld not improbably have proved successful . A regiment of Green Mountain Boys was raised , under the authority of the Provincial Congress of New York , to be connected with the army : for some reason , not now remembered , Allen did not receive the command of it , but attached himself to General Schuyler 's army as a volunteer . He was first employed to circulate an address , issued by the General , among the inhabitants of Canada , and to ascertain their disposition ; this commission he executed in a very satisfactory manner ; and he next proceeded to raise a corps of Canadian volunteers , with which he was about to join the army of Montgomery , now the leader of the Canada expedition , when , at the suggestion of Major Brown , whom he encountered at the head of another party , he was induced to lend his aid in an attack on Montreal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was faithfully performed ; but as Brown did not adhere to his , Allen was compelled to surrender . General Prescott , the commander of the British force at Montreal , after threatening him with a halter at Tyburn , gave orders that he should be bound hand and foot , and sent on board a vessel of war . With his ankles confined in shackles , to which was attaclied a bar of iron eight feet long , and with his hands in fetters , he was accordingly thrust into the lowest part of the vessel , without a bed or any article of furniture . In this condition he was taken to Quebec , where he was transferred for the moment to the charge of a gentleman , who removed his irons ; but when Arnold appeared with his army in the neighborhood of-that city , he was placed on board another vessel , manacled as before , and sent to England . During this voyage of forty days , Allen and thirty-three others , in fetters like himself , were confined in a single apartment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arrival in England , he was still suffered to remain in irons , though he was treated with somewhat less harshness . Notwithstanding the comparative amelioration of his circumstances , Colonel Allen 's mind was not perfectly at ease in regard to the future . General Prescott 's hint about his gracing a halter at Tyburn , rested upon his thoughts , and gave him some uneas*-ness amidst the uncertain prospects now before him . But despondency and fear made no part of his character , and , even when hope failed , his fortitude was triumphant . Prepared for the worst that might happen , he bethought himself of trying the effect of a stratagem . He asked permission to write a letter to the Continental Congress , which was granted . He depicted in vivid colors the treatment he had received from the beginning of his captivity , but advised the Congress not to retaliate , till the fate that awaited him in England should be known , and then to execute the law of retaliation not in proportion to the small influence of his character in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause for which he had suffered . The despatch was finished , and handed over for inspection to the officer , who had permitted him to write . This officer went to him the next day , and reprimanded him for what he called the impudence of inditing such an epistle . " Do you think we are fools in England , " said he , " and would send your letter to Congress with instructions to retaliate on our own people ? I have sent your letter to Lord North . " This was precisely the destination for which the writer intended it , and he felt a secret satisfaction that his artifice had succeeded . ' - pp. 304-5 . It seems almost incredible at this day , that an individual , whose only offence consisted in his having fought the battles of his country , should have been thus dealt with by the officers of a civilized and enlightened nation ; but patriotism was not then a pardonable offence ; it bore the united names of treason and rebellion . Owing however , either to the reprobation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaces of retaliation , the British Government at length resolved to treat Allen and his companions as prisoners of war , and send them to their country . On his return , and until the period of his final release , he had an additional measure of harsh usage and privation to undergo , which would have broken a less stern and haughty spirit . The whole term of his captivity was two years and seven months . Insensibility , ' as Mr. Sparks observes , made no part of his nature , ' and the following mcident , // which occurred towards the close of ' his imprisonment , deserves to be recorded , as illustratiye of his character . The Lark frigate , on board of which were Mr. Lovell , Colonel Allen and their companions , sailed from Halifax about the middle of October . Luckily they found themselves at last under an officer , Captain Smith , who treated them with the politeness of a gentleman , and with the feelings of a man capable of sympathizing in the distresses of the unfortunate . The first interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on deck , he met me with his hand , welcomed me to his ship , invited me to dine with him that day , and assured me that I should be treated its a gentleman , and that he had given orders that I should be treated with respect by the ship 's crew . This was so unexpected and sudden a transition , that it drew tears from my eyes , which all the ill usages I had before met with were not able to produce ; nor could I at first hardly speak , but soon recovered myself , and let him know that I felt anxiety of mind in reflecting , that his situation and mine were such , that it was not probable it would ever be in my power to return the favor . Captain Smith replied , that he had no reward in view , but only treated me as a gentleman ought to be treated . lie said , this is a mutable world , and one gentleman never knows but it may be in his power to help another . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had not been at sea many days , when it was discovered that a conspiracy was on foot to destroy the Captain and the principal officers , and seize the ship . An American captain , who had commanded an armed vessel , and been recently taken prisoner , was the chief conspirator . He revealed his designs to Colonel Allen and Mr. Lovell , requesting their cooperation in bringing over the other prisoners , about thirty in number , and telling them that several of the crew were ready to join in the plot . It was known that there were thirty-five thousand pounds in money in the vessel , and the plan of the conspirators was to take the ship into an American port , where they expected to divide the booty according to the usual rules of captures . Without waiting to discuss the laws of war , or to reason about the infamy and criminality of such an act with men , who were prepared to execute it , Colonel Allen declared with his usual decision and vehemence , that he would not listen a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , it was a base and wicked return for the kind treatment they had received , and that he would at every personal hazard defend Captain Smith 's life . This rebuff was unexpected by the conspirators , and it threw them into a dis // tressing dilemma , since the fear of detection was now as appal . ling to them as the danger of their original enterprise . They then requested him to remain neutral , and let them proceed in their own way , but this he peremptorily refused : and he finally succeeded in quelling the conspiracy , by adhering to'his resolution , and promising , that , as he had been consulted in confidence , he would not divulge the matter , if the leaders would pledge themselves instantly to abandon the design . In the present state of things they were glad to accept such terms . At the conclusion of this affair , Colonel Allen was forcibly reminded of the words of Captain Smith . ' - pp. 315-317 . Congress endeavored to repair the wrongs of one who had thus suffered in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Continental army ; hut it is not known that he entered upon actual service . The flame of the old controversy between Vermont and New York had burst forth anew , and Allen , as before , engaged in the conflict with his whole heart and soul ; laboring , haranguing and writing , with abundant zeal and with no small effect , in the old and familiar cause . His fellow-citizens expressed their sense of the value of his aid , by appointing him general and commander in chief of the militia of the $tate , a station , at that time , of great responsibility . Propositions were made him by the enemy , to detach Vermont from her allegiance ; these he communicated to Congress , and continued to defend the interests of his State and country until the conclusion of the war , when he retired to private life , and devoted himself to the occupation of a farmer . But his pursuits were not exclusively of this character . In 1784 , he published a work , which his biographer denominates a crude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sophistry , knowledge and ignorance , ingenuity and presumption , are mingled together in a chaos , which the author denominates a system . ' In this production , which he entitled a Compendious System of Natural Religion , he argues that the Christian Revelation and the Old Testament are false , while he declares his belief in a future state of reward and punishment . He appears , in fact , to have embraced the principles of deism . The short residue of his life was not distinguished by any important incident . He died at Burlington , in 1789 . This biography furnishes a striking inszance , if any such were wanting , of the industry and talent with which Mr. Sparks // illustrates every subject on which he is employed . There is a great variety of interesting detail in *his article , to which we have found no space , even to allude . It is , however , an act of justice to the memory of Ethan Allen to say , that his biographer has formed a more favorable estimate of his character , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarseness , his presumption and skepticism , though not to be defended , are yet palliated by the circumstances of his early education and condition . On the other hand , he was frank and generous ; courageous in the most emphatic sense of the word ; benevolent and kind in his private relations , and in his public ones , firm , honest and true . It is stated by the editor in his preface , that this beginning is only an experiment , to be pursued or laid aside as circumstances may dictate . He proposes to publish four volumes within the compass of a year ; and should sufficient encouragement be afforded , to continue the work by the publication of a volume quarterly . We are reluctant to believe , that encouragement , for such a work , will be likely to be wanting ; the subject recommends itself to the attention of all readers , and the execution thus far justifies , in all respects , the highest expectations for the future.               @ @ @ @ @ @
