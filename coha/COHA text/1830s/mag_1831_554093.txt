txt The great advantages that must naturally result from the introduction of home manufactures into the United States , are sufficiently obvious , and are hardly denied even by those who are most hostile to the protecting system . Independently of the obvious considerations of political expediency , which render it the duty and the policy of every nation to depend as littie // as possible on foreign labor for articles of ordinary con. - sumption , and looking at the subject merely under an econoimcal point of view , it is evident , that the influence of home manufactures upon the condition of the citizens of every portion of the country , is in the highest degree favorable . The general operation of these establishments is to check em&gt;ration from the settled to the unsettled parts of the country  --  to increase the population , and with it the wealth and comforts of the former , and to raise the standard of civilization and morals throughout the whole . They encourage the agriculture of the Southern States , by holding out to the planters in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly increasing domestic one , which will very soon surpass the former in importance , as much as it now does , and always must , in stability and certainty . They supply the cultivators of the Middie and Western States with an ample market for their provisions , which are now , and always will be in times of peace , excluded from the ports of most other countries . They furnish the monied men of the Eastern States with a lucrative and safe investment for the accumulated capital , which no longer finds employment in commerce or the national funds . By supplying products at lower prices than those of foreign ones of the same description , and in exchange for others that in many cases could not be exported , they enable the citizens of every section of the country to consume manufactures in larger quantities , and thus to obtain a fuller enjoyment of the necessaries , comforts , and luxuries of life . They are , therefore-economically viewed  --  a great and equal benefit to the whole community . The political and moral advantages that result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising generations of the people in the neighborhood of their homes , and within the domestic circles to which they belong , they keep them under the influence of the strongest natural motives to virtue . By substituting the cultivation of the arts of social life , and the tastes , manners , and habits that result from it for those of the roving emigrant , or the solitary settler in the wilderness , they improve the character of the people , and elevate the standard of civilization . They finally perfect and accomplish the great work of our national emancipation , which was only begun by the political separation from the mother country , and which will he fully completed when we shall have learned to supply ourselves at home with all the products ; which our // domestic resources are fitted to furnish , including the first and noblest of them all , the products of the mind . When we shall have succeeded in relieving ourselves from the sort of colonial relation in which we have hitherto stood to the mechanical and intellectual workshops of Europe-when we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political independence-we shall then possess a real national existence , and may fairly claim the honors-till then unmerited-of a selfsubsisting substantive community . We have said above , that the great advantages which result from the possession of domestic manufactures , are hardly contested , even by those most hostile to the protecting policy . They have in fact been seldom stated in a more satisfactory form , than they were by Dr. Cooper , in a paper published in the year 1813 , from which we make the following extract . The learned President of Columbia College was then as decidedly in favor of the encouragement and protection of domestic manufactures as he is now opposed to them . We quote his ancient opinions , however , not so much for the purpose of bringing them into contradiction with his present ones-we are not anxious that an individual who has obtained what he thinks new light upon a great subject , should be estopped by any declarations which he may have made of his former views from publishing his new ones , although we always regret to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to render the n*otive of it in any way doubtful-but because we really do not know where we could find within the same compass , a more distinct and forcible statement of the leading ideas on this side of the question . Our agriculturists want a home market . Manufactures would supply it . Agriculture , at great distances from sea-ports , languishes for want of this . Great Britain exhibits an instance of unexampled power and wealth by means of an agriculture , greatly dependent on a system of manufactures  --  and her agriculture , thus situated , is the best in the world , though still capable of great improvement . We are too much dependent upon Great Britain , for articles that habit has converted into necessaries . A state of war demands privations , that a large portion of our citizens reluctantly submit to . Home manufactures would greatly lessen the evil . By means of debts incurred for foreign manufactures , we are almost again become colonists-we are too much under the influ // ence , indirectly , of British merchants and British agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to correct this , and give a stronger tone of nationality at home . I greatly value the intercourse with that country of pre-eminent knowledge and energy ; but our dependence upon it is often so great , as to be oppressive to ourselves . The state of agriculture would improve with the improvement of manufactures , by means of the general spirit of energy and exertion , which no where exists in so high a degree as in a manufacturing country ; and by the general improvement of machinery , and the demand for raw materials . The home trade , consisting in the exchange of agricultural surpluses for articles of manufacture , produced in our own country , will , for a long time to come , furnish the safest and the least dangerous , the least expensive , and the least immoral , the most productive and the most patriotic employment of our surplus capital , however raised and accumulated . The safest , because it requires no navies exclusively for its protection  --  the least dangerous , because it furnishes no excitement to the prevailing madness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reason that it is the safest and the least dangerous  --  the least immoral , because it furnishes no temptation to the breach or evasion of the laws , to the multiplication of oaths and perjuries , and to the consequent prostration of all religi*oiis feeling and all social duty  --  the most productive , because the capital admits of quicker return ; because the whole of the capital is permanently invested and employed at home ; because it contributes , directly , immediately , and wholly , to the internal wealth and resources of the nation ; because the credits given , are more easily watched , and more effectually protected by our own laws , well known , easily resorted to , and speedily executed , than if exposed in distant and foreign countries , controlled by foreign laws and foreign customs , and at the mercy of foreign agents  --  the most patriotic , because it binds the persons employed in it , by all the ties of habit and of interest , to their own country ; while foreign trade tends to denationalize the affections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests are connected with foreign interests , whose capital is but partially invested at the place of their domicil , and who can remove with comparative facility from one country to another . The wise man observed of old , that where the treasure is , there will the heart be also ; ' and time has not detracted from the truth of the remark . We have a decided superiority in the raw materials of cotton , hemp , and flax ; in our alkalies for glass-works ; in the hides and the tanning materials of the leather manufactory ; and we can easily procure that advantage , so far , at least , as our own consumption // requires it , in the woollen manufactory . Other branches might be enumerated , wherein our advantages of internal resources are undeniable ; but I can not see why we should neglect or despise these . Nothing but a stimulus is wanted to induce and enable us to make a proper use of our domestic riches . But men of skill and men of capital fear to begin , lest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakness and infancy of their undertaking , to contend with the overwhelming capital and skill of the European powers , particularly of Great Britain. * As Dr. Cooper has justly and forcibly described , in the above extract , the great advantages resulting from domestic manufactures , so he has correctly pointed out at the close the nature of the difficulty attending their establishment , and the means by which it may be overcome . The difficulty lies in beginning , and it must be overcome by a stimulus , which can only be applied in the form of legislative protection . However favorably situated a country may be for mauufacturing ,  --  and there is certainly none upon the face of die globe that combines more natural advantages and facilities for this purpose than the United States-whatever care and skill may be employed in laying the foundations of the establishments , it is certain that their products will be for a time inferior to the corresponding ones , which are furnished by an equal amount of labor in other countries . No forethought , care , or vigilance will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses will be incurred-unsuitable agents will be employed-erroneous methods will be adopted , and it is not until the progress of years has afforded time and opportunity for reforming errors and supplying defects , that the product begins to wear a finished shape . In the mean time , it is offered in a form at once less perfect and more expensive than the foreign one , and if the market be left open , the necessary consequence is , that there is no sale for the former ; or if we adopt the supposition that the domestic article is every way equal to the foreign one , the mere force of habit will give the latter for a time a decided preference . Under these circumstances , the domestic article finds no purchasers ; the manufacture of it yields no returns and is abandoned , and the great and permanent advantages that would have resulted from it , if it could have been persevered in , are lost to the community . In order to secure these results , and remove the dangers that are incident to new establishments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time the aid of legislative protection , by imposing a duty on the importation of the products of similar establishments in foreign countries . This occasions a rise of equal amount in the cost of the foreign article in the domestic market ; and the domestic manufacturer is able to furnish his article at a cheaper rate , though perhaps at first of a somewhat inferior quality . He finds of course , a ready sale ; his establishment is sustained through the critical period of its infancy ; he gradually acquires experience-reforms his errors-carries his methods to perfection , and finally becomes independent of the protecting duty , because his article , not being charged with the expenses of transportation from abroad , can be furnished cheaper than the foreign one . The establishment is now secure and flourishes  --  the methods employed in it are copied in others  --  the duty becomes a mere name , and the domestic manufacturer instead of requiring legislative aid in order to have possession of the market of his own country , begins to supply that of others . Such has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the cotton manufactory , which would never have taken root and flourished without the protecting duty ; but having now grown up to maturity is in a great measure independent of legislative aid , and in some of its branches would continue to thrive if the whole duty were taken off . Such is the history of most of the British manufactures , which , under the operation of a steady course of legislative protection , have gained such a degree of consolidation and stability , that they now defy competition in all markets , foreign and domestic . Under these circumstances , the protecting duty is merely nominal , and the Ministry , by diminishing or removing it on some articles , are able to give themselves without hazard , the credit of a liberal policy-*taking care , however , as they regularly do , to retain the duty upon any product in regard to which there is the least possibility of any competition from abroad . The operation of legislative aid on the infancy of domestic manufactures , is like that of favorable circumstances on the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little aid to make them germinate , but that little is absolutely necessary , and unless it is given , they perish forever . An acorn , which is thrown upon the rocks , or the way-side , is soon converted into a little heap of useless dust ; supply it with a handful of earth and a few drops of water , and it forthwith becomes a plant-*-protect the young plant by a fence from // external violence , and it shoots up into a large and spreading oak  --  the pride of the forest and the material of future navies . So it is with domestic manufactures . In their infant state , they require the aid of protecting duties , and without it , they can rarely , if ever , take deep root-obtain consistency , or ulti-* mately flourish . Afford them the protection they want , and they soon outgrow the necessity for it-assume a healthy and vigorous developement-send forth branches in all directions , which enliven and adorn the whole face of the country , and yield returns of wealth and well-being , in comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of securing their infancy , is not worth consideration . It is in fact an error to consider the policy of protecting our own manufactures by a duty on the importation of foreign ones as occasioning any sacrifice whatever to the community . The opponents of the protecting system uniformly maintain , that these duties are a burden upon the public for the benefit of a particular class . Mr. Mc Duffie , in the speech before us , endeavors to prove , that this supposed burden is borne exclusively by the Southern planters : Mr. Cambreleng pronounces it to be a permanent imposition upon the whole people . These opinions are both erroneous , and the latter involves a double mistake . The operation of protecting duties is-as we have seen already-not permanent but merely temporary . They guard the infant establishment from foreign competition , but when once the domestic manufacture is fully established , it has nothing to apprehend from abroad , and the protecting duty becomes a mere name . The operation of it is , therefore , not permanent but temporary , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole or any part of the community . It imposes no new charge . It subjects the people to no sacrifice , which they would not be obliged to make to the same , or even a greater extent , if the whole protecting duty were taken off . The truth of this remark is easily seen on the slightest reflection . The expenses of government must be defrayed by a tax levied on the products of labor in one shape or another ; and there never has been , and probably never will be , a period in our history when a single dollar has been , or will be , raised for this purpose more than is absolutely necessary . The expenses of government are , therefore , what Mr. Cambreleng erroneously calls the protecting duties  --  a permanent burden on the community . These expenses have been hitherto defrayed by // the produce of an impost on foreign articles , which answers at the same time the great additional purpose of protecting our domestic industry . Let us now suppose , that in deference to the opinions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign goods are all repealed , and our ports declared entirely free . What follows ? Will the freedom of the ports pay off the national debt-maintain our civil , military , and naval establishments , and furnish the large sums that are wanted for the removal of the Indians ? Clearly not . No sooner are the protecting duties repealed , than we must provide for raising , in some other way , precisely the same revenue that we now derive from them ; and as a given amount of money is collected at a cheaper rate in the form of customhouse duties than in any other , the people would now be subjected to a heavier burden than they were before . We should be compelled to resort to the system of direct taxes , and leaving out of view the vexatious character of this mode of raising money , it is well known to be much more expensive than the other , so that we should be obliged to raise , in addition to what we raised before , one or two millions more for the sole purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is obvious , therefore , that the duties which protect our domestic industry do not impose any new burden on the labor of the people . They occasion no sacrifice , which would not have been made if they did not exist , and not only so , but they actually alleviate the pressure , which , under any other form of collecting the revenue is imposed upon the public by the standrng expenses of the administration . The only incidental inconvenience , which , on general principles , might be expected to result from the growth of domestic manufactures , would be the decline of navigation . If we now supply ourselves at home , with the articles we formerly brought from abroad , the ships that brought them will no longer be wanted , and the navigating interest will sustain some damage , especially if the change in the state of industry be suddenly effected by important changes in the tariff . This , we say , would be the result of the circumstances supposed , on general principles , and although the inconvenience sustained by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great advantages accruing to the community from the same cause , it would still be to a certain extent real . It is easy , however , to see , that in the peculiar situation of the United // States , the adoption of a protecting policy will not probably be attended with any positive diminution of the amount of our foreign trade and navigation ; that the only change effected by it in this department of industry will be , that our ships will now bring home one description of foreign articles instead of another-French and Spanish products , for example , instead of British  --  and that , as the former are in general more bulky in proportion to their value than the latter , the amount of navigation employed may be expected to increase , instead of diminishing . We shall have occasion to develope this idea a little more at length when we come to examine the theory of Mr. Cambreleng on the supposed decline of our navigation and foreign trade . It results in general from the foregoing remarks , that the establishment of domestic manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral benefits to the country-that they require in their infancy the aid of legislative protection in the form of duties on the importation of foreign goods-that the effect of these duties is in its nature temporary , and that while it lasts , it not only does not impose any additional burden or sacrifice upon the people , but actually relieves them from a part of the burdens , which , under any other circumstances they must necessarily have borne , inasmuch as they furnish a revenue by general acknowledgment , at a cheaper rate than it can possibly be collected in any other way . It appears , therefore , that the protecting policy is attended by no inconvenience tending to diminish in any way the great advantages which confessedly result from it , and that it produces to the country nothing but pure unalloyed good . It is not unnatural , however , that many important interests among us should take the alarm at the prospect of any change in the state of the national industry . The Southern planters fear , that the duties on foreign manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it will increase the domestic one . The Northern navigators fear , that the growth of domestic manufactures will be followed by a decline in the foreign trade , and it is quite in the usual order of cause and effect , that without waiting to see how far these apprehensions , which nothing has yet occurred to confirm , will be justified by results , the parties in question should vigorously oppose by all the arguments and means in their power the measures , from the effect of which they expect so much inconvenience . It is not // perhaps quite so natural , that while they continue to be a minority of the community , they should think that their opinion ought to prevail over that of the majority , or that , under the mere apprehension of some slight pecuniary loss , the former should contemplate a separation of the States . Such opinions and proceedings are not only erroneous , hut the errors they involve are at variance with the moral qualities which the parties in question are fond of claiming as the distinctive traits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in the calculating North than in the generous South . ' But even these errors , obvious and palpable as they are , are sufficiently consistent with the ordinary infirmity of poor human nature ; and we are quite willing to extend to them all the friendly and charitable indulgence which the occasion may appear to require - more especially as we do not conceive that they are fraught with any very imminent peril-economical or political  --  to the welfare of the country . The report made to the House of Representatives of the United States at the last session of Congress , by Mr. Cambreleng , as Chairman of the Committee of Commerce , and the speech of Mr. Mc Duffie on the bill reported from the Committee of Manufactures for the prevention of frauds on the revenue , are among the most remarkable publications which have lately been called forth by the apprehensions to which we have just alluded . The arguments contained in these papers were fully and satisfactorily answered on the floor of Congress ; but as they have since been reprinted in various forms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , it may not be wholly superfluous to give them at present a brief consideration . They represent respectively the feelings and opinions of the planting and navigating interests ; aud are entitled to much respect as expressions of the sentiments of large and important classes of the community through the agency of leading members of Congress , although it will , perhaps , he sufficiently evident in the sequel , that the cause is essentially too xveak to appear to much advantage even in the hands of the ablest and most accomplished advocates . We shall first notice the report of Mr. Cambreleng , and before we proceed to examine the substance of it , we can not but remark , that the tone does not strike us as precisely the one best suited on every account to the nature of the occasion . We speak with diffidence on this head , because we are aware , // that the tone which is proper to be observed in the oral and written proceedings of Congress , is in part , a matter of mere usage , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative notions to the results of practical experience ; but with all the deference that we feel for the high authority of the Chairman of the Committee of Commerce , we must say , that in our opinion a less decisive and triumphant tone than that which he employs , would have been in better taste . The chairman of a committee , in making a report to the House , is in the nature of an agent , submitting for the consideration of his principal the results of an investigalion undertaken by his order . The tone which properly belongs to such a position is that of perfect respect and deference , more especially when , as in the case before us , these results are known to be at variance with the established opinions and practice of the principal . Mr. Cambreleng was fully aware , that the system he intended to combat was a favorite one with a decided majority of both Houses of Congress-that the majority of Congress were sustained in their opinion on this subject by the majority of the people-by the opinions and practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Government-by the almost unanimous voice of his own great State . He was fully aware that the Government and people of the United States are sustained in their opinion and practice upon this subject by those of every other nation in Christendom . He was fully aware that the system which he prefers , is a mere speculative theory-promulgated for the first time half a century ago by an ingenious Scotch writer-which has never been practised upon by any government whatever in any part of the world , and which , as a mere theory , is fast going out of vogue in the only quarter where it ever obtained any authority . In addition to all this , he knew that the system he was opposing was the law of the land , and entitled as such , were it even founded in erroneous principles , to the respect of every good citizen , and especially of those whose particular province it is to superintend and regulate the operations of Government . All these considerations ought not , we are aware , to have prevented Mr. Cambreleng from stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee , in whose name lie was speaking , were it even at variance with that of the House and the country ; but they ought , we think , to have prevented him from applying to the latter such epithets as an // tiquated absurdities , ' extravagant speculations , ' remnants of an exploded system , ' experiments to encourage gambling and smuggling , ' and a variety of others of a similar kind . We can not consider it as quite decorous in a member of the House of Representatives of the United States , to tell that body in a formal report , that a policy , which a majority of the members are known to approve , is disgraceful to the country , and that it must be altered . This style appears to us to suit the position of a General at the head of his army , reprimanding a negligent or offending officer , rather than that of an individual member submitting to the consideration of one of the most imposing deliberative assemblies in the world , the results of an inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important branch of the Administration . We have remarked on some other occasions as well as this , in the language of the opponents of the protecting policy , a dogmatical and peremptory tone , which we think exceedingly ungraceful , although it is not uncommon in persons who are opposing what they deem the results of scientific research , to the plain dictates of the experience of practical men . The editor of the New-York Evening Post , for example , in a commentary upon our own poor labors , very coolly remarked , that the doctrines of the protecting policy are regarded by the most enlightened men of all countries as absurd and mischievous . Now it so happens , as we have already hinted , that these doctrines are , always have been , and probably always will be , approved and acted on by the governments of all the powers in Christendom , including the United States . If the simple fact of agreeing or not agreeing on this subject with the editor of the New-York Evening Post be the test of intellectual light or darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other view of the case , it is not more plausible , than it would be to affirm that the leading statesmen of Christendom do not belong to the class of persons , who , from their superior talents and cha racter , are commonly called enlightened men . To speak only of our own country , General Washington approved the protecting policy-Hamilton was its great advocate-Jefferson , who differed from Hamilton on so many other points , agreed with him in this . John Adams , Madison , and Monroe , held the same opinion . All these persons belong , in our opinion , to the class of enlightened men-of the most enlightened men in the country . If the denunciation applied only to the // members and principal supporters of the last Administration , we could find a natural motive for it in the party politics of the writer , although we incline to think that candid men of all parties would be willing to allow that Messrs . J. Q. Adams , Clay , Rush , Webster , and their principal coadjutors-all warm supporters of the protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is not the worst . The present Administration of the General Government partakes on this subject in the error , if such it he , of all the preceding ones . The President , long ago , declared himself in favor of a judicious tariff and on a late occasion expressed anew his firm determination to give a temperate and steady support to the encouragement of domestic manufactures . Mr. Secretary Van Buren and a majority of the Cabinet are understood to agree with him in these opinions , and intentions . Are we to understand , then , that the President , the Secretary of State , and the majority of the Cahinet are , in the opinion of this writer , unenlightened men ? Is the editor of the Post , with all his intellectual light , pursuing the track of a set of blind guides ? Or if , while he differs from the Cabinet on this subject , he is willing to allow them the possession of a share of common sense , would it not be natural to treat with more indulgence other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions upon the point on which they have the misfortune to differ from him , the authority of the very statesmen in whom he places the fullest confidence ? But without dwelling any longer on this part of the subject , we proceed at once to notice the substance of the argument , which the Chairman of the Committee of Commerce has presented with so much confidence to the House of Representatives . The plan of this argument is not distinctly announced , nor is the argument itself arranged in a regular form . The natural course of reasoning in favor of the positions taken in the report , would be to establish in a general way the inconvenience of a protecting policy , and then to illustrate the subject by reference to the effects of such a policy in this country on all the great branches of industry . Of these two leading divisions of the argument , the former is wholly omitted in the report . Instead of entering on a discussion of general principles , the Chairman confines himself to positive assertions and polite epithets of the description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown to be founded in incorrect principles , but is pronounced to be // an antiquated absurdity . Congress are not informed why they ought to change it , but are told peremptorily that it MUST be repealed . In the other division of the argument , which considers the effect of the present policy on the industry of the country , the Chairman omits almost entirely any large and direct observation of the state of either agriculture , manufactures , or commerce , and confines his view to the single article of navigation-an interest of high importance , no doubt , but still subsidiary only to commerce , itself but one , and that not the most important of the three great sources of national wealth . A few loose hints are thrown out in direct reference to these , but the only point which is developed and illustrated with any fulness and care , is the state of our navigation in itself and in comparison with that of Great Britain . The protecting policy is bad , because the tonnage of the United States has been decreasing ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power that has acted on an opposite system-has been constantly increasing during the same period . Such is the sum and substance of the argument advanced in the report . This argument-such as it is-is however stated with so little method or distinctness , that it is not apparent whether the Chairman means to represent the supposed decline of navigation as being itself the evil resulting from the protecting policy , or merely an indication and proof of the decline of our foreign trade . In some passages , as in that , for example , where he makes the extravagant assertion , that the rise or decline of our navigation is the index of our national prosperity and power , he contemplates it under the former point of view , and in others under the latter . If the general course of his reasoning were sound , and his facts correctly stated , the argument would no doubt admit of either application . The decline of navigation would be itself a great evil , and would also be an indication of a still greater one , the decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument-supposing even the facts to be well established-admits , under each of the abovementioned applications , of a distinct , peremptory , and unanswerable reply . The suggestion that our navigation has declined since the war , is , as we shall see hereafter , wholly false ; but admitting , for argument 's sake , that such is the fact , it is perfectly clear , that , whether we consider it in itself or as an index of the state of trade , it can have no bearing on the merits of the protect* ing system . // 1 . For if it be argued that our navigation has declined since the war , and , consequently , that the protecting policy , which has been gradually gaining ground during that time , is a had one , the obvious answer is , that navigation is precisely the one-and it is almost the only one-of all the branches of our national industry to which the principle of protection has not been applied during that period . From the year 1789 up to the close of the late war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , these discriminating duties have been , for practical purposes , entirely taken off . During the former period , our tonnage regularly increased ; during the latter , according to Mr. Cambreleng , it has regularly declined . Supposing the facts to he as he states them , the obvious conclusion is , that the protecting policy was favorable to the growth of our navigation , and the repeal of it the reverse . Mr. Cambreleng argues , on the contrary , that because our navigation has , according to him , regularly declined ever since the repeal of the protecting policy , as applied to this department of industry , while it regularly throve during its existence , it has therefore been ruined by the protecting policy . In a speech made in reply to one by Mr. Gorham , upon a hill introduced by Mr. Cambreleng , at a subsequent period of the session , the latter gentleman remarks , that the repeal of the discriminating tonnage duties can not possibly he regarded as one of the causes of what he calls the paralyzed state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our foreign trade being to that of foreign in the proportion of seven to one , we gain of course in the same proportion from a reciprocal repeal by ourselves and the nations with which we trade , of the discriminating tonnage duties formerly levied on both sides . We are disposed to agree with him in the opinion , that our navigation has not been injured by a repeal of the protecting duties . It has outgrown the period when protection was useful , and like the manufacturing interest of England , now de*les competition . We must remark , however , that the reason he gives why the supposed decline of navigation has not been owing to the repeal of the protecting duties has very little force . Whatever advantages we might gain for the moment , by a repeal of discriminating duties , the question would still arise , whether our navigation , unprotected by duties , can stand the competition with that of other nations . If it can not , it will of course regularly decline , and this question is so far from being // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority , that this superiority , acquired as it has been , under the prevalence of a diffi*rent system , has an obvious bearing in favor of protection . But however this may be , it is quite plain that the flourishing state of navigation under the protecting duties , and its decline-supposing it to be real-since their repeal , are facts that can never be employed by any sound reasoner as proofs of the inexpediency of the protecting policy ; or rather-for this language is quite inadequate to the true state of the casethe employment of them for this purpose is a mode of reasoning which wears upon the face of it an air of open and unqualified absurdity . Mr. Cambreleug would doubtless reply-if called upon to explain himself-that the effect of the new protecting duties which have been laid upon the materials of ship-building is so much greater than that of the former discriminating duties on tonnage , as to render these a matter of no importance ; and to authorize the statement that this branch of our industry is still under the operation of the protecting policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asserts that the enormous taxes we have levied on the materials of ship-building account for the present state of our shipping , when compared with its former prosperity ; and in the report before us , our treaties and our navigation laws are idle pageants , unless we relieve ship-building from its taxes . ' It is remarkable , however , that though he has given a minute calculation of the increase in the expense of building a ship of five hundred tons , resulting from this augmentation of the protecting duties on some foreign articles , he has avoided comparing this additional expense with the amount of the discriminating duty formerly levied upon a foreign ship of the same burden . The result of such a comparison would have shown at once , that the latter amount is far more importaTit than the former , and that if our navigation had declined since the war , the fact might have been attributed to the repeal of the discriminating duties with much more plausibility , than to the additional expense of shipbuilding , resulting from the new duties on foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship of five hundred tons in Great Britain and in the United States , occasioned by the difference between the duties levied respectively in the two countries , on Russian and Swedish goods , is represented by Mr. Cambreleng as being at present $ 18,577,99. // But the former American duties on Russian and Swedish articles , are represented by himself in another document as having been on an average about half as high as the present ones , and as the additional expense can be calculated only on the additional amount of duty , the difference between the expense of building a ship of five hundred tons in England and America , resulting from the increase in our protecting duties , is reduced to about $1,100 . Compare now with this , the effect on our tonnage of the repeal of the discriminating duties . A foreign ship of five hundred tons formerly paid , every time she entered an American port , a discriminating tonnage and light duty of ninety-four cents per ton . Supposing that our ships , engaged in the foreign trade , made only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply by the effect of the repeal of the discriminating duty , the benefit of a protection equal to about $1,500 . But this is not all . The cargo of a foreign ship formerly paid , as such , an additional duty of ten per cent . Supposing the average value of the cargoes imported in ships of five hundred tons to be only $100,000 , and the average rate of duties fifty per cent. - probably a low calculation  --  the foreigner was subject , on this account only , to an additional charge of $5,000 at every entry ; and taking together the two items , the American ship had the benefit of a discriminating duty on the foreign one , equal , on the average , at every entry , to about $6,500 . If we suppose her , as before , to make three voyages in a year , and to last ten years , her owner loses , in the whole course of her employmeht , by the repeal of the discriminating tonnage duties , the advantage of a preference over the foreigner equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we double the additional expense of building her , occasioned by the new protecting duties , for the additional expense of repairing her , arising from the same cause , we shall have , as the total result of the loss upon her , on this account , the sum of $2,200 . Such is the comparative influence upon the interest of the navigator , of the repeal of the discriminating duties on foreign ships and cargoes , and of the additional duties on the materials employed in ship-building . It is pretty obvious , therefore , that if our navigation have actually declined , and especially if the proportion of foreign tonnage be , as Mr. Cambreleng affirms , greater than it was formerly , the circumstance is owing to the repeal of the discriminating duties , and not to the new taxes on the materials of ship-building . The latter cause // would , of course , operate-as far as it operated at all-in concurrence with the former , but as the effect of it would be to that of the other in the proportion of two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of any general argument , as fractional and null . It must be sufficiently apparent by this time to all our readers , that our navigation has been since the war entirely under the influence of what Mr. Carnbreleng would call a liberal , and not a protecting policy ; and that if it be , as he says , in a state of decline , the fact , instead of helping his argument , makes directly against him . So much for the value of his reasoning , so far as he intends to represent the supposed decline of navigation as a positive evil , resulting from the adoption of the protecting policy , and tending , of course , to prove it to be a mistaken one . But the fact admits of another application to the argument , if we suppose a decline of navigation to be not merely an evil in itself , but the indication of another still greater evil , a corresponding decline of commerce . It is accordingly used at times in this way by Mr. Cambreleng , and we proceed to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it than he has in the other . 2 . In this application of the fact , the argument takes the following form . The decline of navigation since the war , indicates a decline of our trade during the same period ; and as this period coincides with the adoption of the protecting policy , we must presume that it is owing to that cause . If it were the object of Mr. Cambreleng to found any part of his reasoning upon a supposition of a decline of our foreign trade since the war , it would have been more natural to appeal directly to the annual returns of exports and imports , of which we possess official statements . These would have exhibited a regular increase instead of diminution in the amount of our foreign trade , for the last sixteen years . The supposed fact of the decline of trade is therefore just as chimerical as that of the decline of navigation ; but in order to see the full force and beauty of the reasoning of Mr. Cambreleng , let us admit , for argument 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the fact will bear upon his conclusions . The purpose of the protecting policy is to enable the people to make at home the articles they now bring from abroad . As far as they succeed in this purpose , they will of course cease to buy those articles from abroad . Mr. Cambreleng tells us // that our foreign commerce has declined ; that is , that we bring fewer articles from abroad than we formerly did , and that tlii* is owing to the protecting policy . Does it follow from this , that the protecting policy is bad ? Evidently not . The only conclusion is , that this policy has answered its purpose-that we make at home the articles we desired to make at home-that we no longer bring from abroad the articles we desired not to bring from abroad-that our policy , in short , has succeeded , and will at least have a chance for a fair trial . The fact of the supposed decline of commerce , although it does not , like that of navigation , make directly against the conclusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor . It proves the success of the protecting policy , and leaves the question of its expediency or inexpediency entirely untouched . It is obvious , in fact , on a geimral view of the subject , that it is the necessary and natural operation of the growth of domestic manufactures , to occasion a decline of foreign , and a corresponding increase of internal trade . In proportion as we make at home the articles we formerly brought from abroad , our trade will consist in carrying hetween different parts of our own country , instead of carrying between that and other countries . This change is at once an advantage in itself , and an evidence of an advantageous change in the general state of industry . The home trade is admitted by all , including Adam Smith , the great authority of the opponents of the protecting policy , to be a steadier , safer , and , on the whole , more eligible branch of business than the foreign ; and the increase of it evidently indicates a favorable change in the general sta4e of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals where they before employed but one , and that their population , wealth , and resources have increased in the same proportion . This is a point which is apparently not understood by the opponents of protection , hut which , if they could once bring themselves to realize it  --  and it seems to us to be obvious to the plainest common sense-would go near , we think , to satisfy them of the error of their whole system . If , therefore , there had been , as Mr. Cambreleng afflrms , a decline of our foreign trade , since the war , the fact would only prove , that the protecting policy had gone into successful operation , and that we had partially substituted a more advantageous and lucrative branch of industry , for one that was less so . Such , however , is not the fact . There has not been , as // we have previously seen , any decline in our foreign trade , and the reason is , that in consequence of the peculiar character of our intercourse with foreign countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception to the general rule , that the growth of domestic manufactures diminishes the extent of foreign trade . Our exports are chiefly of agricultural products , which can not be raised in the climates of the countries to which we carry them , and which-being employed in their manufactories , and the best and cheapest of their kinds-those countries must at all events have , and must pay for in one way or another . If , in consequence of the growth of domestic manufactures , we should cease to import from any one of them certain articles in which she formerly paid us , the only effect would be , that she would be obliged to pay us in some other . If the whole amount of our imports of manufactures from a particular country were not sufficient to pay for our exports of produce to that country , the immediate result would be a specie balance in our favor on that branch of our trade . If our whole imports of British manufactures , for example , are not sufficient to pay for our exports of agricultural produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on this branch of our foreign trade . Exchange on New-York and Boston will be at a premium in England , just as exchange on England has heretofore generally been at a premium at New-York and Boston . But the money balance , thus due to us , would probably not be remitted in cash to the United States . It would be paid to the American merchant by the British manufacturer in bills on some other part of the world , where it would be invested in any articles-such as wines , teas , spices , silks , or fruits ,  - -  which are not produced in this country . Until the productive capacity of the rest of the world is so far exhausted , or that of the United States so far increased , that there is no article of use , luxury , or comfort to be found abroad , which is not also produced at home  --  a period which may be expected to arrive some time after the opening of the millennium-there is no danger of a falling off in our foreign trade for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the articles of British manufacture , which we have hitherto received in exchange for our agricultural produce , are among the least bulky in proportion to their value , the change to which we allude in the course of our foreign trade , would have a tendency to increase rather than diminish the extent of our navigation . // Mr. Mc Duffie alludes in the speech before us to an article in the number of this journal for last January , in which we introduced nearly the same ideas that we have now expressed respecting the effect of a diminished importation of British manufactures upon the state of our exchange with England , and he represents us as stating , that this effect would be an increase in the amount of gold and silver current in this country . He also represents us as holding the opinion , that such an increase of gold and silver would be a national advantage , and enters into an argument of some length for the purpose of showing that we are wrong on both these points . The learned gentleman has misunderstood us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more , as we had endeavored to make known our views upon them very distinctly , in the hope , which we ventured to express at the time , that they would not be mistaken . We stated before , as we have now done , that if the value of our imports of British manufactures fell below that of our exports to England , there would be a specie balance in our favor on the adjustment of the account between the two countries . This proposition appears to us sufficiently clear . We did not , however , affirm or mean to he understood , that this balance would be actually remitted to the United States in specie , or if it were , that it would increase the amount of gold and silver current in the country-still less that such increase , if it really took place , would be a national benefit . We remarked on the contrary , that the balance in question would probably be invested abroad , and that our merchants would bring home more silks , claret and sherry , than they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointedly and distinctly disclaimed at considerable length the theory of the mercantile system , which supposes that an importation of the precious metals is a great positive benefit , and discialming at the same time the opposite heresy of the Edinburgh reviewer-who had asserted that the reverse of the mercantile theory was true , and that there was a great positive benefit in regularly paying out specie-we professed our belief in the modern doctrine , which considers both operations as matters of indifference in themselves , and as no otherwise important than as they indicate and enter into the general course of trade . Mr. Mc Duflie will perceive , therefore , that instead of gravely maintaining what we consider with him as a gross and palpable absurdity , ' wegravely enough , if he pleases-maintained exactly the opposite // opinion ; having stated upon this subject-. - doubtless in a very inferior form-precisely the same ideas with his own . We hold with him , that an importation of specie is of no more benefit to the country , than an importation of any other article of equal value ; hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance , which he attaches to the circumstance of obtaining a return for our exports to each foreign country in its own particular produce . If the Carolina planter , who exports cotton to England , receive a return for it in bills of exchange or specie , which he invests and brings home in the produce of France , Spain , Turkey , or China , we conceive , that the transaction is not less beneficial to himself , and considerably more so to the domestic manufacturer and navigator , than if he had brought home his returns in British hard-ware and broadcloth . It results from the above remarks , that although it be the general effect of the growth of domestic manufactures , to occasion a decline of foreign trade , that of the United States forms in this respect , an exception to the common rule . It has accordingly hitherto flourished , and will probably continue to flourish under the existing system , as much as it could possibly have done under any other . This consideration leads us to mention the third and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is , 3 . That the statement of facts , which forms the basis of it , is directly the reverse of the truth . Our navigation , instead of having declined since the peace , as Mr. Cambreleng affirms , has in all its branches steadily and rapidly advanced through the whole period intervening between that event and the present day . The errors contained in the report , as well respecting the state of our own navigation , as that of Great Britain , with which Mr. Cambreleng compares it , are so numerous and of so extraordinary a character , as to render the document a real curiosity . The most important of them were distinctly pointed out and corrected soon after the publication of the report in an able series of papers in the Essex Register , and in a well-written pamphlet published at Baltimore , from which we shall take the liberty to borrow such details , as may suit our purpose . The leading statement of Mr. Cambreleng on this subject is , that our navigation has remained , at best , stationary since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly advancing in all its branches . ' We proceed to examine the correctness of this // assertion , and in so doing , shall consider the state of our navi. * gation under its two principal branches of the foreign and coasting trade . It is well known , that the vessels which are employed res* pectively in the foreign and coasting trade , are provided with different papers , called in the one case a Register , and in the other a License , and that a separate account is kept at the public offices of the number and description of each class , in the document No. 5 , to which Mr. Cambreleng refers in support of his assertion , that our navigation has been at best stationary since the peace , he gives a table of the annual amount of tonnage , recorded under each of these heads , for every year , from 1815 till 1828 . It appears from this table , that the amount of registered or foreign tonnage for the two years , 1816 and 1817 , was greater than usual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance , Mr. Cambreleng deduces from the table in two passages of his report , two different conclusions , both unfavorable to the state of this branch of our navigation . In one instance , by taking an average of the amount for the two years , 1816 and 1817 , and comparing it with that for 1828 , he makes out an actual decrease of rather more than 4000 tons , and in another , by comparing the amount for the single year 1816 , with that for 1828 , he makes out an actual decrease of more than 50,000 tons . Now , if instead of employing this obviously unfair method , we take an average of the annual amount of tonnage for the former half of the period , and compare it with a similar one for the latter , it will appear that the latter is greater than the former by more than 50,000 tons . It results , therefore , from Mr. Cambreleng 's own table fairly used , that our registered tonnage , instead of being at best stationary , or as he states it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable increase during the period in question . This error , palpable as it is , is however not the most singular one in this part of the statement . In a note to his document No. 4 , he informs us , that the official registry of tonnage was corrected in 1818-that up to that period , it contained many vessels that had been lost or sold or had decayed , and that in that year the number of these was ascertained , and the registry corrected accordingly . As he had been at the trouble to inform himself and Congress that the tonnage tables had been corrected , we should naturally have expected , that he would have given himself and that body the // benefit of the correction in the references which he might have occasion to make to these documents . Instead of this , we find him copying on the page , next following that in which we are told that the correction has been made , the uncorrected table . Now the employment of one or the other of these tables , is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncorrected table gives , as we have seen , according to Mr. Cambreleng 's method of using it , an actual decrease in the amount of our registered tonnage , and even on a fair and natural construction , a comparatively moderate increase . The corrected table exhibits for the period of eleven years following 1818 , which it includes , an increase of 202,531 tons : and supposing the increase to have been the same during the two preceding years , it would give a total increase since the peace of 220,000 tons , or about one third of the whole amount employed at that period. * Such are the real facts in regard to the , at best stationary state of our navigation , as respects the registered or foreign tonnage ; and such are the methods , by the employment of which , the Chairman of the Committee of Commerce is enabled to deduce this consolatory conclusion from documents and information in his own possession , which tend in their natural use to one of a directly opposite character . Let us now proceed to examine the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the coasting trade . We shall find the errors of Mr. Cambreleng on this head , even more extraordinary and inexplicable than they are on the other . * The following are the two tables mentioned in the text . UNCORRECTED TABLE . CORRECTED TABLE . 1815 to 1828. 1818 to 1828 . Registered . Licensed . Registered . Licensed . 1815 , 408,430 16 , 463,657 17 , 541,030 18 , 661,831 1818 , 606,088 618,480 19 , 679,493 19 , 612,930 647,134 20 , 730,153 20 , 619,047 660,065 21 , 718,158 21 , 619,896 677,137 22 , 720,278 22 , 6*8,15O 693,415 23 , 659,015 23 , 639,920 671,765 24 , 688,426 24 , 669,972 697,580 25 , 645,960 25 , 700,788 699,262 26 , 798,815 26 , 737,978 762,153 27 , 868,171 27 , 766,903 28 , 881,459 28 , 812,619 700,500 877,462 780,136 755,101 783,5791 801,253 769,084 747,887 806,331 845,758 886,511k 910 63.5 900,199* 824,781j // The table of enrolled and licensed tonnage , to which we have already alluded , states the amount for 1815 , at 408,430 and that for 1828 , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period since the peace , of 473,029 or considerably more than a hundred per cent . on the amount employed at the close of the war . In the teeth of this official and unanswerable evidence , furnished by himself , of an actual increase of a hundred per cent . in fifteen years , Mr. Cambreleng , after an idle attempt to explain it away , concludes his paragraph on the coasting trade with the astonishing assertion , that this branch of our navigation is at present in a stationary or declining condition . In a note upon one of his documents he goes even farther than this , and affirms , with a qualification to which we shall presently allude , that we have actually less enrolled and licensed tonnage now than we had in 1807 , the amount for that year being stated by himself at 360,834 tons , and that for 1828 at 881,459 ,  --  the difference or increase in the interval being , of course , 520,625 . The methods by which Mr. Cambreleng endeavors to reconcile his conclusions in regard to the coasting trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , as we have seen , contradict them at every turn , are worth attention . In ascertaining the state of the foreign tonnage , he employs , as we have mentioned , the uncorrected table , which gave a less favorable result than the corrected one . As respects the coasting tonnage it so happens , that the result furnished by the uncorrected table is the most favorable . In this case the patriotic Chairman insists on making a correction , and in order to ascertain how large the correction ought to be , employs the following curious process . In 1818 , he remarks , the table of registered tonnage was corrected , and a deduction was made on account of the vessels lost , sold or decayed , which had hitherto remained upon the list , of 200,000 tons . Now , the error on this account in the table of the coasting tonnage , must be-. says Mr. Cambreleng- ( why does not appear , the amount in each being not materially different ) at least half as great as the other ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonnage for 1818 , by deducting on the account just mentioned , 100,000 tons . This ingenious argument is liable to only two slight objections ; one of which is , that the error discov // ered in the foreign tonnage table in 1818 amounted to 150,000 tons instead of 200,000 , 50 that the conjectural emendation of Mr. Cambreleng should be reduced , on his own shewing , to 75,000 , and the other , that this conjectural emendation is directly at variance with the ascertained fact . The coasting tonnage table has been corrected as well as the foreign one , and the error in the former has been found to be immaterial . If it was proper to use the uncorrected rather than the corrected tables , why did not 1*'Jr . Cambreleng employ the former in ascertaining the coasting as well as the foreign tonnage ? If it was proper to take advantage of the corrections , why not do it in one case as well as in the other ? If there was any reason for correcting the coasting tonnage table and not the foreign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasting tonnage , instead of a conjectural ernendation founded on the corrected table of foreign tonnage , of which no account whatever had been taken , as respects the object for which it was intended ? It would be difficult , we fear , to give any plausible answer to these questions , excepting that the results obtained from these documents , according to their natural construction , are highly satisfactory , and that it was necessary to the argument of the Chairman of the Committee of Commerce to obtain from them , in one way or another , such as would present the state of our navigation under an unfavorable point of view . Again ; we are told by Mr. Cambreleng , that the sum given in the table as the amount of coasting tonnage for 1828 , includes 277,804 tons of foreign tonnage , which is occasionally employed in the coasting trade , but which is included in the foreign tonnage for the same year , and ought not of course to appear in both tables . It is worthy of remark , that this gentleman , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employs without objection or observation , for the purpose of swelling it , a table , which is known to include the whole coasting tonnage , excepting vessels under fifteen tons . Such are the different sorts of measure which this patriotic American metes out to his own and a rival country . But without dwelling at present on this difference , let us look at the essential validity of the correction . The coasting tonnage , we are told , comprehends 277,804 tons of foreign tonnage , which have only been included since the mode of keeping the coasting tonnage account was changed , and ought to be deducted // from the amount for 1828 . On what authority the amount of foreign tonnage included in the coasting trade table is fixed precisely at the above sum , or when the change in the mode of keeping the coasting trade account was made , we are not informed . It is certain , however , from the table , that during the period since the war , the amount of coasting tonnage has risen by a regular and gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign tonnage can not of course have been included in it for the first time during that period-. - that if deducted for any one year , it must of course be deducted for all , and that this correction , as far as it may be well founded , has no bearing whatever on the question of the increase or decline of our navigation since the war . Thirdly . The last device by which Mr. Cambreleng endeavors to reconcile an actual increase of half a million tons in the coasting trade since the peace , with his theory of the at best stationary state of our navigation , is by ascribing it to the augmentation of our territory and the establishment of new branches of industry . A just and accurate statement , if it could be made in 1828 , of the tonnage in the same commercial circle which existed in 1807 , would show an actual decline since the war ! ' And again : the actual augmentation of coasting tonnage since the war in the same States which existed before , as nearly as it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inquire how far the mode of calculation here proposed by Mr. Cambreleng is in theory just , it is sufficient to remark , that in this , as in other parts of his report , his conclusions are completely at variance with the facts and estimates , from which he deduces them . In document No. 4 , he estimates the deduction to be made from the tonnage of 1828 , on account of the extension of our commercial circle since the war , at 68,558 tons . Now the actual increase of coasting tonnage since the war , given by the table , is , as stated above , deduct from this the 473,029 68,558 404,471 and we have still more than 400,000 tons of actual increase , instead of the 26,619 allowed by our liberal and correct political arithmetician . Fourthly . In a note to the report , Mr. Cambreleng , as we intimated above , affirms , that confining the comparison to the // circle which existed in 1807 , we have actually less enrolled and licensed tonnage now , than we had in that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 360,834 . Now the difference as given by the tables , between the amount of tonnage for these two years , is , as we have seen , in favor of 1828 , 520,625 deduct for the extension of the commercial circle 68,558 and we have still an actual increase of 452,067 But here Mr. Cambreleng introduces a new element into his reasoning , which is not less curious than the rest . in comparing the amount of coasting tonnage for 1828 with that for 1807 , we must not only confine our view to the States existing at both periods , but also to the particular branches of trade which were common to both . In 1807 the commerce of Maine and Georgia was trifling , and we had little or no cotton to employ our coasting vessels ; ' therefore , in comparing the tonnage of the two periods , we must not only leave out of view the 68,558 tons , which are allowed for the extension of the commercial circle , but we must make another deduction on account of the increase of the trade of Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us see how far this is reasonable . The object of Mr. Cambreleng is to ascertain the effect of the protecting policy upon the coasting trade . Now the object of the coasting trade in cotton is for the most part to supply our domestic manufacturers with that article , and this branch is of course the one most immediately affected by the protecting policy , which encourages these manufactures . In ascertaining the effect of the protecting policy on the coasting trade , we must , therefore , according to Mr. Cambreleng , leave out of view the precise branch oC that trade which has been in a manner created by that policy , and which hardly existed at the period preceding its adoption . So much for the attempts of Mr. Cambreleng to explain away the increase in the amount of coasting tonnage , which appears upon the face of his own table . It results from the above statements , that during the period when our navigation is represented by him as at best stationary , and in fact really declining in both its great branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 200,000 tons , or about 33* per cent. , in the coasting trade an increase of more than 450,000 tons , or about 100 per cent. , and in the sum total of both , an accession of more than 650,000 tons , or about 50 // per cent . upon the amount employed at the close of the war . If there be any truth in his principle , that a decline of navigation would prove the protecting policy to be erroneous , the increase which has taken place would of course very fully substantiate the contrary . In reality , the increase in the foreign tonnage is probably in a great measure a result of other causes wholly independent of this ; but the increase in the coasting tonnage is , no doubt , as appears in fact , from the admission of Mr. Cambreleng him self , mainly attributable to the growth of manufactures ; and is in every respect , one of the most agreeable and important results of the adoption of the protecting policy . A rapid and constantly accelerated progress in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ) will be the necessary consequence of a perseverance in this system , and will sufficiently demonstrate the erroneous nature of the apprehensions entertained by the commercial and shipping interest , of its effects upon their prosperity . The supposed decline in our navigation since the adoption of the protecting policy turns out , therefore , to have been an increase of about 50 per cent . Whether the state of the British navigation during the same period , have or have not been as flourishing as Mr. Cambreleng has represented it , is a question of minor importance in this country ; but as the errors in the part of the report in which he treats this subject , are , if possible , still more glaring than in the other , we shall proceed Witi as much conciseness as possible to point out some of the principal . In commencing his remarks on this head , Mr. Cambreleng avows , that he was himself surprised with the result of his researches . However injurious we had supposed our policy to be , we were not prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more rapid increase in British than in American tonnage . ' On a first view of these results , the reader will probably share in the surprise of Mr. Cainbreleng ; hut after examining the methods by which they are obtained , his surprise may perhaps cease , and he may be rather inclined to think , that by the use of such methods , it would not be difficult to procure from these or any other documents , almost any results that might suit the purpose of the inquirer . However this may be , it is certain that Mr. Cambreleng has exaggerated to an almost incredible extent the amount of British tonnage and its increase during the period // under consideration , both positively and in comparison with the increase of that of the United States , as will amply appear from the following brief statements . And first , as to the actual amount of British tonnage . The official registers kept in England , include a statement for each year , of the vessels employed , their tonnage , and the number of their crews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships ; 2,460,500 tons ; 151,515 seamen . The estimates of Mr. Cambreleng for the same year are as follows Amount of tonnage employed in the foreign trade , 2,829,869 coasting , 8,648,868 Total , 11,478,737 Deduct the actual amount as given above , 2,460,500 Over-statement by Mr. Cambreleng 9,018,237 or about 400 per cent . Our readers , we think , will not now wonder that Mr. Cambreleng was himself surprised at the results of his researches . They were obtained by estimating the amount of tonnage employed , by the returns of clearances instead of the registers . In the former , the same vessel is returned anew every time she clears out , and if she performs more than one voyage , will of course be returned several times in the same year . In the coasting trade , and when the distances are short , as in England , the same vessel would often clear out for different ports ten or fifteen times in the course of a year , and her tonnage would be repeated as often in the return of clearances . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , come with one tide and return with the next . ' This consideration explains the nature of Mr. Cambreleng 's over-statement , which is also owing , in part , to the confusion between the returns , in the British official statements , of clearances in the foreign and coasting trade . Mr. Cambreleng might , perhaps , say in defence of these statements , that he gives them for what they are , and that it is not his fault if the reader mistakes a return of clearances for a permanent register of tonnage . But this answer is unfortunately precluded by the use he makes of them . The object is not so much to exhibit the actual amount and increase of the British tonnage , as its actual amount and increase in comparison with those of the // tonnage of the United States . In speaking of the American tonnage he generally quotes the permanent register , and in speaking of the British , the returns of clearances . The former gives , of course , for the same amount of navigation , much smaller numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates made upon similar principles , will be led into a very gross error as to the real comparative amount of the navigation of the two countries . In regard to some of his statements , this error is nearly unavoidable . Thus he remarks : that the mere increase of the coasting tonnage of England for five years is more than equal to the whole enrolled and licensed tonnage of the United States . ' No statement is given by Mr. Cambreleng , in any part of his report , of the enrolled and licensed tonnage of the United States , except the statement in the permanent register , and none of the British except the return of clearances . It is natural , therefore , and indeed almost necessary , that the reader should deduce from a comparison of the two estimates , a conclusion as to the comparative amount of the coasting trade of the two countries . The error in such a conclusion may be seen by the following statement : Coasting trade of England , for 1827 , according to the only statement given by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for the same year , according to the only statement given by Mr. Cambreleng , ( and even this he attempts to explain away , as we have seen , into half its real amount , ) 868,171 " Superiority on the British side , 7,780,697 or nearly eight millions of tons . The real state of the case is as follows Coasting trade of the United States , for the year 1827 , 868,171 tons . Coasting trade of Great Britain , from estimates made on respectable British authority , 500,000 " Superiority on the American side , 368,171 or more than three hundred and fifty thousand tons . As the tables of the tonnage employed respectively in the foreign and coasting trade , are not kept in the British offices with the same distinctness as in ours , the amount of the British coasting tonnage // given above , is not an exact statement , but is probably a near approximation to the truth . Again , - lVIr . Cambreleng tells us , that while our navigation has remained at best , stationary , that of our rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere increase alone in British foreign navigation , amounting nearly to the whole foreign tonnage of the United States . ' In the documents referred to in support of this statement , the estimates on both sides are taken from the returns of clearances , but an atlempt is made to produce in a different way , an erroneous impression as to the actual comparative amount of British and American navigation . The returns of clearances for foreign countries , as kept in the British offices , comprehend those for every part of the British empire , including Ireland ; as kept in the United States , they include of course , only those for the possessions of some other power . No hint is given by Mr. Cambreleng of any such difference in the mode of making up the statements , and the reader would of course conclude , that they give a correct view of the comparative amount of the foreign tonnage of Great Britain and the United States . The extent of the error in such a conclusion , will appear from the following state-ment : Foreign tonnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the statement of Mr. Cambreleng , 2,829,869 tons . Foreign tonnage of the United States for the same year , 900,199 " Superiority on the British side , 1,929,670 or nearly two millions of tons . The real state of the case is as follows British tonnage employed in the trade with the possessions of other powers , according to an estimate made on respectable British authority , for the year 1827 , 918,213 tons . Foreign tonnage of the United States for the same year , 900,199 " Superiority on the British side , 18,014 or less than twenty thousand tons . So far is it , therefore , from being true , that the increase of British foreign tonnage since 1815 is equal to the whole amount of ours , that we find in fact the actual amount on each side just about the same . // Such are the errors of Mr. Cambreleng in his statements of the amount of British navigation , as compared with ours . Let us now look at the reality of the supposed increase , since the close of the last war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken exclusively from the returns of clearances , which in fact exhibit a considerable increase , not of navigation , of which , for the reasons stated above , they give no idea whatever , but of commerce . Whether this increase be real , or , as often happens with British official documents , merely apparent , it is unnecessary to our present purpose to inquire . The object is , in regard to both countries , to ascertain the increase of navigation ; and this is given in En gland as well as the United States in a distinct shape in the permanent register of ton na*e , to which we have alluded above . Now it so happens , that this register , instead of exhibiting the very great increase of tonnage during the period in question , which Mr. Cambreleng supposes to have taken place , exhibits on the contrary a steady and regular decline , as will appear from the following statement : Year . Ships . Tons . Seamen . 1816 , 25 , S64 , 2,784,940 , 178,000 , 1827 , 23,199 , 2,460,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Here we have an actual decrease of more than three hundre&amp; thousand tons in the amount of navigation employed in Great Britain , during the period which Mr. Cambreleng represents as so very flourishing ; and it appenis upon an inspection of the statements for each year of this period , that this decrease has been steadily and regularly going on through the whole. * * The following table exhibits the state of British navigation through the whole period : Year . Ships . Tons .

We are not disposed to found upon these errors a charge against Mr. Cambreleng of intentional misrepresentation ; although such a charge might perhaps be sustained with some degree of plausibility . We have been heretofore accused of excess of charity , and at the risk of encountering anew the same imputation , we are willing to attribute the incorrectness of this document to the haste with which it was probably prepared , in the midst of the urgent and distracting occupations incident to the position of a leading member of Congress . But while we cheerfully exonerate Mr. Cambreleng from this imputation , we may venture perhaps to remind him , that a writer who expects-if necessary to be allowed the benefit of the plea of hasty preparation ,  - -  should announce his conclusions with somewhat less assurance . A dogmatical and overhearing tone , which is always ungraceful , when found in union with a series of errors , unparalleled probably in any official paper of the same description , is still more objectionable , and may even be thought to border on the ludicrous . We now come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this article-.we mean the speeches of Mr. Me Duffie , on the bill for the prevention of frauds in the collection of the revenue . These speeches contain-as we remarked at the outset-an entirely new theory upon an important question in political economy , the discussion of which , in all its details , would furnish ample matter for a long article , and would occupy much more room than we now have at our disposal . A discussion of this kind is , however , the less necessary on this occasion-not only because the erroneous nature of this theory was very distinctly and satisfactorily pointed out on the floor of Congress , immediately after its promulgation , by several distinguished Representatives from different parts of the Union , and particularly from this State , but especially because it does not appear to have obtained the assent of the political friends and associates of Mr. Mc Duffie himself . Mr. Cambreleng expressed his dissent from it in his place in Congress , and the writer of an article in the Southern Review , on the American System , distinctly disavows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as the individual opinion of Mr. Mc Duffie , with perhaps a few of his intimate friends , and however justly entitled it might be , as such , to the most respectful consideration in a treatise on the science , it does not call for so much attention , when the principal object is to examine the views taken of this subject by the great opposing parties that divide the country . We shall , therefore , limit ourselves to a comparatively small number of observations on this particular head , but shall endeavor within the compass allotted to it , to place the subject in as clear a point of view as possible . The theory , then ,  --  as we understand it ,  --  is , that the planter or producer of our agricultural exports , pays , as such , the whole , or if not the whole , a considerable portion of the duties imposed on the British manufactures , which we receive in exchange for them . Now the greater part of these exports are raised by a comparatively small minority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undue proportion of the public burdens , and have a right to complain of the system that imposes them as unequal and oppressive . Of the various considerations that may be and have been alleged in opposition to the truth of this theory , we shall mention one or two of those , which appear to us the most peremptory .. 1 . If the planter pay the duties on the manufactures received in exchange for his products , he must pay them either directly or through the increased price of the imported articles , which he consumes ; because there is no other way in which his money can pass from his pocket into the public coffers . It is admitted , that he does not in his quality of producer , pay them directly , and if he pay them at all , he must therefore pay them in the increased price of imported articles . But all that he pays in this way , he of course pays as consumer , and it is therefore impossible , that he can in his quality of producer pay any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr Mc Duffie resorts to the expedient of suppressing entirely , in his view of the economical arrangements of the community , the intervention of the merchant , which regularly takes place between the producer and the consumer . He supposes . the rxmerchant to be a mere factor of the producer , who on this supposition pays as such through his factor , the merchant , the whole duty directly into the treasury . Now this mode of stating the case is obviously wholly inadmissible . The merchant is the factor of the VOL. xxxll. - No. 70. 21 // consumer , as well as of the producer , and if his being the factor of the producer prove that the producer pays the duty , his being the factor of the consumer would prove in the same way , that the consumer pays the duty . The argument-if it have any weight-proves that the duty is paid twice over by two different classes of persons , and of course proves nothing . The conclusion , that the producer , as such , does not and can .. not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . But as the strength of the case admits of almost any concession , let us grant , for argument 's sake , that the merchant is the factor of the producer only , and that the latter , as such , and through his factor , the merchant , advances the whole duty to the Government . It is not less certain on this supposition than it is on the other , that the whole is refunded to him hy the consumer , and that he finally pays no part of it , excepting as we remarked before , as a consumer , in the increased price of the imported articles which he reserves for his own consumption . In this case the value of the imported article is augmented in the American market , to the exact extent of the duty imposed on it . The consumer who buys it , of course pays to the producer a sum equal to the value of the article as it enters the American market , with the addition of the duty . The producer pays over the duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor free of any charge . But , says Mr. Mc Duffie , the planter has no means of raising the price of the imported article , in such a way as to throw the duty on the consumer . If he continue to export the same quantity of cotton , he must of course take in exchange the same quantity of foreign produce , and the demand and supply being thus the same , the price will of course remain unaltered , and the duty must be paid out of it by the planter. * It is no doubt true , that the planter , while his export of cotton remains the same , must of course receive in exchange for it the same quantity of foreign produce ; but it is not true , as is * It is curious to remark the complete contradiction between the views taken of the operation of protecting duties , by different classes of the persons who oppose them . In this quarter of the country , they are complained of as raising the prices of imported articles . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Southern section of the anti-tariff party-founds his whole argument against them on the supposition , that they do not and can not increase the price of the foreign article . // here supposed , that he must necessarily receive the same quantity in the same articles , or in the products of the same country . When it ceases to be profitable to import certain articles of British manufacture , in consequence of the duties imposed upon them in this country , he will take others . It ' there are no otl ) ers of British manufacture suitable to the American market , l ) e will then , as we have already remarked , after purchasing as much of the articles he formerly imported as will sell at an advanced price , receive the rest of the proceeds of his cargo in specie or bills of exchange , which he will send to France to be invested in claret and silks , or to any other country where he can find a product adapted to our consumption . This very obvious answer to the leading point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctness by Mr. Gorhai7n and others on the floor of Congress , and was met by no satisfactory reply . It was said , indeed , by Mr. Me Duffie , that we already import as much French wine , and in general as much of all foreign produce as we have a market for , and that consequently a diminished importation of British products can not be compensated by an increased importation of those of France , Spain or China . It does not appear to have occurred to him , that the mere fact of our ceasing to consume a certain quantity of British manufactures-all other circumstances remaining the samefurnishes us with the means of purchasing ,  --  or in other words creates a market for an additional quantity of other foreign articles , which may now of course be imported at their former prices . The planter being , therefore , at perfect liberty to bring home in exchange for his cotton any article which may best suit his purpose , will of course take of the taxed article only so much as will sell at the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , therefore , two leading errors in the theory of Mr. Mc Duflie , either of which would be of itself completely fatal to his conclusions . He is wrong in the first place , in stating that the planter , through his agent or factor , the merchant , advances the custom-house duty to the Government . The merchant is the agent , not of the planter , but of all the parties concerned in the importation , and advances the duty for the one that ultimately pays it . To say that he advances it for the planter is , therefore , to assume precisely the point in dispute . Again , if we admit for argument 's sake , that the merchant is the factor of the planter only , and that the latter through him // does advance the duty , it is still certain that the whole is refunded to him by tile consumer in the increased price of the article , and that he ultimately pays no part of it out of his own pocket . It may be assumed , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is freely admitted , or rather spontaneously affirmed as a fundamental truth in the science , by the writers on political economy , that it is impossible to lay any tax , of which the burden does not ultimately fall alike upon all classes of the community . If the whole revenue of the country were raised in the form of an export duty on cotton or an excise on spirits , neither the cotton planter in the one case , nor the distiller in the other , would pay , in the last result , one cent more than his fair proportion of the public expenses ; although one or the other of these modes of raising a revenue might , for special reasons , be more or less advantageous to the country than those now in use . If we had room to pursue this subject on the present occasion into all its branches , we might enlarge without impropriety upon the extraordinary inconsistency between the premises of Mr. Mc Duflie-supposing them to be even somewhat more plausible than they are  --  and his conclusions . He complains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify a resort to actual resistance , or at least , nullification , and when called on for proof of the assertion , brings forward a theory in political economy never before started , directly opposed to the generally received opinion , and on the face of it , in the highest degree paradoxical and improbable , and rests his case entirely on its correctness . He virtually says to Congress if you do not at once adopt and act upon this new doctrine of mine , which nobody ever heard of before , which is at open variance with the common sense of the world , and with the opinions of all the writers , including our great authority Adam Smith , to whom I am most fond of appealing , which is even disavowed by my own most intelligent political friends ; if , I say , you do not at once adopt this paradox and make it the basis of all your legislation on economical subjects , South Carolha will revolt against you and secede from the Union . ' We have a high personal respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his course as more unjustifiable than it really is , but we must needs say , that in our observations on practical legislation and administration , we have met // with very few things more extravagant than this . A merely speculative writer on any branch of science , usually thinks it due to the authority of public opinion to bring forward an entirely new and paradoxical theory with some degree of diffidence . But we have here a discoverer in political economy , who broaches his inventions on the floor of Congress , and would force his colleagues to approve and act upon them sn.stanter at the point of the nullifying bayonet . A gentleman of the talent and general intelligence of Mr. Mc Duflie , must surely be aware that new theories-however well supported and probable-gain ground , and in the nature of things must and ought to gain ground , very slowly on public opinion ; that even individuals of common prudence allow themselves time for examination and reflection , before they stake their reputation or their property upon the value of any supposed discovery . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of half a century from its promulgation , a complete victory over the preceding opinion , and until it has obtained such a victory , taken its place among received truths , and become a matter of general acknowledgment with competent judges , it is no safe ground even for private action in affairs of consequence , still less for the regulation of the great and momentous concerns of a mighty empire . A deliberative body , which should at once break up its whole established system in a most important branch of the administration , and rush headlong into a new course of policy , upon the mere suggestion by one of its members , ( however able and ingenious ) of a supposed discovery in political science , would prove its own fitness for the cells of a lunatic hospital , rather than the halls of a legislative assembly . Yet such is the precise line of proceeding which Mr. Mc Duflie , in the name of the State of South Carolina , enjoins , under penalty of nullification and rebellion , upon the Congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , on the present occasion , to examine the political bearings of this subject , and we return to a consideration of it under a merely economical point of view . In our previous remarks on the report of Mr. Cambreleng , we showed , that instead of the decline of navigation , supposed by that gentleman to have taken place since the adoption of the protecting policy , there had been an actual increase of about 50 per cent. , a great part of which might be traced directly to the influence of the growth of manufactures . It would be easy to // show in like manner , that the theory of Mr. Mc Duffie is not only-as we have already seen-. - entirely unsubstantial , but that it is directly the reverse of the truth , and that the protecting policy , instead of being injurious to the cotton planter , is highly beneficial to him , and is precisely the system of which he ought for his own interest to desire the adoption . WTithout pretending to exhaust this , or indeed any other branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few brief remarks . The demand for our cotton in the markets of Europe is determined , not by the amount of this or that particular article which we take from them , but by the demand for cotton man-. ufactures in the general market of the world . As the cost of the material is a comparatively unimportant element in the value of the finished article , it is of course for the interest of the European manufacturer to buy the material wherever it can be got cheapest and best , without the least reference to any inferior considerations , which , under other circumstances , might have more or less weight . As long as our cotton maintains its superiority as to quality and cheapness , they will , therefore , take it in preference to any other ; and will pay us for it in any merchandise , which may be for the time being best adapted to the state of our market . They have hitherto paid us in manufactures of certain descriptions . If the demand for these , whether by the effect of protecting duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will send us others , which we in turn , as has been shewn above , by the mere fact of ceasing to consume those which we formerly did , have the means of paying for . The foreign demand for cotton is therefore entirely unaffected by the protecting policy , and will increase , diminish , or remain stationary , exactly as if no such policy had ever been adopted ; or if diminished at all , is only diminished in the proportion which the consumption by us of foreign cotton manufactures bore to the general consumption of the world . But if the foreign demand for our cotton be in this way , as it probably would be , a little diminished , the domestic one would be increased in a much greater proportion by another effect of the same cause . When we cease to consume the foreign articles of the same description , in consequence of the operation of protecting duties , we begin to consume the corresponding ones of our own manufacture ; and the consumption of the latter is naturally much more extensive than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come in the end a great deal cheaper , being relieved from the charge of transportation for an immense distance by land and water , and secondly , because a large part of the population who produce articles which could not be exported , either on account of their bulk and perishable nature or the prohibitions of foreign nations , are enabled to purchase when the manufacture is brought to their doors . The consumption of the domestic article is , therefore , much more extensive than that of the foreign one ever can be , and the demand for the materials employed in making it proportionately increased by the substitution of the former for the latter . Experience has already demonstrated the truth of this remark . The British exports of cottons to this country never exceeded a tenth part of her whole exports of that article ; and it is calculated that her home consumption of cottons is about equal in amount to her exports , so that if there had been no increase in our home consumption of cotton goods in consequence of the substitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw cotton ought not to be more than a twentieth of the British . But it is calculated that we already consume at home an amount of cotton , equal to one third of the amount consumed in Great Britain . As the cotton manufacture extends into the different parts of the country , the importance of this increase in the home demand will be more and more distinctly perceived ; and we venture 10 predict , that before the present discussions on the subject of the tariff have been brought to a close in any other way , they will have been completely settled , so far as the planters are concerned , by a growing conviction in their minds , that the encouragement by every possible means of domestic manufactures is the very best policy that could be adopted for the promotion of their immediate interest . And while the protecting policy confers these important benefits on the planters of the South , it is attended-as we remarked at the outset of this article-with advantages of a not less important character to the other great interests of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the iVliddle and Western States a home market for their grain without diminishing the foreign one , which is occasionally open to them in seasons of scarcity . In this way they obtain the means of exchanging their surplus produce , which in ordinary times is excluded from foreign markets , for the various articles of use and luxury , of which they have // hitherto been compelled to forego the enjoyment . The Eastern States , in consequence of their limited extent and comparatively sterile soil , afford but little scope for the extension of agriculture , but possess on the other hand in their numerous , hardy , enterprising and intelligent population , and in their large amount of accumulated capital , great facilities for the establishment of manufactures , of which they will probably become the principal seat . In the transportation of the products of this branch of industry to other parts of the Union and to other countries , the navigators of this section , of whose courage , perseverance , skill and success , we have had at every period of our history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , will find a compensation for the loss of the carrying trade of the world , which fell into their hands for a time during the troubles of Europe , but which , under ordinary circumstances , they can never expect to possess . In this and every other section of the country , the population , by being furnished with new employments for their labor , and new markets for its produce at home , are prevented from seeking them in the distant and unsettled regions of the interior of the continent ; and the tide of emigration , without being wholly dammed up , is in some degree checked . In speaking of this as an advantage , we are not influenced by any feeling of jealousy towards the rising communities of the Western country . We experience on the contrary a glow oC pride and pleasure , when we contemplate the before unexampled spectacle of progress and prosperity which they all exhibit . We look upon them as the kindred progeny of that illustrious mother of men , New-England , and hail them with affection and interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less advantageous to them than it is to us , that their resources should he employed , in part at least , in raising the standard of civilisation and increasing the enjoyments of life in the settled parts of the country , rather than devoted exclusively to the breaking up of new tracts in the wilderness . It is said , that the emigration from Ohio and Kentucky is proportionally at least as great , as from Massachusetts and Connecticut . The older Southern States , Virginia and the Carolinas in particular , are drained of their people by the superiority , real or supposed , of the soil in Alabama , Mississippi , and Texas , and as appears from the results of the recent census , have lost more by emigration than any other part of the country . This is the real cause of the decline of some // of these States , and the American System , instead of being , as they erroneously imagine , the cause of this decline , is on the contrary the real and only cure for it . The influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sometimes been representeda bounty granted by the Government for the encouragement of a single branch of industry  --  but it is a common and equal benefit to all the great interests in all sections of the Union . It is a benefit not merely in an economical , but in a moral and political point of view . It substitutes for a restless and fluctuating condition of society , wholly incompatible with any considerable progress in improvement , the steady pursuit of honorable ends by honorable means , which is the true secret of public pros* ) erity and private wealth and happiness . We stated , at the commencement of this article , that it is the effect of the protecting policy , and of the growth of domestic manufactures , to reduce the prices which we pay for the necessaries and comforts of life ; and such , by the united testimony of experience and theory , is the result of this system . It is sometimes alleged , however , as an objection to this part of the argument , that , in consequence of the croxvded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing in Europe , the wages of labor are naturally much lower there than they are with us , and that this single circumstance will always enable the European manufacturer to furnish as good an article at a cheaper rate . This objection involves an error , which we have not yet seen distinctly pointed out , and which , as it goes to the root of the argument , it may be proper to notice in a very few words . The theory of the wages of labor , upon which the modern school of British political economists have thrown so much obscurity by their extravagant and wholly baseless imaginations , is extremely simple . The wages of labor are its products . Whatever the laborer is able to produce in a given period , excepting so far as the Government may interfere , and take away a part of it , is the amount of his wages for that period ; and the average amount of the produce of the labor of individuals for a given period constitutes the average rate of wages for that time . Hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , activity , and moral habits of their respective inhabitants . If the citizens of the United States , by the effect of greater industry , intelligence , enterprise , perseverance , and other good moral qualities , will // do on an average twice as much work in a day as those of the old countries of Europe , the rate of wages will be twice as high in this country as in Europe ; and such is in fact very nearly the real state of the case . But it does not follow from this , that a given article , or a given amount of the same article , when made by a citizen of the United States , will be dearer there than it is when made in Europe . The value of a particular article is determined by the amount of labor employed in producing it ; the wages of labor are determined by the amount of products , which the laborer can furnish in a given time . An industrious and active tailor will make twice as many coats in a year as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the amount of his products for a given time , will of course be double . The price of a coat made by each will be the same . The difference between the average rate of wages in different countries , is determined exclusively by the state of civilization ; that is , the political , intellectual , and moral condition of the people , and has no effect whatever on the cost of a particular quantity of the articles produced by each . Hence the United States , though the wages of labor should continue to be , as they now are , and we trust always will be , twice as high as they are in any other part of the world , will be able to produce at home-all other circumstances being equal-cotton cloths , hard-ware , or any other article , just as cheap as it can he ftirnished in France , England , or China . And this being the case , the domestic article , which is not burdened with the charge of transportation , xviii of course be cheaper than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unanswerably demonstrated by the history of our navigation . The labor employed in building and sailing our ships is paid , on an average , like every other branch of labor , twice as high as it is in Europe . Notwithstanding this , we have notoriously driven out of the common market of the world the products of the labor of every other people in this department , whenever we could come into competition with them . Even England , the other great commercial and navigating power , permits us to carry on nine-tcnths of all the trade between the two countries . On the modern theories of the wages of labor , and their effect on the value of its products , this result would be an inexplicable mystery ; but when we look at the matter by the light of plain common sense , the reason of it is perfectly obvious . A ship built by our ship-. wrights , commanded by our shipmasters , and manned by our // seamen , will make twice as many voyages , always with twice as good a chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that is fitted out in Sweden , Holland , or even Great Britain . This being the case , it is obvious , that all the parties interested in one of these ships or voyages can afford to allow the ship-. wrights , shipmasters and seamen , twice as much in proportion to the time employed , without raising in the least the market price of their own products , or deducting any thing from their profits . On the other hand , if a low rate of wages had any effect in reducing prices , it would be clearly impossible for Great Britain or the United States to enter into competition with the Hindoos in the manufacture of cotton cloth ; an dyet we find the latter not only excluded from our markets , but actually driven out of their own by the superior intellectual and moral qualities of the inhabitants of the western world . These considerations , which , however simple and obvious , have not , as far as we are aware , been adverted to before , will be found , we trust , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of our experience , as far as we have carried it , concur with those of all just reasoning on the subject , in demonstrating the great advantages of the protecting policy . Since its adoption , our navigation-as we have seen abovehas increased more than fifty per cent. ; and as this increase has chiefly taken place in the coasting trade , it must be traced directly to this cause . The results of the enumeration now in progress , and the flourishing towns and villages , that have grown up under the influence of manufacturing establishments , sufficiently evince the advantages derived from them by the inland population of the Eastern and Middle States . In these beautiful and admirable creations , the poetical fables of Orpheus and Amphion , moving rocks and building cities by the influence of their charming music , have been more than realised . We envy not the moral constitution of the man who can view without emotion these abodes of art , industry , and happiness , springing up , as if by enchantment , from the bosom of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburg , and various other parts of our vast territory-still less of him , who like the sentimental laureate of England , can see nothing cheerful in a manufacturing village , because the buildings composing it , have not the hoary moss-grown appearance of an old stone cottage-as if the freshness and brilliancy of // youth were not as pleasant things to contemplate as the symptoms-however graceful and interesting-of decay and ruin . The satisfaction afforded by the view of these rising settlements , is wholly unmingled with alloy . There is no element of evil about them , to divert the mind from the agreeable contemplations , which they naturally excite . They augment the wealth of the community , by augmenting at the same time the wealth , knowledge , virtue and happiness of its members . They restr* in emigration , and preserve unbroken the family circles-cherish and invigorate the natural affections-furnish increased opportunities for the acquisition of knowledge , and for social enjoyment-in one word , impart a new richness and beauty to the moral , as well as to the economical aspect of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indefatigable perseverance , gave the first effectual impulse to this branch of industry , and who has given his name to the largest manufacturing town in this State , will be numbered hereafter with the great public benefactors of the nation ; when many individuals , who filled at the time when he lived a much larger space in the view of the world , will be lost in oblivion . Such are the advantages resulting respectively to the Northern , Middle , and Western sections of the country , from the adoption of the protecting policy . In the Southern States , which will not probably for the present become the seats of manufactures , the benefit is realised in a different way , in the increased demand for the great agricultural staples , which constitute their principal produce . The extent and importance of this demand have already been noticed . The price of cotton has no doubt fallen within a few years , partly because it was a great deal too high before , and partly from the effect of a temporary fluctuation in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cultivation of it are still , as is justly remarked by Mr. Clay in a late eloquent and able address at Cincinnati , higher than they are in most other employments , and consequently at least as high as they could reasonably be expected to be , in the ordinary course of trade . The comparative decline of some of the planting States-as far as it is real-has been owing-as we remarked above-to the superior attractions of other climates . This difficulty is to a certain extent irremediable , but the remedy for it , as far as any can be found applicable to the case , would be furnished // by the introduction of new employments , to the successful prosecution of which the qualities of soil and climate are of less importance ; and such is the nature of almost all manufactures . This remedy has accordingly been resorted to , and with such success , as-by the admission of Mr. Me Duffle himself-to have changed entirely the feeling of large districts upon this whole subject . It is time , however , to bring this long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , to a close . Convinced as we are of the importance to the welfare of the nation , of a steady perseverance in the protecting policy , we should regret to see it connected in any way with passing controversies on subjects of a temporary character ; and we venture to hope , that in the midst of the fluctuations of parties , and the changes in the persons of the public functionaries , the Government will never lose sight of this great and vital concern ; but will , on the contrary , seek to promote it by every expe ( lient measure within their power . The improvement of the means of communication between the different parts of the country , by roads , canals and rivers , is one of the most important subsidiary l ) arts of this great system , and this too will , we hope , receive the attention of all branches of the Government in their respective spheres of lawful action . We regretted to find the President refusing on a late occasion to sanction an appropriation for an ilnportantpur1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a future article , to make some remarks upon the spirit and substance of the message conveying this refusal . In the mean time , however , we may express the satisfaction we feel , at seeing that the President , while lie declined , for reasons which we can not but deem insufficient , to exercise in this instance the power of taking part in measures intended for the internal improvement of the country , concurred in the opinion that this power belongs to the General Government , and declared anew his intention of giving a temperate , but steady support to the protecting policy . Attempts will ( loubtless be made in Congress and elsewhere , for some time to come , to undermine , in this respect , the established system of the country , and l ) rocure its change ; but we have reason to hope , and if the friends of the system are as active and persevering as its enemies , to believe , that these attempts will be , as they have hitherto been , ineffectuaL The efforts making in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , by threats of nullification and forcible resistance to the law , are not , in our // opinion , the most dangerous attacks to which this system is ex** posed . The effect of these absurd pretensions , and empty menaces , is to excite disgust rather than alarm , and by a natural reaction , to defeat the purposes of their authors . A much more plausible and politic mode of attack upon the tariff , is the one which was pursued with partial success at the last session of Congress , and will doubtless be followed up at future ones , founded in the old Machiavelian principle , divide and conquer . By addressing successively their sectional interests , it is hoped , that portions of the friends of the protecting policy may be induced to combine with its enemies for the repeal of particular articles of the law , until the whole shall be finally destroyed in detail . The nature of this plan of attack and the motives which have led to its adoption , are very fairly avoxved in the speeches and writings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no pretence of mistake on the subject . If the friends of the American System have not the firmness to resist the allurements of the bait thus held out to them , they will at least have the satisfaction of going into the trap with their eyes open , and a full knowledge of the consequences . We take for granted , however , that the majority of an American Congress will not be very readily duped by so simple a stratagem-that they will see and feel that their only safety is in union , and will rally with unbroken unanimity , without regard to any temptation of apparent personal or sectional advantage , round the standard of the principles and interests common to them all . Should this be the case , we can venture to assure them beforehand of a decided victory.
