txt I have the honor of a short personal acquaintance with you , sought for and had , during the late war , at the city of Washington , on the several occasions of my official duties there . I have listened to your " sentiments " on the floor of Congress , with pleasure : and the promptness of your subsequent answers to my several written communications , gave me a favorable opinion of your fitness for office , Your very laboured publications to sustain an existing " paramount " Sovereignty in our several States , since the adoption of the present Constitution of the United States , has occasioned a general surprise , and much painful regret . Your Station , the time , manner , and perplexing matter of your address , has made it a subject of the highest importance , not to us only , , but very specially to the Republics of South America , - who had adopted our model , and now held in a confused struggle of formation , from this impracticable doctrine , sought to be sustained among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unequaled advocate , although we have a deep experience , and certain knowledge of , its distructive tendencies . This I now r pledge myself to substantiate , in a few short numbers , and which , in strict propriety , are addressed to you as my special auditor . It is evident that a great and mighty change of political sentiment , is about to pervade a large portion of this globe . Such great changes , whether religious or political , are of rare occurrence . Europe has been held under the uniform power of personal despotisms , for more than , two thousand years , and the struggle now ( ft is if theif institutions are to be eternal ! Our written model of republican Constitution , has gone forth thank God , and yet stands foremost in this high career of social melioration . Hence , Sir , the vast concern to sustain it in all its original puriety , and as it was adopted by a united Sovereign people , and as now displayed by its ample energies , all operating , in due checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elective franchise . It is on this part of your address , I am now constrained to animadvert . The tarif question has been laboured , - the constituted authorities have decided , and their I rest that part of your address . From your elevated station , bringing into serious controversy any of the fundamental principles of our Constitution , your recently published " sentiments and opinions of the relation which the States and general Government now bear to each other " could not but arrest a general attention among your fellow citizens ; and must ultimately seize on the high consideration of foreign Governments , with home we have made , and now hold the most important treaty relations ; all of which are bassed on the idea of supreme Sovereignty in the collected body of the people of the United States . A total denial of - this fact , is the main subject of your address , and you are the first man who ever assumed a like position , and grounded on a " paramount " Sovereignty of the individual States , since the adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your assumption became of indispensible necessity as the ground work of your system of nulification . You have indeed placed yourself , in the front ground , but it can no longer be doubted to be the work of a combination . You have seized on the death robes of the deceased Jefferson to bear you out in your assumptions . You have raked into the embers of his election to the Presidency , in 1800 , and the then opposition to the Alien and Sedition laws , and applied these to your present system of nulification . To proceed these foreign powers must shortly charge their several Embassadors. strictly to inquire if , in reality , the old /z/ State Sovereignty texture , of our confederation ol ' 1778 , under which they refused , or rather could not treat with us , as a united Sovereign people , had never ceased to exist ; and , if they had been led , deceptively , into those treaties , which you now hold that , a single Sovereign state can nidify at pleasure . And if furthermore if our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had falsly declared to the world , that their " law s were the supreme laws of the land " These powers will naturally present your publication , of a paramount state Sovereignty , as the text-book of their inquiries ; " so says your Vice President , the second officer of your Government / " Forty three years of practical use , and investigation of a few pages of plain written document , the Constitution of the United States , consisting of seven short articles , all expounded upon by seven Presidents of the United States , a regular succession of twenty-two Congresses , now composed of forty-eight Senators , two from each state , and about two hundred and ten of the immediate representatives of all the people of the United States , added to these , are seven supreme judges , hold* ing their stated court at the seat of government , Hogethrr with such other inferior courts in each state , as the Congress may from time to time , ordain and establish . " These are the main agencies , among a host of minor agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President holds his office during four years , the Senators six , the Representatives two , and the Judges during good behaviour ; all under the penalty of impeachment , dismissal and disgrace for mal-administration , and all are bound together by the solemnity of an oath of faithful integrity to " SUPPORT THE /z/ OATH , and you have taken the same oath , and are now acting under the high penalties of it . " All this dread order break , for whom. ? " You now declare to have assumed as facts , and as the main " BASIS " of your productions , certain Kentucky resolutions , and a report of the Virginia Legislature* /z/ us tar back as 1798 , and passed during the heat of that unexampled party contest , which placed Mr. Jefferson in the chair of the Union ! These long by-gone circumstances , arc now totally . irrelevant to your present system of nuliilcation . The resolutions of 1708 , went to oppose the admisistration of that day , on the unconstitutionality of the Alien Bill , and the Sedition laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the freedom of speech- " The first impowered the President to seize any alien , suspected by him to be inimical to the government , and order him to depart the country . This Bill was mainly aimed at the French citizens among vis , then in the progress of their revolution . The Sedition law imposed a line and imprisonment on every body , whether alien or native , " for writing , publishing , or proclaiming any thing tending to bring the government , or its officers into disrepute . " Several prosecutions , fines and imprisonments were had , in the state courts , under one or both these laws . They became extremely obnoxious ; and with Mr. Jefferson at our head , and by means of the elective franchise ! we opposed them with all our might ; and thereby CONSTITUTION ALLY , removed that Congress and administration from power . " Go thou and do likewise . " The Virginia resolution of 1798 , you now apply , . and torture their meaning , into your present system of nuiification , and openly declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully rescued from the daring aspersion on his posthumous fame . Your principles of nuiification go to destroy the constitution , Mr. Jefferson 's principles to sustain it on the ground of the elective franchise , bassed on the will of the majority , which you now also declaritwely oppose . Mr. Jefferson asks " is he honest , is he capable , and will he support the Constitution and laws oflhe UnitedStates ? * what , Sir , would he now say of your recently declared " sentiments and opinions , " in direct opposition to the Constitution , and the " supreme laws of the land ? " It will facilitate the means towards a more clear understanding and patriotic a ttractment to'our exist- /z/ tng " relations , between the states and general government , " and especially so , to many of the present and rising generations , if we step back , for a few moments , and retrace a short sketch of FACTS , not " opinions and sentiments " which , as a people , and Jieretofore as separate state Sovereignties , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . On looking over your most dangerous and extensively spread epistle , to the people of the United States , it was found that you had adhered almost wholly , and throughout seven columns of close n wspaper print , to a mere detail of " sentiments and opinins " of your own and one other man , whom you have named , and thus doomed to share with yourself , ike high responsibility of YOUR OWN assumptions ! I am sorry to see that great man now named by you as an abetter of your present creed , becaase , #e is dead ! His inaugural address , in the Presidency proves that , he never was an anti-federalist ; at the head of whose banner you have now arrayed yourself . Your plan of address , by way of ' opinion " while it affords to you infinite scope , not requiring to be narrowed down by FACTS , determined me to an opposite course , both for brevity sake , and as far as possible to exclude " opinions , " and leave the community to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; /z/ No. 2. /z/ I now proceed to a short sketch of FACTS , in relation to our General and State Governments , as /z/ mentioned in No. l , with the view to a more citr understanding of this important subject , and specially so , to many of the present and rising generation , and thus to inspire a patriotic love of our present Union from certain historical facts , thus made familiar . These States were originally divided into thirteen distinct colonies , and subject to Great Briton . Each Colony was held to the Sovereign power by separate charters , alike in character , and which contained a regular form of Government , very like our present State Governments , to which they served as modals . The Colonies , now States , all bordering on each other , in one vast range of territory , were at no time a divided people , either in general sentiment or action , but on all occasions of insult , or imposition of the old step-mother , on one Colony , the whole rallied in a mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some cases the internal commerce between the colonies was restrained . In a most special manner internal manufactures were forbidden , unde r certain pains and penalties , Machinery of every kind , to such end , were hunted out by spies and informers , burnt and destroyed , even the household labours of clothing and the necessary implements of husbandry were limited , in their construction ; and Pitt , the British Minister ( whom we are in the habit of eulogising ) had declared that the " Colonists ought not to be permitted to make a Hub Nail . " The Colonists submitted to these restrictions without any general risings ; but on all attempts to raise a direct revenue by mere act of Parliament , and without our due representation there , or even the consent of our Colonial Legislatures , was instantly met by a combined opposition , on the ground that " representation and taxation were inseparable , by the British Constitution . " In 1764 , certain Bales of stampt paper , were transmitted to the Colonies , by act of Parliament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here from Holland , when it was a republic , and who had been exchanged , by Holland , to the English , for /z/ surrinam in South America , seized on the stamp papers , and burnt them , together with Lieutenant Governor Colden 's coach , taken from the west wing of the Fort , mounted with about forty pieces of cannon , and which then stood at the lower part of Broadway , below the present Bowling Green . The obnoxious stamp act was repealed , and the Colonies returned to their allegiance , regardless of the declaration , which was suffered to remain on the English Statute Books ; proclaiming their " right to tax the Colonies in all cases whatsoever " The British Government then proceeded to erect new Forts , and strengthen the old ones , " to transport and quarter among us , large bodies of armed troops , without the consent of our Legislatures ; " and in 1775 the famous Tea-project was ordained , with determination to enforce a direct tax . Accordingly a ship load was sent to Boston , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the salt waters of Massachusetts Bay . Boston harbour was blockaded and her Charter declared null and void . The Colonists rallied in defence , and afforded every aid to the invaded Colony . The determination of England to enforce her long brooded intent , to raise a direct revenue , in addition to the vast advantages derived from the Colonies , as the consumers of her surplus manufactures , was no longer a matter of doubt . It became necessary to prepare for the conflict , or yield , ingloriously , to a degrading submission . The Colonists chose the combat ! They were destitute of the munitions of war , and without consentration to direct any unitted force . Their chief cities were occupied by trained regiments , in military array , and their harbours guarded by hostile ships . The uniting Sovereign power , was not only withdrawn , but had declared the Colonies to be in a state of rebellion to it . Such , Sir , was the train of relations which the Colonies ( now states ) then bore to each other ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mens souls ? t " noint of it , capt the climax of human firiP 1 /z/ Our political ship was thus launched on the wide ocean of revolt and made subject to the caprice and dictation of thirteen adventitious Sovereignties , and independent commanders-in-chief ; and all of them unacquainted , or crudely informed , to act in their newly acquired capacity , to wield or direct a united Sovereign power . JjT I n a M communities of men it has been found indispensable to create a MAJESTY , a Sovereign contro/ing power , an Arbiter which can have no equal , and much less a superior , or it could not be Sovereign , nor act efficiently to a general interest . Thus Governments of every kind must possess the power of self-preservation . The n ust be able to enforce the civil laws , command the national purse , bring into action the physical force , put down insurrection and rebellion , punish treason , repel invasion , defend the nation against foreign power and internal defection , and thus provide for the general welfare . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure , in any of these indispensible requisites , with security to itself , and let it be forever remembered " that fears in the public councils betray like treason " We ought never to doubt for a moment , of the efficiency of our government , to sustain its united integrity . Washington 's farewell address . To proceed . The Colonists began their research of a new Sovereign , at the true fountain head of all le- fitimate authority . THE WHOLE PEOPLE ; and have nally constituted and " consolidated " themselves , as the only true , and never to be divided Sovereignty ; thus for ever excluding all personal rivalships , and family successions , from the supreme power . These have been the causes of the most cruel and vindictive wars of any other source of contention among mankind . The distressed people of Portugal are now suffering in their blood and treasure , in a mere family rivalship. /z/ On closing this number , I am constrained here to say , in advance of my subject , and with great reluctance , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties /z/ whoever spoke or wrote in relation to our union , has ? ever presented to the world our united Sovereignty in so unfavourable a condition , as you have done . For the present , the following extract , from your production will aifbrd a short specimen . You have declared to the world , " that the South de " mands free trade , light taxes , economical and equal " disbursments , unshackled industry leaving them to " pursue their OWN interists . ( This demand is im " " possible while the present Constitution exists . ) That " from the Potomack to the Mississippi , if dependent ; i on their own volitions , every shackle on commerce " would be removed , which now represses , and en " crouches on their enjoyments . That no two na " tions EVER entertained , more opposite views of " POLICY , than these two sections ! ! " ( I take these " sentiments , " to be a direct excitement to rebellion , and a gross calumny on the patriotism of the intire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived to a " point which a great change CAN NOT be much longer ; i delayed , and the more promptly it be met , the less ex " citernent there will be , and the greater leisure , and " calmness in making the TRANCISION ; ( what tranci " sion ? ) and which becomes those the more IMMDEIATE " LY interested to consider ! who are they . That to ; i delay longer must finally increase the SHOCK , and * ; disastrious consequences which may follow ! ! ! " If these " sentiments and opinions , " do not lead direct to a dissolution of our ' union , I know of no words , more expressive of suR effect ; and the Potomack is assumed as the line of separation . Thus according to your " sentiments , " all further attempto to modify the tarif duties as a peace offering , must prove to be worse than useless ! at any rate , the extent of your patriotism , of which you repeatedly boast , differs widely from that of the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have now written , and therefore placed his opposing " sentiments " on the eternal record ! Viz : " The unity of government which con " stitutes you one people , is also ever dear to you , much " pains will be taken to weaken in your minds this 44 truth . Designing men may endeavour to excite a " belief fliat there is a real difference ofinterists and " mews ; beware of heart burnings from these mis " representations . Frowning upon the first dawning " of every attempt to-alienate any portion of our country " from the rest , enfeabling the sacred ties , which link " together the various parts ! " No. 3 will RBsume a moro regular am Yours , &C.; train of relations on this all important subject , BEN J. ROMAINE. /z/ No. 3. /z/ In No. 2 the events of our Revolution , from its commencement , were noted , and it is now intended to keep the subject in connection , as far as a hasty review will admit . The absolute necessity of some general form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful opposition to the vast power of England . The Colonists , as stated in No. 1 , began their researches of a new Sovereign Authority , at the only true fountain head of all legitimateSovereignty , THE WHOLE PEOPLE . From their primary assemblies they first delegated the power to certain committees of " public safety " to communicate with like committees , in the several Colonies . Provincial , or rather Colonial Congresses followed in course , and finally a Continental Congress was delegated from the same sacred fountain . They were however cautiously intrusted with powers which had relation to the whole Union . Each Colony paid its own delegates , and on the recommendation of the General Oft s. each independent Colonv furnished , or not as they chose , tu* , : * quota of men ana mo***** ? . a general defence , and tJien without incurring the sin of rebellion or treason . The immortal Congress of 1776 , saw in clear perspective , the doubtful cohesion of the thirteen Sovereign Commanders , at least in their Colonial capacity , and on the 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude , a national character ! They appealed to their God , and the civilized world , " and declared the United Colonies to be free , Sovereign and independent STATES ! " a noble responce resounded throughout the land , the received spirit appalled the internal opposition , and Europe hailed the energy , and magnitude of the deed ; aid and aliances followed , as the new Constellation was seen rising at the verge of the political horizon . Hostile armies were landed on our coasts in 1776 , and began their work of distruction by fire and sword ; and Washington was beaten in every direction . Our war of defence dragged on heavily , from the tardy supplies of the several Sovereignties , and at the begining of the Winter of 1777 , our little reduced army was in full retreat , through the Jerseys , towards Philadelphia , and closely pursued by a British force , more than three times our number . The Congress then requested Gen. Washington to accept the sole direction of the war ! when he in- stantly faced about , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recrossed the Delaware River , a short distance above the enemies ' camp , and captured nine hundred Hessians at Trenton . The General writes to Congress , " that the soldiers were then destitute of shoes to their feet , and that their footsteps were marked in blood ! " The British General was obliged to retrace his steps back towards New- York , and failed to reach Philadelphia that winter . In 1778 the Congress , as an additional incentive to a unity of defence , presented to the State Legislatures , for their adoption , a kind of general Constitution , consisting of thirteen articles , declared to be " articles of confederation and perpetual union " /z/ ' They were nowever , not ratified by the States until the 1st of March , 1781 , two years only before the close of the revolutionary war , because of the incessant excitement of State jealouscies . This " firm league of friendship " between the states , begins thus , " each state retains its Sovereignty , freedom and independence , and every power , jurisdiction and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegated to the United States in Congress assembled " Our present Constitution begins thus , " We the people of the United States , tyc . The words State Sovereignty , are not mentioned in it , and for the best reason in the world , because that was yielded to the general government The state Sovereignties , before they ratified the articles of confederation , had restricted the powers of Congress , in making war and peace , in borrowing monies , in the formation of treaties , and regulations of commerce , &c.; Our internal supplies depended as before the Confederation , on the will and pleasure of each Sovereign State . The general Congress was expressly forbidden to make any " treaty of Commerce , whereby the Legis " lative power of the Sovereign States shall be restrain* ' ed from imposing such imports and duties on foreign " ers as their own people are subject to , or from pro- " hibiting the exportation or importation of any spe " cies of goods or commodities whatsoever , " &/c.; , I seek brevity , Sir , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the defective arrangements of the old confederation . Nevertheless the seven years battle was fought , and the British Lyon was made to cower under the talons of the American Bird , in 1783 . Britain however predicted , and on commercial grounds , that distruction from our internal discord , which her arms had failed to effect ; and now also , from your recently published " sentiments and opinions , " and on the same grounds it is threatened and made to appear that , the fulfillment of the prophecy , is near at hand , and the " present English Tarif question , is to complete the /z/ prediction ! ! ! But I am again in advance of tin subject . Four years elapsed , after the peace , under the old confederation , and which had completely failed of all uniting purposes between the Sovereign states . The extention of our commercial relations , and the local , dissimilar , and imposing arrangements of some of the most powerful states , pointed to a more efficient Legislation to preserve the integrity of the union ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion of our treatise , both political and commercial with foreign states and nations . These nations refused , nay they could not treat with us collectively , as a united people , while the several states continued to be distinct and separate Sovereignties , as declared by the old confederation . Thus our existance in thirteen independent Sovereignties , and destitute of a united and controlling energy , was demonstrated to be totally incompatible with union at home or respect abroad , and which became the solecause for calling the contention , of the then Sovereign States to remedy the evil ! Certain states had actually commenced restrictions on the intercourse with other states , and to form separate tariffs of internal duties , and also on * exports and imports " with foreign nations . Alamode , your State Sover *eignty . A new state of our relations was thus seen to be of immediate necessity . The state Sovereignties had , as yet , no enmitiesjtowards each other ; they were a Band of Brothers , left destitute of a cohesive principle which the pressure of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foreign nations , and thus ; to become the sport of tyrants , and the derision of the world ! Yes , Sir , and all this in about four years of peace , and after their joint , and successful war of revolution . Thus had the states in their separate Sovereignties well nigh completed the ruin predicted by our enemies at the end of the war ! These once venerated shades ( the State Sovereignties , ) you have now raised into new life , and placed /z/ them once more in hostile array to each other , and specially to the general government , and clothed in the most terriffic forms . The present and rising generations are now taught , by the Vice President , that no two nations ever entertained more opposite views of policy and interests , than the two sections " the South and the North of our republics , " on the line of the Potomac ! " What can now suffice all the declarations of your patriotism , as regards the integrity of the union , after such deliberate , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitements of speech , on the floor of Congress , do not bear , on the public mind , that forceof intent , though the same " sentiments and opinions " be expressed in the heat of debate . Tarn , Yours , &c.; /z/ No. 4. /z/ In No. 3 , the most critical events of our revoluolution were hastily sketched . The declaration of Independence , in 1 776 , revived the drooping spirit of the Colonists , appalled the internal opposition , and Europe hailed the energy and magnitude of the deed . The seven years battle was fought and won ; when , in less than four years after the peace , the states , in their individual Sovereignty , had well nigh produced that ruin to our union , which the whole power of England had failed to effect ; and which Lord Sheffield had predicted , in his writings of that day , on the American /z/ The United States government , constructed as it now is , of agents to execute the whole people 's Sovereign power , and who are to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state governments in Sovereignty must , long e'er this day have become conttending despotisms ; our revolution a curse , and /z/ the people of each state made aliens , and foreigners to each other , and far less degrading and humiliated would have been our present condition , to have remained the slaves and commercial dependents of our old task ' master . Every individual would now be obliged to seek pasports , suffer search of Person , of Baggage or Merchandize , at the point of the bayonet , and a thousand harrassments in passing and repassing through each of the Sovereign states . In such case I need not mention the personal affronts , the contentions , and honorable wars , between certain state High-Mightiness , Chieftains , Kings , Lords or Barons ; and all to be held in perpetual armour , and other proud Ensignia , of battle to sustain the dignity of their several independent state domains , at the expense of blood , and the treasure of an enslaved people . Even NOW , such choice spirits , though yet without titles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , in our several states , and in a kind of mimical majesty , creating disputes , both political and personal ; and then searching for partizans to defend their characters , in both capacities ; and specially in their repeated attacks on the general government . These men will always be found , determined to sustain the states in their individual Sovereignty , because when that shall be seen as " obviously impracticable " under our present constitution , as the convention who formed it , declared it to be , then will the " Othellos ' occupations be gone " and the boundry line be set to an irregular and tumultuous ambition . I would not be understood as sensuring the honorable pursuit of fame . This passion truly directed , is the glory of man . Washington is one of the brightest examples , in its pursuit ! I will further remark here , that , our free trade , and uninterupted intercourse between the states , by land and water , now free from " imports " and other taxation , as the winds which wafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interior ; which , together with our Canals , Rail-Roads , and other national improvements , if not blighted by your nulifications , must continue to /z/ increase our free international commerce , and speedily produce the best market in the world for the consumption of our staple productions ; and thus ulti- ' mately fill up the measure of our glorious Union and Independence ! f Permit me now to sketch a parellel to our existance , in separate state Sovereignties . About one thousand years ago the Emperor Charlemagne attained to the sway of Europe , and after his death the Empire split into about nine hundred independent Sovereignties . The scenes of blood began ; each Baron , or Chieftain , contended with the others , for increase of dominion ; and that devoted country , to this day , presents the unceasing groans of a political Volcano , and ready to burst forth , every moment . It is now , governed by about three hundred distinct Sovereignties ; and the great body of the people exist , in humiliated poverty ; and are driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these sovereignties are now sustained in perpetual preparation for war with each other , and which frequently depends on the mere breath of a single individual , who may have become affronted with his neighbouring Chieftain , perhaps at the instigation of some modern Helen , or Cleopatra , or on some diplomatic quibble , always at hand , when war is declared . After this thousand years round of bloodshed , Napoleon Buonaparte , had again nearly grappled the whole , and brought Europe to the point , of sole dominion , where Charlemagne had left it a thousand years before . This , Sir , is in amount , the history of Europe for the thousand years last past , and may serve as a model , to minds capable of critical investigation , on the doctrine of chances , in our State Sovereignties , for a thousand years to come . Will you , Sir , now pause with me for a moment , at the verge of the precipice , to whichfacts , of our own experience , not " opinions , " have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the states in their Sovereignty had led the people of the United States in 1787 , as stated in No. 3 . Can you now believe , and yet hold itas your " confirmed opinion , that on the /z/ " recognition and continuance of our utatesin their " individual Sovereignty , depends the stability and " safety of our political institutions ? " Sir , your misgivings have become apparent , as in many other parts of your production , and you do well now to state , that , " / am not ignorant , that those opposed to the " doctrine ( of State Sovereignty , have always , now " and formerly , regarded it in a different light , as " ' monarchical and revolutionary ! " I am almost sorry that you were not " IGNORANT " of this FACT . However this may be I proceed most joyfully to state , that , in the direful emergency , as above stated , and within one step of a like course of distructive consequences , the ever guarding angle of our union , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the harbour of our salvation ! Will twelve millions of United Freemen now fail of a redeeming power from the abberations of about three dozen of her tumultuous and boisterous sons ? In the same year , 1787 , were assembled at Philadelphia , a convention of sages , Washington , Franklin , and Madison were among them , regularly , delegated and instructed , by their local and separate state Sov ' creignties , then in full power and authority . You . * repeatedly , and nineteen times over , insist that , these delegates acted throughout in behalf of their respective , states only , and not as from " one aggregate political community , " This , is a selfevident fact , and needed no repetition , because there was then no " aggregate , " or United Sovereign people in existance here , it was to effect , THAT , as the main object , which the Sovereign " people of the states , by their united convention was in search of , and which had become absolutely necessary " to relieve themselves from the impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Sovereignties , had nearly accomplished . Of all absurdities , THAT on which you now predicate , an existing state Sovereignty , and from the very act ( the present Constitution of the United States ) by which they unanimously relinquished it , is the most derogatory to com- /z/ iiion sense , and acknowledge fact , of any " sentiment* ever assumed on the public credulity ! ! ! To proceed . That august body , unparelleled in the annals of history , has displayed to an admir ingworld , a political phenomenon , the Sovereign power is not placed in an individual , but in the wJiole people of the United States ! The military is made subject to the civil power , and has now controled it , both in peace and war , for more than forty-three years , and the majority governs by universal suffrage . Our Republic is marching on a line unpracticed in the history of man . The eyes of philanthropists throughout the world , view every of its seeming oscillations with doubting and painful sensibilities ; while its foes glory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation of a true history of men and things , is all important to us , to the world , and to future ages . Every member of this grand republic should treasure up his recollection , and those who can write , to sustain their parts , and fearlessly sketch , in bold relievo , the true political character of men and things , whatever their station has been or may be . Political immorality has at all times opened the floodgates of human woe , and made this world an aceldama of blood . " Any thing is fair in politics , " say some , and again , " / care not a d nfor my political character , that is fair game " &_c.; Our Government was formed by the unanimous vote of all the States , when in their separate Sovereign capacities , and nothing short of a like vote will be permitted to dissolve it as now existing in their united Sovereignty , one and indivisible . Six thousand years are said to have passed since the creation , and the United States is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profound peace , whose religion was of their own choice , whose politics were derived from their own experience , freed from the power of personal despotisms , and from the superstitions of the old world ; and thus choosing their form of Government . Then it was , that our sages deliberated , and by the most happy combina- lion , they finally arranged , entwined , " consolidated " and formed our general Government , and WHOLLY /z/ GOVERNMENTS ! ! This fact will be demonstrated in No. 5 . Can you , Sir , ever again repeat the gross absurdity , that these things " strip the States of their Sovereignty , and degrade them in fact to mere corporations ? " If , however , to gratify individual State pride , you chose to misname and yet call our State rights , State Sovereignty , it may for a while continue to confuse the public mind , though in either case , it can only be a STATE AFFAIR ; and you can not go , Constitutionally , one inch beyond your boundary line , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights , as now cemented into our United Sovereignty , is of free passport , and honorable mention throughout the world ; they disdain to quibble , and excite turmoil and disunion by misrepre* Dentations among the people . Yours , /z/ No. 5. /z/ In No. 4 , the advantages of our union , and the contrary , were delineated . It is of general remark , " that the States had given away a large portion of their liberties to secure the rest . ' Such is not the fact . No important State authority , which they ever exercised , under the Old Confederation , except their adventitious $nd mpst destructive /z/ individual Sovereignty , was yielded to the general Government , that is yielded to themselves collectively ; and in the most ample manner and form , with full powers to enforce and sustain their undivided integrity , from foreign attack , and internal aberration .

That which injures one State , must injure all ; and no unjust or unequal law can be long sustained , having such ten ( dency , if it be possible to afford relief ; and be assured Sir , that none of the states would yield their proud original , present eclat , and elevation in the eye of the world , ( and their own united power ' , ) for all the individual state Sovereignty blessings you now seek to renew as under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your influence and that of , others , t any state should be led to commence operations on the ground of its Sovereignty !

His Excellency , the President of Congress . The Convention having thus recapitulated the main principles of the Constitution , in the plain simple language of it , and then , understood both by natives and foreigners in the same common sense way ; and on the faith of which they entered into treaties with us as a " consolidated " and united people . Sir , you have laboured hard and long , and wholly against the OBVIOUS CURRENT or FACTS , and with evident perplexity to your own mind , in endeavours to prove the fallacy of a continued existence , under our present Constitution , of a plurality of independent Sovereignties , as under the old Confederation ; when , Sir , to redeem the dread consequences in that state of things , ( as proved in No. 3 , ) became the sole cause of calling the convention by the people of the Sovereign States ! The Convention also declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government of those " States , to secure all the rights of independent " sovereignty to each , and yet provide for the inter " est and safety of all . " Here the Convention affirms the abolition of the State Sovereignties , as an act of plain common sense necessity , and to avoid a downright absurdity , from their having " consoMda- /z/ ted " the Sovereign power in the whole people of the States collectively ; and who , by their several independent State Conventions , consented to be clothed with every attribute of power , denominated supreme , and as appertains to every other Government on earth ; when each state , tJien relinquished its individual Sovereignty , and in good faith , proceeded so to alter and conform their several State Constitutions accordingly . If the State Sovereignties had been reserved , would they have failed to mention it in their State Constitutions ? or in that of the United States ? Surely , Sir , those sacred instruments , and specially the old thirteen , and those since formed , would have been made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours , &c.; /z/ Ouf general government is not now a compact , contract , bargain or compromise , between twentyfour independent states Sovereignties ; that compact has been had , and settled . It is now a gov eminent in fact , holding command , and by order of the whole people , of all the energies of supreme power over the Union , to enforce and sustain its undivided integrity . It can not now turn to the right hand nor to the left , until it be forced into a display of the peoples power , by some overt act , of daring obstruction to its straight forward , constitutional course . If the executive arm shall fail , or refuse to enforce the supreme laws , or other misdemeanor , or tumultuous excitement , then will the peoples ' resrved power , through THEIR immediate representatives , irt the Congress of the United States , resume the execit tive command , and impeach such delinquent , at the fiar of the Nation ; whether it be the President , the Vice President , or other individual who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir , will the supreme judiciary preside , and the Senate of ' the United States , the immediate representatives of the states , as states collectively , try and adjudge such delinquent , in conformity to the Sacred Charter of Union .

" I have often thought , and do now believe , that if Mr. Jefferson had enforced the law of Embargo , in Connecticut at that time by Continental Troops , or had only called on the people of Connecticut , that 437 naked steels , both Federal and Republican , would have leaped from their seaboards to sustained him , in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have had the late and leading resolves of the scholars of that notorious Englishman , and noted monarchist , President Cooper ( already mentioned ) of South Carolina College , nor of the Colleton , and present resolutions of South Carolina ; and now led on by their leaders , governor and all , to the borders of rebellion , in their opposition to the TARIFF /z/ President Jackson will shortly be put to the test , as respects his courage and veracity , in the execution of the laws of the United States , in South Carolina ; or in some Southern Convention about to be raised up , and in opposition to the Union , over which he now presides . Respecting the Hartford Convention in 1814 , at the East , it lias been repeatedly declared and never denied , that General Jackson , affirmed , that if he had /z/ been in command there , he would have hung their main leaders , " by the second article of war !

It is thus only that our general government can attain and maintain a fixed character , as respects the exercise of its Sovereign power , amidst the present and most daring assumptions , on the ground of state Supremacy . I have now no doubt this will ultimately demand of the only true Sovereign authority , some high display of its Constitutional energies to preserve itself ; or relinquish ingloriously , to a few desparate and daring . spirits , to be found in every state , the entire glory of our revolution ! Have I here seemed to express a doubt of the energies of twelve millions of free-men to sustain their present proud stand among the nations of this earth ? Perish the dastardly conception forever ! This error of evil omen , having silently passed " along in the current of our time , and without any general discussion , has really so far entered into a general belief , as to startle many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the States are not now , nor have been Sovereign since the adoption of the United States Constitution . It would be well to begin a new 7 , and reflect on the true meaning of the word Sovereignty , as understood at the adoption of our Constitution . ' It is the supreme power in all communities ! " and even two Sovereigns in the same community is an absurdity ; and the practical operation of twenty-four , would speedily require to erect a Bedlum for the incurables , wherein to ruminate , on the possible doctrine of chance* in the regions of Political disquisition ; " calculating the value of the Union ? as you observe . The Constitution of the United States alone speaks like a Sovereign . From the pinnacal of the Temple to Union , the Majesty of a free people proclaims , " We the people of the United States !

We Guarantee to the several states a Republican form of Government . We Have defended Treason : and We Make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the aforegoing powers , and all other powers , invested by this Constitution , in the government of the United States , or any department , or office thereof . Such are the outlines of the Temple of our ' 4 Constitution " I do indeed mistake , Sir , if a " common Arbiter " shall fail now to be found , in any and every case of overt act of insurrection , rebellion and treason , within the boundries of the Constitution , whether such acts be perpetrated in South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and ever will be , the vote of a majority of the people of the United States , in Congress assembled ! It was indeed feared , and believed , by some , at that day , that the general would destroy the State Governments , and become dangerous to civil and ( political freedom . It does appear to me a most daring attempt , or a gross infatuation on your part , - at this day , to suppose the least of it , now again and merely on temporary commercial grounds , as during the late war , to raise this sfyame-faced question , and by way of threat , and the menace of State Sovereignty nullifications , to dissolve the Union , stands wholly unprecedented in determined purpose . You have placed the deceased patriot , Thomas Jefferson , in your Van , in this new career , and the materials for his posthumous sacrifice , have beerj sought and triumphantly published , and said to be found written on " scraps of paper , in his secret family bureau , of date 1798 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immolation may also serve to cover a retreat , if necessary , from the apprehended reprobation of twelve millions of united freemen ; although you now declare yourself " regardless of their effects personally " The Constitution was opposed mostly in the large states , and in the then Sovereign Convention of this State , convened in 1789 , to pass upon the adoption or rejection of the Constitution of the United States , it was declared that , " it robbed the states of their Sovereignty , that it was a mammoth , would swallow " up the state governments , destroy civil and political " liberty reduce the states to mere ' ' Corporations ? " and that the great Convention itself , had declared " it to be a ' CONSOLIDATION , ' &c."; Here , Sir , we have discovered the embryo , the alpha and the omega of the whole nullification system . At this time a party arose denominating themselves anti-federalists , that is , adhering to the old confederation , State Sovereignty . From long habit , these words were continued in general use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the idea of a supreme power continuing to be attached to the states , individually , as under the Confederation , would , at that day , and now , as I frequently find on explanation , be deemed an absurdity , as it really is . You repeat this fallacy nineteen times ! it is your repeats which carry with them a smothering of better judgment The re- /z/ maining state rights COULD only be ment . Thu &; have the words " State Sovereignty , " crept along under masked State Batteries , for forty-three years ; and the Vice President of the United States is the first now to proclaim State Sovereignty , not only in the literal sense of the word , but in a superabundance . of supreme and paramount power , of which the " United States Government is but its unere crea-ture ? Yours , fec. /z/ No. 7. /z/ It was shewn in No. 6 , that none of the state - Constitutions now assume individual Sovereignty as under the old confederation ; that , if the states had intended to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates in the Convention , or have refused to sanction the Constitution , as the words State Sovereignty are not even mentioned in it ; but it is declared by the Convention , to be " obviously impracticable , in the federal government of these states ! " Every true American should raise his voice , loud and incessant , against all doctrines calculated to weaken , divide and confound the allegiance of the whole people , of the United States , to the Constitution . We all inhabit some one or other of the states . Now says one , I hold to the existence of twenty-four independent state Sovereignties , on Vice President Calhoun 's plan , and therefore deem my allegiance to be due to my " native stale " and if they all say so , or two thirds , as you observe , then is the union dissolved But if all adhere to the United States Sovereignty and sole allegiance , then we remain a united nation . You say . " / do not deny that a power so high as State Sovereignty , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of national power and distinction , the danger is on the side of the union ? As respects " the love of distinction " Sir , where an individual sways the Sovereign power , the greater danger no doubt is on that side ; but in our national Sovereignty , experience abundantly proves the danger to be , not on the due exercise of state rights , but notoriously , on state is$umptions of Sovereignty not retained ! Hence a few state leaders are so repeatedly found able to excite to the most dangerous , and daring usurpations on the mild and dignified character of the general government ; but not a single instance exists , where the national government has given the smallest sign of encroachment on the state rights . Nay , such act would be in total repugnance to its own existence ! Oar admirable Constitution , having so entwined and " Consolidated " our state and general governments , as to render the one absolutely indispensible to the existence of the other ; and specially the general government , wholly depends , for the constant renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights ! There can not then be a single motive to encroach on those rights . The state assumptions by repetition have acquired great strength , and may ultimately demand of the only true Sovereign authority , some high display of its Constitutional energies to preserve itself . Experience proves that our general government still demands the most vigilent foresight , and determined energy of the whole people to preserve it from state aberrations . We shall always have an abundance of state aspirants , would be Lords and Barons , who have missed their aim of ambition in higher pursuits , and to whom your state Sovereignty affords a wide field for display . The general Sovereignty is , and has always been the object of their fears and hate ! Again , Sir , on the moral point , man first loves himself , /z/ x his family , his neighbourhood , city , and state follow* in the scale of his attachments ; but to embrace a union of states , requires , not only a more than extraordinary share of intellect , but the expansion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in No. 3 , that all our partialites hung on the state Sovereignties , in 1787 , to the very brink of ruin , and nearly to the total abortion of all our acquisitions attained by the revolution ; and the deep deceptions now practising on the good people of South Carolina , is full evidence of like attachment at this day . These confiding people , are now excited , and , as said , " goaded on " to elect two-thirds of both houses of their State Legislature favourable to your nullification . That in such event only , can that Legislature call a State Constitution , whose power alone can declare , and bring the state back to its original Sovereignty , and absolve them from all allegiance to the United States . If this device prevails , then will your State Legislature and their Convention assume the entire responsibility . Then will the legerdemain be complete , and the nation plunged into a civil war , for protecting the people against foreign monopoly . We had been accustomed to use the words State Sovereignty and Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1776 , up to the 4th day of March 1789 , twelve years and eight months , when the present Constitution went into full effect . On this all important transition , or change " of the relations between the states and general government , " it only required to put in use their true substituted fact meaning , Viz. State Rights , in the stead of continuing the words State Sovereignty , ' which became abrogated , on the adoption of the present Constitution . These two words is the true hocus-pocus , of all the state aspirants from that day to this . What shall restrain aSovereign power but its limitations , if the states are all Sovereign , then is the United States Sovereignty annihilated ; and this is the sum of the whole matter at issue / /z/ What is the general government , but the aggregate of state rights ? The state authorities , legislative , judiciary and executive , are in the constant exercise of those retained rights , to sustain their united Sovereignty . It certainly borders on the ridiculous , even to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state rights by which alone that Sovereignty can continue to exist ! Nevertheless in every individual and state aberration , the first we hear , is state Sovereignty , and a vast concern about the infringements on " paramount " state rights . Your " sentiments " are now before the people , who will ultimately judge truly of your moral and political sanity in the premises . " Mene Mene Tecal " is already written on the walL " He has been weighed in the balances and found wanting . " I have read somewhere that such is the nature of untruth , that , if not arrested in its course , would , not only destroy a kingdom , or a nation , but the whole creation of theAlmighty throughout the infinitude of space ! It is indeed lamentable to know , and disgraceful to reflect , that , during forty-two years our beloved country should have been kept in almost perpetual broils , from the repeated threats , mere quibbles , falsehoods , and misrepresentations of the words " State Sovereignty ; " and which , during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its centre ! Your nineteen repetitions of " Sovereign parties to a Compact , " or joint Commission " as you have it , wherein each partner contracts for the right , at any time , to nullify and break up the whole concern , is certainly very novel . Sound minds , among the people , , will always think there is some mistake about it on your part , as there never before had been known or heard of , thirteen sane individuals , or even thirteen states , who had made such " COMPACT ! " again , Sir , shall we now confound the common understanding by abstract subtilties , and inform the world in the face of all our solemn treaties made with it , " thai foreigners do not understand the relations which the state and general government now bear to each other /z/ That the Sovereign states , " as distinct parties , " and by way of Compact made with each other , had indeed accepted their United Sovereignty ; yet , and nevertheless , that each Sovereign state , held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their " Veto ? or nullification on their own laws , as made in their United Sovereign capacity ! Let natives and foreigners , at all times keep a steady eye , to the plain facts in our Constitution , and guard against the misrepresentations , and falsehoods , which are repeatedly made to surround it ; then will they be no longer perplexed , confounded , deceived and discouraged in their support and imitations of our unparalleled model of government . If this be neglected by ourselves , the world will shortly turn from us in disgust , and cease to imitate our institutions , as discordant and unintelligible ; and oppressed man loose his hope of relief from the personal despotisms ; and we , at no distant day , be driven back to the verge of the precipice which the states in their separate Sovereignties had led the people of the United States in 1787 , as before described . Then , Sir , there may be no uniting arm to save us from the tyranny , of perhaps twenty-four , or may be fifty petty Sovereigns* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking broils , hatreds , and open war-fare with , their nearest neighbours . It is indeed , Sir , almost incredible , that , from 1787 to the present day , has this state Sovereign phantom been kept up and displayed , by way of political incantation , in all and every of the aberrations against the general government ; and specially in every immaginary , local , and temporary interest of states or individuals . We have seen this Sovereign Talisman raised , clothed , and sent forth among the people , in all the solemnities of Samuel 's Ghost ! and but for this , my honorable friend would have been spared thetrouble , and great perplexity , in writing NINETEEN columns , of close newspaper print , to sustain a NONENTITY ! Yours , &G,; BENJAMIN ROMAINE. /z/ No. 8. /z/ In No. 7 , the absolute necessity of sole Allegiance to the United States Constitution , were shown to be indispensible to union ; that the aggregate of state rights is the compositive of the United States Sovereignty , &c.; Recent accounts , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa- Ann , is now also at the head of a state Sovereignty party , and has demanded of their Vice President , " to dismiss his Cabinet Ministers because of their adherance to CENTRALISM , " by which the United Sovereign power is ment . Your publication of 1831 , in all probability hasproluced this movement inMexico . If Santa- Ann succeeds " ollowing up the high example now set before him by he Vice President of the great mother of republican - sm , it will need no prophet to foretell the destiny of he Mexican Republic ; and , in all probability the ate of the other seven Republics , spread over the vast ind delightful regions of South America . These republics have been struggling to attain some fix ed form , for more than twenty years ; first in imitation of our model , which , if it had gone to these people , in its pristine beauty and simplicity , and freed from the polluted contaminations of our restless politions , these republics , together with our own , it is reasonable to believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , and now presented a line of republican fronts along the whole range of the Atlantic Ocean , on the East , and the Pacific on the West , reaching onward , and preparing the way for the multiplication of republics , as man shall increase , until they arrive near to the eastern boundary of the Russian Autocrat . The great danger to the liberty , peace , power and happiness of the American Republics is , their splitting into petty State Sovereignties . The opinion which long prevailed , that " Republics could only exist in small territories , " and which you now favour , has become reversed , I trust , where the Sovereign power is " consolidated " in the great body of the people , as with us , operating through their grand lever and regulator , the elective franchise . You thus proceed , and again repeat , " that our " United States Constitution was formed by delegates " from the people , while in their separate and Sovereign State capacity . That it IS a compact , ( I " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , or parties , have a right to judge of its in " fractions ; and in case of a deliberate , palpable , " and dangerous exercise of power , NOT DELEGA44 TED , they have a right , IN THE LAST RESORT , to " interfere for arresting the progress of the evil , " and ' for maintaining within their RESPECTIVE " LIMITS the authorities , rights and liberties ap " pertaining to them . Again . That the resolu44 tions of the general Assembly of Virginia , relates " to those GREAT AND EXTRAORDINARY /z/ OF THE CONSTITUTION , MAY prove in44 effectual against infractions dangerous to the 44 essentianl rights of the parties to it . The ResO ' " lution again SUPPOSES , thai dangerous pow44 ers , NOT DELEGATED , MAY not only be " usurped , and executed by the DEPARTMENTS , 44 but that the Judiciary Department MAY T also " exercise , or sanction , dangerous powers beyond 44 the grant of the Constitution , and consequently 44 that the ultimate right of the parties to the Con44 stitution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must extend to violations by " one delegi ' * ' d Authority , as well as by the other . 4i by the Judiciary , as well as by the Executive* " or Legislative " * Hero , Sir , you divide and prostrate , at one fell swoop , the entire unity of the general Government , Judiciary , Legislative and Executive , nothing now remains fixed , and permanent , except your plural Sovereignties . Really Sir , we may suppose any thing . The force , however , of such like suppositions , as above , and as made in 1798 , in the great electioneering struggle to place Mr. Jefferson in the chair of the union , is now lost by the extravagance of them . As now applied to our government , on the Tariff question , and protecting system , they are wholly irrelative . You proceed to say , " that this right of interpou sition. thus solomnly asserted by the state of Vir " ginia , be it called what it may , State Right , Veto , " Nullification or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental principles of our system ! and " that the error is in the assumption that the general " government is apart of the Constitutional Com " pact ! " It is the Constitution itself , as I understand it . May the heavens protect us from your " state Sovereignty parties to our Constitution of general government . " Every general law is henceforth to be made subject to the whim , caprice , or special local interest of every state in the union , to be determined on by their several state leaders of party ! and to call a United States Convention to settle them as they occur . Again you repeat , yes repeat , " that if one party " has the right to judge of infractions of the Consti " tution , so has the other , and that consequently , in " case of contested powers between the states , and gen " eral government , each would have the right to " maintain its opinion , as is the case when Sovereign " powers differ in the construction of treaties , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come to be a mere " question of FORCE ! " If your premises be true , and your conclusions in conformity to the present Constitution , then is our country in an awfnl condition , and a Convention of the twenty-four states ought to be called without de- /z/ lay , as in 1787 , and as the Constitution directs , to relieve us , once more from the dread consequences of this " State Sovereignty / " If false , you are now under a vast responsibility . I am , Yours , &c.; /z/ No. 9. /z/ In No. 8 , your quotations from the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions were in part considered . You proceed to say that " should the general government , * ' and a state come into conflict , we have a higher " remedy ; the power which called the general govern " ment into existence , and which gave it all its authorities , may be invokved . The utmost extent then " of the power is , that a state , acting in its Sovereign " ty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may compel the government , created b y " that Compact , to submit any question , touching " its infractions to the parties who created it " The Constitution provides for amendments , only on application of two-thirds of the state Legislatures , or two-thirds of both houses of Congress , a convention shall be called , &/c.; But no provision is made , by the present Constitution , to refer any dispute between the general government and a state , to the collective body of states , as sovereign parties to any Compact . Such , indeed , was the rule under the confederation , when Congress legislated on the states , as Sovereignties , by requisition for all their wants ; and not as at present , by command 's , on the whole people of the United States collectively . You have constantly deceived yourself and us , by using the word Compact indiscriminately in both cases . The present Constitution , ( not now a Compact ) provides for the adjustment of your nullification dispute , by the judiciary of /z/ the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arising under it , in controversies to which the United States shall be a party . " This is your present assumption . On this dilemma you reason at great length on possible hypothesis , and finally are obliged to cut the gordian not , and openly prostrate the present judiciary power , before the shrine of your " Sovereignty parties " to the old confederatioa Compact , with which it has nothing to do . Nevertheless , in the next breath , you exclain , " I yield , I 44 trust to few , in attachment to the judiciary depart44 ment . I am fully sensible of its importance ; BUT* " it is impossible for me to believe , that it was ever in44 tended by the Constitution , that it should exercise the 44 power in question , or , that it is competent to do so ; 44 and if it were , that it would be an unsafe depository " of the power . " You thus fritter away , piece-meal , every of its provisions , which fail to suit your purposes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution itself are brought into question ! There is no disguise here . Now follows your " sentiments and opinions , " in relation to the right of the majority to govern , and the contrary . You begin , and in like eulogy , as on the judiciary ; " no one can have a higher respect for the // " taken in its proper sense : subject to the restraints " contained in the Constitution , ( I know of none ) and * confined to subjects in which every portion of the " community have similar interests : ( there never was 44 such a community ) but it is a great error to suppose 44 that the right of the majority to govern is a nation44 ly right , and not a Conventional right . Where the 44 interests are the same , that is where the laws that 44 may benefit one will benefit all , it is just to place 44 them under the control of the majority . ( There never 44 were such holy laws on earth , and Milton says an44 gels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 that the law that may benefit one be ruinous to an " other , it would be , on the contrary , unjust and absurd 44 to subject them to its will . Such I tsoilceive to be /z/ the theory on which the Constitution RESTS . ( Rests ? " no sir , you have placed it on the baseless fabric of a " vision . ) Where there are no contrariety of interests , " ( such perfection never did exist even in a single " family ) nothing would be more simple to preserve " free institutions . Then the right of suffrage alone " would be a sufficient guarantee . Indeed a Consti " tutional provision giving to the great , and sepau rate interests oftJie community the right ofselfpro " tcction , must appear , to those who will duly re " jlect on the subject , no less essential tothe preservation u of liberty than the right of suffrage itself ( This is impossible , and would destroy every government on earth . " Tell this not in Gath , " as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nice distinctions between a Conrcntional right , and a natural right of the majority to govern , in our Republic , I must refer back to your scG3 of aids in the mystical course of your productions ; only to say , that the distinction MAY POSSIBLE belong to the sublime doctrines of ontology , or , " the general affections and relations of existing substances and things ! ! ! r However imperfect and even unjust the acts of the majority may be in seme cases , it is nevertheless an indispensible rule in elective governments ; and were it now to cease , it would unhinge the entire of social order ; and that , whether it be a natural or a Conventional right , man would again return to his original condition A SAVAGE ! It is probable that Congress may pass unequal and even unconstitutional laws : a State also , in their sphere of legislation , may do the same , and hurtful to some branch of industry : a free press would soon correct the errors of both , or a change of representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , common honesty , would call it madness to dissolve the Union on such contingencies . Thus , Sir , through your entire range of " sentiments and opinions , " ' as I apprehend them , a like political diplomacy appears , which frequently requires tt page to explain the bearing of a single word ; this - is unpardonable in a republican statesman . You repeatedly quote Mr. Jefferson to your views , I beg also now to quote from his first Inaugural address on entering on the duties of President ; they are all directly opposed to your quotations . He says , " the " preservation of the general government , in its " WHOLE CONSTITUTIONAL VIGOUR , is " the sheet anchor of our peace at home , and " safety abroad . An absolute acquiesscnce in the DECISION OF THE MAJORITY , is the vi** tal principle of Republics , from which their " is no appeal !

Can it ever be believed , for a moment , that Mr. Jefferson gave his sanction to your docriaes of nullification and State Sovereignty , when , only a short time before , he penned the above official opposition to them ? I will not again disturb the ashes of this great man , however , you may in futre seek shelter for your own ' assumptions under his name . Again . The father of his country , GEORGE WASHINGTON , also opposes all your " sentiments , " on the same subject : he says , " a careful " preservation of this blessing , ( our Constitution of " general Government , ) will acquire the glory of re " commending it to the applause , the affection and " adoption of every nation which is yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity of Government which con " stitutes you one people , is also ever dear to you , " much pains will be taken to weaken in your minds " this truth .

" That facility in changes upon the credit " of mere hypothesis and opinions , exposes to per " petual change , from the endless variety of hypo " tJiesis and opinion . % That in a country so a extensive as ours , a Government of as much " vigour , as is consistant with perfect security of " liberty , is i dispensible .

BUT LET THERE BE NO CHANGE /z/ " Parties in small minorities , will seek to make the " public administration the MIRROR OF FACTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 44 faction over another . " In relation , Sir , to this last of my quotations from General Washington 's farewell address , where he speaks of the MIRROR FACTION , I can not now forbear to quote from Senator Miller 's speech in the United States Senate , on President Jackson 's answer , of the 14th day of July , 1831 , to a formal invitation to dine on the 4th of July , with a party , as such , in Charleston , South Carolina . Miller says , " the great body of this party , ( the nulli " fiers , ) resident in Charleston , took it into their " heads , on the 4th of July to celebrate that day as a " party , and sent for foreign aid ; made a formal com " munication , requesting the President ( Jackson ) to " come to their assistance , - and the aid was furnished " in a letter containing a threat against the party , of " military force , to coerse state legislation to conform " to Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the result of the President sending a " military force against the state laws of South Caro* lina ? Sir , if he headed his force himself , one of our /z/ 4 - judges would serve him with a rule , as Dominic " Hall did , when at the head of his army at New-Or " leans , and if he did not obey the rule , he would be " committed . " I must thus take Miller 's sense of Jackson 's letter , as I have it not at hand . Will President Jackson , who declared that he would have hung the leaders of the Hartford Convention , if he had been in command there ; I say , will he now be less energetic in the South , when in chief command ? and where the second officer of the government , is at the head of a powerful party , issuing long proclamations and in the full tide of open preparation ? Surely , the conduct of the Hartford Convention bore no comparison with the present daring outrages of South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration , " THAT THE UNION MUST BE /z/ I arn , Yours , &c.; /z/ No ' . W. /z/ In my canvass of your productions , it was found impossible to connect any regular chain of ideas with the present Constitution of the United States ; they are only applicable to the Confederation COMPACT of 1778 , throughout . The first article of which declares that " each state retains its Sovereignty , freedom and " Independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and " right , which is not by this Confederation expressly " delegated to the United States in Congress assem " bled . " This article presents the head and front of your state Sovereignty assumptions ; and which the present Constitution declares to be " obviously im ' ' practicable , in the federal government of these states , " to secure all rights of Independent Sovereignty to /z/ - each , and yet provide for the interests and safetv i4 of all . " You now deny the right of Congress to protect the Citizens , Mechanics and Tradesmen , against foreign manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this protection has divided the country into two great " geographical divisions , and arrayed them against " each other on the subject of Finance , Commerce and Industry . " The old Comp : ci is here also your so e guide* It restricted the Legislation of that Congress in all these particulars . In the CONSTITUTION , these protections form a main article in it . An old member of Congress told me , that theConfederation Compact , could not be executed by Congress without a constant resort to the doctrine construction , or implication ; otherwise , " sentiments and opinions " The verity of the remark is amply proved in your many adroit efforts , of construction , to reconcile that Compact with the Constitution , which are totally distinct in sense and meaning . You use these words always synonymously , to suit your nullification . You reason and compare , repeatedly run foul ; and again compare and reason , and finally , so entangle yourself , in your own toils , as to make it absolutely necessary for escape , to abandon the CONSTITUTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state Sovereignty gr mnds of the " COMPACT . " I have already far exceeded my limit on this most painful subject , and shall only enumerate a few of the remaining heads of your several positions ; always carefully preserving your sense , where brevity requires my own phraseology . Nought has been , nor shall be set down in malace , " but much extenuated. " 1st You say that the states are gradually subsiding into sectional and selfish attachments . ( Who now stands before the world as the main agent in the . course ? ) 2d . That the general principles of the Constitution itself is brought into question ! ! ! ( By Whom ? ) 3d . That the majority is at the North , but the South Is more determined , ( who made this threat ? ) 4th . That the course of the general government is unconstitutional . ( The legal authorities declare against this " opinion " 5th . That relief has been sought from the government but now , driven to dispair , the South are raising their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only refuge . ( I presume to free them from their obligations to the Constitution. ) 6th . That the question now is between the-exporting and the non-exfiorting interests . That is , if English Jenny - spinners , spindles and Power looms be curtailed in their use arid occupations , in the cotton line , and the free exportation of their productions to our country , then is the nullification of our protecting laws to be declared , and the union dissolved ! ! 7th . That the progress of events are rapidly bringing the contest to an immediate and decisive issue . 8th . That the widely and diversified interests , and relative estimates , without some Constitutional check r must become interminable y except by the dissolution of the union itself . 9th . That there is a deep and growing conviction in a large section of the country , that the imposts* even as a system of revenue are extremely unequal . 10th . That in a state of determined conflict , in relation to the great fiscal and commercial interests of the country , the opposite views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of the system , ought to satisfy all of its unequal action . llth . That nothing can be more certain than that the impression is wicely extending itself , ai ; d if to this be added a deep conviction , still deeper and more universal , that every duty imposed for the purposes of protection , is not only unequal but also unconstitutional . 12th . " That in order to understand more fully the difficulty of adjusting this unhappy contest , of the Constitutional objection ; and that it may be clearly seen how hopeless it is to expect that it can be yielded by those who have embraced it . That Congress are not only restricted by the limitations imposed , but by /z/ nature and object of the granted powers themselves ! That though the power to impose duties on impost be granted , without any express limitations , but that they shall be equal in the states . It is therefore restricted as much as if the Convention had expressly so linditcd it : a lid that to use it to other effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same view is believed to be applied to the regulations of Commerce ! ( Here is a fine specimen of your talent in the art of construction and implication , required by the old compact , as mentioned by the old member of Congress. ) 13th . That to surrender these principles , ( protect us ye G ds ! , would be to surrender all power to the government of the United States , even so despotic ; and the labour and property of the minority subjected to the trill of the majority ! 14th . That we have arrived to a point which a great change can not be much longer delayed , and the more promptly it be met , the less excitement there will be and the greater leisure , and calmness in making the transition ; and which becon es those the more immediately interested to consider . ( What transition ? Our troops swore terribly in Flanders. ) 15th . That the south asks from the government , only to be let alone in the undisturbed possession of its natural advantages ; that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Such is now r the extent tf the Vice President 's , national patriotism ; who has been led through a range of high offices , from his youth , and now stands second in the nation s partiality . I am now more than ever convinced that no man in the high stations , should be kept in office beyond a definite term . ) I will only remark here that , the Vice President has now finally settled the matter . He demands that the government shall do that which is out of the power of all combined to do , short of a dissolution of the Union ) The Vice President winds up in the following manner . " In thus placing my sentiments and opinions before the public : I have not been actuated by ex- /z/ ' pectations to change the public sentiment . Tnis 64 would argue , on my part , an insufferable vanity , and " a profound ignorance of the human heart . ( I must " here ask , is this not a mistake ? " However it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation than any other man since the adoption of our national government . What ! write nineteen columns of close newspaper print without an effective object , or " EXPECTATION " of motive ? This would indeed argue " an insufferable vanity " It could not surely be merely to display " learnings luxury ; " 44 Or tricks to shew the stretch of human brain , " Merecurious pleasure , or ingenious pain . " However " ignorant " it may be , on my part , I do confess , that my whole soul is now in exercise , in hopes , and even in " expectations " to ward off some of the baneful consequences ( as I conceive them to be ) of the Vice President 's " sentiments and opinions , " as relates to my native country ; in whose defence I have passed five years in arms , during her revolution , was twice wounded , made prisoner , in captivity twelve days , under the notorious Cunningham , in the old jail near our park ; and the remainder of seven weeks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in LIBERTY STREET , was regularly exchanged , and continued in arms to the end of the war . And again , served nearly three years of arduous duty in the late war . That I am njw seventy years of age , in good health , and all that yet remains of me belongs to my country . I seek no office of emolument . I have ventured this piece of egotism since my hononrable friend has been so voluminous in speaking of his patriotism . The Vice President proceeds to say that , " I dare " not hope in taking this step I have now done , to 44 escape imputations of improper motives , though I " have , without reserve fully expressed my opinions , " not regarding whether they might be popular . I 44 have no reason to believe that they are such as will " conciliate public favour , but the opposite* which I /z/ " greatly regret . But be that as it may , 1 shall , at " least , be sustained by feelings of conscious rectitude , " regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me individually , are of too little impor " tance to be taken into the estimation , where the " liberty , and happiness of my country are so vitally " involved . " ( Signed ) JOHN C. CALHOUN N.T3 . I will not impugn your motives ' , I must your judgment , in the premises . /z/ 1 have remarked that the two words , " State Sovereignty " had been retained in common use after the adoption of the present Consitution , when the fact ceased to exist : and that the neglect , or oversight , to have put into use , the true substitute also consisting of two words , viz. " State Rights " now stands as the head and front of all the personal and state aberrations from that day to this , against the government of the Union , and the sacrilegious arm is again lifted up . ! And again . The mistaken use of the word " Compact " also , as applied , indiscriminately , to the confederation , and the present Constitution , has led my learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Confederation was indeed a Compact between thirteen independant Sovereignties , and continued so to be , until it was abrogated by a Constitution . The grand Convention met indeed , " as Sovereign parties under the Compact " and finished by establishing a Constitution . The word Constitution is not mentioned in the Compact , nor is the word Compact named in the Constitution ; it would have been a p erversion of terms , as they are totally distinct , in sense , and irreconcilable in principle . Our State /z/ Constitutions are not called Compacts , because they were formed by order of all the people of each State ; and the aggregate of the State Constitutions is now the Constitution of the United States . The world thus viewed the simple structure of our government , as we did , with wonder and delight . The plain written Constitution was the only guide , and declared to be " the Supreme law of the land , " Europe commenced the struggle of imitation , and seeks relief from the vindictive personal , and family despotisms . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark in the public speeches , and addresses of our great men , a kind of half yielding to the present boisterous and tumultuous displays of a few , may be , ' ' ' brave and desperate leaders . " Sedition is encouraged by a relaxtion in the power to punish it . If this yielding , is yet expected to effect reconciliation , I am wrong in the estimation of It . The Vice President meets the case on his part boldly , that such " expectations are hopeless , that the South is determined ! Let it be remembered that sedition uuchecked , will soon become rebellion , and too powerful to be restrained , but by physical force , thus the old addage. that " fears in the p ublic councils betray like treason . " The " POTOMAC " is the dividing line ! The English historian says that , " in 1653 , Oliver " Cromwell , who hated subordination to the Repub " lican Parliament , had the address to get himself de " clared commander in chief of the English Army ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on the 20th April , 1653 , without any ceremony , ; with about 300 Musqueteers and disolved the Par " liament and assumed the Dictatorship , " when probably they also were making long speeches in the Par liament about reconciliaton , " they were nullified in a body . " In the same manner Buonaparte , at the head of a few Grenadiers , dissolved the republican legislative body of France , and became an Emperor ! " Cromwell 's partizans declared him Lord protector of the Commonwealth of England ; a title under /z/ which he exercised powers , far beyond those of the royal dignity . No king ever acted more dispotically than he did . His partizans liked this , but threatened to oppose him if he took upon himself the Title of King ; on which subject he had frequently sounded them . His amazing success in arms , dazzled the great mass of the people . However , after a most uncomfortable usurpation of four years eight months anu thirteen days , he died , miserably , on the 3rd of September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Vice President also speaks much of the " Coordinate powers of our government . " This is also a mistake . another catch-word . There are no such departments or powers in our government . The compound word " Co-ordinate " is defined to mean , and does mean , " holding the same rank " we have first , a legislative power , which comes immediately from the people , and is the real Sovereignty ! It makes the laws , and holds the Constitutional power to impeach the Judiciary and the Executive , if the one or the other neglect , refuse , or become guilty of usurpation , or mal practice in their several and distinct stations . There is no power to impeach the legislature , it is a falacy to teach that " each of the three great departments of our government hold an equal power to judge of infractions " in the same cases , and " co ordinate " manner . The Judiciary , judges of the Constitutionality of the laws which the Legislature makes , and the Executive executes the laws thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or holding the same rank , each department is distinct . This amalgamation of powers is working ruin to our government , by the assumption of powers not in conformity of the Constitution . Let each of these separate and distinct authorities be assured that an inflexible integrity and undaunted firmness , and courage , will always meet the support of a free and enlightened people , at every sacrifice which may be required in all cases , of undue assumption . /z/ The great body of the people , of both parties , love their general government ; and permit me to repeat that , external pressure and DOMESTIC TREASON , can have no other tendency , when it sJiall be clearly seen to exist , than that of rousing the nation , in every part of it , in defence of the constituted authorities ; each in its strict and proper Constitutional sphere vf duty : admitting no encroachment , for a moment , of one department on the other . This is not now to be done , in speeches of bare recapitulation , of the daring outrages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when our public addressers should speak the language of defiance , and the determined means to save the Constitution . It is now time to rouse the nation to its dangers , and the true Constitutional means of its own inherent energies , and not to suifer them to perish by default . The line of the Constitution is the guide . Our government is frequently spoken of , as resting merely on " OPINIONSNO ! It is a government in FACT , holding command , by order of the people of the whole United States , of all the energies of SUPREME POWER , over the Union , to inforce and sustain its undivided integrity , and equal , in all respects , to any government on earth ! Shall the page of history ever be obliged to record that the present generation , and especially the present authorities , in ample tnajority , through a faint hearted timidity , had suffered " the worlds best hope ? to pass away like a morning cloud ? while the distroyer is in open display , and determined arrangements , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a timid opposition , while perfecting their scheme , that , when it shall amount to an open approbation ot a state , will be admitted as valid , and " paramount ' 1 ' to the Constitution and laws of the United States ! ! ! We have seen that our old ship Confederation with her thirteen commanders in chief , came well nigh foundering in 1787 . Her fastenings were of leaf /z/ and her frame work Was seen to shake . The alarm became general ; the whole company arose , an examination was instituted ; when all her timbers proved to be sound , and of American live oak . Artists of the first order were instantly employed to rebuild , and new model ; and in about five months the work was proclaimed to be complete . It was critically inspected by the whole cdmpany , and their orders unanimously given to make preparation for the launch . The day was set , the solemnity to be performed in the City of New York , it was the fourth of March in the year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief Executive command .

I A witness to this scene declared that it appeared to him , that the hosts of heaven , at that moment , were looking down with approbation on the act . That he w r as deprived of utterance and could only wave his hat among the multitude ! I was also a witness to the scene .
