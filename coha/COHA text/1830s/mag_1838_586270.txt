txt THE purpose of this paper is riot to discuss the tenets designated under this title , but to show the absurdity of the alarm which they excite , or which it is pretended they justify . This may seem to be a work of supererogation . It is , indeed , hard to believe that any man of sense can entertain serious apprehensions upon this score . In the midst of the difficulties in which we are involved , and the real dangers by which we are threatened , to be frightened by such visionary evils indicates a very whimsical imagination , or , at least , a morbidly sensitive nature . By politicians we are aware the topic is used as a mere bugbear , or rather as a hackneyed electioneering theme . Writers who lack originality of thought , or ingenuity of reason , find this a very convenient subject for declamation . Deprive them of their slang ( we can not find a better word , though a coarse one , ) about Loco-Focoism , Fanny- Wriglitism , Agrarianism , and they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pity to cut them off from this fertile resource . But we should not calculate too strongly upon human reason . In the long run , in an enlightened community , its dictates will always prevail , and the " sober second thought of the people , " in the philosophical language of President Van Buren , is perhaps " never wrong . " But in the passion or delusion of the moment , evils may be inflicted which time can not repair ; and there are some maladies of sudden origin which are incurable . The very pertinacity with which political partisans , who , although they may want wisdom , are seldom without its bastard substitute , cunning , insist upon those topics is a proof that they are not without their effect . Spargere ambignas voces , is a more effectual method of propagating alarms , than by bringing definite charges , or specific accusations . Suspicion is more hurtful than actual crimination ; its very indefiniteness gives scope to the suggestions and fears of the susceptible imagination . We should never // altogether despise such appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , according to Madame de Stael , was made by words . We cite the sentence for its apposite point , rather than for the truth of its application to the great political earthquake which shook European society to its foundation . Now we happen to know , from actual observation , that the charge against the Democratic party of holding anti-social doctrines , and opinions subversivc of the rights of property , has done much to prejudice it in the minds of many worthy and sensible persons . There is in every community a large class of men , and they form a most valuable portion of the population , who are averse to ultraism in every shape . Satisfied with their condition , they prefer the status quo , and are unwilling to sacrifice positive benefits to speculative ameliorations . All that they ask is tranquillity ; that they may follow their pursuits , and enjoy domestic happiness , and the fruits of their industry , without molestation . They reverse the sentiment of the old Roman who preferred hazardous liberty ( libertas periculosa ) to the calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their influence in the community is salutary . They check the extravagance of more ardent spirits . They form the regulator of the political machine . They are the drag on the wheel of state . Their vis inertia gives stability to social institutions . They are the breakwater which stays the flood of popular commotion . Without them , we should , perhaps , be too prone to speculative changes ; too ready to embark upon the ocean of untried experiment . Among this class , from temperament and mind , we do not count ourselves ; nevertheless we know how to value it , and even to respect its prejudices . It is fortunate that we do not all think and feel alike . It takes many kind of people , says the vulgar adage , to make up a world . It is for the benefit of society that it contains adverse and contending elements . This keeps up a healthy , vigorous action ; this prevents that lethargic stagnation , which is more than any thing else , unfavorable to its efficiency and improvement . Discors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the physical world . It is chiefly amongst this class of persons that the apprehensions of which we have spoken , have been propagated with the greatest success . Secluded in their habits and ideas , and isolated from the tumultuous existence of cities , the ferment of political effervescence is brought to their ears , magnified by distance , like the " sound of many waters . " The roar of faction and the turmoil of political agitation are swelled by the gale which bears them along , until the retired mansion and the quiet hamlet are " frightened from their propriety . " All this is so different from their tranquil existence ,  --  jars so harshly upon the uniformity of their pursuits and habits ,  --  that they feel uneasy and disturbed , nay , anxious and alarmed for the consequences . It is to these , and these // only , whose apprehensions are unfeigned , whose patriotism is undoubted , whose very prejudices are respectable , that we intend to address a few desultory and unpretending observations . In the first place we must observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the opinions of all its members . This will be conceded without hesitation . " How foolish , " exclaimed Charles V. , " to expect all men to think alike , when the most cunning workman can not make two watches go exactly together . " We cite the substance of the sentiment . Admitting that some members of a party which comprires two-thirds of a great nation , hold irrational opinions , what does this prove ? Certainly not that the essential and recognized doctrines of that party are wrong , and should be abandoned . Would it not be hard to charge the Federal party with holding principles utterly adverse to liberty , or with the design of overturning our republican institutions , because some of its members , and a goodly number , too , are at heart , if not confessedly , monarchists ? Shall we take the opinions of the modern Sydney , as the Federal creed , or visit upon all , the doubts of Hamilton and the sneers of Morris ? This would hardly be fair . We maintain , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it would scarcely be generous to assume or to assert , that they are so in the intentions of all those who hold them . In grave discussions , let us abandon the exaggeration of newspaper polemics , and both give and claim justice . Yet we hear every day the extravagances attributed to a few , ascribed to the whole body of the Republican party ; and those who frankly adopt the opinions of Jefferson and of Madison , the philosopher and sage of American liberty , stigmatized by the most opprobrious epithets , and calumniated by the most ungenerous imputations . It is a remark of Chateaubriand , that in a country where all men write and speak , we must make up our minds to hear patiently a great deal of nonsense . The human mind , in its infinite modifications , is prone to exaggerations and extravagancies ; it has its day dreams , and its waking visions , its optical illusions , and spectral hallucinations . The most unsound theories are often the most l ) iausible ; sophistry is often more specious than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the approaches of falsehood ; they do but lend strength and zeal to the seductions of error . Clear perception of truth is rarer than the ingenious defence of fallacy . It is more difficult to think justly than with brilliancy . Common sense is , after all , the most uncommon sense . To reason well is a rarer faculty than to reason much . For one man , whose deductions are uniformly sound , you will meet with a hundred whose opinions are striking in statement , and happy in expression . This world is one vast academy of Laputa , and that satire of the misanthropist has been drawn from truth . The race of projectors , // visionaries , and experimenters , is the most numerous , and will never be extinct . Where the reason is weak , and the imagination lively , there is no end to the abortive progeny of schemes and speculations . The mind teems with these " crotchets and maggots of the brain , " like the " equivocal generation " of the slime deposited by the river of Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the exemplification of this , in mechanics . There is not a madhouse which has not some votary to the quadrature of the circle , the ascertainment of the longitude , or the discovery of perpetual motion . Throughout the civilized world there are constantly thousands who waste their whole substance , and exhaust their whole lives , in the effort to attain utterly unattainable ends . There are men who can scarcely creep , who are ever trying to invent means to fly . There is no end to the deliramenta of the human mind . There is no limit to the more than Chinese puzzles of the intellect . Why , then , should we object to a little theory in politics , or be surprised that human ingenuity or inventiveness should also take this direction ? It is a subject which rises in importance above all others ; which includes all others in its settlement . It is that which concerns the well-being , the improvement , the property , nay , the very lives of men . It is one which daily comes home to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is paramount to all others . It determines the character , the prosperity , the existence of nations , as well as of individuals . Without good government there is no security of possession , no protection of law , no permanency of enjoyment , no activity of industry , no developement of the faculties and capabilities of human nature . Shallow minds , we know , disparage the science of politics as one of impracticable speculations , and cite with ignorant exultation the famous couplet of PopeFor forms of government let fools contest ; XVhate'er is best administered is best ; as if the poet seriously entertained the belief , that all the modifications of social polity were equally good and that an essentially bad government could be so administered , in the long run , as to promote the highest prosperity of a people . One of this class of declaimers was once citing the remark of Fox , that he who caused two blades of grass to grow where but one grew before , was a greater benefactor to mankind , than the whole race of statesmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avail you in Turkey , " was the prompt reply . We make these observations to show that nothing is so well calculated to interest and excite the human mind as political speculations . Nor should we think too lightly of this spirit of inquiry even in its extravagancies and aberrations . There are doubtless many discoveries to make in political science , as there are without question , // marry evils to be eradicated or at least mitigated in the social state . This spirit of investigation does not exist in vain , and is not , or will not be , without its fruits . The visions of the last age , have become the realities of this , and opinions which are now deemed absurd and impracticable , may to-morrow be adopted with success . There was a time , and that not far back , when religious tolerance was deemed a heresy in politics as in religion , and the separation of Church and State , the complete freedom of the conscience from legal fetters , is a very modern doctrine , and even now but partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently to all opinions . Truth will be winnowed by discussion fron3 the chaff of error , and what is good and sound will abide for the instruction and benefit of those who are to come after us . Let the fnllest scope be given to human inquiry , even should it to a certain extent shake the admitted belief , and unsettle the existing ideas of men . the attempt to fetter it but gives importance to error , and the force of resiliency to heresy . Much yet remains to be learned and done . There are still mysteries to be unravelled , and problems to be solved . We can not feel much respect for him who can sit down and fold his hands in contentment with what has been achieved . It is true that in every state of society much evil will exist , much suffering will be inevitable . There will always be pants which " neither kings nor laws can cure . " At all times men have , and in all times they will , suffer many evils and oppressions . He who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect happiness of mankind , is wofully mistaken , or rather labors under a fond delusion . It is the lot of human nature to suffer . " Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live , and is full of trouble . " But let not these melancholy reflections deter us from unwearying efforts to meliorate the condition of humanity . Much can be accomplished , to which that which has already been done can not compare in magnitude . There are all around us refreshing indications of progress and improvement , and who will limit the march of improvement ? A spirit of inquiry has been aroused throughout the civilized world , which is directed to the social amelioration of man . When Beccaria first published his work against excessive pains and penalties , the idea of abolishing capital punishment , for even minor offences , was deemed preposterous . Now there are flourishing States , where it has been wholly abandoned and with advantage . There was a time , and that not far back , when , in the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for debt , was something more than a mere figure of speech . Now the public attention which has been turned seriously to the condition of prisons , has rendered them more efficient by reforming their abuses ; and the abolition of incarceration for debt has become a popular idea , having even been partially determined upon in a country , where the // horrors of the Fleet and the Marshaisca have acquired a painful and odious celebrity which will be enduring as our language . We cite these few illustrations out of many which might be adduced . No man of a philanthropic spirit can look around him without seeing countless evils which it would be his earnest desire to mitigate or extirpate . There are hideous ulcers on the social body , which require the caustic and the knife of the political surgeon ,  --  e'ase recidenda . By day and by night the voice of lamentation is heard upon earth and ascendeth to heaven . Cruelty , oppression , injustice , are yet rife in every land under the sun . What man who sympathizes with humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having his feelings harrowed by scenes of the most revolting misery and injustice . He sees the palace confronted with the hovel ; he witnesses superfluous wealth in actual contact with utter destitution . One man sits down to an Apician banquet , while another perishes at his threshold for the want of a crust of bread . " One treads upon the carpets of Persia or of Turkey , and burns the perfumes of the East in his vaulted halls , " while another dies on a duaghill . On the one hand riotous opulence , on the other abject misery ; here the child of poverty driven to crime by the desperation of want ; there the minions of luxury stimulated to vice by the very satiety of pleasure . We do not say that all these things can be remedied ; that these evils may be entirely cured ; that the inequalities of fortune and the causes of vice and misery may be utterly extirpated . But we do say , that the man who can look and reflect on these things with indifference or without a yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least palliate them , is of a soulless and heartless nature . There is , then , much justification for those who are striving for social ameliorations which even if unattainable are humane in the intention , and desirable in the end ; nor should we lightly discourage that spirit which busies itself in philanthropic speculations. * * Let those who sneer at political philanthropy read the following extract from a late French work , a Treatise upon the Education of Mothers of Families , by M. Aimfl Martin . " The great misfortune of our villages is the degradation of women by the labors which belong to men . In their early infancy they drive the flocks and gather the harvest . While youn , girls , an instinct of coquetry , and the foresiaht Of their mothers , banish them from the ruder fatigues of agriculture ; but as soon as they are married every thin , is chan&amp;d ; they abandon the house and followtheirhusbands into the fields . You see them bent to the earth like machines , or loaded with enormous burdens like beasts . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) where they are attached to the plough like the ox and the ass . Then their skin becomes wrinkled , their features become masculine , and they fall into a premature decrepitude more hideous than that of old age . But while they are performing the labors of the woman , ( those labors which soften all others ) they remain unknown or neglected . Nothing can be more dirty and more unhealthy than the interior of a cottage . Often , hens , ducks , and hogs dispute the possession of its damp soil . The door opens into the mud , and the windows3 when there are any , open upon the dus*gheap. // But we deem it even fortunate for our republican system , and for the interests of freedom , that some ardent spirits exist who carry their ideas to the verge of extravagance . They invigorate and preserve the sacred flame which otherwise might become dim , or even extinct . Their enthusiasm animates those whose devotion might become sluggish from their absorption in sordid pursuits and material occupations . Th3ir too ardent zeal serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anti-liberal opinions which , under every form of government , exists in the very nature of many men . These opposing impulses , like the centripetal and centrifugal forces , keep the body politic in its true and invariable orbit . If one man is a leveller in opinion , another is a monarchist in feeling , so that there is a counterbalancing weight on the other side . But it is chiefly upon the more sluggish mass of their own party that these radical democrats exert a salutary influence . Let justice be done to those who are stigmatized by the title of Loco-Focos . Reviled as they have been , and made a very by-word by ignorant scoffers , the doctrines which they have " Here it is , however , in a mudhole , like that of a savage , in the midst of the grunting of animals , and their offensive exhalations , that every evening , two human beings come to rest themselves from their fatigues . Here , no one welcomes them ; nothing agreeable meets their eyes ; the table is empty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other labors await the woman ; and before thinking of her hushands sup* per , and the care of her children , she must attend to the stable , and give food to the beasts . " What a difference would there he if ; abandoning to man the rude labors of the earth , and confining her own to the interior of the house , the woman , hy her graceful foresight , had prepared every thing for the hour of return . The blaze would sparkle on the hearth ; on the table , polished hy her hands , would smoke the nutritious soup , cad the high pyramids of chestnuts and potatoes bursting invitingly from their skins . The good housewife would then never be seen hy her husband hut in the midst of abundance , and surrounded by the smiling flock of her children . Thus , a genteel and easy life would become the life of a villager . But nothing gives him the idea of such happiness ; he is i , , norant of comfort , the charm of caresses , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife dreads the vigor of his arm . The adversary , and not the protector , of these feeble beings , he knows no law but force . The last reason of the peasant , in his cabin as well as the fields , is generally the weight of his fist . " If we are asked for examples , we will cite whole provinces , the richest as well as thc poorest , of France . Perigord , where the women grovel in a state of dirt and degradation , which re-acts upon the whole family-Picardy and Limousin , where repulsed to the last degree as an inferior race , they serve their husbands at the table without ever placing themselves at their sides-Crisse , where they are mere machines , beasts of burden and labor-Lower Brittany , finally , where the men , wemen , and children , reduced to an almost savabe state , pell mell in the same mud , eat the same black corn in the same man er with their sheep and swine . Every where the degradation of the woman is the proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brutalization of the man is the re-action of the degradation of the woman . Such is the situation of the peasantry in almost the whole of civilized Europe . " And this is in la belle France , the land of gallantry ; the renowned realm of chivalry ! We thit*k there is some room for improvement yet . // maintained , through evil report , are generally sound , and their practice , with perhaps slight exceptions , would make the world , happier and better . They are democrats in earnest ; and their opinions , when freed from the exaggeration of passion , are those of enlightened philosophy . Their political doctrines are those of Jefferson , of Taylor , and of Madison ; their financial opinions , those of all the accredited writers upon political economy . We have seen nothing in their proceedings , their speeches , and their resolutions , which , when fairly understood , with proper allowances , should excite the apprehensions of the most sober-minded republican . We speak now of what we have heard and read . They have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors have not been pointed out , nor their reasons refuted . Their doctrine is simply that of equal rights ; they are opposed to those monopolies and exclusive privileges which all must admit are at variance with the fundamental principles of our Government . They wish to en . croach upon no man 's rights , to seize upon no man 's property ; but they insist upon a clear field and no favor . They wish to secure to industry its just reward ; to the mouth of labor , the bread which its hands have earned . They feel that there is no security for honorable toil under the fluctuations of a vicious paper currency , which a distinguished Senator , the head and ornament of the Federal party , has happily described to be the most successful of all inventions " to fatten the rich man 's field with the sweat of the poor many s brow . " They see that practices and privileges have been permitted to grow up under our system , contradictory to its letter , and at war with its spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out those results which they should and can produce . They feel that the word of promise has been kept to the ear , but broken to the sense . They insist upon all the consequences which can fairly be educed from the principles which are at the foundation of democratic liberty . With these convictions and feelings , is it astonishing that they should express themselves with earnestness , and in the heat of the conflict , as all men are prone to do , sometimes exaggerate their opinions ? Is it surprising that the voice of passion should sometimes swell above that of reason , when they hear the most absurd opinions and infamous designs falsely ascribed to them by their oppressors , who , under this cloud of obloquy , would not only debar them from the recovery of their lost rights , but even add fresh manacles to their fettered limbs ? Surely not . And if ever they should , in the frenzy of desperation , realize the pretended apprehensions of their cold-hearted calumniators , who would be to blame , but those who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings by adding insult to injury ? But there is no fear of this . They will not fail to reconquer their rights by more pacific measures . // it has been attempted to attach much odium to the , so called , radical democrats for holding the doctrine of the revocability of charters . For this they have been called robbers and violators of the public faith . These are hard words , and should not be applied for slight causes . It is not our intention , in this paper , either to maintain or to combat the doctrine . Our purpose will be simply to show , that irrational and anti-social as it may appear , ( to use one of the cant phrases of the day , ) it is not original with these much vilified politicians , but has been held by men who would give authority and do honor to any opinion . It is well known to have been a leading doctrine in the creed of Mr. Jefferson , who was wont indignantly to exclaim " Can the dead bind the living ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Taylor of Caroline , who treated the opposite opinion as both shocking to common sense and incompatible with the first principles of political freedom . It is recorded by a distinguished gentleman , that Mr. Madison , a short period before his death , spoke of this question as at least one of difficulty and doubt . The common fallacy , that a consideration in the shape of a bonus converts a charter into an inviolable contract , as if the essential character of a great political question could be altered by the intentional addition of something foreign and adscititious , we regard as infinitely more absurd than almost any doctrine attributed to the Loco-Focos . If the converse of the opinion held by them could find no more specious grounds , the solution of the problem would not present much difficulty . In England , the Whig or Liberal party have always held , and sometimes carried into effect , the doctrine which is called radical with us . The debates on the East India and Bank questions , particularly the speeches of Mr. Fox , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Parliament , the discussion of the abolition of the Negro Apprenticeship raised a similar question , and it is singular to observe the almost unanimity with which it was maintained that a great political and moral measure , affecting such extensive rights and interests , could not be regarded in the narrow point of view of a mere contract . This consideration , it was alleged , might give an equitable claim for compensation , but by no means fetter the hands of Parliament . We may mention , also , that the American politicians who take this view of the charter question , have been most unfairly treated . They have been accused of intending confiscation and robbery , and the fact has been studiously concealed that they have uniformly contemplated , not only a return of the bonus , when a consideration has been paid , but even a reasonable allowance for the damages or loss that may be inflicted by the revocation of the privilege . It may be stated further , that in those cases where the State , in granting bank charters especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been considered // less desirable , or the investment less safe . There is an entire reliance upon the public faith and honor , and the only effect of the precaution , which is certainly a salutary one , is to put the companies upon their good behaviour . We repeat , it has not been our intention here to discuss this question , or take part with either side , but merely to show that the opinion of the popular party is not quite so irrational , so unsustained by high authority , or so novel , as is commonly supposed . On the subject of chartered immunities it may be well to observe , that even in Great Britain the fory Lord Liverpool , when Premier , declared in his place in Parliament , that the day of monopolies had gone by . This was Loco-Focoism in high places , indeed . We now come to the greatest humbug of all , to employ a term which seems to be stereotyped upon the lips of our adversaries , we mean the panic about agrarianism . We find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehensions on this score . The community doctrine is so absurd , and its execution so impracticable , that to make it an object of serious refutation , is to give it too much importance . It is an impossible theory . The agrarians of Rome , from whom we have the name , were not agrarians in the modern sense of the word . they did not demand a general division of property , but the restoration of the public domain to those to whom it had originally belonged ; who had won it by their valor , and from whom it had been fraudulently alienated . It was for the recovery , not the destruction , of property that the Gracchi strove ; it was in defence of the vested rights of original possession that they perished . The ancient agrarians , then , were anti.agranan as the word is now understood . In fact no attempts upon a large scale have ever been made to carry out this speculation , except in the Utopia of Sir Thomas More , or some other founder of imaginary commonwealths . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sometimes held out as a stimu lus to an infuriated mob , but never , we imagine , as a principle of permanent political organization . In that furious insurrection of the common people in France , known as La Jacquerie , and in some other popular outbreaks , some vague ideas of the kind may have prevailed , but the unreasoned chronicles which we have of these remote events , do not enable us to estimate with accuracy their causes or their objects . One thing seems to be clear , that they were sudden outbreaks of the poorer sort of people , excited by accidental perhaps slight causes , against long and grievous oppressions . The obsequious chroniclers tell the tale of power reeking with triuml ) h . We should like to hear both sides . If ever there was a revolution which gave birth to the wildest phantasies and the most visionary projects , it was that of France . All the elements and materials of the political fabric , were thrown back // into chaos . No prejudice however hoary with antiquity was spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no right however legalized by the sanction of ages was sacred-save that of property . Neither religion nor morals was unviolated by the thorough-going reformers of this terrible epoch ; the sacred bond of marriage , that strongest ligament of human society , was rudely torn asunder . Titanlike , they scaled the very heavens with impious defiance . Yet the sanctity of possession was respected ; and if the estates of men were often cruelly confiscated and for trivial reasons , it was never on the ground that all men at all times were equally entitled to property in the earth , in its fruits , and those of industry . That which withstood a Marat , a Robespierre , and a Danton , has not much to fear from " Slamm , Bang &amp; Co . " The fact is that property is the foundation of civilized society , as marriage is of domestic morals . To talk about society without the basis of individual possession , is to talk about morality without the existence of the conjugal tie . In the wildest state man has property in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomadic he recognizes individual right in his horses and cattle ; and civilized society , from its most incipient agricultural condition , is as much an aggregation of possessions as of individuals or families . The fallacy at the foundation of the community doctrine is this , that it contemplates the earth without taking into view the additional value bestowed upon it by the industry of man . Without the improvement which labor has bestowed upon it , this world would be a barren *vaste or a rank wilderness . What were the possession of a continent , without the application of agriculture and the arts ? It is labor which gives nearly all its value to the earth ; the industry of man which does much more for him , than all the bounties of nature . It is the opinion of some political economists , De Tracy among the rest , that all value is derived from labor , and no one will deny , that it proceeds chiefly from that source . To talk , then , about the original and indefeasible right of all men to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wealth and its worth to the industry of man , which is chiefly stimulated by , nay , which would not have been exerted without the existence of individual possession . There can certainly be no universal claim by nature or original right , to houses and furniture , and manufactured products , and the improvement of agriculture , even if it were conceded , as it regards the mere soil , which would not however , be very desirable without the labor by which it has been cultivated and adorned . Now , it is only individual possession , and the right of testamentary transmission of property , which has induced or can impel men to make those untiring exertions which have converted the rude gifts of nature into the products of subsistence , the means of comfort , the commodities of luxury , and the refinements of civilization . // Even , then , conceding the original right of every one to the earth , as it came from the hands of the Creator , this has , ever since the origin of human society been merged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges of individual pos. session . This is the oldest and highest of all prescriptive titles . What is the state of man by nature , it is hard to say . All our speculations and reasonings must regard him as a gregarious animal , and have reference to the social state in which he has existed from the earliest traditions , and which alone comes within the purview of political science . But it is rather too late in the day to proclaim these trite truisms . It is vain , too , to vindicate them , because people who do not at once recognize their conclusions , are not to be addressed by reason . The community doctrine has not the poor merit of originality or even novelty . It has always been a seductive idea , when sincerely entertained , to weak and amiable minds . The speculations of the ancient philosophy are full of it ; and if early christianity , fresh from the precepts of its divine founder , " had all things in common , " the practicability of the doctrine in the present age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity . vrhe anabaptists of Germany and other sects attempted it on a small scale and in a modified shape , but with poor success . Among these are the Moravians . We know not how their political microcosm has fared in Germany , but in this country , they have been already compelled to abandon , in a great measure , the principle . The example of the Shakers will scarcely he appealed to for its support , since it would furnish an equally strong argument for the possibility of eradicating the strongest of the natural instincts . This brings to mind an anecdote of one of the popes , who when told by a cardinal with a dismal face , that a sect whose principal tenet was the injunction of celibacy had sprung up , and threatened the very existence of the hierarchy , coolly observed , " don t be alarmed , seuza amore flOTh si riusce , without love it is impossible to succeed . " The wild theories of St. Simonianism were almost too extravagant for apprehension , and too ephemeral for notice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Owen , have terminated , the one in litigation , the other in abandonment . Folly , like dulness , never dies . As long as the world lasts these projects will be revived by the dupers or the duped , only to perish and be born again . They are founded upon an appeal to undying principles and feelings in human nature . These might be easily indicated and illustrated , but we have not time nor space for the task . Human commonwealths must be constructed with different materials from " the ants ' republic and the realm of bees . " If agrarianism he an universal absurdity , how much more is it so in this country , where land is so cheap , and many millions of un // appropriated territory render possession so acce*ible to all . Even the accumulated wages of labor soon consolidate themselves into property of some kind , and it is rare to meet with a man who is not , has not been , or will not be , the owner of land or a house . In such circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural , to acquire property than to make war upon it . That the imputation is peculiarly unjust , as applied to the democratic party , is obvious from the fact , that its strength lies chiefly in the yeomanry of the country , who are almost to a man property holders ; while the opposite influence has always been most potent in cities , where the class of mere proletaries is chiefly to be found . Again , to show that the tendency is rather in the opposite direction , or the danger from the other quarter , it must have struck every one , that as soon as the Opposition succeeded in propagating extensively the belief that the Administration was hostile to the rights of property , it was left in a minority , and it is only recovering its predominance by dint of disproving the accusation . We would ask , too , whether the republicaii leaders are , from character and position , more open to the imputation of being adverse to order , industry , and property , than other members of the community ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge if it be possible to find men who , from their habits , principles , and possessions , present stronger guarantees against the suspicion of holding these wild and anti-social opinions ? But we must bring this discussion to a close . It is the more useless , because the imputation of agrarianism to any fragment , even , of the republican party , is false as it is ridiculous . We have yet to see the democrat who deserves the title . The accusation is unfounded , gratuitous , calumnious . The allegation is not made with sincerity . Why labor to convince those who have no convictions ? The republican creed is clear and simple . It is the retention of as much individual liberty as is consistent with the security of each and the general harmony . It respects the persons , the rights , the property , nay , the very prejudices , of all . It legislates not for individuals or classes , but for the whole . It recognises no political distinction or superiority . It leaves to men the control of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not encroach upon the rights of others . The tastes , the habits , the fashions of the citizen , it does not interfere with , much less attempt to regulate or enforce . It permits society to arrange itself by its own volitions , and leaves the associations of its members to their respective elective affinities . It recognises no exclusive privileges , no selfish monopolies ; but embraces all with indiscriminate protection . The democratic creed may be summed up in this brief formula . As little government as possible ; that little emanating from , and controlled by , the people ; and uniform in its application to all.
