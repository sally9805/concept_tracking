txt WE consider it peculiarly fortunate for the interests of American literature , especially now , when every one , who can write joining hand , writes verses , that one of the most extraordinary models of style , which ever existed , has been imported from Europe . Our readers will at once perceive that we mean that very ingenious light of learning , Dr. James M'Henry , of whom Philadelphia is so justly proud . Yet great as the Doctor is in medicine , verse and prose ,  - -  though just at this time he enjoys considerable personal notoriety ,  --  we do not find that justice has ever been done to his merits . The reviews do not review him , newspapers do not puff him , and there is even danger that he may sink into oblivion , together with his works , unhonored , unwept , unlamented . We , therefore , consider it a duty to step a little out of our usual path to prevent the extinction of so glorious a luminary . The origin and early career of this great man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much appears to be an acknowledged truth-he is an Irishman ; but whether Catholic or Protestant we have been unable to learn with certainty . At first , judging from the fact , that the favorite characters of one of his books come from Ulster , and speak an unknown tongue , we inclined to think him an Orangeman ; but , reading farther , the rich raciness of his brogue staggered us in our opinion . Since then , the noble confidence with which he continues his efforts to instruct and amuse , in spite of neglect , has almost demonstrated a true , unmixed Milesian descent . When Dr. M'Henry first honored this country with his presence , he burst upon the public with a novel , entitled , " The Wilderness . " It was at once apparent that the author was no imitator . The style introduced by Sir Walter Scott was then the style of all American novels . It had been adopted by nearly all the most eminent writers , English and Yankees . Several of these , Cooper and Galt , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their influence was sufficient to bring this style into repute with the mass of readers , and the candidates for literary renown on this side of the Atlantic , taking the opinions of British reviewers for canons of criticism , fell into the prevailing error , and imitated the very worst // peculiarities of the new school . Dr. M'Henry scorned the rock on which so many had split . The lovers of light reading searched the Wilderness in vain for the minute fidelity of description which distinguishes Cooper , the dry humor of Gait , or the intimate knowledge of human nature which is displayed in every page of Scott . It was erroneously pronounced , hy public opinion , one of the very dullest offsprings of stupidity , and has slumbered ever since on the shelves of book-shops and circulating libraries . The great merit of the Wilderness is the originality of its plot . Gilbert Frazier , an emigrant from Ulster , who speaks a language we do not understand , settles on the banks of the Juniata , whence he is carried a prisoner to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and becomes acquainted with Aliquippa , queen of the Shawnees . The Doctor thus describes this lady , showing how much Indian fashions then differed from those of the present day A kind of diadem , made of the red feathers of the flamingo a bird never seca in the alley of the Ohio ! plaited together , encircled her brows , and , in some parts , seemed enwreathed with her hair , which was very plentiful , and of a brilliant jet color . A large splendid crystal hung pendent from each ear ; and from her neck , which , as well as a considerable part of her breast , was bare , hung a slit . tering chain of variegated beads . Her elbows and wrists were surrounded with scarlet bands , made of dyed skins , and ornamented beads , " &amp;c . Queen Aliquippa , as well as the rest of our author 's Indians , shows a proper disregard of the earth ; her speech is ever in the clouds ; she expresses the most ordinary thought in metaphor , as Indians are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . however , Queen Aliquippa has nothing further to do with the story , excepting to give Mr. Gilbert Frazier certain lands on Turtle Creek . Mr. Frazier takes charge of the infant daughter of a French officer , and educates her as his own . This young woman , in the midst of a howling wilderness , with no companions but savages and the family of an Irish bog-trotter , becomes polished and accomplished , by the assistance of an Indian prophet , who teaches her to relish the English classics ! In due time , a lover appears , one Charles Adderly , who engages in several skirmishes with the Indians , and uniformly comes by the worse . After a while , Colonel Washington appears in Mr. Frazier 's cabin , and is so smitten , at first sight , by our author 's heroine , that he can eat no supper , though be has made a long day 's march over the mountains . At the first opportunity , he offers the lady his hand , and is rejected . In the mean while , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly saved from the consequences of his folly and mismanagement , by the Indian prophet , Tonneleuka . This last character is a strange one . He is highly esteemed by the Indians for his intimacy with the Great Spirit , and by his white friends for his refinement , his knowledm of the arts and sciences , and his skill as a teacher , which is , indeed , little less than miraculous . At the end of the book this wonderful savage proves to be a white man , no less than the laird of M'lntosh , and the father of the heroine . The constancy of the lovers is rewarded in the old way , l ) y marriage . Such is the outline of the XVilderness ,  --  a tale which is beyond admiration ; whether we consider the fertility of the author 's imagination // or the judgement with which he sustains the plot and the characters . The book abounds with incidents ; some ludicrous , some pathetic ; it is sometimes difficult to distinguish which ,  --  so true it is that the sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a melancholy account of the escape of two of the personages from a French fort , through a very filthy common sewer . The reader could scarcely refrain from tears at beholding their dismal plight , were it not that the author humorously compares them to ducks . There is , also , an Indian council , for the purpose of condemning Charles Adderly to the flames . We think no one can read the speeches of the several chiefs without vehement laughter . " Son of presumption V says the prophet to one of them , " Thou who wouldst thwart the wishes of God ; instead of blasting thee on the spot , I am permitted to tell thee what in thy darino wickedness thou hadst the hardihood to ask . Listen to me now , and ask no more . That mau in bonds , whose flesh thou wouldst roast in the fire kindled by thy vengeance , is in the favor and under the protection of the Great Spirit ; and , listen farther , I am commanded by the power who moveth all minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to lay before him the oracles of the Great Father contained in this holy book , which profane hands should never touch-into which profane eyes should never look ,  --  and which none but the favored of 1-leaven can understand . " We apprehend that this appeal to a heathen Chippeway , in behalf of the holy scriptures , is either intended to set some missionary in a ridiculous light , or as a parody on some of poor old Mr. Heckewelder 's Indian speeches . It has , indeed , been hinted to us that it is given as a true specimen of savage eloquence , which supposition can not be adrAitted , as it would render Dr. Milenry , and not his prophet , the object of laughter . It has been said of Shakspeare , that , after he had exhausted old worlds , he imagined new ones . The remark would apply with more propriety to Dr. 1'VI'Henry . None but himself could have imagined such uncouth monsters as roam through his Wilderness . Peter M'Fall , the Ariel of the drama , is a perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand a word he says . Charles Adderly can only be compared to Nick Bottom ; Maria , his mistress , seems to be intended to exemplify the 01 ( 1 adage , that " beauty and virtue come by hard study , but writing and cyphering are the gifts of God . " In no other way can we account for her learning and accomplishments . Tonneleuka is the prime mover of the piece . He is something like Edie Ochiltree , Meg Merrilies , and Prospero , but superior to them all . This Scotchman stains his face with the juice of herbs , and passes for an Indian , among Indians , for twenty years ! He convinces the savages of his supernatural powers , teaches Maria all manner of virtue , snatches captives from the lighted pile , performs miracles ) and talks like a dictionary ( an Ulster dictionary ) on all occasions . rime Wilderness is chiefly valuable for the light it throws upon characters which have become historical . The Imidian chief , the knavish trader , and still more knavish Yankee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear them speak , and we are constrained to acknowledge that they were not such as we could have imagined . Braddock falls and dies like a true English gentleman , surly and brutally uncivil ; Washington appears , not good and great and dignified , as lying orators and huistorians have represented him , but such as , // 493 doubtless , he was , ( for we have great faith in Dr. M'Henry ) weak and silly . Who could imagine that the father of his country ever snuffled like a homesick school-boy at leaving his miraculous mistress ? yet , what is more likely than that he did so ? He was but a man . In how amiable a light he appears in the following passages " I shall eat , since it will gratify you , " he replied , " although ii confess I have no appetite just now . Yet think not , Miss Frazier , that it is because these cakes and that metheglin are disagreeable to my taste that I use them sparingly . Nothe choicest viands of city luxury could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believe me , I do , that the very heart of the wilderness can produce attractions equal , nay , let me say , superior , to any I have yet met with in society . " " Not worthy ! " he exclaimed ; " not worthy of my affections Ah , then , what woman on earth can be worthy of them . Oh , Maria ! I have seen , I have been acquainted with many females ; and if I were to make , in your hearing , the comparison which my fancy has often formed between you and the fairest , the best of them , your modesty would not tolerate it . You would not listen to me-you would command me to be silent . Alas ! to draw the picture which my imagination has formed of your person and your virtues , would excite your incredulity and subject me to the suspicion of insincerity . But with you , with none , will I ever be insincere . Oh ! if you cannot- " Sir , " said she , " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed- " Oh , tantalizing girl ! Another choice , did you say ! No , let Heaven hear me ! I swear that , unless thou dost pereniptorily and finally refuse to be mine , I shall never form another choice ; and even then , sho&amp;ld that ever be , which Heaven forbid , my choice may be the dictate of duty ; but I never shall be impelled to it by that warm , that irresistible feeling of heart and soul , which urges me to sue thee to become the partner of my love , the mistress of my fortune , the fondly cherished wife of my bosom , the dear , the sweet source of all my earthly happiness . 0 Maria ! wilt thou not yield to it ? wilt thou not become mine If this be not the tone of refined society ,  --  if this be not the langu age of love , persuasion and poetry ,  --  if this be not pathos itself , pray , reader , what is it ? Let us see how a little of it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ab , then what earthly she , What lass that handles knife and fork , can worthy of them be ? Believe me , tantalizing girl , that if I were to try To tell you how you do excel , you d answer , " All my eye . " But notwithstanding that and all that mortal man may fear , The truth will out ; I 11 never lie , my dainty dearest dear It is much to be regretted that the Doctor did not put his romances into a metrical form . We can scarcely be expected to pass judgement upon the mere verbal style of the Wilderness , seeing that it is not written in English . We can say , however , and that with a safe conscience , that it fulfils the sole purpose of a novel , which we take to be to amuse . No book , excepting Don Quixote , ever made us laugh half so much . We have read no book that contains so many new and strange expressions . The author seems , as far as regards language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and to have carried some of their practices to their utmost extent . We hazard this remark with some diffidence , knowing that it is not for us to censure so great a man . With this slight qualification , we may say , that he is unrivaled in invention . Talk of the Arabian Nights , indeed ! It never entered into the mind of even an Arabian magician to conceive of such beings as people the Wilderness . The author is also a master of sentiment and the tender pas*mons . His love scenes savor of something more than mere theory .. // No one who has not felt could portray so well . The chapters , which are devoted to this passion , pat us in mind of the very best amatory poetry of the Della Cruscan school . Voltaire preferred the Orlando Furioso to the Odyssey ; Southey admires the Pilgrim 's Progress ; we xviii not affront Dr. M'Henry by comparing the Wilderness to either , though each is great in its kind . We would as soon couple Willis and Bryant in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been induced to dwell thus long on the Wilderness , by the reason which made Mr. Cheever allow Carlos Wilcox so large a space in his Common Place-Book of American Poetry . In plain terms , nobody in these parts knew any thing about Mr. Wilcox , and no one knows any thing of Dr. M'Henry or his works . If our hero should have the same fate as Mr. Cheever 's favorite has had , that is , if his merits should not be discovered , by means of our introduction , it will not be our fault . " The test of poetical popularity , " says a valuable cotemporary review , " is not the number of newspaper puffs a poet may receive in a given number of months , but the number of persons into whose possession his works have made their way . " We take it on us to say , that this is an orthodox canon of criticism for Dr. 1*I'Henry , great as he is as a novelist and a poet , is absolutely unknown to the reading public in New-England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wilderness , from which we have made the above extracts . Of one of his poems , entitled " Waltham , " we have seen but a single copy , and that came to us in the form of wrapping paper . We were obliged to advertise for " The Pleasures of Friendship , " and thereby discovered that Boston contained but a single copy of that invaluable work . We do not believe the Doctor 's eyes were ever , in the whole long course of his literary career , gladdened with the sight of a newspaper puff on any of his own works , unless it were of his own writing . We never saw him mentioned in any newspaper or other periodical . We , therefore , conclude that he can not truly be pronounced " popular . " In reviewing our author as a poet , we will drop the veil of irony and descant upon his merits , or , more properly , his demerits , in the style proper to our vocation . It is a pleasure to demolish a bad author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree of merit , too , or the shaft falls harmless , as it will in the present instance , blunted on the shield of vanity . It is a pleasure , because it is a duty . Perhaps such small , nameless game as our present quarry , might safely be suffered to exist in its obscurity ; but at any rate it does no harm to remove it . We approach any poetic grub with the feeling which induces every good Christian to set foot on a ( rarter-snake . We have never read any book called Poems , of which it was so difficult to say any thing as of the Pleasures of Friendship . Even were poets like other men , accessible to reason , and tolerant of advice , we see not that we could do aught to serve the writer of this work . It seems to be a conglomeration of all the faults incident not only to verse but to prose also . We may safely pronounce the same judgement on Waltham . Saddled with the reputation of these two works , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong ass , stooping between two burthens . We have found // some benefit in the perusal of Waltham . When Anacreon Moore wished to sleep , he thought of Lord Castlereagh . We took his hint , and nightly took up Waltham and our lamp together . No other soporific ever had so speedy an effect . What is poetry ? The vivid expression of feeling or passion is poetry . Sublime and beautiful thoughts , clad in strong and concise language , constitute its essence . The vulgar think , and , judging by his practice , Dr. M'Henry thinks with them , that the mere jingle of rhymes at the end of lines , of equal or unequal length , constitutes poetry . Most American poetry is yet " unwritten ; " it lies in our lakes and streams , and in the depths of the wilderness , ( not Dr. M'Henry 's Wilderness . ) Two thirds of Bryant 's verses , nearly all of Halleck 's , and a great many of Percival 's , are poetry of the highest order . Mere metre is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not poetry ; the trash in the corners of most of our newspapers is not poetry . To give a definition , on a level with the Doctor 's comprehension , poetry is what was never manufactured in his study ; it is the very reverse of Waltham and the Pleasures of Friendship ; it is what his mind 's eye never had a glimpse of . When a man of plain , common sense , reads a book , and retains a vivid recollection of what he has read , it is more than probable that there is poetry in it , whether it be in metre or not . A child will retain some verses of Job or Isaiah at the first reading , but there is not the man alive , who can repeat ten consecutive lines of any of M'Henry 's productions , excepting only their author . There is good reason to complain of the scarcity of American Poetry , and there are good reasons why it should be scarce . There are few among us who can afford the time to write it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the talent . It is not matter of just reproach that our country has not yet produced a Byron or a Milton . It is no reproach to any one that he has no poetical talent whatever , though it seems so to be considered among our literary small fry . We have good seamen , good scholars , good mathematicians , in abundance ; in due time , we shall also have great poets in aoundance . The hour is not yet come , and never will , till our critical periodicals assume a more healthy tone ; till booksellers fear the touch of a manuscript poem like that of a red hot horse-shoe ; till authors like M'Henry look up to the press , as a capitally tried prisoner looks to the bench ; till each editor turns his pen into a whip , and neither fears nor spares to lay it on . Then , when literary reptiles shall be trampled on , with just contempt for their insignificance , will our true poets dare to try the chance of a sale for their works ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciprocal eulogies ; then will Hadad and the Ages lie nearly alone on the counters which were once the high places of Waltham and the Pleasures of Friendship , and which will know the rubbish no longer . Such a press as ours is enough to cramp , if not to crush , the tuneful energies of Apollo himself , and of the Nine to boot . We learn that Marsyas was flayed alive , for presuming to sing when he should have but spoken ; would to heaven that the precedent had been established as a rule in a literary sense , we mean . We think we know who would have been stripped of his red morocco binding . // Yet even the inundation of " fugitive poetry , " " other poems , " and the like trash , with which the twenty-four states are deluged , has not discouraged some hold swimmers in the sea of ink . Few or none adventure successfully south of Long-Island Sound ; what little poetical merit America can boast belongs wholly to the north . Who has not read Bryant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that Sprague and Pierpont have written well ? We have other sparks of genius , which might be fanned into flame , were there as much honest critical talent in the country as would suffice to remove impudent pretenders from the highways . We incline to think that few English bards write better poetry than Holmes ; we are convinced that Whittier has some merit ; and Willis has a musical chord in his brain , which , once in a great while , awakes to harmony . After reading the Pleasures of Friendship , strange as it may seem , quite through , we searched our memory , in vain , for a parallel to its author . He has at least one merit ; he is original , in the excess of his very dullness . We do not think that even his vanity could suggest any resemblance , unless in manifest plagiarisms , between this work and any of the English classics . The author as little resembles any of our own writers , unless it be Willis , some of whose worst pieces might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison farther . We can not pretend to point out the distinguishing charm of the Pleasures of Friendship ; the propriety and vigor of its conceptions are much the same as may be found in the Wilderness ; the same gloriously inimitable confusion of ideas , which is , perhaps , a national characteristic , reigns throughout . The brogue alone is wanting . Those parts which are stolen are infinitely the best . We can not say that the metre is absolutely bad , neither can the reverse be affirmed . A kind of Scotch mistiness of imagination seems to have suggested some of the descriptions . For example , But soon the Tempter bade our bosoms swell With vain desires ; - we ventured and we fell ! In wretched state , how helpless then we lay Beneath Heaven 's wrath , that flamed in fierce array ! Could angels save us ? could repentant tears Arrest th ' unsparing sword that justice bears * Ah ! no-in vain e'en Pity pleads our cause : Can she appease Heaven 's violated laws ? Can seraph tears indemnity provide For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eternal mercy shone ! The Heir of Heaven bath made our cause his own ! Almighty power is offered in our stead , And sin , and death , and hell are captive led ! I-leaven 's boundless love has paid the debt we owe ( 1 , Restored our souls to happiness and God ! Our song shall hence in grateful anthems rise To love Divine , and Friendship in the skies ! This is about as good and poetic a passage as any in the book , if it be not the very best . Passing over the bad rhymes , and heaven 's wrath in array , we would ask , how the love of God , manifested in the great atonement , can be considered one of the pleasures of friendship ? We do not read our Bible so . And this is poetry ! Take off the rhymes , and what remains ? An amplification , a very dull and prosaic amplification , of the simple text , " God so loved the world that he gave his // only begotten son , " &amp;c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a camp-meeting sermon . The following may serve as a specimen of the author 's manner of depicting the passions Oh with what pangs the father of our race Bewailed his own and nature 's dire disgrace ; " My son , ' he cried , " My righteous Abel bleeds , Slain by his sire 's and by his brother 's deeds ! Ah ! this is death ! that death which Heaven hath sworn , For my accurst transgression must be borne ! On me alone should all the vengeance fall But oh ! t will crush my children - crush them all The Doctor seems to have no very clear conception of the nature of friendship . In the twenty-seventh page he confounds it with paternal instinct , giving the joy of Israel , at recovering his son Joseph , as a striking illustration of its pleasures . It makes dull boys learn their lessons , he says , and gives a keener relish for literature . The ransom of Captain Riley by the British consul , an act which we always thought was dictated by common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friendship induced Sir Edward Pellew to bombard Algiers , and GreatBritain to interfere in the slave-trade . In its division into cantos and the arrangement of the paragraphs , the Pleasures of Friendship resembles the Pleasures of Hope . The imitation is as close , throughout , as the Doctor 's powers would admit ; and , in several instances , amounts to actual plagiarism . Whoever shall read the first and last pages of the two works , will admit the truth of this . This resemblance , in our opinion , , constitutes the whole merit of the Pleasures of Friendship ; for , wherever the author loses sight of his model , he loses sight of poetry also . We will give but one extract from Waltham ; more the reader could scarcely endure . But man can not to human cares be cold , And Waltham 's heart was but of human mould . An earthly object round his soul entwined , And greatly shared with heaven his pious mind . T was Ellenore , the apple of his sight , In whom his heart now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move , If e'er a child deserved a parent 's love ; For she was virtuous , dutiful , and hind , All that could please an anxious father 's mind Her smiles had power his troubled mind to calm* Her soft attentions were his bosom 's balm ; And much she loved his sorrows to beguile , With many a soothing art and pleasing wile .. Ceaseless the tender arts she used to cheer A mind , to her so partial and so dear , Dispensing filial benefit like this , She knew was duty and she felt it bliss . Ilence , for her sire , she left without a sigh , The attractive haunts of city luxury ; Amusement , friends , whate'er could charm the mind Of youthful maids , she cheerful left behind ; And deep concealed in solitary shades , Where silent sameness over all pervades , Where those young charms are hidden from the sight , That dawned upon the admiring world so bright She pines not at the change nor dull employ ; They are no sacrifice to her , but joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not selected this passage for its weakness . There are three cantos , or , seventy duodecimo pages , of the like sing-song monotony , of which we can not say that one is better or worse than the rest . After reading the book through , we opened it at random , and quoted the part at which we opened . After this specimen , it is probable , that no one would desire to follow us in a critical examination of Waltham . There are some authors , who , with a thousand glaring faults , have yet some individual merit to rescue them from contempt ; there are some , whose ill-chosen subjects are forgotten , because they are brilliantly adorned ; there are few who have not some peculiarity , which distinguishes them from all others . We can not class Dr. M'Henry with any of these . If , in any part of any of his works , which is not a manifest imitation , there is one sublime , tender , or in any wise striking thought , one harmonious line , we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be said to constitute poetic character in his writings , we know not what it is , though we have diligently perused them . One of his subjects , Friendship , though well chosen , he evidently does not understand ; we may venture to pronounce of the rest , that they never could have attracted popular attention . Of all the faults which have been attributed to all past and present poets , there is but one that may not be found in every page of Dr. M'Henry 's poems . He is not obscure , even to the meanest capacity . All his sentences have one plain meaning , and that meaning is , that he is entitled to be called something that rhymes to pass . We trust that the quotations we have made , few though they be , will bear us out in what we have said . It has been suggested ( we believe by Mr. Dana ) that it is the great fault of modern criticism to compare every work with some preconceived model . If this fault be ours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as yet read no author with whom we can , for a moment , think of comparing him in any respect . If a work should be judged with sole reference to the impressions it leaves , the Doctor is safe from criticism . Each of his lines drags the same slow length along ; the eye glances over each of his pages as it does over a stagnant puddle , the surface of which is unbroken , even by the rising of a mephitic bubble . We turn away from his dreary waste of words , where , to use one of his own hues , a little modified , Stupid sameness over all pervades , with no other feeling than that of excessive weariness . After all , we are breaking but a butterfly on the wheel , and it is time to close . How we have yawned ! We are aware that it is the fashion to decry severe criticism , where its subject is respectable in private life ; but we do not , nevertheless , think it any breach of editorial courtesy to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published a book , with his name in the titlepage , can not be allowed to throw off the responsibility . His works , and his reputation , as far as it is connected with them , have become public property . In this case , we believe that we are giving Dr. M'Henry aid in the object which he has most at heart . He has been endeavoring to obtain notoriety for some years , by the most indecent // exposures . Such is his taste , and he has an undoubted right to enjoy it . If he should construe our well-meant intentions unfavorably , we can only say , that we have much mistaken his character ; for we have always believed that nothing gave him so much pleasure as to see one of the minnows of Helicon impaled alive on the barbed hook of criticism . G.@@183068255.txt Phil . WHAT a beautiful evening ! How calmly and gently the waves ripple against the shore ! What a gorgeous drapery of clouds above , folding around the setting sun ; and the air , how sweet and fragrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us sit down upon the green grass beneath this wide-spreading oak , and suffer the sea breeze to cool us ere we venture to bathe in the river . What a beautiful and romantic stream ! How gracefully it curves around the hill , and loses itself far away , sending to the ear its gentle murmurs . Well do I remember the first time I came to this spot ; when , released with my companions from school , glad and merry as birds that are let loose from their cage , what would not I have given , to have been able to move as easily in the water as upon the verdant lawn ; instead of paddling in the shallows , to have ventured out into the depths , and , by a few sweeps of the arms , to have bounded through the waves , and stood firmly upon the opposite bank . I have ever been a great admirer of swimming , and , if my lot were cast in a warmer climate , I believe I should change soy nature , if possible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in the water . Col. I can not prize swimming so highly as you do . I remember to have heard you often call it a better kind of gymnastics , than that which we have imported from Germany , and which has acquired such deserved popularity within these few years . It is refreshing to bathe in the water such a warm summer eve as this ; but one need not be an expert swimmer to enjoy all the luxury and pleasure of bathing . If you call it an amusement , I shall certainly give the preference to the gentle craft of Old Walton , and Joe Manton . I am myself not an expert swimmer , but can keep my head above water , and that is more than all our friends can say in our time . Phil . I would not undervalue your involutions , your evolutions , your skips and your jumps on land . I do not often practice them , but my admiration is no less on that account . Though an arm or a leg may run the chance of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robust and healthy looks of the young gymnasts . There is exercise enough in the water , and the faculty allo*v , the pure element is as healthy and refreshing to the outward as to the inward man . But it is for a far different reason that I would have thee a skillful swimmer . Think , but a moment , of the thousands , young , middle-aged , and old , that are yearly cut off by drowning , in the summer months in our country ! In nine out of ten cases , their deaths are to be attributed to ignorance of swimming ; I say nothing of the pleasure one enjoys in breasting the waves and feeling at home in the water . Do you remember what Franklin says of swimming ? How the philosopher describes the pleasure he took , when , one afternoon , in his young days , he swam a mile across a lake upon his back , holding in his hand the string of Isis kite-not the one with wlsich he disarmed the clouds of tlseir terrors ; he describes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion , that he might sail in the same maniser from Dover to Calais . Col. Yes ! but I agree with him when he adds that a packet-boat is preferable . Phil . As to speed , it doubtless would be . But , if pleasure be the object , 1 tlsink we may say Ben would prefer his own way of sailing . Far be it from me to undervalue what you call the gentle craft of fishing and sporting , though I confess they seem to be the most ungentle employments to which our young men are riven . I admire the rich descriptions of scenery , and the sweet poetical musings and contemplations of old Isaac Waltoms 's pages , and the pleasant blending of poetry and philosophy in Sir Humphrey Davy ; and I could wander all day at the heels of the sportsman , over hills and plains , cragged rocks and romantic valleys , on the margin of streams and the green banks of brooks and rivulets ; but the poetry , feeling , and enjoyment of all these , are deadened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native element , or the robin and wild dock bleeding upon the ground with their broken wings . The one , no longer able to flap his pinions on the free and liftisig breeze , and the other , prevented from bearing his stately form gracefully down the stream , or leaning his glossy wings upon the air , and flying away to his woodland home . I would , Colymban , that fewer were given to these pursuits , and more to the healthy and useful art of swiniming . Col. Nay , if you call it an art , I shall , indeed , think you an enthusiast in earnest . If you rank mere paddling in the water , among the arts and sciences , // we shall next have you boasting of some feat in the water , that will put Byron and Leander to shame . Phil . An art it certainly is , and as such , has long been acknowledged . I do not claim such a dignity for mere paddling in the water . Our common mode of swimming is quite a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before said , you may paddle about in the water , and enjoy all the luxury of bathing , without being an expert swimmer . indeed , you may enjoy your cold or your warm bath at home ; but to be a swimmer is another thing . It is as much an art as reading or writing , or playing upon a musical instrument , and , as such , it will one day , I trust , be considered in America , the land of noble streams and rivers . Do not suppose , Colymbao , that , because it is not so considered now in this country , it never was any where , or at any time , taught as an art . It is a thing to be learned , and to teach it properly requires as much skill as was required of old to he a good wrestler , or to bear away the palm at the Olympic Games . Indeed , the old Greeks and Romnans viewed this matter better than we do , and we might even take lessons in swimming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was deemed among the Romans an important branch of the education of their youths . To show the ignorance of one , they would say of him-. *mcquc literas smeque netare didicit . It was esteemed a great accomplishment , and masters were employed to teach the art of swimming , as well as the art of speaking , or addressing a public assembly . Where would old Menoetes have been , think you , if he had not been an excellent swimmer , when Gyas threw him overboard , and Teucri riserunt , as Virgil expresses it , when he swam to the rock , and sat sunnincr himself there ? Would Leander have ventured to cross the Hellespont on a stormy night , if he had not had great confidence in his skill in swimming ? Cot . Would old Palinurus have reached the shore of Italy , if he had not pulled the rudder overboard with him ? He might , for aught I know , have been a good swimmer , but it shows no confidence in his knowledge of swimming , to take the rudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philonno , I willingly own that swimming was an important and essential part of education among the Greeks and Humans , and , perhaps , considering that , from their commerce with their neighbors. , they were obliged to be often on the water , it was deservedly so ; but why , I would ask , if swimming is so important as you deem it , is it not taught as an art in this country , and why does it not form a part in the education of our young , in a country where so much is done to render our young men accomplished . But I fear it will he too late to introduce it , unless it is done soon , for our rail-roads threaten to destroy traveling on water . P/mit . I fear you have put sue one of those questions , that are more easily asked than answered . Our people are doing every thing to train up our young men , and snake them accomplished ; but yet , how few are there , who , if they were shipwrecked , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on fire , would be able to save their lives by swimming , or to help a fellow-passenger ? When we consider for a moment , that our country is intersected by rivers , in every direction ; that our people are traveling by water every season , in thousands , from one end of the Union to the other ; that we have intercourse with every nation on the globe ; that our harbors are crowded with merchant ships , and our lakes and ponds covered with pleasure boats , and reflect how many lives are lost daily on the water , we can not doubt , for a moment , that it would be a national advantage , if there wer swimming schools in every seaport , and every town in America , tlsat has a river. * How many lives would he saved How few would then mourn thse loss of relations , drowned far from their firesides . It would not only be the means of saving the lives of tisose , who are exposed to " accidents by flood , " but it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak and sickly , by inducing them to venture into the water ; it would drive away the humors and small diseases that undermine , by degrees , the constitution , and brin* on those more serious disorders , that are beyond tise cure of warm or cold baths . The more I think of our country , the attention that is paid to education , the risks to which we are exposed by sea from inexperience in swimming , the more I am imnpressed xvithm the importance and usefulness of this art , as a part of education . But , as you say , my dear Colymbao , we have no practical treatises The author makes pleasure in refering mu an example , misam has been scm in Bosmoms by a dismingui shed foreigner . ASS who have been Siis pupils , will bear witmiess to the mmmli of wham is urged in this armicle .

I know of but one , and that has never been translated into English , though the Germans have translated it , and , I believe , have practised upon it very successfully . It was written a few years since , by Bernardi , an Italian , who was appointed Professor of the Art of Swimming , in the Royal Naval Academy at Naples . Cot . Professor of Swimming ! that sounds very odd to my ears ! But as we have Professors of Dancing , I suppose we may have Professors to teach us pirouettes in the water , as well as in the ball-room . We have Professors of Gymnastics , and , I suppose , by the same token , we must have Professors to teach us to cut antics and turn summersets in the water . Pray , do these landsharks take lessons from the Sea-Serpent ? Why not teach our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river into a spacious ball-room ? But , I suppose , although you are for making our lads mermen , it does not enter into your plan to make our girls mermaids ; I confess I envy the Professor some of his capers in the waters under the mild and soft sky of Italy . But , if swimming is an art , as you claim it to be , how is it that our boys learn it so easily ; surely they are self-taught ; they are their own masters in water , as they would be on land . Phil . I do not deny that swimming , as practised by our people , has saved many lives ; I wish every man , woman and child in the country , could swim in this way from New-England to Liverpool ; but as there are so few who can swim at all , compared to the whole population , and , as the mode now practised requires great time , and can not be followed without great labor and fatigue , I would have them learn it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good swimmers in a short time , but may enjoy it with ease , and without weariness and fatigue ; that they may swim miles instead of rods , and tow the hull of a wrecked vessel five leagues to the strand , lying on their backs all the while , if you please . Such feats as these , or something resembling them , never enter into the imaginations of our best swimmers , if they deserve the name , and yet they are performed daily in the Swimming Schools of Europe . Any clown may spring upon the back of a horse , and , by holding fast to the mane , possibly save himself from being thrown ; but the poor fellow , at the end of his journey , will drop down from very weariness , and the looseness of his bones . But see how easily and gracefully he rides , who has been under the eye of a skillful master ; how thorou ghly he understands all the mysteries of horsemanship ; how much farther he wi11 ride , and with how much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swimmer , who is under the instruction of a master , and he who is his own tutor . In a word , Colymbao , it is necessary that we should swim naturally . Cot . I doubt whether any , but Long Tom Coffins , or such water animals , could tow a brig ashore . But , you say , I must swim naturally . It would seem to follow then that savages are the best swimmers in the world . But , perhaps , I do not understand what you mean by natural swimming  --  a young gosling goes into the water , with the shell on its head , and swims off , before it can stand straight on land that , I suppose is one kind of natural swimming . But how a reasonable being can be said to swim naturally , who has no fins , and is not amphibious , I am puzzled to tell . Phil . I am no professor myself ; and , if I were , it would be impossible for me to teach you unless we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some of the most simple principles that ought to guide a young swimmer , and , when we are thoroughly cool , we will go into this river , and if you are not too strongly prejudiced in favor of your common niode of swimming , I will give you a lesson or two . Of course , you are not like the old wag , who swore he would never go into the water , till he knew how to swim , to suppose that I can teach you here on this green grass . Cot . Oh ! no ! though I have no great inclination to move from this delightful seat , I will accompany you . But , if your system should require much labor and exertion , I think , in case I should ever suffer shipwreck , if I could not succeed in saving myself , by my own way of swimming , rather than kill myself ; by following yours , I should , like another wag , make a dive for the anchor , to save myself . Phil . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would teach you requires comparatively none at all . Its great object is to teach you to move with perfect ease in the water . But I must recall to your snind , if you would understand the subject perfectly , what I suppose your aversion to natural philosophy and hydrostatics has suffered to escape from it-viz . Colymbao , that the human body is considerably lighter than the same bulk of water , or than the quantity of // water displaced by it , when immersed . Franklin , indeed , says that the head and arms themselves , are heavier than their hulk of water , but , that the whole body , with all its parts , is considerably lighter . Some old writers have expressed doubts of this , but it has been proved by repeated experiments and will not be doubted at the present day . This is the first and most important principle , and it should be well known and credited , by every one who would be a good swimmer . Col. Well , proceed have as little as possible to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its importance ; but if you can contrive to give it some other name than a principle of natural philosophy , I should like it as well . There is a good deal in names , and philosophy is one of the worst and most unmeaning I know of . I fear if you talk of hydrostatics , you will make swimming a very dry subject . Phil . I know very well , that , as the saying is , Philosophy is not so delicious a subject , as to set your mouth watering for it . However , I have not much to say of Philosophy ; so be easy on that matter . Now , if one is convinced that the human body is of less specific gravity , than the same bulk of water , or in other words , if he has full confidence in the fact , that the human body naturally floats , he will he devoid of the fear and alarm that prevent learners from venturing more than knee-high in the water , lest they should sink . Col. But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can not swim , so often drowned , when they fall suddenly into the water ; or , indeed , why need one have any fear whatever , if he can throw himself on the water , and float about without sinking ? Indeed , I see no need of learning to swim at all , if what you say is true . Phil . If you could place yourself upon your back , in the water , and keep your head above , and , at the same time be in no alarm , Colymbao , you would float like a log . The reason that a person drowns so som , when he falls from a wharf , is , that he is in great dread all the while ; and owing to that circumstance , he can not manage so as to keep his respiratory organs above water . He sinks , of course , into the water , a distance in proportion to the impetus his body receives , and , when he rises to the surface , by an improper motion of his bands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head out of water . This , and the continued fear he is in , prevent his floating and saving himself . And this leads me to speak of what I mean by swimming naturally-namely , that the position of the body in the water should conform , as nearly as possible , with its position on land , and that their motions should nearly correspond in both situations . Do you aim at this when you attempt to swim ? By no means . Our swimmers lie almost horizontally on the water , and use their arms in a manner which they think will advance them most speedily . They throw them about in every direction ; but they should place their bodies as upright as possible in the water . Great importance is attached to this posture by Bernardi , and the best swimmers in Europe . An expert swimmer would tell you , that you might as well lie flat on the earths , throwing your arms and legs about , in order to travel fast , as to think of making an easy progress in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnatural and laborious , though they are able to make some progress ; but the best swimmers among you will always use the upright posture , if you do but observe them . Savages , as I was telling you just now , might set common swimmers an example in this art , and it certainly is one , in which they are as far before civilized people , as they are behind them in other respects . You have read the accounts of Cook , and other navigators , and must have been amused if not instructed by their descriptions of the manner in which the natives approached their ships in the water . They swim as if they lived in the water , and were truly amphibious . They approach the boat with their necks and heads out of the water as turtles come up to the surface sideways . If they are threatened , they dive out of sight ma twinkling , under the boats , and come up again , a few rods or half amile distant . They are perfectly at home in their favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , and struggle in every direction with their limbs , but move as easily and gracefully along the water , as the stately swan skims over the bosom of a lake . Col. I allow the truth of what you have said . Are there any other advantages which the upright posture has over the horizontal one ? Phil . The principal advantages which it has , are these-its conformity to the accustomed movements of the limbs  --  the freedom which it gives to the armsthe facility of breathing , and removing any obstacle in the way . There is also less danger to be apprehended from a person behind , who frequently obstructs your progress , and occasions fright , stealing suddenly your presence of miiid , and // Swrnming. giving you fear in its stead-an exchange that has proved fetal to the besL swimmers . Cot . But , surely , one can not advance so rapidly in this way . Phil . Perhaps not quite so rapidly . But he is overpaid by other advantages . lie can continue his course a hundred times longer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this way , he is enabled to husband his strength , a thing of the first importance to a swimmer , who has a long journey to make . He can proceed to his journey 's end , without fatigue and exhaustion . Our swimmers , when they first begin to dabble in the water , suppose that their life depends upon the continual exercise of their arms and legs , upon their unceasingly throwing them to and fro , and will tumble about a year or two in the shallows , before they venture into deep water . Hence , very naturally arises an apprehension , that they are entirely at the mercy of their own efforts , and this occasions that want of confidence that is so essential to the success of a swimmer . Many persons are discouraged from attempting to learn , by this timidity and apprehension . They flounder about a year or two , half dead with the untiring motions of their limbs , and give up , in despair , of learning to swim . This always will be the case . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing ; but it is the only way , unless they have a greater share of courage and confidence than most young persons with whom I have chanced to be acquainted . A few lessons by a professed swimmer , would do more good than ten years spent in this way . Cot . I begin to be of your opinion ; but how is it with other animals ; if what you say is correct , the monkey , which so nearly resembles man in his formation , should swim better than the dog , which is not the case . Travelers tell us that , when a monkey of Borneo or Sumatra chances to get into the water , he drowns immediately . He is perfectly nonplussed  --  and any dog will save him . How is it that a dog , a cat , or other animal , swims so much better than this homunculus , as a certain author denominates him ? Phil . You speak like a philosopher ! When a dog is thrown for the first time into the water , he rises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , and he is , moreover , a capital swimmer , and has saved more lives in the water , than men have done . Though man and animals , like the dog , seem equally capable of floating , the latter have the superiority ; because , by their length of neck , and the size of their heads , they are better able to keep themselves above water , and attain an erect position , and to make all their motions in the water correspond to those on land . How different with man ! his centre of gravity inclines him to a prostrate position , and , of course , he can not so easily keep his head above water , and give free exercise to his respiratory organs . The ape , as you observe , has precisely the same formation with man , and his body is as well adapted to floating . But he is devoid of reason and a prey to fear , and can not so manage as to keep his head above water . He sinks as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations have worshiped him as a god , and yet how helpless in danger , how deficient in reason ! How he dwindles when we think of Hamlets soliloquy on man ; so noble in reason , in comprehension so like a god ! what singular sagacity in the dog , ever true to his master , on laud and water ! surely in the water he is worth a thousand times more than his weight in gold , which is assigned as his precise value on land . It would require a sinking fund infinitely larger than that of Great-Britain , to pay up the debt of gratitude the drowning man owes the noble animal . But it seems to me , Philonao , that it requires great skill , patience , and care , both in professor and pupil , to advance in the water with perfect ease . Phil . If you can bridle your wit , I will discourse further without being tedious . Of all the systems I am acquainted with , and I have known several , I think Bernardi 's by far the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has many advantages over others , which it would take me a long while to particularize . I will , however , briefly tell you some of its merits . He begins by teaching his pupil to float in an upright posture , and to have full confidence in the buoyancy of his body . He leads him into the water , where he can not by a few feet touch the hottom ; the pupil extends his arms under the water , his head and part of his neck being above , and , in this erect position , the teacher supports him by placing his hand under his arm , removing it now and then , and restoring it so as never to suffer his head to sink . In this early stage , the unsteadiness of the body is the chief obstacle to be overcome . Against this , we are disposed , by our habits on land , to trust to the heel as a fulcrum ; but in the water the head is Ihe chief regulator of our movements , for the heel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil is , therefore , to endeavor to restore any disturbance of a just equilibrium by moving the head in an opposite direction . This first lesson being familiarized by practice , he is taught the use of his legs for the purpose of balancing his body , the one being extended forward , the other behind , and the arms laterally . He will thus find himself steadily sustained , and in no need of further assistance in floating . When these first steps have been acquired , he is taught the sweeping semicircular motion of the arms . This is taught slowly , without any motion forward , until attained with precision ; after which , a slight inclination of the body , from its erect position , occasions its advancing . The motion of striking with the leg is added in the same cautious and measured manner , so that the pupil is not perplexed with the acquisition of more than one at a time . In this manner , thus briefly developed , which is at once natural , simple and beautiful , the Italian professor teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pupils have done feats that might be compared to Byron 's , Ekenhead 's , or Leander 's . I was taught , as you know , by a pupil of Bernardi 's , who was afterwards made professor in one of the Italian academies , and who out-did his maser . The eleventh , I entered the bay of Naples under his tuition , in company with a number of young Neapolitans ; we swam far out into the bay , and made a circuit , before our return , of six miles . Col. I wish I had been with you ; I should have enjoyed such an excursion exceedingly . I always thought it very difficult to swim far on the back , and could never do it to my comfort , notwithstanding Franklin describes himself as taking great pleasure in swimming in that manner with his kite . I prefer a good mattress for my back in summer , and in winter I am content with diving and tossing myself in a sea of down . Phil . Oh ! nothing is easier or more delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially as a swimmer will often find it convenient and necessary , if he would go far and husband his strength , to vary his position in the water . It is in every respect a most important attainment , and should be resorted to in all emergencies . If you are seized with the cramp , you may lie on your back with as much ease as in your sea of down . You have only to jerk out the affected limb into the air , taking care , however , not to elevate it too high , so as to disturb the equilibrium of the body ; you will thus soon find its natural powers restored . To advance in this position , the swimmer must push with the flat of his feet , without regarding an occasional dip of the head . He must not attempt to prevent this , by dropping a leg , which would immediately occasion the body to sink . The arms may likewise be used in swimming on the back , in which case they act like oars , the legs being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer onward . In this way you may lie on your back , and glide gently down the current , or into a sweet slumber ; that is , if you can keep your mouth shut . Col. Or into a shark 's mouth ; have you any new method of diving , Philonao ? Phil . Our swimmers , in general , dive very well , and I might say very scientifically , if you approve of a word that smacks a little of philosophy . The resistance offered by the surface of the water when violently struck by a flat object-stay , Colymbao , do n't shake your head , but pick up this small crumb of philosophy , though it falls not from a rich man 's table-is little inferior to that of a solid body , as you may see by striking it forcibly with the palm of your hand . In springing , therefore , from a height into the water , great precaution is necessary , not only that the depth of the water shall be sufficient to prevent the possibility of striking the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to avoid any awkward percussion from the water itself . In order , therefore , to cleave the water without injury to the body , the limbs must be kept firmly together ; the head being protected by the hands clasped over it , so as to present a sharp , swallow-shaped edge , entering the water like an arrow ; the feet come last and must be kept close . By taking a diagonal direction in the spring , the risk is considerably diminished , as the resistance is more progressively overcome , and the hands and feet are in a better position for giving assistance . The eyes should always be kept open under water , as there is no danger resulting from doing so , and the complete power is acquired of discerning any thing in the water , and , of course avoiding rocks and other obstructions . For the purpose of diving , we possess , to a certain degree , the power of contracting the body , by drawing it together , while its weight remains unaltered . There is no power which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining uninjured under the water . On the shores of the Mediterranean , the natives practise div // Swimming . ing with wonderful success in shell-fishing and gathering bits of oakum in the harbors ; indeed , they not unfrequently turn the acquirement to the purposes of thieving , by picking out the oakum from the bottoms of ships , from which practice very unexpected and serious accidents to vessels have occurred . requiring aid ? Phil . As to the length of time during which a person may be able to float , or the distance he may be able to swim , so many circumstances have influence that nothing very precise can be said on the subject . In general , a good swimmer ought to make about three miles an hour , which is as fast as a good traveler will go on land . As thirst and nourishment are less severely felt in the water than on land , by reason , probably , of the liquid imbibed by the pores of the body immersed in it , a good day 's journey may be achieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the swimmer familiar with the various ways in which it may be recruited . With the use of these advantages people have been known to accomplish the extraordinary distance of thirty miles ; and it is even recorded of the famous Neapolitan diver-generally called II Pesce , or The Fishthat , upon one occasion , he actually performed the incredible distance of fifty miles on the coast of Calabria . Col. I confess , that I admire the system of which you have been discoursing . It certainly is an art , and a very important one , and in the knowledge of which we are sadly deficient , and in the rear of the Europeans . It seems somewhat remarkable , at first thought , that civilized nations should be behind the uncivilized in this respect ,  --  but it is a fact , which all history and observation confirm . It is probably to be attributed to this circumstance , that we have a thousand artificial wants to supply , which engross all our attention , hiding from our thoughts whatever is simple or approximating to the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has none of these ; he scours the woods , and the rivers , and to them he owes his means of support . He would laugh at a cool or hot bath ; but seeks his old , familiar stream to bathe his noble limbs . The dangers to which he is exposed on the water ,  --  the wreck of his frail bark ,  --  the frequent necessity of escaping by swimming from the vengeance of a hostile tribe ,  --  and a certain instinct that directs him in the free and natural use of his limbs in the water ,  --  all these give him a superiority over his civilized brother , which long practice can but seldom attain . But , in other respects , how inferior is he , in every thing that makes man a good member of society , and in all the blessings which they enjoy on whom the light of civilization has dawned . The present mode of swimming is certainly objectionable ; it requires a great time to learn it , and when it is attained it is iaborious and fatiguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , we should consider whether the art may not be taught so as to produce infinitely greater good . If we had schools in our country , we might , in a short time , become a nation of swimmers , and our young men be more robust , healthy and vigorous . Phil . Thou sayest true , good Colymbao ! I would fain have thee , if thou art not already one , a lover of the pleasant and delightful art of swimming . It is a healthful exercise for thy limbs , and will make many a weary hour of thy life sweet and calm . Art thou an admirer and a follower of shooting and fishing , thou wilt find swimming often a precious help to thee . Thy skiff may be endangered on the bosom of the fickle stream , when thou dost dangle thy reed for the pike or aim thy gun at wild duck , swinging on the waves ; and if thou hast a long way to go to reach the shore , thou wilt find it needful for thee to husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but take thine ease upon the water . Art thou a traveler , whose curiosity leads him to trace to their rise , the magnificent rivers of his land , thou wilt see times when thou wouldst give the whole broad expanse of water , for a foot of solid land ; thou wilt then find it pleasant to bear thyself freely over the mountain wave , or save thy drowning fellow-passenger . Art thou an invalid ? I would have thee repose thy limbs on the cool wave , and take thy course , at thy pleasure , up the winding stream . Thy sleep at night will be sweet , and thou wilt " lie down to pleasant dreams . " Hast thou the spirit of love for all mankind in thy bosom ? thou wilt too often have occasion to exercise thy benevolent and philanthropic feelings ; next to thy being a good Christian and a good member of society , I would have thee , Colymbao , a good swimmer . words and thy sentiments , which are the mirror of my own . Now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and swim to the opposite bank.
