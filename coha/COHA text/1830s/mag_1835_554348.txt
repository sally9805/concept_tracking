txt OUR readers , we doubt not , will join with us in giving a hearty welcome to the gentle lover of nature , who returns , after an absence of four years , ready to redeem the promise which was given in his former volumes . We have heard of him at times from the icy regions of Labrador , and the burning sands of Florida , countries sufficiently distant from each other in reality , but standing side by side in the history of his unwearied adventure . Wherever he goes , the good wishes of many go with him ; and though he may not hear the cheering of their voices , it may be a gratification to him to be assured , on our critical authority , that there are intelligent persons , not a few , who feel a deep interest in all his enterprises , and rejoice in his success . The measure of success which has thus far attended him , is certainly enough to encourage him . His fame , as an enthusiastic , penetrating and scientific observer , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is better than respect , and that is the sympathy and regard of his readers ; whatever his success in other points may be , this consciousness , which he can not but have , of the affectionate interest which follows him , will make other rewards , should he gain them , doubly welcome , and console him under reverses , should they chance to come . What the circulation of his work may be , - an earthly consideration , it is true , but one which can not be disregarded in this world of dollars and cents , - we do not profess to know . We are glad , however , to hear him say , that his own country is now affording him a support equal to that of Europe . It was not so in the beginning ; and had he not received encouragement abroad , his great enterprise might have been delayed for years . That encouragement was freely given , and he has , as he ought , fleely and warmly acknowledged it . But far from regretting this circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that of Samaritan benevolence , makes of no account the boundaries which separate nations , and regards the honor of all such enterprises as helonging , not to a particular region , but to the whole intellectual world . Where property is so equally divided as it is in our country , there are not many who are able to buy such expensive volumes ; prob // ably there are more now , who can afford this expense , than there were twenty years ago , who were able to answer the humbler claims of Wilson ; but in that day as well as this , those who had wealth in their possession , were men who had earned it by their own exertions ; and who , in the course of their exertion , had slender means and chances for forming such tastes , as would enable them to estimate and take an interest in undertakings , which were not recommended by a utility more obvious to common eyes . When Wilson* s name is mentioned , we are at once reminded of his hardships and discouragements ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to have the path broken before him , and made comparatively easy to his feet . But things are not always as they appear to common observers . Audubon has had his discouragements to contend with , as many and as serious perhaps as those of Wilson , though not so easily understood . The resistance of outward circumstances , is a difficulty which all such men are prepared to meet ; they expect to find obstacles thrown in their way by the indifference of others ; they know , that it is not reasonable to expect to find such tastes already existing , but that it must be part of their labor to form them ; and as for money , they are well aware , that if such resources abounded , the kind of self-created necessity which drives men to exertion , would in all probability be wanting . Human hearts must be more open than they are now to human eyes , before one man can undertake to pronounce upon the happiness , or even the good fortune of another ; and in the case of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow not from things that are seen , but from fountains within the breast . If Audubon is to be regarded as a more fortunate man than Wilson , it is because his disposition is more cheerful and social , and such as enters with readier sympathy into the cares of those about him ; for though Wilson was one of the most generous of men , he was reserved in manner , and slow to express his feelings , except to an intimate few . But , after all , we believe that the greatest happiness of the determined naturalist , is to be found in his surrender of soul , his deep devotion to his favorite pursuit . And here they were equal ; both successfully explored the forests , mountains and shores of America ; both snatched the fearful joy of wandering beyond the limits of civilization , with no other companion than their dog and gun ; both saw their fires // lighting up woods , and shining in waters , which never before felt the presence of cultivated man , where the rose-breast sung them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matin strains ; if Audubon gained any thing in point of facility , by striking later upon the march , it was made up to Wilson , by the glory of moving in the van . There is , however , one point in which Audubon has been signally favored ; and that is , the improvement in modern art , which has enabled the engraver to give so faithful copies of his own fine drawings from nature . It is true , there is a freedom and life in his own coloring , which the print can never possess ; but compare him with Wilson , striving to make himself an engraver for the sake of accomplishing his design , and ahle to publish his work , only on condition of coloring the plates himself ; here he was made to feel his own helplessness : but the result was , that the illustrations are the least important part of his work ; he was compelled , not unfortunately for his own fame , to color in words , and no one ever managed them with more freedom , boldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own lifelike descriptions , we believe he will join with us in saying that this is a point in which Wilson can not be exceeded . We justnowremarked , that Audubon had met with discouragements : but is it possible to stand in an enviable position , and not to be envied ? Truly , this world must be very much altered , before such an unheard-of exemption can be enjoyed by any distinguished man . And to be the absolute sovereign of this department of nature ; to know that one 's works are admired in both worlds , and to feel that these works are the result , not merely of genius or happy discovery , but of honorable and weary labors ; to see hoary heads nod their approbation , and bright eyes kindle , as this new revelation of the treasures of nature is spread before them , and more than all , to feel that one has extended the boundaries of things known , would be enough to sustain the spirit , under greater hardships than are often encountered . If we were inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destiny of a naturalist , whose heart is in love with nature , and who has leisure to give to his favorite pursuit , the engrossing attention which it requires . But there are some things which are more trying than depressing circumstances , and , to have one 's veracity called in question is assuredly one of them . It seems that Audubon // had long suspected that birds , which , like the Black Vulture , feed on carrion , were guided to their banquet by the sense of sight and not of smell ; in fact , that the latter sense was wanting or imperfect , - a defect which , considering the diet of such creatures , would be rather a blessing than a privation . Professor Jameson remarks , that he had suspected the same thing , from the accounts of birds in India , which move directly to their prey , though the wind bears the fragrance in an opposite direction from that in which they happen to be . When Audubon observed this , he immediately began a course of experiments , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses were reduced in number by at least one , but which established to his own satisfaction the fact , that the sense of sight was the means , by which these birds are assembled in such numbers wherever their table is spread . Upon this disclosure , which was first published in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal , a warfare began between the eyes and the nose , similar to that which Cowper has recorded . The advocates of the nose accused Audubon of want of veracity in pleading the cause of the eyes . The charge was singularly absurd ; since , had it been made clear that the nose was entitled to its former honors , what would it prove ? Simply that he had been mistaken , and that some other observers were more correct than he . If a man build theories upon facts , then indeed , if his fabric be overthrown , his intellectual reputation is endangered ; but if he merely aim at establishing facts , it is no dishonor to his mind , even if he should not succeed ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one way or the other . But the question , such as it is , has been completely set at rest , by a series of experiments , conducted by some friends of Mr. Audubon. it was fully established , that the Vultures do not depend upon the sense of smell , which might destroy their appetite , while it leads them where they might indulge it . It was also made evident , that , contrary to vulgar prejudice , the Vulture 's eye , sharp as it is , when once extinguished , can not be restored ; and in opposition to those who considered these birds epicures , it was shown , that it was matter of perfect indifference to them whether their meal was fresh , or in the early or latter stages of decay . We commend the zeal of these friends to science ; it certainly was not for their own gratification , that they entered on such a course of experiments ; but they thought and cor // reetly , that it was not beneath the dignity of scientific investigation , to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend any good man 's reputation , however unworthily assailed . We would not intimate , in what we have said , that Mr. Audubon betrays much solicitude to vindicate himself from this and similar charges . It is impossible to exhibit better taste than he has , in relation to such matters . He is profuse in his acknowledgments for acts of kindness and services , both great and small ; but he says very little of the charges brought against him , knowing that his reputation is able to sustain itself , and that the public have , in general , but little interest in that kind of discussion . To that sagacious tribunal the longest and most laborious defences are apt to convey the impression of something which is not easily defended . Every man of conscious integrity , who repels charges in few words , and leaves it to time to do him justice , finds that time is not wanting to its trust ; it is perpetually rendering this service to the injured , - both to the living and to the dead . But where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Biography was given to the world ? He is as rapid in his motions as one of his own birds of passage ; and he thinks so little of distance , that it is not always easy to trace the direction of his flight . After that publication in 1831 , he came to this country , amply provided with letters to the British colonial authorities , from English noblemen and ministers . We are happy to find , too , that our own government stood ready to do its part . He received flattering attentions and offers of assistance from our civil and military officers , which were of essential service to him in his later expeditions . While at Washington , he was very much impressed with the error of Wilson , in writing to the president of his day , instead of presenting the living letter , by going himself to Washington . The letter sent by him never reached its destination ; and , if it had , might have been thrown aside , together with those innumerable applications for appointments , with which the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wilson but for a few minutes , he would have singled him out from the herd of adventurers , and there can not be a doubt that he would have aided him to the utmost of his power . Mr. Audubon is not in the habit of losing time which he can employ to advantage . Shortly after his return from Europe , // he proceeded to St. Augustine , in East Florida . He pursued his researches there as zealously as the winter would permit , but not with very encouraging success , when the schooner Spark came to St. Augustine , on her way to St. John 's river . In consequence of letters from Washington , he and his assistants were received on board . No sooner had they entered the mouth of the stream , than his eyes were regaled with the objects which he most wished to see . The guns , fired at day-break to call the pilot from the shore , started thousands of snowy pelicans from their resting grounds , and sent them in graceful circles through the air . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound as a signal for beginning the labors of the day . The lovers of fine scenery would not find much to admire on the banks of this river , nor in any part of Florida . But it affords a good field for the naturalist , and this probably is the reason why everything should have seemed so rose-colored to Bartram ; he thought the country worthy of its name , and so , botanically speaking , perhaps it is ; but later travellers have found no paradise amidst its rocks and sands . The climate , which Volney pronounced the finest in the world , must , at times , be somewhat oppressive ; since so early as the middle of February , Mr. Audubon found the mercury at 750 on the water , and 9O* on the shore , and this in the evening of the day . There is something charming in the description of this winter evening . The fog hung so heavily on the stream , that the eye could not discern either shore , though it was not a mile wide . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes extinguished the candles in the cabin with heaps of martyrs ; and that none of the senses might lose their share of delight , the zephyrs came heavyladen with the odors from a slaughter-house on the shore . Let those who mourn over the severity of a northern winter , when the mercury seems sinking to the earth 's centre , think of this description , and be comforted . The inconveniences of this earthly ball are more equally balanced than discontented man believes . After several attempts to draw the portrait of an alligator , who was not inclined to sit , Mr. Audubon left the vessel to continue its voyage up the river , and returned to St. Augustine . His return gives a lively idea of the country . Leaving one of his attendants to take care of his baggage , he set off // on foot with the other . They had eighteen miles to go , and the sun was but two hours high . The country was level as a floor ; the path was distinctly marked , having been trodden by the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of quenching their thirst , and magnolias and other flowering shrubs varied the uniformity of the woods . But meantime , the sun went down in a cloud , the wind began to 1 ) owl dismally through the tall pines , and a black mass of vapor , lifted from the east , spread itself over the whole heavens . The dog was for a long time their only guide in the darkness ; heavy drops began to fall , and he at last became doubtful , and refused to proceed . The wind soon increased to a gale , - the lightning streamed through the heaven , occasionally setting fire to a pine , Which shone magnificently bright in the darkness , - and the water rose so high on the level ground , as almost to cover their feet . While in this perplexity , they at length discovered the light of the beacon at St. Augustine , and were guided by it to their lodgings , where they arrived drenched with rain , steaming with perspiration , and covered to the knees with mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the way . Every one who has been bewildered in the woods , knows that the feeling is one which entirely destroys the moral and physical strength ; the lost one is helpless as the dreamer in troubled sleep ; " to stop too fearful , and too faint to go , " he feels as if a resistless destiny was forcing him , almost with a visible grasp , to his doom . Mr. Audubon gives us an account of a " live-oaker , " - the name of the men who are employed in cutting that valuable timber . Leaving his cabin one morning , in a fog , to proceed to the place of his labor , he found , when the fog cleared away , that all the objects about him were strange to his eyes . He retraced his steps , but in vain ; the night found him in the unsounded depth of the woods . After a cold , dull , moonless night , he spent the next day in vain attempts to recover the path . The next night found him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , except that he was able to destroy a turtle with his axe , and with savage desperation to eat the warm flesh , and drink the blood of his victim . In this manner , forty miserable days were passed , and he lay down on the banks of a river to die , when he was discovered by the crew of a boat , and restored to his home . He was // then at the distance of thirty-eight miles from his cabin , and had probably travelled more than ten times that distance , wandering in circles in the woods . Toward the close of April , the season became more propitious to Mr. Audubon 's enterprise . He then proceeded to Sandy-island , the southernmost cape of Florida , a great resort of birds . As they were on the way , the pilot conducted the boat into a thick shrubbery of mangroves , where they shot a multitude of pelicans . They shortly after saw hundreds of cormorants ' nests , directly over their heads . When the party fired , nearly all the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sportsmen were marvelling at the unexampled effect of their shot ; hut the mystery was solved , when they saw the birds first peep cautiously out of the water , then rise upon the wing and fly away . In the morning , the nightheron and the owl were seen , retiring into the sxvamps , where none could follow ; the gulls and terns skimmed lightly through the air ; rose-colored curlews stalked under the mangrove 5 ; purple herons started up before their steps ; gallinules and other water-.fowl were on the waves , and every cactus supported a white ibis 's nest . When the party had built a shed , and lay down to rest at night , the waters were almost at their feet ; when they rose in the morning , the beach was naked , and the waters at a vast distance , so level are these shores . Meantime , the birds could laugh at the disappointment of the ornithologist ; his boat was far enough from the sea , and no human foot could venture upon the vast fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ibis ; the eggs supplied a delicious food , which the naturalist ate with becoming resignation , since nothing better could be done . But a little time changed the scene ; when the tide rose a foot or two , the immeasurable plain was again covered with water . Then the birds were driven in towards the land , and the party fired on them with such effect , that they had soon thrown up a heap , like a haycock , of the dead . But when they were returning with their treasures , they had an opportunity of witnessing another exhibition of nature , which , situated as they were , in a small boat on the sea , was rather more curious than welcome . A black cloud suddenly folded the setting sun ; a low , murmuring sound was heard , and lightning shot from the cloud , which seemed as if it were chasing the boat for some purpose of revenge . The pilot quietly // said , " sit still , gentlemen ; I should not like to lose you overboard just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if you will but sit still ; here we have it ! " in an instant , the wild hurricane struck the boat , and dashed it on the shore . The waters drifted like snow ; the strong mangroves were bent to the earth , and washed by the waves which rose out of their bounds ; the rain fell , not in drops , but masses . Such are the fierce winds which sometimes rage in tropical climates , carrying destruction with them over land and sea ; on shore , destroying more in an hour than an age can repair ; on the sea , making over many a gallant vessel to the mercy of the wrecker or the waves . Mr. And uhon makes a remark with respect to bis residence in Florida , which deserves to he remembered . He says , that while enduring constant hardship , and exposed to alternate beat and moisture , both by day and night , he and his party restricted themselves to fish and soaked biscuit for food , and drank nothing but water and molasses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be produced by ardent spirits and more substantial food . What a change in men 's views on this subject within a few years ! Southey , in his life of Wesley , sharply censures General Oglethorpe , for prohibiting the use of ardent spirits in his colony , since they were necessary to health , and it was unreasonable to deprive the sober of an important luxury , because it was abused by a few . Jacquemont , the enterprising traveller in India , preserved his health by a course of prudence resembling that of Audubon ; it is true that he fell a victim , at last , to the climate , but it appears to have been owing to a feeling of security , which grew out of his long exemption from disease . Unfortunate it was for that young man , that he had not something of that religious feeling , which ought to be inseparable from the love of nature , and which Audubon so happily expresses on proper occasions ; a man of prudence , energy , fine intellect , and large attainments , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpressibly painful to every thoughtful mind . It seems impossible to doubt , that if moderate caution is observed , every climate of the earth may be inhabited , transiently or permanently , by travellers from every other . There is scarcely an instance of the death of foreign travellers , even in Africa , which may not be traced to some needless exposure . Every remark of an experienced traveller , that tends to // give right views of this subject , should be carefully treasured for the use of the world . Audubon says , that his party , and the officers who followed their example in respect to diet , never were troubled with so much as a headache , arising from the damps of night , or the noonday sun . Mr. Audubon took an opportunity to visit the Tortugas , which are about eighty miles from Key West . They are low , uninhabitable banks , covered with shells and sand , and are resorted to by turtlers and wreckers ; the former , aiming at profit , by affording the means of luxurious indulgence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in nowise anxious to publish , either to the government or the world . The turtles are of four kinds , of which the green is considered the best for food . The hawk-billed stands next , in point of flavor ; its shell is the one so much in demand . The loggerhead and trunk turtles are little sought for food , and are accordingly bold , compared with the others . The account which he gives of their habits is curious and interesting . They pass the winter in the deep waters , hut in spring they approach the shores , not the Tortugas only , but the many sandy capes and islets of that region . On coming near , generally on clear moonlight nights , the turtle raises its head above the water , and attentively examines all around . Should it discover nothing unpropitious to its movements , it makes a loud , hissing sound , which alarms its enemies , and drives them from the spot . If all continue quiet , she advances slowly to the beach , and crawls over it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till she has selected a place to deposit her eggs . She then scrapes a hole in the sand , to the depth of about two feet , a work which Mr. Audubon saw accomplished in nine minutes ; and in this , she deposits the eggs , in regular layers , to the number of one hundred and fifty or two hundred . She then replaces the sand , and makes it so level with the rest of the beach , that the place can not be detected except by an experienced eye . In order to secure these anirnals , the turtlers overset them on the beach , and sometimes in the water , though this is considered a hazardous operation . They are sometimes so large , that to throw them on their backs , requires the united efforts of several men . The animals are not unprovided with means of defence . One of the loggerhead species , which was brought on board the vessel , made , with its bite , an indentation in one of the flukes of the // anchor . The smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying some for his friends , we mean his feathered friends , - found that one weighing seven hundred pounds , cost but a trifle more than one of thirty . The turtlers take them in various ways , some of them cruel , but successful in proportion , and humanity is a thing but little regarded in matters like this . One thing , which Mr. Audubon relates on the authority of turtlers , is interesting , as an evidence of that mysterious reach of instinct , which appears in various animals . If a turtle is carried in a vessel several hundred miles from its favorite haunts , and then let loose in the ocean , it will be found in the spot from which it was taken , either immediately after , or certainly in the next spring . While in Florida , Mr. Audubon took occasion to visit a celebrated spring , near the sources of St. John 's river . It presents a circular basin , about sixty feet in diameter , from the centre of which the water rises with great apparent force , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deposited vast quantities of shells , gravel , pieces of wood , and other substances , which have gathered into masses . The water , though dark colored , is transparent , and so impregnated with sulphur , that the smell is offensive . Its depth is about seventeen feet . Not far from it was another in former times , which had , from some unknown cause , dried entirely away . The only use to which the waters are applied , is that of turning a mill , which grinds the sugar-cane of a neighboring plantation . Mr. Audubon passed the summer of 1832 in Boston , devoting his time , however , not to society , but to those labors which are never remitted even so much as health requires . While here , he was seized with an illness , owing to his incessant application , which had nearly brought him to the grave . During his residence in Boston , he made an excursion into the British provinces , and the state of Maine . After exploring the woods at the eastern extremity of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river of that name , he reached Frederickton , where the Governor , Sir Archibald Campbell , treated him with much regard . Wherever he went , he was attentive to every thing worth observing , even though it was not strictly within the line of his own profession . We can not permit ourselves to pass over the testimony which he bears in favor of the lumberers of Maine . As a // lover of nature , he was delighted to witness their humanity to their cattle ; and though it seems like an incredible Arcadian description , he avers that the drivers neither beat nor cursed them , - a kind of unusual self-denial , which says much in their praise . The explanation is not distant ; for he tells us that in many of the villages of Maine , when he applied for brandy , rum , or whiskey , he could not obtain one drop ; insomuch that he , temperate as he is , could not help feeling as if the temperance amounted to excess . He gives an interesting account of the habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spot , which they are soon to make desolate with their axes , and begin by providing a shelter for their cattle ; then they construct their own log hut , making bedsteads of the rudest cabinet work , in the corners , and a " rung chimney , " as it was called by our forefathers , on one side , meaning a chimney formed , by securing together four ladders , filled in with clay between the rounds . In the neighborhood of the camp , they set their " steel-traps , " " dead-falls , " and " spring-guns , " to catch the bears which are apt to prowl round such establishments , - guests unbidden and unwelcome , save that their skins answer good purpose for raiment , and their flesh is no contemptihle food . The appearance of one of these woodmen is sufficiently odd , with a rackoon 's skin over his head and brow , and moose-skin " leggins " reaching up to the girdle round his waist , stalking forth on snow-shoes , to cut down the noble pines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These trees are sawn into measured logs , and drawn by the cattle , to be left on the ice of the rivers ; so that when the winter breaks up , they may be ready to float down the stream . When the labor of the season is completed , they devote themselves to pleasures ; not , however , of the unprofitable kind , as the deer , bears , sables and martens , will bear witness ; the moose hunt , also , is recommended to them by the dignified associations of hardship and danger ; this large and powerful animal makes his way through snows several feet in depth , faster than the hunters can follow him on their snowshoes . A veteran hunter knows the direction in which to pursue them , by the marks of their teeth on the branches , left in browsing ; these are found more distinct and frequent , as he draws near them ; but the moose have senses so acute , that before the hunter can reach them , they have taken the // alarm and moved away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their flight ; when hard pressed , they will turn and defend themselves with great fury . Mr. Audubon 's party took a young one , which was so exhausted , that it made no opposition when it was led to the camp ; but on the next day , it was so powerful and violent , that it was found impossible to preserve it alive . The common deer , which but a few years ago were found in Massachusetts , are now hardly seen in New England , except in Maine , and the northern parts of New Hampshire . The newspapers of the last winter gave us an example of the danger to which these lumberers are sometimes exposed , from the burning of their camps ; and Mr. Audubon has given us an account , as he received it from the lips of a forester , of one of these conflagrations of the woods . They are sometimes thought to be kindled by Indians ; others ascribe them to the friction of dry trees upon each other ; but where so many fires are made , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new countries , it is not wonderful that these accidents should abound , since insects often destroy trees in vast numbers , and leave their dry remains in a fit state to receive the flame . This man , with his family , was awaked one night by the outcry of their cattle , and starting from their beds , saw the glare and heard the crackling of the fire ; they arose and fled for life on their horses ; but the flames pursued so fiercely , that they could feel the withering heat ; their only resource was to gain a lake , and secure themselves on the lee side of it ; there they released their horses , which they never saw again , and threw themselves down among the rushes on the water 's edge . The frighted wild beasts dashed into the water , swam across to the place where they were , and stood still at their side . Perhaps no condition in life can be imagined , more full of horror and dismay than this , and yet it is not uncommon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs sent down by the lumberers do not reach their destination ; they linger , in tangled heaps , within the banks of the stream , where they are suffered to remain , till the miller has done his office upon those that have reached him . Mr. Audubon has given an animated account of the operation , by which these wayfarers are brought down . Vast numbers of them were lying in the gorge of a stream , which , though broad and powerful in the spring , was then shrunk to // the centre of its dusty bed , and had left the logs white in the sun . A dam was made at the outlet of another gorge above , which slowly filled itself with the diminished waters of the stream , and formed a broad sheet of water , a mile in length , with a depth of ten feet . When it was filled , the temporary dam was torn away , and the waters were suffered to pass into the gorge choked with logs below . They flowed out with conscious power ; presently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monster beneath was struggling to throw off a weight ; then , the logs rose in masses , lifting , crashing , and dashing each other aside , some springing into the air , others diving under the roaring tide , till at last the waters hore all away , cleaving some into splinters , and striking others against the banks , with a noise that resounded like thunder . He could compare it to nothing hut the confusion of a battle , with the roar of cannon , the shouts of the victorious , and the groans of the dying . It gave him a profound and tremendous irnpression of the force of the waters . Mr. Audubon , when he left New Brunswick , proceeded on St. John 's river . He and his party were landed at Wood* stock , a youthful settlement , and went by land over an unpromising road , to Houlton , in Maine . He remained for a day or two at that military station , laboring in his vocation , though with small success . Of the road cut by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audubon speaks in high terms , describing it as one of the best turnpikes in the Union . In one place , where it was unfinished for some miles , he met with difficulties and delays , which made him sensibly feel the advantage of such a thoroughfare . But when he came in sight of the Penobscot river , all the hardships of the way were forgotten in the view of the glorious landscape before him . Canoes , filled with Indians , were plying in every direction , scaring the game from the broad , bright waters . The eagle and fish-hawk were floating over it , on their motionless wings ; the rich colors of early autumn were over all the fields , and mountains rose in the distance , an appropriate boundary for the scene . This tour to New Brunswick , which most men would consider of itself a tolerably extensive journey , was to him only a preparation for one . He had always been desirous of visiting the northern regions , in which so many birds which pass through New England , fix their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seem , like the vessel whose fate Mr. Balwhidder commemorates , to " sail north into utter darkness , " there are many interesting birds which pay us a flying visit in our gardens , as they hurry to their arctic home . Such is the fox-colored sparrow , which sings us a farewell just before he goes , to which we have often listened , wondering if any sound in nature was ever half so sweet . The treesparrow , also , with their inseparable friends , the snow-birds ; when they linger so long with us , what attraction is it which forces them away at last ? There are many questions of the kind which can not be answered , except by one who goes himself to explore the recesses of their polar home ; a voyage to Labrador was therefore indispensable , and the purpose was hardly sooner said than done . While his eldest son went to England to superintend the publication of the work , Mr. Audubon went to Eastport , where he engaged a fast-sailing vessel , and made preparations for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the cruise of one of our revenue cutters , to visit the Bay of Fundy . This was in May , when nature was just waking from her wintry sleep . He was in raptures , when he was once more in motion , and it is curious to observe , what an ornithological aspect his favorite taste gives to most of his beautiful descriptions . As they passed under the cliffs of the island of Grand Menan , " the prudent raven spread her pinions , launched from the crag , and flew away before us ; the golden eagle soaring aloft , moved majestically in wide circles ; the guillemots set on their eggs on the shelvy precipices , or plunging in the water , dived and rose again at a great distance ; the broad-breasted eider duck covered her eggs among the grassy tufts ; on a naked rock , the seal basked lazily , its sleek sides glittering in the sunshine ; while shoals of porpoises were swiftly gliding through the waters around us , showing that though doomed to the deep , their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold shores of Nova-Scotia , gradually fading in the distance , of which the grey tints beautifully relieved the wing-like sails of many a fishing bark . " But on landing , the prospect was still more to the purpose . On White-Head islands , he found the nests of gulls on almost every tree of a wood that covered several acres . " What a treat , reader , was it , to find birds of this kind , lodged in fir trees and sitting comfortably on their eggs ! " // At another time he sailed in the revenue cutter 's tender , the " Fancy , " a name that seems to have inspired his descriptions . We do not mean that anything is overdrawn or overcolored ; we refer to that wild delight which the sight of nature , in her happiest aspects , awakens in such minds as his . It seems to him as if the " old wives " that covered the hay , were cackling a welcome , and cormorants and gulls appeared as if they wanted nothing but words , to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , the delightful trills of the winter-wren , the red-squirrel " smacking time with his chops , " the clear notes of the rohin , the rolling melody of the rosebreast , filled him with such enthusiasm , that he burned with the thirst of knowledge , and longed to learn from their own lips , what every one could teach of the wondrous works of Heaven . When he saw the water birds , towering on firm and graceful wing , a way to regions where none have followed , he longed to " take the wings of the morning , " and pursue them to the lands where the presence of man has never yet disturbed their quiet abodes . It is such imaginations as this , that warm the heart of the lover of nature ; the world at large may have little sympathy with them ; in fact , may not understand then ; and yet these are the " maintaining power , " which enables men to go through with hard enterprises and memorable deeds . Mr. Audubon had the opportunity of verifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he could not believe without the sight . At Windsor , in Nova Scotia , he sat on the bank of the river , about eighty feet above its bed , which was almost dry . Many vessels lay in this sandy wilderness , where it seemed as if no water could ever come to float them . The next morning , he watched the rising of the tide , and ascertained that it rose at the rate of three feet in ten minutes , or eighteen in the hour . At high water , the surface was sixty , five feet above the bed of the river ; and on looking for the vessels which he had seen the evening before , he was told that most of them had sailed with the night tide . Mr. Audubon found some things even in Labrador to interest him , apart from his professional researches and soon had occasion to make a remark , which we have not the hardihood to deny . " Go where you will , " be says , " if a shilling is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of it . " The first of these adventurers that he discovered , was a French // man , who had established himself in a small island , separated from the main land by a narrow channel . He saw this person with his telescope engaged in kneeling before a cross in the attitude of prayer . Mr. Auduhon visited the island , and asked the man why he chose that place for his devotions . He replied , that in spring and summer he prayed fronting the ocean , because that element supplied him with food . In winter , for a similar reason , he prayed fronting the mountains , from which the deer came down . Mr. Auduhon thought his answer reasonable , and went with him to his hut , which was formed of stones plastered with mud , and thatched with weeds and moss . Eight Esquimaux dogs formed his family . The stranger kindly welcomed him to this mansion , the fragrance of which was overpowering , and went away ; hut soon returned with a face expressive of horror and dismay . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had discovered his barrel of rum , which he had hidden in a sequestered spot , and , engaged doubtless in the service of the Temperance Society , had conveyed it entirely away . So true it is that there is no escaping from chance and changes . But the unfortunate man , even in this moment of bereavement , with tears in his eyes , declared that for ten years , the time which he had resided here , collecting skins , he had met with no affliction that would hear a moment 's comparison with this irreparahle loss of his rum . Proceeding further along the coast , he came to another resident of a higher order , who had come to this inhospitable region in search of fortune . lie was a gentleman in his manners , with a wife and children . He said that he had no relish for the world , and that he lived out of the reach of lawyers , taxes and all exactions . As for his children , he intended that they should live and die in the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that they needed to know . But wherever man is , there is trouble : even his repose was disturhed by fishermen and eggers , whom he abominated ; he felt no joy in the visits of the navigators , who bought his salmon , seal-skins and oil , and supplied him in return with the necessaries of his chosen life . At Bras-dor , a distance of seventy miles , they found the brother of this recluse , who was also weary of the world , of which he had seen much , and resided in this secluded place with his wife and children . The lady descanted upon the fine arts , as exhibited in certain prints upon the walls ; 1*1r . Audubon was out of patience with her // pretension ; but he should have considered , that these were the finest in all the country , and that , if they were satisfied with works which cost a shilling , it was useless to go to Dresden or Florence for wonders of art , which they could neither value nor understand . She regretted very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she greatly delighted ; her instrument bad been sent to Europe to be repaired ; but from her enthusiastic description of it , it was evidently a hand-organ . She admired it , because it was played with a winch , and because without much instruction in the arts her children soon became interesting and able performers . The visiters were disposed to smile ; but truly , we think thatthe instrument was chosen with great discretion , and might be introduced even in more southerly latitudes , with manifest advantage . When we see the many pale , tired and tuneless children , who are compelled to belabor a piano for years , in hopes that music , which can " create a soul , under the ribs of death , " will call into existence a voice and ear where nature has provided none , we do think , that it would be a wise and happy exchange , to take an instrument , which will produce the harmony ready-made , such as it is , and leave hours and years of valuable time for things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gifts , they should by all means be cultivated ; but we see no advantage in teaching the lame to dance , nor the daughters of discord to sing . It may be true that all can be made singers ; and so far as the power can be cultivated to any good purpose of use or pleasure , it should he done : but we fancy , that , after all , though the peacock and sea-gull are allowed to have voices , they are not the birds to which we shall go for melody , when the baltimore or the red bird is nigh . The lady , however , had virtues more substantial than accomplishments , and her husband lived a quiet , busy and inoffensive life . His name was in good odor through the whole region ; not so his establishment ; the carcases of fifteen hundred seals lay in a heap near his mansion , sending forth a fragrance which would have drowned all the perfumes of Araby the blest . Mr. Audubon derived from it a conclusive argument in favor of the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , had the vultures possessed the sense of smell , in as great perfection as some naturalists believe , they would have hurried to Labrador , rejoicing , from all parts of the United States , in which they are found . // While at Labrador , Mr. Audubon had an opportunity of seeing the cod-fishing , which is carried on with so much vigor . He had been astonished at the numbers of fish which he saw in Florida : but here they were far exceeded . The business is laborious to the men who are engaged in it , and their wages are proportionally high . The hours of rest on any of the week days , do not much exceed three in the twenty-four . At three in the morning the cook has the breakfast ready for the master and the crew ; immediately after , they proceed in boats to the fishing grounds , taking with them their dinner already prepared ; there , they employ themselves till their boat is laden almost to the water 's edge . When they return to the vessel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this ceremony is repeated as often as the boat is filled , which is generally once in each half of the day . The fish are cleaned upon the deck , cast into the hold to be salted , and thus , six experienced men dispose of what the other six catch in the course of the day . They afterwards take them to the shore , where they dry them in the sun , either on scaffolds made for the purpose , or on the bare surface of the rocks . The life of a Labrador fisherman is not one of indolence and ease . In midsummer , they sometimes throw out seines to catch their fish as they are chasing the smaller fish to the shores . In proof of their numbers , Mr. Audubon mentions , that the young men of his party often caught codfish alive with their hands , and large trouts with a mackerel hook , suspended by a line from their gun-rods ; and if two of them walked knee-deep along the rocks , holding a handkerchief by the corners , they swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy employment are generally well repaid for their labor . He tells us that he has known those who were in independent circumstances , only ten years after they went their first voyage as boys ; but they still continued to resort to the fishing , liking its exertion better than idleness at home . But the account of Mr. Audubon 's expeditions is so entertaining , that we had almost forgotten the purpose for which they were made . In Florida , he lived among the ibises , herons and pigeons , and had the best opportunity of studying their habits . In Labrador , he became acquainted with the summer plumage of various water birds , and their modes of breeding . The results of these tours will not fully appear , till the next volume , which , in consequence of the solicitation of // various persons , will contain the water birds . His own plan was , as set forth in his prospectus , to go through with the land birds first . It is a matter of very little importance in itself ; but such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the arrangement which he had adopted in his own mind ; and which , if not the best , certainly has the advantage of being the most familiar to him . But let us see what lie has added to our former knowledge , on this interesting subject . And here we would remark , that we honor him for his readiness to make acknowledgments for information afforded him by others , engaged in the same pursuit . To he grateful for services , hospitality , and aid , is one thing ; to be warm in acknowledgment of information received , is another ; and naturalists , like other men , are apt to feel like the monk of the middle ages , who , when told that many of the good things in his book , had been said by the ancients before him , replied , in wrath , " pereant , qui nostra ante nos dixissent . " Mr. Audubon takes pleasure in stating that he was indebted , not only for many important facts , but some new discoveries , to his friend , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of these , is the Sylvia Bochmanii , first made known to the world in this collection . It was discovered by Mr. Bachman , in July , 1833 . He described it as a lively , active bird , gliding among thick branch .. es , occasionally mounting on the wing and seizing insects in the air , in the manner of a fly-catcher . Others have since been seen in the same neighborhood ; so that we may , at some future time , receive a full description of its habits , which are now entirely unknown . The name of this bird was quite appropriately given . To have one 's name thus attached to a natural object , and engraven in the world of nature , is , of all honors , the most enduring . It should not be lightly bestowed , and there are none to whom it so properly belongs , as to those who have distinguished themselves in this particular science ; there are certainly those who deserve it . A species of finch has also been discovered by Mr. Bachman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approbation , Mr. Audubon gave it the name of McGillivray 's finch ; in this , he did not transgress the rule stated above , since the gentleman thus honored , possesses a thorough know*dge of this science , and according to Mr. Audubon , no mean authority in such matters , is unquestionably the best of all portrayers // of the feathered race . This bird does not appear in company with the description . It was sent to London for the purpose , but did not arrive in season ; it must now be delayed , till the appearance of the fourth volume . Mr. Audubon discovered a new species of finch in Labrador , to which he gave the name of " Lincoln 's , " in compliment to one of the young gentlemen who went with him in his northern expedition , and who was so fortunate as to shoot it . Going forth , one morning , into one of the small valleys which are found here and there in that country , Mr. Audubon heard the notes of this bird , resembling those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was new to his ears . He immediately gave chase to it , which was difficult , on account of its wildness ; but though he succeeded in gaining the bird , he could not discover its nest . Where this bird passes the winter , is unknown . Mr. Audubon never met with it in the southern states , though he has seen specimens in the collection of William Cooper , Esq. , of New York , which were found in the vicinity of that city . The fourth of these new birds is an Emberiza , called " Townsend 's , " because discovered by Dr. Townsend , of Philadelphia . Beside the warbler above-mentioned , Mr. Audubon has given to a new finch the name of Bachman . No one can say , that this naturalist is not entitled to the honor , inasmuch as be himself discovered the bird ; but to avoid the repetition , it might have been better to have bestowed the compliment elsewhere ; nor need he have looked far , for he acknowledges many obligations to the sister of this gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes . Mr. Bachman found this finch on the Edisto river . He had heard its note before , but took it for that of the ground-robin , or towee-bunting , though the note is softer , and in other respects not precisely the same . The bird is easily discovered , and passes for the finest singer of all the family of sparrows ; no search has yet been able to trace it to its nest . But the list of Mr. Bachman 's discoveries is not completed . In 1833 , he discovered another warbler , near the Edisto river . To this , Mr. Audubon has attached the name of Swainson , in honor of a distinguished naturalist , who has traversed a large portion . of our country . The Carolina titmouse is one of his own discoveries . The print of this little bird had been distributed among his subscribers , // before be found that it was not the same with the Parus hi-color of the middle states . When he was at Eastport , in May , 1833 , an officer of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the southern bird of the same name ; and on inquiring carefully into the subject , he ascertained that they were specifically distinct . This new kind is found only in the south ; the other is found in the northern , hut abounds most in the middle states . They differ , also , in their habits , the Carolina titmouse being a more retiring bird than our peto , as he is sometimes called , from the peculiar sound of his song . The list of new species is closed with the wood-wren , a bird with which Mr. Audubon became acquainted in Maine . It had often been seen , but was supposed to be one of the kinds which are familiarly known . The notes , however , differ considerably from those of the house-wren , and other differences appear , on a comparison of the two . They breed in hollow logs in the woods , and seldom approach the farms ; a point in which they are exceedingly unlike the house-wren , who , with that easy composure , which is so unjustly thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes himself perfectly at home , wherever he may be . Of these eight additions to the birds of America , Mr. Audubon claims the honor of discovering but three ; and evidently takes as much pleasure in setting forth the success of others , as if it were his own . This is well ; there is no greater proof of conscious poverty of merit , than to be avaricious of praise ; and no one , who can not rejoice in the honor of others , ever deserves to have any honor of his own . Mr. Audubon has introduced several birds to our notice , which were never before known to visit the United States . At Key West , he first saw the pigeon , to which he has given the name of the island where he found it . The commanding officer there sent a serjeant with him , who happened to he familiar with the pursuit , and soon put him in possession of this treasure , which he gazed on again and again with perfect delight ; he says , that the Egyptian pharmacopolist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverence , than he paid to the corpse of this most beautiful of the doves . Though covered with moschetos , flowing with perspiration , and sinking with heat , he thought of nothing but the richness of his prize , and with a joy which was only abated by seeing // how difficult it would be to give any adequate representation of its brilliant , varying , metallic hues . This bird , the *olumbct Montana , had always been considered the same with the Zenaida dove . The blue-headed pigeon , Cotumba Cyanocephala , is another , which Mr. Audubon has added to the list of transient residents in the United States . Though some of them migrate every year from Cuba to Florida , they are seldom seen , on account of the deep thickets in which they reside . He saw a pair of them near the water ; but on approaching them , they escaped to the bushes . He afterwards searched for a whole day , in a place where fishermen and wreckers said they were more abundant , but not an individual could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when young , on the " Mule Keys ; " so that the fact is established , that they are embraced within the limits of our ornithology . It was never generally known that the Caracara , or Brazilian-eagle , comes within our boundaries , till Mr. Audubon published it ; though Dr. Strobel informed him , that this bird undoubtedly breeds in Florida . He saw it first , flying at a great elevation , and , convinced that it was new to him , determined to watch its motions . He was not long kept in suspense ; for the bird proceeded to a dead horse , on which some vultures were regaling themselves , and without much exchange of civilities , made one of the dinner party . But hungry though it was , it did not lose its caution . He fired on it without effect , but did not succeed in securing it till two days after . It differs most from the American vultures , in its power of carrying its prey in its talons . ' Mr. Audubon found it no easy matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plumage loses its brightness soon after the bird dies ; but in those warm regions , the colors will almost entirely fade , before the most rapid hand can paint them . In one of the Florida keys , Mr. Audubon first formed an acquaintance with the . IJ*Iuscicapa Dominicensis , or pipiry flycatcher . This bird comes from Cuba to Florida in the spring , and would probably have been observed in the United States before , had it not been mistaken for the king-bird , which it resembles in appearance , manners , and the way of building its nest . Mr. Audubon gives an example of the necessity of paying proper regard to the statements of others . Report was made to him and Mr. Bachman , by a young gentleman of Charleston , that he had seen a pair of fly-catchers in the // college yard , different from any which he had ever observed before . He requested them to come to the spot , where they might see both the birds and their nest . They paid little regard to his first account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found that the nest had been destroyed , and happening to see a common king-bird , rallied the youth upon his new discovery . Some time afer , the birds formed another nest , and Mr. Bachrnan on visiting it , found it was the work of the bird in question . The anecdote is honestly recorded , to the credit of the youth , and for the warning of all the wise . The Hudson 's Bay titmouse is slightly described by Nuttall , in his valuable work , on the authority of others , he himself not having found it . Wilson , who knew it only by description , imagined it the same with our black-cap or chicadee . Mr. Audubon ascertained that it breeds in the state of Maine , and is , therefore , one of our citizens ; but he never could find it , till his visit to Labrador . There , he was so fortunate as to discover the bird and its nest . The nest was in the hollow of a small decayed stump , not more than three feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingeniously matted , that it seemed like the work of human art . This species is more common in Newfoundland than in Labrador ; it is found in Maine , but no one has yet been seen so far south as Massa* chusetts . Again and again has it been said , that only one species of humming-bird ever visits the United States ; hut lo ! here is another . But the world may be forgiven for not having known that there were two , since Audubon himself never seems to have met with the mango humming-bird , as it is called ; the one that now figures in his plates and descriptions . This species was communicated to him by Mr. Bachman , who received a specimen from Dr. Strobel , which he had brought from Key West . It was captured from a bush , where it was sitting , exhausted , perhaps , with its migratory flight . Whether it is numerous or not , Dr. Strobel had no means of ascertaining . Thus there are five species of birds , which were previously known to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are ascertained by this unwearied observer , to be occasional visiters or residents in the United States . The mangrove-cuckoo might , perhaps , be included ; for though Nuttall described it , and gave it the name of Coccyzus Seni // culus , he declares that he never saw it , and that it was admitted only on the authority of Vieillot . Mr. Audubon often noticed these birds at Key West , but took them to be the same with the common yellow-bill ; when one was sent him by an officer , he discovered that it was not the common species , though it resemhles it in many of its habits , particularly those in which it is least worthy of imitation . It feeds on the eggs of other birds , and builds a nest in the same slovenly manner , but is even more timid and shy . The fishermen and wreckers declared to him , that it went to the nest of the white pigeon , and destroyed the helpless young ; a kind of trifling with life , which doubtless grieved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to hope that the reproach is undeserved . Mr. Auduhon , in his own researches , could find nothing to confirm it . To discover new species , or to ascertain these new facts , must be the thing wished for by him who was desirous of inventing new pleasures ; we doubt whether any bloody triumph was ever so luxuriously enjoyed . We must next take a view of the new facts which Mr. Audubon has established . He has exalted our crow to the dignity of a distinct species , and given it the name of Corvus Americanus . It has always been regarded and described as the same with the carrion-crow of Europe ; hut in this country , that name is wanted for the black vulture ; and assuredly no creature can more eminently deserve it . Mr. Audubon considers our crow less in size than the European bird ; this difference however , if it exists , is trifling : but the voice , the form of the tongue and the habits of the two , afford more important differences . 1* ' 1ontague says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the year , seldom collecting in numbers , except to feed on some carcass or to roost in winter ; this does not describe the American crows , which are a remarkably social people . He also says that he has seen a crow strike a pigeon dead from the top of a barn ; in fact , his whole description gives the impression of a bird , more bold and less cautious than ours . Mr. Audubon with his usual generosity pleads the cause of this unfortunate bird , which is exposed not only to the shot of idle boys , but to the acts of legislatures , and regularly receives the ominous benedictions of the farmer as often as the spring arrives ; being compelled to bear the sins of the grakle in addition to his own ; while the latter bird , saving himself by // turning evidence against his neighbor , builds his nest upon the high tree over the chimney , and riots undisturbed upon the fields and garden . The raven , which is the head of this sable family , has been placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his second volume ; a more discreet file leader could not have been selected , though in point of beauty , it must be acknowledged , many others would have the advantage . The raven is a much larger and more powerful bird than the crow , and there is no tie of relationship or love between them . Wherever the ravens choose to resided tl ) ey give warning to the crows , that a change of air will be good for their constitutions ; but , with a generosity unknown to human parties , civil , military or religious , they permit the crows to inhabit those regions which they do not want for themselves , and thus the whole country is parcelled out between them . These birds resemble each other in their familiarity and ease , when they are domesticated . The raven perhaps is the more desirable inmate of the two , since it treats its master like a friend ; the crow too loves its master much , hut its joke more : and nothing can exceed the troublesome ingenuity of the pranks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The caution of the raven in protecting its young is most remarkable . On the coast of Labrador , Mr. Audubon discovered a nest , and he and his whole party attempted to shoot one of the proprietors , but in vain . One afternoon , he lay concealed under a pile of rocks for two hours ; the young in the nest croaked for food , but no parent came ; as soon as he was out of patience and had left the place , the female , in an instant was seen from the vessel , to go to the place to relieve her clamorous children . He observed that in the deepest fogs , these birds by their peculiar instinct , could move from any distance , straight toward their nest . Of the crow , Mr. Audubon says , that , " the state of terror in which he is always kept is enough to spoil the temper of any creature . " We honor him for his humanity , but we fear it will be lifting up his voice in vain . We shall he satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harmless birds . And much we wonder what that parent can be made of , who will suffer his child to destroy life and regard it as pleasure . If the boy have that taste , and the parent be disposed to indulge it , let him take the boy to a slaughter house , and there pay a sixpence for the privilege of knocking an ox in the head . If there be any sport in the case , it must // be greater in proportion to the size of the animal , and if such a propensity deserve to be cultivated , let it be indulged , where it can be of some service to men . Mr. Audubon has pointed out the difference between the American golden-crested wren , Regulus Tricolor , as Nuttall has named it , and the Regulus Cristatus of Europe ; showing that the former is longer , and differs also in its claws and bill . This bird breeds at Labrador , where he saw it feeding its young in August ; common as it was there and in Newfoundland , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in a group , as they go to pass the winter in our southern and western states . In January , he saw great numbers of them in the woods near Charleston , and so careless were they of his presence , that he could go within two or three feet of them , without giving any alarm . Mr. Audubon shows that the Sylvia Palmarum or palm warbler of Bonaparte , is the same with the Sylvia Petechia or yellow red-poll . That able naturalist , introduced it for the first time as a bird of the United States , saying that in winter , it abounds in the vicinity of St. Augustine ; but Mr. Audubon maintains , that the true Sylvia Palmarum is never found within the limits of our republic . Nuttall had corrected the error of Bonaparte before , though in a quiet way , without note or comment ; Mr. Audubon was for a long time persuaded that they were distinct species , and under that impression had attached the name to the sixty-third plate of the second volume ; but Mr. L3achman convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumage differing at different periods of its life . The rough-legged falcon , Falco Lagopus , Mr. Audubon takes to be the same bird with the black-hawk , Falco Niger of Wilson ; the difference in their markings , being ascribed to the time of life at which they were taken . And , to show how much the color of the bird might mislead us , he tells us that while he was in Boston , he received eight of these birds at one time , in consequence of a premium which he offered , and found that the pluma*e of no two of the number was the same , while there was no difference whatever in the more important signs by which the kind is determined . Bonaparte thought , that the effect of increasing knowledge on these subjects , would be to increase the numbers of species of birds already known ; but such examples as this seem to show , that the effect will be different , and that many , which now stand apart in their dignity // of class and order , will hereafter be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , in the same marsh , and their flight and attitudes were the same : it was observed that the dark ones were the most shy , which he thinks was owing to the circumstance that they were the oldest . This natural association and the perfect similarity of their voices , taken in connexion with the other circumstances , satisfied him that they were all of the same family of birds . The very specimen which Wilson described and painted as Falco Niger , is still in the Philadelphia collection , and as Mr. Audubon says , serves to show , that , apart from color , which is not much to be depended on , there is nothing to distinguish it from the roughlegged falcon . Wilson was provoked with those who said that the American crossbill was only a variety of the European species ; but Mr. Audubon , with due deference to his predecessor , firmly maintains that the American does not differ in any respect whatever from the European bird . He says that he has shot great numbers , and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in his present conviction ; but , knowing that he may be mistaken , after all his care , he invites his reader to go through a similar course of experiments if he will . The great A merican shrike , called by Bonaparte Lanius &amp;ptentrionalis , he , like Wilson , considers the same with the Lanius Excubitor of Europe . The singular practice for which this bird is remarkable , of impaling insects on sharp points of twigs and thorns , is a mystery , which he does not attempt to solve . Mr , Audubon takes particular delight in the swallows , those " light-hearted wretches , " which are perpetually wheeling in their rapid and graceful circles , as if there were no such thing as care in the world . They sport together in perfect harmony all day , and what is a little remarkable , considering the quick temper of most birds , they assemble in perfect harmony at night , though so many are tenants of the same barn . Mr. Audubon describes their flight with great animation . " In fine calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed at a considerable elevation , with a lightness and ease that are truly admirable . They play over the river , the field or the city , with equal grace , and during spring and summer , you might imagine that their object was to fill the air around them with their cheerful twitterings . When the weather lowers , they move swiftly in tortuous meanderings over the meadows and through // the streets of the town ; they pass and repass , now close to the pavement , and now along the walls of the buildings , so rapid , that you can scarcely follow them with the eye . But try - there she skims against the wind over the ruffled stream : up she shoots , seizes an insect , and wheeling round , sails down the breeze , with a rapidity , that carries her out of your sight almost in a moment . " Wilson combated the opinion , which regarded this favorite bird as the same with the chimney-swallow of Europe . He remarks , that there is some difference in their colors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confining itself to chimneys , while ours never selects those places for its nest . But Montague observes of this chimney-swallow , that , though in England the chimney is its favorite retreat , in Scotland it builds in barns , out-houses and straw-built sheds . White found their nests in the shaft of a deserted well , and Mr. Rennie remarks , that he had repeatedly seen them in the shafts of coal-pits , not at all dismayed by the presence of the workmen , who , fortunately for the birds , consider it unlucky to injure them . In Swedeii , the chimney-swallow is equally indifferent as to the place where it builds ; so that nothing can be found in the place of their nest , to constitute a marked distinction of one kind from another . Our barn-swallow builds sometimes in old wells , and under bridges , as well as in sheds and barns , but never was known to make its nest in a chimney . Whatever the explanation may be , - and Mr. Audubon thinks it possible that they are prevented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not admit that the Hirundo Rustica of Europe , differs from the barn swallow of our country . Mr. Audubon remarks , that he saw these birds in flocks at St. Augustine at the beginning of December , but after the first frost , they had all disappeared . He believes that they pass the winter on the southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico , not going much farther south , for the want of proper food . He takes no notice of the ancient superstition , which maintained that they dived into the mud . It is a difficult matter to account for the numbers of these birds , which are found in millponds and similar places , where they have evidently been drowned at nearly the same time . Montague observes , that once in spring , when the mercury had suddenly fallen to 42* , these birds were all missing . But be accidentally discovered a retreat , in which hundreds of them were collected , near a large pool , where they seemed to have found some insects for suP // sistence , but were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing . In our capricious climate , they must often he exposed to similar troubles . Such was the case in the cold weather at the early part of June in 1832 . Almost all kinds of birds suffered more or less from cold , and consequent inahility to supply themselves with food . In this state , the birds came in from the forests to the villages and farms , and the summer birds , *articularly the scarlet tanager , were found dead in our gardens . The red-start , generally a shy and retiring bird , came on that occasion , day after day , to a twig , within three feet of the window where we were writing . The swallow is easily affected by cold , and perhaps would suffer more than any of our visiters by such changes ; and changes of the kind abound , after their coming , in the beginning of May . Mr. Audubon adds much to our knowledge of the habits of the barn-owl , which he does not consider precisely the same with that of Europe , though lie says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This elegant bird has been less known to science than to superstition . Its complaint from the ivy-mantled tower , and the dreary sound of the cry , which we so often hear in the stillness of night , have made it rather a subject of fear than of enlightened interest : but Montague , with whom it was domesticated , found it , instead of an evil genius , a familiar and affectionate friend of man . He bred an owl of this kind , a sparrowhawk , and a ring-dove together , and found that they lived in harmony , which was only broken by the pretensions of the ring-dove , which governed the rest , by virtue of being weaker and worse-tempered than the other two ; a kind of despotism , which we did not know to exist among other animals , though it has prevailed for ages , in families of the human race . When he at last dismissed them , the owl was the only one which returned to visit him again . Wilson , diligent as he was in gaining knowledge , declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or information of others , concerning the habits of this bird . Audubon has supplied information concerning its breeding , in which it is peculiar , particularly in respect to time . The European species breeds in March or April : he found the nest of the American at Charleston in the depth of winter , and was told that they bred at all seasons of the year . When in Charleston , in October , 1833 , he received information of a nest in the upper story of a deserted sugar-house. // it was lighted with windows , one of which had two panes broken . He approached the young , guided by the sound of their hissing , when the parent bird , discovering him at the distance of a few feet , glided silently through the aperture . The young were three in number , covered with a cream-colored down , which was beautifully clean . A cotton rat lay beside them , which must have been brought from a distance of three or four miles . On visiting them ' a month after , he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied them with less food than formerly , and brought it only by night . This was on the 25th of November . On the 18th of January , he visited the place again , and found the young fledged , but still unable to fly . He has satisfied himself that this kind of owl lives entirely upon the smaller quadrupeds , - a subsistence which the ornithologist would consider more pardonable than the destruction of small birds , which it was supposed to use for food . But Audubon could never discover the trace of a single feather near the nests ; the pellets , which they throw up after having swallowed their prey , were invariably composed of bones and hair . He has never seen any propensity in this bird to fish , whereas Nuttall gives the account of one which was known to steal gold-fish from a pond . it may , nevertheless , be true , that it resorts to birds and fish , when it can not find a supply of its usual food . it is a little singular , that Mr. Audubon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever ; all ornithologists , as well as common observers , dwell much on their hollow scream ; but he avers , that excepting the hissing , expressive of alarm , he has heard no sound proceed from any of the number . They are remarkable for the silence of their motions . In a room , their flight is so noiseless , that one finds them removed to the opposite side , without having heard the least sound from their wings . Mr. Audubon has added much to our knowledge of the great crow black-bird , an inhabitant of the southern states , which was alluded to by Wilson , but not painted nor described ; an omission which was probably owing to his desire to acquire more knowledge respecting it , before he published it to the world . Bonaparte , who supplied the defect , says but little concerning the habits of the bird ; but Audubon gives a description full of interest and beauty . He describes it as mating in February , when the male delights in perching on the // topmost bough of a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colors , glancing in the sun . The pair build , generally , in the island of a lake , where they refit the last year 's nest , or hastily construct a new one , from twigs , grasses , and the long Spanish moss , that streams from every tree . But no sooner does the female begin to sit upon the eggs , than the males fly away , leaving to the females the whole charge of supporting and educating the young . It is a strange provision of nature . Why is it , that the male wild-turkey would destroy , not only the eggs , but the young themselves ? Perbaps , in the case of the black-bird , which has a passion for eggs , the male emigrates , to be out of the way of temptation to destroy his own . And yet xvhy wonder at such things in the lower animals , when you can not go to any part of the civilized world , where you do not find , in abundance , widows with living husbands , and orphans with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , how much Mr. Audubon has added to what was known concerning the architecture of birds ; but one or two examples will show the difficulty which he encountered . He was desirous to inquire respecting the spruce-partridge , or Canada-grous , which breeds in the state of Maine . Mr. Lincoln , of Dennisville , who afterwards accoml ) anied him to Lahrador , undertook to guide him to their favorite retreats ; but after groping through tangled brushwood , over fallen trees , and through miry ponds , their advance contested at every step by armies of flies and moschettos , they were compelled to return at sunset , without having seen a single hird . He afterwards succeeded in reaching their breeding places , in the hacmatac woods , sinking every step or two in mud to the waist , his feet fast in the mire , and his body wedged between the trees . The birds delight in these inaccessible retreats , and hardly ever leave them ; but when approached , they seem to be fearless , from their unacquaintance with the savage reputation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first noticed this bird in connection with our ornithology , described its eggs as varied with white , yellow , and black ; Audubon says , that they are fawncolored , and irregularly splashed with brown . In his pursuit of the willow-grous , he was exposed to similar trouble . In Newfoundland , he was giving chase to this bird , in an extensive miry flat , where one of the party sunk so deep that it was with the utmost difficulty be could be res // cued by the others . They were covered from head to foot with black mud , and so exhausted , that they were obliged to sit down , every few yards , upon the damp sward , which threatened constantly to give way and let them down beyond human reach . These birds , both males and females , manifested the strongest attachment to their young ; whenever they approached a covey , the parents would give battle in its defence , and attack the intruders with great violence , while the young were hiding themselves in the moss and leaves . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goshawk , the Falco Atricapillus of Wilson , who suspected it to be the goshawk , though h ecalleditbyadifferent name . This bird is not common in the United States , but wherever it is found , is bold and spirited ; in Maine , they have been known to descend to the door of the farmer , and to carry off his chickens and ducks before his eyes . He observed some of them near the Ohio river , engaged in chasing vast numbers of pigeons . One of them suddenly left the pursuit , to attack a flock of crow black-birds , which happened to be crossing the stream . The a-frighted birds fled swiftly , gathering themselves into a mass so dense , that it resembled a black ball . The goshawk soon overtook them , and seizing one , strangled and dropped it , without suspending his flight . In the same way he made sure of several others , letting them drop into the stream . When the black-birds plunged into the woods , he gave over the pursuit , swept down to the water where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one after the other , carried them to the shore . This bird was one of those which were formerly used in falconry , a kind of amusement which has been consecrated by many lordly and chivalrous associations , though without them it would probably have stood on a level with cock-fighting . May we not hope that the time will come when men can find amusement for their idle hours , without requiring the torture and death of other creatures of God ? Mr. Audubon seems often to reproach himself for the severity which he employs in making these accessions of knowledge . He searched out the breeding habits of this species , and of the Mississippi-kite , both of which are described for the first time by him . In pursuit of the latter , he one day heard a prolonged cry of distress , which he traced to a dark , motionless thing , that seemed to have lodged on the branch of // a tree . It proved to be the young of this bird . As soon as he fired upon it , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but without success ; and the parent , seeing the danger , gently took up the young one , and sailing through the air , deposited it in another tree . He could not help admiring the daring and affectionate action ; still he fired again , and brought them both to the ground . After carefililly hiding them , in order to take them on his return , he proceeded on his expedition ; but when he came back to reclaim his prey , some marauder of the woods had destroyed them both . His punishment , he says , was deserved . Its nest , of which Nuttall professes himself entirely ignorant , was found in tall whiteoaks and magnolias , formed of sticks , slightly put together , of Spanish moss , and dried leaves . Only one brood is raised in the season . We have now , for the first time , an account of the breeding habits of the tree and the fox-colored sparrows , two beautiful wayfarers , which remain but little time with us , and yet are generally known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glowing in the setting sun ; and who does not know the voice of its tender and plaintive farewell ? Though they are so silent while with us , when they go to the northern regions they are overflowing with son , . " Would that I could convey to your mind the effect which it produced on my feelings , when wandering on the desolate shores of Labrador ! That I could intelligibly tell you , of the clear full notes of its unaffected warble , as it sat perched on the branch of some stunted fir ! There , for hours together , was continued the delightful serenade , which kept me lingering near the spot . The brilliancy and clearness of each note , as it flowed through the air , were so enchanting , the expression and emphasis of the song so powerful , that I never tired of listening . " During the breeding season , the plumage has a brighter color than with us . Its nest , which is large , is placed on the ground , amidst the moss or tall grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which entirely conceal it . The eggs are laid at the last of June , or the beginning of July . Mr. Audubon mentions the singular circumstance , that in an aviary in Charleston , some of these birds were killed , by what offender , it was for sometime difficult to discover ; till , one day , a mocking-bird was seen to alight on one of them , and peck it in such a manner as to cause its death . A blue-jay had been suspected of the crime , but so // far from being the murderer , the jay was at length one of the victims . The eggs of this species do not answer to the description of Richardson , neither are those of the tree-sparrow brown , as represented by Nuttall ; the latter are of a deep blue , so much resembling those of the chipping-sparrow , that it would be difficult to tell them apart . If any one suppose , as men are apt to do respecting pursuits which they never tried , that such facts as the author of this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book will undeceive him ; it is hard to verify matters of fact in an extensive library ; it is harder still to ascertain them in the open volume of nature . At Camden , in New Jersey , he watched the movements of the warbling-vireo , a sweet little bird , whose note is admired by many , to whom its appearance is unknown . lie saw two of them , evidently conversing on the subject of building in a poplar , and shortly after saw them making the frame-work of their nest , by disposing blades of grass in circles . On the second day , they began to weave in bits of hornet 's nest and corn-husks , pushing them between the rows of grass , and there securing them . On the third day , they were ahsent ; but on the fourth morning , he was awaked by their song , and saw them working extremely slender grasses within the frame . Wishing to know where they procured their materials , he followed them from tree to tree , toward a large meadow , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done for two or three days . On the seventh , the female spread wool and horse-hair for the lining , and the eighth was devoted to smoothing the inside . On the fifteenth , five little birds were standing on the borders of the nest ; and on the sixteenth , they quitted their home . All this time he had constantly observed their habits and motions . The feelin0s of the reader would probably be expressed in one of Dr. Johnson 's courteous remarks to a gentleman , who took much time in speaking of a flea . " Sir , if a thing so small has taken all this time , a larger animal would probably take you a year . " Still , these facts are well worth the labor and the time which it costs to ascertain them ; they afford materials for some of the most inspiring and intellectual contemplations on which the mind can dwell . But this devotion of Mr. Audubon to his favorite pursuit , must make immense demands upon the physical constitution . He exposes himself to all weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold nor the burning sun ; and when he has gained the object of his hot pursuit , sits down to study and draw it with an intenseness of application , which is even more exhausting than his active exertions. in Boston , he secured a noble specimen of the golden eagle . By the advice of his friend , Dr. Parkman , he attempted to destroy its life with the fumes of burning charcoal , to avoid injuring his plumage , and to spare him unnecessary pain . After the bird had been exposed to its effect for hours , Mr. Audubon opened the door of the little apartment in which the experiment was tried , and though the air was perfectly suffocating , saw the eagle " with his bright , unflinching eye , turned towards him as lively and vigorous as ever . " When he had succeeded in destroying it , for which purpose he was obliged to resort to other means at last , Mr. Audubon proceeded to draw it , and engaged in the employment so unremittingly , that he brought on a spasmodic affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after devoting so many years to this pursuit , we may suppose that less demand will in future be made upon his exertions . He is not the man who will ever rest , but he may continue the employment of his life less laboriously ; and when the work succeeds , as succeed it will , may find leisure to enjoy his well-earned and lasting fame . We trust that many of our readers will soon be familiar with the descriptions of Mr. Audubon ; the illustrations can be in the hands of but few ; but this is of the less consequence , as the originals are to be seen by all , and the great proportion of them save us the trouble of seeking them , by coming directly to us . The biography alone , will answer every purpose of aid , to those who desire to investi* , ate the subject for themselves . We consider it fortunate , that our ornithology should have fallen into the hands of such a man : his qualifications are great , and his success has been in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his courtesy secures all the information which others can give , and makes them regard it as a privilege to render him all the aid in their power . A lover of nature in his feeling , he dives fearlessly into the deepest forests , and wanders alone over the most savage regions of our country ; intelligent and observing , he discerns easily and rapidly whatever the naturalist desires to know : an accomplished artist , he strikes out with a bold pencil the spirited attitude and lifelike colors of the subjects of his art . And he has one advantage // which is greater than all beside . He loves the pursuit for its own sake . In former days , he offered to Wilson the valuable materials he had collected ; and when the offer , fortunately for the world , was declined , he supplied information to Bonaparte , Wilson 's able successor . It is evident , therefore , that he entered upon the pursuit because he loved it , and not with the view of erecting this monument to his own fame . indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many difficulties which he had to encounter . Nothing , short of an enthusiastic passion for his pursuit , would have borne him up to the eminence on which he now stands . He suffers nothing to draw him aside from it , and never disdains the most trifling information ; his only enjoyment seems to consist in gaining accessions of knowledge . We remember his asking letters from us , to some gentlemen of a certain place distinguished for intelligence and cultivation . We supplied them , with the assurance that he would highly enjoy the society in question . He replied , that be did not doubt it , hut his object was , not to enjoy pleasant society , but to see a stuffed owl . It is only as a literary production , that we undertake to criticise the work ; for on the subject of American birds , be doubtless knows more than any other man ; and they who come to criticise , will retire to be instructed . His style , though there is a forei0n aspect about it , is expressive , animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fine scenery . It is a style perfectly natural , and not at all in bondage to any rules of art : hut it tells us precisely what he means to say , and when he would make us share his own feelings , is evidently dictated and inspired by the heart . He has not the solemn enthusiasm of Wilson ; who found little sympathy in those about him , and therefore lived in a world of his own . Audubon 's passion for the science , is , as might he expected in a man familiar with the best aspects , indeed all the aspects of life , more easy , graceful , and such as others know better how to share . Perhaps this volume will not seem so attractive as the former , to most readers : but if it should be so , the explanation will be , that it is the second not the first . The public often uncharitably require , that the works of a popular writer should increase in interest , at least in geometrical progression : and if this unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , they are apt to say , that be has fallen below himself : but , we consider this volume as equal to the // first , which in our opinion is sufficient praise for any man 's ambition , and we shall look forward with impatience to its successor.
