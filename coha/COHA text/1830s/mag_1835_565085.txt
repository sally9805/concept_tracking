txt DEAR ladies , could I but look into your eyes , like a star-gazer , II might read secret intelligences . Will you read what I have written ? You love music and the dance , and are passionate for flowers ; you sometimes cherish singing-birds , and sometimes young kittens . You sigh by moonlight . Once or twice you have wept over a love-story in the annuals . Sleep falls upon you , like a lace veil , rich with gold-embroidered dreams , and is withdrawn as lightly , that you may see brighter dreams than them . // Maiden pursuits , and gentle meditations , the sunshine of maiden glee , and the summer-cloud of maiden sadness - these make up the tale of your happy years . You are in your spring , fair reader - are you not ? I am scarce in my summer-time . Yet , I have wandered through the world , till its xveary dust has settled on me ; and when I meet a bright , young girl , a girl of sixteen , with her untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fresh among faded things , I fancy that the gate of Paradise has been left ajar , and she has stolen out . Then I give a sigh to the memory of Rachel . Oh , Rachel ! How pleasant is the sound to me thy sweet , old scriptural name . As I repeat it , thoughts and feelings grow vivid again , which I deemed long ago forgotten . There they are , yet in my heart , like the initials and devices engraved by virgin fingers in the woo ( l of a young tree , remaining deep and permanent , though concealed hy the furrowed hark of after years . The hoy of fifteen was handsome ; though you would shake your heads , could you glance at the altered features of the man . And the hoy had lofty , sweet , and tender thoughts , and dim , hut glorious visions ; he was a child of poetry . Well ; at fifteen , I became a resident in a country village , more than a hundred miles from my home . The morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright as any in July - I ramhled into a wood of oaks , with a few walnut trees intermixed , forming the closest shade above our heads . The ground was rocky , uneven , overgrown with hushes and clumps of young saplings , and traversed only hy cattle-paths . The track , which I chanced to follow , led me to a crystal spring , with a border of grass , as freshly green as on May morning , and overshado*ved hy the limb of a great oak . One solitary sunbeam found its way down , and played like a gold-fish in the water . Prom my childhood , I have loved to gaze into a spring . The water filled a circular basin , small , but deep , and set round with stones , some of which were covered with slimy moss , the others naked , and of variegated hue , reddish , white , and brown . The bottom was covered with coarse sand , which sparkled in the lovely sunbeam , and seemed to illuminate the spring with an nnborrowed light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated the sand , hut without obscuring the fountain , or breaking the glassiness of its surface . It appeared as if some living creature were about to emerge , the Naiad of the spring , perhaps , in the shape of a beautiful young woman , with a gown of filmy water-moss , a belt of rainbow drops , and a cold , pure , passionless countenance . How would the beholder shiver , pleasantly , yet fearfully , to see her sitting on one of the stones , paddling her white feet in the ripples , and throwing up water , to sparkle in // th es un ! Wherever she laid her hands on grass and flowers , they would immediately he moist , as with morning dew . Then would she set about her labors , like a careful housewife , to clear the fountain of withered leaves , and hits of slimy wood , and old acorns from the oaks above , and grains of corn left by cattle in drinking , till the bri ht sand , in the bright water , were like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too near , he would find only the drops of a summer shower , glistening about the spot where he had seen her . Reclining on the border of grass , where the dewy goddess should have been , I bent forward , and a pair of eyes met mine within the watery mirror . They were the reflection of my own . Ii looked again , and lo another face , deeper in the fountain than my own image , more distinct in all the features , yet faint as thought . The vision had the aspect of a fair young girl , with locks of paly gold . A mirthful expression laughed in the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance , till it seemed just what a fountain would be , if , while dancing merrily into the sunshine , it should assume the shape of woman . Through the dim rosiness of the cheeks , J could see the brown leaves , the the slimy twigs , the acorhs , and the sparkling sand . The solitary sunheani was diffused among the golden hair , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round that head so beautiful My description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thus tenanted , and how soon it was left desolate . I breathed ; and there was the face ! I held my breath ; and it was gone Had it passed away , or faded into nothing ? I doubted whether it had ever been . My sweet readers , what a dreamy and delicious hour did I spend , where that vision found and left me For a long time , I sat perfectly still , waiting till it should reappear , and fearful that the slightest motion , or even the flutter of my breath , might frighten it away . Thus have I often started from a pleasant dream , and then kept quiet , in hopes to wile it back . Deep were my musings , as to the race and attributes of that etherial being . Had I created her ? Was she the daughter of my fancy , akin to those strange shapes which peep under the lids of children 's eyes ? And did her beauty gladden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or was she a water-nymph within the fountain , or fairy , or woodland goddess peeping over my shoulder , or the ghost of some forsaken maid , who had drowned herself for love ? Or , in good-truth , had a lovely girl , with a warm heart , and lips that would bear pressure , stolen softly behind me , and thrown her image into the spring ? I watched and waited , but no vision came again . I departed , but with a spell upon me , which drew me back , that same afternoon , // to the haunted spring . There was the water gushing , the sand sparkling , and the sunheam glimmering . There the vision was not , but only a great frog , the hermit of that solitude , who immediately withdrew his speckled snout and made himself invisible , all except a pair of long legs , beneath a stone . Methought he had a devilish look ! I could have slain him as an enchanter , who kept tbe mysterious beauty imprisoned in the fountain . Sad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and the church-spire , rose a little hill , and on its summit a group of trees , insulated from all the rest of the wood , with their own share of radiance hovering on them from the west , and their own solitary shadow falling to the east . The afternoon being far declined , the sunshine was almost pensive , and the shade almost cheerful ; glory and gloom were mingled in the placid light ; as if the spirits of the day and evening had met in friendship under those trees , and found themselves akin . I was admiring the picture , when the shape of a young girl emerged from behind the clump of oaks . My heart knew her ; it was the Vision ; but , so distant and etherial did she seem , so unmixed with earth , so imbued with the pensive glory of the spot where she was standing , that my spirit sunk within me , sadder than before . How could I ever reach her ! While I gazed , a sudden shower came pattering down upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightness , each rain-drop catching a portion of sunlight as it fell , and the whole gentle shower appearing like a mist , just substantial enough to bear the hurthen of radiance . A rainbow , vivid as Niagara 's , was painted in the air . Its southern limb came down before the group of trees , and enveloped the fair Vision , as if the hues of Heaven were the only garment for her beauty . When the rainbow vanished , she , who had seemed a part of it , was no longer there . Was her existence absorbed in nature 's loveliest phenomenon , and did her pure frame dissolve away in the varied light ? Yet , I would not despair of her return ; for , robed in the rainbow , she was the emblem of Hope . Thus did the Vision leave me ; and many a doleful day succeeded to the parting moment . By the spring , and in the wood , and on the hill , and through the village ; at dewy sunrise , burning noon , and at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sight , I sought her , but in vain . Weeks came and went , months rolled away , and she appeared not in them . I imparted my mystery to none , but wandered to-and-fro , or sat in solitude , like one that had caught a glimpse of Heaven , and could take no more joy on earth . I withdrew into an inner world , where my thoughts lived and breathed , and the Vision in the midst of them . Without intending it , I became at once the // author and hero of a romance , conjuring up rivals , imagining events , the actions of others and my own , and experiencing every change of passion , till jealousy and despair had their end in bliss . Oh , had I the burning fancy of my early youth , with manhood 's colder gift , the power of expression , your hearts , sweet ladies , should flutter at my tale In the middle of January , I was summoned home . The day before my departure , visiting the spots which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a frozen bosom , and nothing but the snow , and a glare of winter sunshine on the hill of the rainbow . Let me hope , ' thought I , or my heart will be as icy as the fountain , and the whole world as desolate as this snowy hill . ' Most of the day was spent in preparing for the journey , which was to commence at four o'clock the next morning . About an hour after supper , when all was in readiness , I descended from my chamber to the sitting-room , to take leave of the old clergyman and his family , with whom I had been an inmate . A gust of wind blew out my lamp as I passed through the entry . According to their invariable custom , so pleasant a one when the fire blazes cheerfully , the family were sitting in the parlor , with no other light than what came from the hearth . As the good clergyman 's stipend compelled him to use all sorts of economy , the foundation of his fires was a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoulder away , from morning till night , with a dull warmth and no flame . This evening , the heap of tan was newly put on , and surmounted with three sticks of red oak , full of moisture , and a few pieces of dry pine , that had not yet kindled . There was no light , except the little that came sullenly from two half-burnt brands , without even glimmering on the andirons . But I knew the position of the old minister 's arm-chair , and also where his wife sat , with her knitting-work , and how to avoid his two daughters , one a stout country lass , and the other a consumptive girl . Groping through the gloom , I found my own place next to that of the son , a learned collegian , who had come home to keep school in the village , during the winter vacation . I noticed that there was less room than usual , to-night , between the collegian 's chair and mine . As people are always taciturn in the dark , not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the stillness but the regular click of the matron 's knitting-needles . At times , the fire threw out a brief and dusky gleam , which twinkled on the old man 's glasses , and hovered doubtfully round our circle , but was far too faint to portray* the individuals who composed it . Were we not like ghosts ? Dreamy as the scene was , might it not be a type of the mode in which departed people , who had known and loved each other here , would hold communion in // eternity ? We were aware of each other 's presence , not by sight , nor sound , nor touch , but by an inward consciousness . Would it not be so among the dead ? The silence was interrupted by the consumptive daughter , addressing a remark to some one in the circle , whom she called Rachel . Her tremulous and decayed accents were answered by a single word , but in a voice that made me start , and bend towards the spot whence it had proceeded . Had I ever heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rouse up so many old recollections , or mockeries of such , the shadows of things familiar , yet unknown , and fill my mind with confused images of ber features who had spoken , though buried in the gloom of the parlor ? Whom had my heart recognized , that it throbhed so ? I listened , to catch her gentle breathing , and strove , by the intensity of my gaze , to picture forth a shape where none was visible . Suddenly , the dry pine caught ; the fire blazed up with a ruddy glow ; and where the darkness had been , there was she - the Vision of the Fountain ! A spirit of radiance only , she had vanished with the rainboxv , and appeared again in the fire-light , perhaps to flicker with the blaze , and be gone . Yet , her cheek was rosy and life-like , and her features , in the bright warmth of the room , were even sweeter and tenderer than my recollection of them . She knew me ! The mirthful expression , that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I beheld her faint beauty in the fountain , was laughing and dimpling there now . One moment , our glance mingled - . the next , down rolled the heap of tan upon the kindled wood - and darkness snatched away that daughter of the light , and gave her back to me no more ! That is all , fair ladies . There is nothing more to tell . For , why must the simple mystery be revealed , that Rachel was the daughter of the village Squire , and had left home for a boardingschool , the morning after I arrived , and returned the day before my departure ? If I transformed her to an angel , it is what every youthful lover does for his mistress . Therein consists the essence of my story . But , slight the change , sweet maids , to make angels of **25;934;TOOLONG Music was now banished to the church ; and , proscribed like the Christians , it was heard , at the still hour of midnight , in the caverns and tombs , where they concealed themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the Roman songs ; and we may form a tolerably correct idea of the ancient vocal music , from some of the Catholic chants . As the Christians gave up the use of musical instruments , however , the art soon fell into great confusion , and was well-nigh lost , when St. Ambrose , of Milan , appeared . He reviewed it , and made great improvement in the science , by the introduction of rhythm , or equal division of time , instead of the irregular chant of the Romans . Pope Gregory , however , who lived in the fifth century , seems to have established the foundation of church music , as it now exists . He began by improving the manner of writing it ; the Romans had employed fifteen letters , to express the notes ; be reduced the number to seven , as they now stand : but , as the notes were not placed on lines , as at present , he used capital letters for the first octave , small ones for the second , and double letters for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now common among us , and is called , from him , the Gregorian chant : it was borrowed from the ancient music . This pope also established singing-schools in Rome , in which orphan children were supported and instructed for his chapel . With the spread vf Christianity , music was extended to Germany , France , and England ; and Gregory supplied performers for all these countries . In the ninth century , great improvement was made in the art , by placing marks over the letters to indicate whether they were to be sung loud or soft : the five lines were also introduced about this time , to mark more distinctly the intervals of sound , though the letters still continued to be used . Guido Aretinc* now appeared , and did much to improve the art . He was the frst to make use of semitones ; he adopted the written notes , nearly as we have them , instead of letters ; he invented several instruments , and is thought to have discovered counter-point , or harmonic chords . From this time , music was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , with the parallel lines , the divisions of bars or measures , and the characters which represent let* ters . Notwithstanding the efforts of numerous composers , however , the art seems to have made little progress from the time of Guido down to the sixteenth century . A French writer observes , that , until the middle of the sixteenth century , music // was only a tissue of harmonious sounds , almost destitute of any perceptible melody . In the fifteenth , and the earlier part of the following century , the professors , in order to render their masses more agreeable , composed them upon the air of some popular song ; ( a practice not altogether abandoned in our day . ) The studied singularity of the middle age , ' ( says the same writer ) led other masters to write their sacred music according to the cast of dice ; each number thus obtained had musical passages which corresponded to it . ' At length , Palestrina appeared . This immortal genius , to whom we owe modern melody , shook off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air , grave indeed , but continued and perceptible ; and his music is still performed in St. Peter 's , at Rome . About the middle of the sixteenth century , the composers had taken such a fancy to fugues and canons , and collected these figures in such a singular manner , in their works for the church , that , during the greater part of that period , this pious music was extremely ridiculous . This abuse , after a length of time , excited the complaints of the devout ; and it was often pro* posed to banish music from the churches . In short , Marcellus II. , who occupied the papal chair , in 1555 , was on the point of issuing the decree of suppression , when Palestrina entreated his holiness to hear a mass which he had composed . The pope having consented , the young musician caused to be performed before him a mass for six voices , which appeared so beautiful and so full of dignity , that the pontiff , instead of putting his project into execution , ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chapel . The mass in question is still extant , and is known by the name of Pope Marcello 's Mass . ' The composers of church music in Italy , since the days of Palestrina , have followed nearly in his footsteps ; of all these , Gregorio Allegri is the most remarkable , having composed the celebrated . Miserere , which is sung once every year in the pope 's chapel , at Rome . This is , undoubtedly , the most powerful music ever composed . It is intended to commemorate the awful period which elapsed between the death and the resurrection of our Saviour - the earth wrapt in gloom , and man bereft of hope ! The Miserere is an agonized cry for mercy from a despairing world . It is sung at night ; and the chapel is dimly lighted by a few xvax candIes , which throw their glare upon the painting of the Last Judgement , ' ( by Michael Angelo ) above the altar . As the service proceeds , the tapers are extinguished , one after the other ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted with terrific power , by Michael Angelo , is increased in awfulness , when they are dimly seen by the pale light of the last taper . ' After a deep and most impressive pause of silence , ' // ( says a recent traveler ) the solemn Jlliserere commenced ; and never , by mortal ear , was heard a strain of such powerful , such heart-moving pathos . The accordant tones of an hundred human voices - and one that seemed more than human - ascended together to Heaven , for mercy to mankind , for pardon to a guilty and sinning world . It had nothing in it of this earth - nothing that breathed the ordinary feelings of our nature . It seemed as if every sense and power had been concentrated into that plaintive expression of lamentation , of deep suffering and supplication , which possessed the soul . It was the strain that disembodied spirits might have used , who had just passed the boundaries of death , and sought relief from the mysterious weight of wo , and the tremblings of mortal agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave . It was the music of another state of being . It lasted till the shadows of evening fell deeper ; and the red , dusky glare , as it issued stronger . from the concealed recess whence the singing proceeded , shed a partial but strong light upon the figures near it . It ceased . A priest , with a light , moved across the chapel , and carried a book to the officiating cardinal , who read a few words in an awful and impressive tone . Then again the light disappeared ; and the last , the most entrancing harmony arose , in a strain that might have moved Heaven itself-a deeper , more pathetic sound of lamentation than mortal voices ever breathed . Its effects , upon the minds of those that beard it , were almost too powerful to be borne ; and nevernever can be forgotten . ' In speaking of sacred music , we must not omit to give some account of the oratorio , or spiritual drama . Its origin may be be traced to the Christian pilgrims , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in songs and choruses , the life and sufferings of the Saviour . As early as the year 1243 , a piece , of this nature , was performed at Padua . St. Philip , of Neri , however , is considered the founder of the oratorio , He was born in Florence , in the year 1515 , and first established regular oratorios in 1540 , with the design of directing the public taste to religious subjects . They were , at first , little more than a succession of hymns , unaccompanied by instruments . The recitative was invented some time afterwards ; but , at first , the actor related the story to the audience , singing only detached portions . In 1590 , the recitative was first used in oratorios . Choruses were next introduced ; and the words and music continued to improve gradually , down to the eighteenth century , when Handel appeared , and , devoting all his powers to this branch of music , carried it to a degree of perfection which has hardly been surpassed . The great characteristic of Handel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians ; and his lyric flights are unequaled. // His choruses , to borrow the language of Milton , are like the sound , Symphonious of ten thousand harps , that tuned Angelic harmonies . ' All things considered , however , Haydn 's Creation ' is probably the most remarkable and perfect oratorio , that was ever composed . In this wonderful piece , the composer has attempted to represent , by music , the creation of the world and its inhabitants , as described in Genesis . The overture portrays the wildness of chaos . The earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep . And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters . ' The music is perfectly wild and mournful , and destitute of harmony or melody ; and expresses , by its strange discords , the painfulness of chaotic confusion . It falls upon the ear , a dull , frightful mass , which we in vain endeavor to throw off . The tones seem lifeless , but vast and terrific . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very bottom ; the spirit is moving upon the face of the deep . Rapid passages dart , like flashes of lightning , through the scale , and occasional gleams of harmony are caught , but quickly overpowered by the prevailing confusion . The soun*s picture to us , most forcibly , the vast immeasurable abyss , Outrageous as a sea-dark , wasteful , wild . Up from the bottom turned , by furious winds And surging waves , as mountains to assault Heaven 's height , and with the centre mix the poles . ' The closing notes are in the same wild strain as the commencement . The author of a life of Haydn analyzes the piece in these words : Music reappears , in all her charms , when the angels beoin to relate the great work of creation . ' We soon come to the b passage which describes the creation of light . And God said let there be light , and there was ligbt . ' It must be confessed , that nothing can have a grander effect . Before this fiat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he introduces the unison , and the piano still growing softer , as the suspended cadence approaches ; at last , this cadence bursts forth in the most sonorous manner , at the words , and there *vtts light . ' This burst of the whole orchestra , in the resounding key of c , accompanied with all the harmony possible , and prepared by the gradual fading of the sounds , actually produces upon us , at a first representation , the effect of a thousand torches suddenly flashing light into a dark cavern . The faithful angels afterwards describe , in a fugued passage , the rage of Satan and his accomplices , precipitated into an abyss of torments , by the hand of him whom // they hate . Here , Milton has a rival . Haydn employs profusely all that is disagreeable in the enharmonic genus ; horrible discords , strange modulations , and chords of the diminished seventh . The harshness of the words further increases the horrors of this chorus . We shudder ; but the music begins to describe the beauties of the new-created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned the world ; and our minds are at length tranquillized . You next pass to the rising of the sun , which appears , for the first time , in all the pomp of the most magnificent spectacle which the eye of man can contemplate . It is followed by the rising of the moon , which silently advances through the clouds , and illumines the night with her silver radiance . The second part opens , with an air , majestic in the beginning , afterwards gay , and tender towards the conclusion , describing the creation of the birds . The different characters of this air well represent the audacious eagle , which , just created , seems to spurn the earth and dart towards the sun ; the gaiety of the lark , the amorous doves , and lastly , the plaintive nightingale . The accents of the songstress of night are imitated as near to nature as possible . A beautiful trio represents the effect produced by the immense whale , as he agitates the waves . A well-executed recitative shows us the generous courser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger , rapidly traversing the forests and gliding between the trees ; the fierce lion roars at a distance , while the gentle sheep , fearless of danger , are peacefully feeding . An air , full of power and dignity , announces the creation of man . The movement of the harmony corresponds with the words - Behold ! a man he stands  --  the king and lord of all . ' The music increases , in force and elevation , at each of these last words , and makes a superb cadence on the king and lord of all . ' It is impossible not to be struck with it . The second part of this air describes the creation of the charming Eve , and gives us an idea of Adam 's happiness . It is universally esteemed the finest part of the Creation . ' The third part of the Creation ' is the shortest . It is a beau* tiful translation of the most pleasing part of Milton 's poem . Haydn paints the transports of the first and most innocent attachments , the tender converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude towards the infinite goodness which created them , and which seems to have created for them all nature . The most ardent joy breathes in every line of the allegro . There is also apparent , in this part , a devotion , of a more than ordinary kind , mingled with terror . Lastly , a chorus ( partly fugued and // partly ideal ) terminates this astonishing production , with the same fire and majesty with which it commenced . We shall now proceed to give some account of the opera . The literal signification of the word is , a work ; and the name is not ill-chosen to express the combination of arts , which appears in the musical drama . It is a perfect work , and addresses itself to the entire capacities of our nature . It is founded upon the principle , that there is an harmony between the fine arts ; that painting , sculpture , music and poetry , address themselves , with a kindred power , to the better feelings , and though each takes a different path , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the mind . The opera is the union of all these ; combining music , poetry , acting , and scenic decoration ; and offers more , to delight the senses and interest the mind , than any other representation . The origin of the opera , like that of the oratorio , may be found in the religious feeling prevalent in the time of the crusades . The passion of Christ , the adoration of the Virgin and the angels , and sometimes of the martyrs , were the subjects of these representations . We learn from Tiraboschi , that the monks of the city of Treves were required to furnish , annually , two clergymen , well-skilled in music , to represent the annunciation , by personating the angel and the Virgin ; and we have already seen that a religious drama was performed at Padua , in the thirteenth century . From religious subjects , others , of a less spiritual nature , were undertaken . In 1475 , Politian produced a sort of musical drama , upon the story of Orpheus ; and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sacrifice , ' which was performed , with great applause , before king Henry III. , of France , when he visited Venice , in 1574 . Thus far , however , the music consisted entirely of sacred songs , or the common ballads of the country . No composer had as yet written expressly for the opera . In the year 1594 , three young noblemen , of Florence , made the attempt to revive the chanting declamation of the Greek drama , and employed Rinuccini , the poet , to write a piece on the story of Daphne , which was set to music by Pen , the most distinguished composer of the day , and performed by the three young men , and one or two friends , in the Corsi palace . The orchestra consisted only of a lute , harpsichord , viol de Gamba , and harp ; no airs were introduced , but the piece consisted entirely of the recitative . Though such a play , at this day , would be considered intolerably dull , it nevertheless produced a great sensation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet composed , four years afterwards , a drama for music , called Euridice , ' which was represented in the theatre of Florence , in honor of the marriage of Henry IV. , of France , with Mary de Medici . In 1606 , the first musical drama was acted at // Rome , by Quagliatie , who , with four or five companions , performed , during the carnival , in a wagon , draxvn about the streets . About nine years afterwards , the opera first appeared in Naples . For the next half century , little attention was paid to the music of the opera , which degenerated , rather than improved ; the scenery , however , was made very magnificent . The opera was now carried into other countries . Cardinal Mazarin established it in France , in the year 1646 ; yet , it is probable that the French paid more attention to the decoration of the stage than to the music , down to a late period ; for Goldoni , who visited Paris , in 1761 , declares that the French opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ears . In Germany , carnival-plays had been chanted as early as 1567 ; but the first regular opera , in that country , was performed in *t678 ; the subject was Adam and Eve . The Italian opera was introduced into England in the seventeenth century , and greatly improved by Handel . The birth of this distinguished man forms an era in the history of music . Haydn said of him , he is the father of us all ; ' and indeed , succeeding composers , though they may have improved the art , have not made any material changes . We have said that an opera is an entire work , combining more attractions than any other kind of representation . To illustrate this , we shall give an analysis of one of the most perfect operas ever composed , as performed in Paris . It is called Robert le IDiable , ' or , Robert the Devil ; and the story is as follows . Robert is the son of a princess of Burgundy , who , being knighted , sets off in quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend and brother in arms . Bertram is , in reality , a friend , and the father of Robert he is permitted to wander on the earth for a certain number of years , at the expiration of which , if he can not persuade some mortal to covenant his soul to the infernal powers , he is doomed to return to his torment . Robert , his own son , is the individual whom he has fixed upon to substitute instead of himself in his infernal abode ; and the play turns upon his attempts to induce Robert to make a covenant with the devil . The music of the overture is majestic , wild , and mournful and the drop-scene , which covers a stage large enough to contain almost any other theatre , represents a confused and frightful mass of precipitous rocks ; a vast and impenetrable abyss yawns open in the midst , over which a dusky fiend hovers , with outspread wings . All seems to announce the sublime and awful scenes which are to ensue . Robert has fallen desperately in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the prize of the conqueror , in a tournament about to be held at Palermo . The first scene represents a large number of knights , carousing in front of their tents , near // the city , among whom are Robert and Bertram . A young girl is presently brought iu by their pages , and is rescued from violence by Robert , who recognizes her as his adopted sister . She has come to announce to him the death of his mother , and brings him a letter containing her last advice . He is overcome with affliction at the news , and can not bear to read the letter , which he entreats his sister , Alice , to preserve for him . Bertram tries to console him , and , under pretence of diverting his mind , engages him in gaming , with the other knights . Robert loses , and Bertram advises him to double the stake ; still he loses , and again doubles ; the fiend is at his elbow , and governs the chances , so that they are constantly against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose - his hags of money , his ingots of gold , his jewels , the diamond chain about his neck , and finally , his horse and armor , and his golden-hilted sword , with the rich sheath . He is thus left destitute , and , instead of the wealthy knight , is an insi6nificant beggar . The fiend now expects to seduce him by the promise of wealth ; but the princess , who is in love with him , provides him with a horse and armor , that he may fight for her . Meantime , a different scene takes place . The stage represents a wild and mountainous country ; on the right hand are seen the ruins of a classic temple ; all appears desolate and lonely ; and a rude cross , erected among the rocks , indicates that some hapless traveler has been murdered on the spot . The lover of Alice appears , having promised to meet her here ; but Bertram presently comes in , and , wishing to be alone , persaades the young man to go to a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treasure . Bertram comes to meet the spirits , with whom he is associated , and to do homage to the infernal king . He hears their shouts in the caverns under the earth , and they call upon him to descend . Trembling , he obeys , and disappears amidst the ruins of the temple . In the meantime , Alice arrives , and is greatly disappointed at not finding her lover . All is stillness ; she calls him by name , hut no answer is returned ; nothing is heard but her own voice , long echoed among the mountains . The sky now becomes overcast ; the distant roar of the storm , and the low mutter of thunder are heard from mountain to . mountam . Alice listens in dismay ; she is distressed at the absence of her lover , and frightened at the loneliness and gloom of the place . While she stands thus perplexed , the silence is broken by a shout from under the earth , so loud and terrific , that it seems as if all the spirits of darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiends , to whom Bertram has descended . No words can adequately describe this infernal music ; it is a strange mix* ture of utter remorse and agony with wild and reckless joy* // A thousand voices appear to join in the frightful chorus , that they may dim the sense of xvo , in the uncouth riot . The awful sound is heard but a moment , and again-all is silent . Alice is horror-struck , but can hardly believe her senses . Again the terrible chorus bursts forth from the earth , and she , all trembling , approaches the mouth of a cavern , in the ruins , whence the sound issues . At that moment , flames blaze forth , and Bertram rushes out , pale and terrified by the fury of his kindred spirits . Alice screams at the sight of him , and swoons at the foot of the cross . Bertram rouses her ; he is now betrayed ; she knows his true character . By threatening to destroy her lover , he obliges her to take an oath , not to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches ; he has been defeated in the tournament by a friend , whom Bertram sent in the place of his rival , and is now in utter despair ; he believes that his mistress is lost to him forever . Bertram confronts him , and still promises him aid . He wishes to strengthen his power over him , by involving him in crime ; for he has been told that , if he can not induce Robert to sign the covenant before midnight , he must himself return to his sufferings . The scene now changes , and the theatre represents the ruins of a convent . On one side is a long cloister , the arches of which open in a roofless and ruinous church , which is filled with graves . Various tombs are seen in the cloister . Their form , according to the fashion of the times , is square ; and on a slab , raised two or three feet from the ground , reposes a marble statue of the person buried , shrouded in the grave-clothes , the hands folded in prayer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosalia , bearing in the hand a magic branch . It is night , and the soft light of the moon is poured on the broken walls and columns of the church , and streams through the arches of the cloister . Heavy denunciations are pronounced against the sacrilegious person who shall pluck the branch from the hand of the saint . Bertram , therefore , wishes to make Robert to do it . He has already told him , that the possession of the branch will ensure him success ; and he is now going to summon the spirits of the nuns from purgatory , that they may persuade Robert to commit the crime . Bertram appears at the extreme end of the cloister ; the music is slow , soft , and very solemn , and the trumpet is heard summoning the spirits from their graves . The enchanter commands them to appear . Slowly , the marble slabs , on which the statues repose , rise up , and the forms , shrouded in their winding-sheets , step from their resting-place - at first , almost inanimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more instinct with life , and finally advancing , with slow and measured step , towards the masterspirit who has awakened them . Still the trumpet pours forth its // solemn notes , and hosts of spirits come flitting through the arches ; every grave yields up its tenant , and all bow before the enchan* ter and receive his commands . The slow and solemn music is now changed to a livelier strain the nuns fling off their shrouds and appear as beautiful girls . Some of them set up an altar to their master , and offer incense to him others , in reckless mirth , throw dice , and gamble in their own tombs . Robert appears in the midst , and a bevy of them dance round him , lead him to the tomb of St. Rosalia , and endeavor to persuade him to pluck the branch . He starts - for the statue reminds him of his mother ; he is horror-struck , and retires from the tomb ; but the false spirits again gather round him , and lead him towards it , till at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , he plucks the branch . At that moment , the wild shout of the demons is heard , with the clanking of chains* and the nuns sink lifeless into their graves , above which the most hideous monsters hover , and seem to exult over their victims . Robert has now possession of the branch , and bears it into the court of Sicily , where the king , with all his nobles , and the rival of Robert , are assembled . He xvavcs the branch over them , and all , save the princess , fall into a magic sleep , from which they can only be awakened by his breaking the branch . The princess persuades him to do this , for she will never be won by such arts ; in despair he breaks it , and the sleepers are roused from their lethargy . The next scene represents the vestibule of the cathedral of Palermo . Bertram meets Robert there . The hour of midnight is approaching , and he knows , that if the league is not signed before that , his doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything , if he will but comply . Robert is almost persuaded , when a strain of soft and delicious music comes stealing on his ear , and seems to recall him to virtue . It is the organ of the cathedral , and the vesper-chant . Again Bertram renews his agonized entreaties ; he reveals the sacred name of father ; he kneels , he weeps , he drags his victim away from the influence of the holy music . At this moment , Alice rushes in ; she implores Robert to read his mother 's letter before he yields ; he is hardly willing , but at length complies with her entreaties . He there reads , that Bertram is a fiend , who had ruined her , and who is plotting his own destruction , He is saved ; the cathedral bell is heard slowly tolling twelve , and Bertram sinks into the yawning earth in a shroud of fire . At the close of this act , the drop-scene indicates that the frightful passages are terminated . It represents the Holy City , in all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square , and lengthened colonades , stretching away as far as the eye can reach . A rainbow spans it , from the right hand to // the left , with its glittering arch , on whose summit stands the angel of mercy , crowned with a diadem of stars . The closingscene represents the wedding procession . The story of Robert 's temptation and dangers has reached the king , and he has betrothed his daughter to him . The gorgeous train is seen entering the cathedral ; a thousand wax-lights shed their glare upon the scene ; boys , in robes of white , are swinging their censers , from which rises the smoke of incense ; and the loud organ is heard , with the full choir chanting hymns of praise for victory over the wiles of the enemy . We have thus endeavored to give a sketch , imperfect though it be , of the developement of this art . There is one consideration , which appears to invest the subject with additional interest for us ; it is , that music has probably arrived at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present age are proverbial . We are constantly reminded of the great poets and artists of by-gone times ; and their works are contrasted with the degenerate efforts of modern days . True , poetry , architecture , painting , and sculpture , reached their zenith ages since ; but it has been reserved to our time to witness the perfection of one of the fine arts , which ranks with the highest . We live in the golden age of music ; it will probably never be advanced farther ; and even now , perhaps , the symptoms of decline in the art , may be discerned . Handel and Mozart and Haydn and Beethoven are gone ; and , though their halo still hovers round us , we know that it must finally depart . In another century , their works will be held up as inimitable models . But , while we are yet lingering within the verge of the magic circle , from which the irresistible sweep of time is hurrying us , we may be pardoned if we occasionally turn back , With wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory we are leaving.
