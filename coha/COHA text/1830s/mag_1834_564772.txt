txt It is such an elevation or enlargement of soul , as renders it capable of every thing noble in sentiment , emotion , or exertion , and takes a variety of names , according to the various objects and occasions ; such as courage , fortitude , independence , self-command , and generosity . There is a courage , that implies no magnanimity , that implies , indeed , no mind at all . It is no manly virtue , to rush blindly on death , or to sacrifice things of inestimable worth to those which are of little or no value . Impetuosity is seldom connected with true greatness of mind . The true hero understands perfectly what he is about . He knows the danger be has to meet ; he has compared that danger with the value of the object in view , and he has deliberately resolved to incur the danger for the attainment of the object . All animals are , in their very nature , more or less subject to the influence of fear They not only fear those things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hurtful , but they seem to have many instinctive apprehensions of unknown evils . Almost every species of animal , and , among others , the infant man , discovers symptoms of terror , almost as soon as he is born . In some of the brute creation , this native timidity is soon removed , by an early consciousness of superior powers , or means of defence . In some others , it gradually gives place to the resentful passions , or to the influence of combative habits , while in the weak and defenceless , it continues through life , and is rather increased than diminished , by familiarity with danger . In our OWfl species , in adult men and women , may be found many instances of mere animal timidity or courage , essentially the same with those which are observed with other creatures around us ; fears , which a little exercise of mind would dissipate or surmriount ,  --  or gratuitous exposures , which are equally unreasonable . rro a groundless timidity , we give , by common consent , the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same term might , with equal propriety , be applied to groundless courage ,  --  to that bravery which is regardless of probable consequences . As already remarked , the courage becoming a human being , is a mental quality . It is not the offspring of brutal force . It is not inspired by furious passion . It is open-eyed , circumspect , cool , and calculating . It explores the path it is about to tread , and hence it proceeds , with firm and intrepid steps . It is intimately allied with another virtue , of which we must now speak , and without which the courage of the hero would degenerate into rashness , or sink into despondence . Fortitude is the virtue most inseparably connected with genuine courage , and perhaps equally entitled to the character of magnanimity . As courage inclines us to meet those approaching evils , which might for a time be avoided , fortitude enables us to endure those , which , for the present , can neither be avoided nor resisted , and this may require a force of mind far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most brilliant achievements of courage . If we instinctively retreat from approaching dangers , it is equally natural for us to shrink from the immediate grasp of pain , which , to mere animal feeling , becomes every moment more intolerable . There is , however , a state of mind , which is superior to bodily suffering ,  --  // which endures with composure those things which would be torture to others . In this state , the immortal nature within learns from experiment the extent of its own powers . It feels a kind of pride in its capacity for endurance ; and from that pride it may , perhaps , be said to derive new strength . To sustain itself in this posture , however , it must have that hope , which is inseparable from the human mind , so long as it continues what it was intended to be . If the present be painful , it flees from the present , and dwells in the future ; and , in the fulness of pleasurable anticipations , becomes , in some measure , insensible to immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of darkness and distress , are cheered by the prospect of a happy result . Courage is held in salutary check , means of relief are provided and arranged in proper order , and opportunities for effectual efforts are waited for with an eye that is equally watchful and patient . Such fortitude has often triumphed over dangers and sufferings , which premature resistance would have multiplied and strengthened . Another form in which magnanimity presents itself to our contemplation , is that of independence , or the personal prerogative , which belongs to every human being ; the right of thinking and acting , within a certain sphere , for himself . This sphere is , in most cases , circumscribed by very narrow limits ; but , within these limits , every one may consider himself an absolute sovereign , equal to the greatest potentate on earth , and there is something noble in maintaining this exclusive right . Though one man may be intimately acquainted with many things , of which another has no conception , arid though one may be clothed with an authority , or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor is wholly excluded , there are things , in which the illiterate and the learned , the weak and the mighty , stand on the same ground ; in which the peasant has the same assurance with the philosopher , and is called to duties and privileges equally honorable with those of the monarch . There is , indeed , no magnanimity in arrogance , in aspiring above our proper station , in assuming that which belongs to another ; but there is something great in the clear discernment and steady pursuit of that course , which has been marked out for us by the finger of Him , in whose presence all mankind are equal . This independent spirit is , indeed , liable to be confounded with obstinacy , as well as with arrogance or self-sufficiency it is , however , essentially different from all . It is , in its very nature , dignified and ennobling . It is neither contemptuous nor vain . It is respectful , but not fawning . Though not regardless of the approbation or applause of others , it is chiefly concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firmer ground of satisfaction , than the good opinion of the world . In proportion as real liberty prevails , this magnanimous spirit will become the ornament , the glory , or the happiness of men in every rank and condition . Again , the magnanimity we are consideriiig , is apparent in that self-command , which is the duty and the privilege of every human being ; that control , which reason was intended to exercise over all the animal propensities . The birds and beasts are gove rued by their appetites and passions . The same is generally true of infants and young children , and the history of the world proves that multitudes of // those , who have attained to the age and stature of men , are , in this respect , little better than children or brutes . From defect of education , or want of personal attention , their reason is feeble and irresolute ,  --  unable or indisposed to curb the angry passions , or the most inordinate desires . The prerogatives of human nature are lost ; the firm ground on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defence broken down , and all that remains of the soul , exposed to the most contemptible , as well as the most tremendous foes . How different the character and condition of those , who are more ambitious to govern the empire of their own hreasts , than to exercise any authority over their fellow-men ! - whose hearts respond to the words of Solomon , " He that is slow unto wrath is better than the mighty , and he that ruleth his spirit , than he that taketh a city ! " This greatness of mind does not , indeed , annihilate the animal desires , but , in the name of God himself it says to them , " Hitherto shall ye come , but no farther . " It does not extinguish the natural fire of passion . It is not insensible to injuries or affronts . It does not require the ocean of life to be in perpetual stagnation ; but , when the winds become too boisterous , it checks their impetuosity , and they subside into the gentle breezes , by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparably more dignity in sparing a fallen foe , and sometimes in pitying or disregarding one , who is still in arms , than there is in executing that dire revengo in which many other animals may rival man . For the present , we shall consider only one other form , in which magnanimity commands our admiration , and that is , generosity , or benevolence , acting on a large or extensive seale . All ordinary kindness , or benignity , partakes more of moral beauty than sublimity . Every smile of good-nature , every accent of love or compassion , is amiable and winning ; but , , as it costs little , it has no absorbing interest . There is , however , a generosity , so energetic and expansive , as tobe justly considered peculiar to great minds ; a generosity , which disregards personal ease and personal safety ; and , still more , the common calculations of self-interest , and is ready to make the most essential sacrifices for the good of others . This implies mind ,  - -  energy and enlargement of mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which constitutes the resemblance of man to Him , who is perfectly good , and , in that goodness , perfectly happy . Men of little minds seek for happiness in the gratification of appetite or personal vanity . The generous man has learned from experience , that the pleasures of doing , or even wishing good , are incomparably superior to those , which are derived from selfish exertions ; richer , purer , more lasting , and , in every view , more worthy of the heaven-born spirit . Such a mind dwells in a region too high for the vapors of envy or the clouds of discontent to reach . It expatiates in light , and , in its ethereal nature , seems destined to rise and expand with a kind of divinity , beyond all assignable bounds . Some have contended , that the magnanimous virtues are the peculiar glory of arms ; or , at least , that war is a school , in which they may be cultivated with the greatest success . That military men have sometimes been examples of courage , fortitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candQr will , probably , deny . // For most of these qualities , however , we should be more disposed to look among the sons of peace , in common occupations and pursuits . Courage may find exercises enough without wielding the weapons of death , or exposing itself on the field of blood . The ministers of police , while enforcing the laws of the state , are often called to show what manner of spirit they are og while they are required to meet danger , without that stimulus of public glory , to which the warrior frequently owes the reputation of courage . A variety of occurrences in private life invite , if they do not absolutely call us into great danger , and afford opportunities for heroic adventures . We may add , that there are dangers more appalling to many , than those , which threaten our limbs or our lives ; and the advocates of decency , propriety , truth , and virtue , may always find sufficient scope for the exercise of magnanimity in all the several forms in which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind is to be regarded , chiefly , as a moral quality ,  --  as relating more immediately to the affections than it does to the understanding . There is a connexion , however , between the heart and the head ,  --  between the moral and the intellectual state of a man . In one of our old books , it is said , " A man of understanding is of an excellent spirit . " While there is something noble and sublime in that comprehensive view , which penetrates a subject through and through at a glance , and discovers at once all its important relations , there is a kind of assurance inspired , that such an understanding will be combined with correspondent feeiings ,  --  with all that is practically noble and generous . Still , those who are intellectually great , are not always distinguished for sublimity in morals . In many instances , indeed , we have occasion to lament the reverse of this ; while , on the other hand , many , who have been little distinguished by their native powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial means of improvement , have shown degrees of magnanimity superior to those on which a flattering world has bestowed the name of greatness . There is one sentiment of which all human minds are susceptible , and which tends to put all men upon a level , in respect to the quality we are considering ; it is the sentiment of piety , or , more properly , perhaps , the principle of religious faith ; which is sublime in itself , while it inspires the soul with every other sublimity . The unlettered peasant , as well as the profoundest philosopher , can understand and feel what is meant by eternal existence , by almighty power , unerring wisdom , and perfect goodness ; and , while he believes himself under the protection of One , who unites in his character all these unbounded perfections , he can realize emotions , which the sublime language of inspiration itself can hardly express . " God is our refuge and strength , therefore will we not fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion , which can not be moved . " Although the fig-tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vines ; the labor of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stalls ; yet will I rejoice in the Lord , I will joy in the God of my salvation . " W.H.@@183068795.txt THE discovery of America , near the close of the fifteenth century , was the commencement of a wonderful train of events . The descriptions which we can gather of the opening of a new world , and of the consequent changes of the old world , infinitely surpass the utmost stretch of fiction , in their details and issues . The very act of commencing a voyage of discovery , when Europe had just emerged out of darkness , even without a single known island to steer for , is sublime . The pursuit of the plan , after struggling with countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we should now hardly trust ourselves in , a half a dozen leagues from our coast , brings the author of it before us in a picture of the highest moral sublimity . And such was Columbus , first and foremost in this spirit of maritime enterprise . It matters not that he mistook Cuba for a part of a great continent , in his first voyage , and that , in his third voyage , he touched at several places on the continent of America , without knowing that it was a continent . Though he died ignorant of these things , his glory , as a discoverer , is not the less real . It is desirable , indeed , to come at exact historical truth in these matters ; and we rejoice , therefore , that the order of discovery is now well settled . John and Sebastian Cabot , in the service of England , first reached the American continent , and the coast of the United States , 24th June , 1497 . The voyage was performed at their own expense , by which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the territory of North-America . What a prodigious change in the world 's affairs has since taken place so immense , that it seems almost incredible that the earth had been peopled for six thousand years . In the course of three centuries such advances have been made in every thing which the bulk of mankind think worth living for , not less than . in what relates tcr moral and intellectual elevation , that the previous long lapse of ages seems but the infancy of the world , from which the transition to manhood was comparatively but the work of a day . Providence appears to have conducted mankind to a new world as if for some great overturn in human affairs . By this means new political and social relations were von . VII . 22 // to be introduced ; the shackles of prejudice were to be weakened and broken ; minds , released from the bondage of old institutions , were to work more freely ; revolutions of feeling and opinion were to be produced ; and liberty was to gain a foot-hold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known and felt in the old world ; and indocile as it might be expected to be , and slow to learn as it has been , and could not fail to be , the effects of such lessons are still extending for good or ill ,  --  ultimately , we trust , for good . Mammon , the idol which has had so many worshipers in all classes , from crowned heads to bare feet , was not contemned in the times of the early voyagers in search of regions in the west . The noble-spirited men , who first projected these enterprises , and hazarded their lives in the execution of them , were not , indeed , stained by such idolatry . But it was otherwise with their sovereigns . When Ferdinand and Isabella secured to Columbus , in his first voyage , a tithe of all the profits that should accrue from it , nothing was added thereby to the zeal of Columbus , sanguine as might be his hopes of discovery and final wealth . To have received an outfit more suited to his undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , at the cost of four thousand pounds , would have cheered his heart and have enabled him more effectually to gain the favor and active cooperation of his crew . After his return from his second voyage , during which he suffered unjustly in his reputation , at home , it was by the specimens of glittering gold , that he brought with him , more than by his vindication of himself , that his sovereign 's countenance was irradiated . Had it not been for this , the " high admiral of all the seas , " and the " viceroy of all the islands and continents " that he should discover , might have striven in vain to appease the wrath of a disappointed master . Henry VII . furnished only one of the six ships for the voyage of the Cabots ; but his exactions , in regard to the profits , extended only to one fifth part . In Ralegh 's scheme for making discoveries and settlements in those parts of North-America , which had not been subjected to any European power , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gold was the great lure held out to the queen and all concerned . And when , after his misfortunes and the ill-success of his colony , he assigned his patent , he reserved to himself a portion of the gold and silver ores to be discovered . The prospect of a golden age seems to have delighted the crowned heads of Europe and some of the distinguished subjects , in the time of the early voyagers to the west , as much as it now does the sovereign of these United States and his devoted retainers . Riches , however , did not constitute the only motive with those , who engaged in early attempts at colonization . A bold and undefined spirit of adventure , such as is apt to take possession rather of those who have little to lose , than of the affluent , or even of those who are at ease in their fortunes , was beginning to work . The spirit was not that spirit of avarice , which , though insatiable , stakes nothing upon chance . It was cheered , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only accessory . There seems to have been much of public and adventurous spirit , mixed with the hope of personal advancement and glory , in the plans and achievements of Ralegh . Be these things , however , as they may , he stands forth pre-eminent // among the early promoters of colonization in the United States . Though baffled in his schemes , he had shown what might be accomplished by due providence and foresight , mingled with energy and zeal . His , like other first attempts to plant colonies , furnish little else than tales of misery , starvation , massacre , and death . It was easy for those , who came after him , to see the defects of his plans , and to supply them ; to find how he fell short of success , and to provide against like failure . This , however , was less perfectly accomplished than might have been expected ; for the commencement of the permanent colony in Virginia , in 1606 , was , neither in the number nor in the character of the emigrants , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been for one man , John Smith , who seemed to be equal to every occasion , whether it required him to control the refractory , to encourage the desponding , to task the idle , or to teach the unskillful , the colony would have utterly perished . As it was , notwithstanding the repeated additions to the number of colonists during the first five years of the existence of the settlement at Jamestown , yet , at the close of that period , 1611 , it consisted of only two hundred men . In that year there were large accessions to their number ; good government was instituted ; private property was allotted to individuals , and mutually respected by them ; and industry succeeded , to the reluctant and inefficient labor , which was performed when the colonists had all things in common . For several succeeding years the prosperity of the colony was fluctuating , till , in 1619 , it received a new impetus by the establishment of the colonial assembly , and by the exportation from the mother country of " ninety agreeable females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tenants of the company , or to men who were able to support them , and who willingly defrayed the costs of their passage , which were rigorously demanded . " In the progress of colonization , the love of liberty manifested itself by rapid gradations . Virginia , the " old dominion , " as it is still proudly called , early secured to itself a pure democratic government , for common municipal purposes , in the assembly of the whole people . The colonial assembly , which was afterwards instituted and elected by the people , always strove to exercise its rights to the greatest extent , and was not scrupulous about encroaching upon the prerogatives of the crown , or creating prerogatives of its own . When opportunity occurred , the people chose their own governor ; and when they could not endure one appointed by the crown , the voice of the same people compelled the council to eject him from office . Such was the fact in the case of the king 's governor , John Harvey , in 1635 . The early colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings equally summary as those of the Virginians , and more severe , were had in the expulsion of Clayborne from his official supremacy . While the assembly acknowledged the duty of allegiance to the king of England , it claimed for itself " all such powers as may be exercised by the commons of England . " Connected with the prevailing spirit of political liberty in the infant colonies , was that also of religious freedom . Toleration , indeed , was not understood , and formed no part of the system of operations , either in Virginia or in the eastern colonies ; but it was the aim of each colon y to guard against any encroachments upon its own system of doc // trifles and ecclesiastical polity . What is remarkable in this case , is , that the colony of Maryland , consisting of Roman Catholics in name and profession , approached most nearly to the true Catholic church , the church universal . Catholics , who were not tolerated in Virginia , ( which recognized only the Episcopal church , ) in Maryland invited Christians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of equality , no less in religious than in civil freedom . This was done by Sir George Calvert , at the time of the " fundamental charter , " 1632 ; and in 1649 , it was more fully and formally set forth in the statutes of the government : - " Whereas , the enforcing of the conscience in matters of religion bath frequently fallen out to be of dangerous consequence in those commonwealths where it has been practised ; and for the more quiet and peaceable government of this province , and the better to preserve mutual love and amity among the inhabitants , no person within this province , professing to believe in Jesus Christ , shall be any ways troubled , molested , or discountenanced , for his or her religion , or in the free exercise thereof . " The privileges thus secured remained undisturbed , till anarchy sprung up in the civil affairs of the colony . Then the puritans strove to gain the mastery , and to exclude the Catholics , by whose toleration they had come to enjoy all the privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Assembly of 1654 , in which the Puritans gained the ascendency , an act was passed securing freedom of conscience , provided it should not extend to " popery , prelacy , or licentiousness . " Cromwell 's bigotry was not comprehensive enough to include the colonies ; and he commanded his commissioners " not to busy themselves about religion , but to settle the civil government . " In regard to the colonization of New-England , religious freedom was not merely an important element in the causes which produced emigration-it was itself the gre at moving cause . The history of the Pilgrims , " who led the way , both before and after they landed on these desolate shores , stands out among remarkable events , prominent , single , and alone . Pilgrims they may well be called ; not , however , like those who visited Jerusalem , Mecca , Rome , or Loretto , in obedience to existing and prevalent superstitions , to save their souls by bodily penance , or self-infliction , to pay an idolatrous service to a consecrated spot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were ready to travel the world over , to erect an altar of their own , such as their consciences might sanction , such as they trusted God would approve . Their history has no parallel . A little hand which came forth from the " Separatists , " in the north of England , under which name , a communion of Christians had existed previous to the close of Elizabeth 's reign , at last set up their banner at Plymouth , and took possession of a portion of the territory of what was afterwards called NewEngland , which , in little more than two centuries , has become peopled by more than two millions of souls . They were , in truth , though not in name , Independents . They were Independents by abjuring all human authority ; by a firm resolve , " whatever it might cost them , as the Lord 's free people , to join themselves , by covenant , into a church state , " and by a constant maintenance of their resolutions . They were such men as never before or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them certainly were , to husbandry , they knew how to // bend their occupations to circumstances . Amsterdam was their first resting-place after their flight from England ; but they soon removed to Leyden . Brewster , their ruling elder , had once served as a diplomatist in the Low Countries ; but now , obliged to learn a trade , he became a printer . Bradford , their historian , substituted , for the implements and art of husbandry , the art of dying silk . After a residence of twelve years in Holland , still feeling very much like strangers in the land , for various reasons dissatisfied with their abode , and retaining still that lingering love of country , which prompted them to seek an alliance with it as close as their principles of civil and religious freedom would permit , they embarked for the new world . They had been disappointed in the schemes which promised to relieve them from the hardships incident to solitary and unaided settlers . The auspices of the English government afforded not the kind of favor and protection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were humble enough in temporals ; but no vassalage in spiritual matters , not even any inequality , in stipulated terms , would they submit to . Still farther , by vile treachery , they were landed on a bleak and barren coast , instead of the fertile banks of a noble river . There they were , however , as they felt themselves to be , in God 's hands . The number of the colony , men , women , and children , conveyed in one ship , consisted of one hundred and one . The whole body of males , in this important commonwealth , qualified to act in state affairs , amounted to forty-one . The preservation of this colony , under all the circumstances of the case , was next to miraculous ; and we can not conceive that any but such men could become the instruments of Providence in establishing a system of polity , which was to have such a wide and wholesome sway as we can now distinctly trace from this little beginning . The effects of the leading traits of character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came after them , and the influence of their institutions , civil , religious , and literary , have never been lost . The unyielding Protestant principle-protest against all encroachments upon religious freedom-is inscribed on the banner of all sects , however much and however inconsistently they may strive to encroach upon each other . Learning , liberty , and law , all sanctioned in some good degree by religion , have dwelt together in sweet alliance ; and the influence of New-England principles and institutions , which have formed her sons , have migrated with them to the remote regions of the west . We have been led to make these cursory reflections upon our primitive history , by the great pleasure we have enjoyed in reading the first volume of Mr. Bancroft 's History of the United States. * This volume brings down the history only to the time of the restoration of the Stuarts . The author states , with great frankness , the reasons which have induced him to publish this volume by itself  --  a frankness which should be fairly and kindly met . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double motive . The work has already occasioned long preparation , and its completion will require further years of exertion . I have been unwilling to travel so long a journey alone ; and desire , as I proceed , to correct my own judgement by the criticisms of candor. " // We have traveled with the author to his present resting-place , with uninterrupted pleasure ; but our knowledge of the ground he has passed over is not sufficiently minute , in regard to localities , strange persons , dates , and historical facts , to induce us to accept his challenge , ( so to speak , ) given , as it is , with perfect modesty , and , as we firmly believe , with perfect sincerity  --  the sincerity of one who has labored for truth , and labored successfully , to make it attractive . The modern historian is not obliged , ( as the father of Grecian history felt himself to be , ) literally speaking , to travel , for the acquisition of knowledge , over the various countries in which the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the information that can be gathered from personal observation and inquiry ; but he has a task in some respects more difficult and less pleasing . He has not the same excuses for easy credulity ; he is sometimes perplexed by disagreement or contradiction in authorities , which he is obliged to weigh , and may overlook the small dust of the balance which should turn the scale . We find abundant evidence of care , in this respect , in Mr. Bancroft 's history . He is fully aware of the historian 's responsibility ; of the distrust which even small mistakes may bring upon his reputation for accuracy or fidelity . The evidence , upon which we award to him this praise , is not founded so much on the number of authorities which he cites , as upon the diligence with which he compares them , and the discrimination by which he arrives at his results . " Pouring out of one phial into another " is an easy process , and as good an illustration of book-making now , as it was in the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascertam the elements of the contents , to find whether the materials of the composition are genuine , and duly mingled , is quite another matter . And this illustrates the difference between Mr. Bancroft 's toilsome work , and the extempore compilations , as they may not improperly be called , of those who make up a history from one or two leading authorities , copying all the errors and supplying none of the deficiencies . We should , if we were professedly reviewing the work before us , point out several instances in which the author has detected errors , some of them very important ones , which have passed for verities from one historian to another . So much for the indispensable though humble qualities of the historian . One of the great difficulties which Mr. Bancroft has been obliged to encounter , and it will be far from being lessened as he proceeds in his work , is the preserving of its unity . Such is the extent of our country , so various were the circumstances of the early peopling of the several colonies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes interfering with each other in their internal policy , then confederated together for some purposes , with no other bond than common danger , or common honor and benefit , till at last they became one great republic , each still retaining its sovereignty , in matters not conceded to the general government ,  - -  that no little vigilance is required to keep the parts distinct , without interference , repetitions , or chasms , and to prevent the less from being swallowed up by the greater . We do not see that Mr. Bancroft could have arranged the history better , thus far . He begins with the early voyages , which resulted in discoveries upon this continent , and pro .. // ceeds to the history of the several colonies , in separate chapters , including the territory acquired by the United States , since the adop* tion of the federal constitution . Florida , of course , comes in , the firstborn colony within the present territorial limits of the United States , and the last adopted . By the arrangement he has chosen , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces together , to preserve the chronological order of events in the several portions of the history , which closes with a view of the colonies of New-England , as a united people ; and such they certainly were in manners , principles , and feelings ; in the spirit of liberty and order , and of resistance to oppression . New-Belgium is omitted . It is reserved for the next volume , " to give unity to the account . " Of the wisdom of this decision we have some doubts ; but we are willing to submit to the author 's better means of judging in the case . While the northern and the southern colonies differed from each other , and the two southern colonies were opposed one to the other , in religion , yet we trace , through the whole , that all-pervading spirit of liberty , which tended constantly to bind them together , and could not fail ultimately to lead to that toleration , the true principles of which , only one man in the colonies , and , so far as we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to avow . That man was Roger Williams . It is this pervading spirit of freedom , which the author distinctly traces and keeps continually in view , that constitutes , if we may bor .. row a phrase from the drama , the main action of the history , whose unity is so far strictly preserved . The bearing and tendencies of this spirit are eloquently set forth . We shall , doubtless , see , in the sequel of the author 's work , how this spirit , every where diffused , was concentrated , and was made to secure a glorious result ; and how matters of faith and conscience , private in their nature and obligations , and which are coupled with man 's destiny hereafter , became merged in great public and united efforts for this conservation of liberty . If the plan of our journal allowed an extended review , we should enter at some length into an examination of the first volume of Mr. Bancroft 's work , in order to illustrate his merits in regard to the higher qualities of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgeineuts which he renders concerning human actions and events , as affected by motives and circumstances ; of his sagacity in tracing effects from their causes ; of the charms of eloquence , so gracefully mingled with facts , that he is never dull , and so harmoniously allied to philosophy , that he never chills the reader with what is purely oracular and didactic . Witness his character of the Puritans , which , however , with all reverence be it said , is , perhaps , even too apologetical . We should add the happy parallelisms , which spring up from his full mind , between persons and between events , such as are not suggested by contemporaneous existence , or juxtaposition , but by a wide knowledge of the characters and actions of distinguished men , and of great historical facts in their circumstances , progre ss , and final issue ; the enlarged views which are taken , incidentally , indeed , of the comparative advances of nations in commerce , civil institutions , and intellectual culture ; the political and moral reflections which abound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass from the greater to the less , various little gems in the way of // anecdote , allusion , or illustration , which are scattered through his pages . And we should not forget to speak , also , of his narration , simple , spirited , and clear . Mr. Bancroft asked us two years ago , whether we were ever to have a good history of the United States ; or ,  --  as we should say , if called upon as a witness ,  --  words to that effect . We did not then know how deeply interested he was or might he in the question ; but now , if we may judge of the middle and end , from the beginning of his work , we are ready for a reply , which , after what we have said , need not be offered in a new form ; and we trust he will find a more satisfactory reply in his consciousness of fidelity and ability well applied , and in the gratitude of the public , which , when it is well deserved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity to value and to enjoy.
