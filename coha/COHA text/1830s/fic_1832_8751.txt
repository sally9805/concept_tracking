" Accipe nunc insidias. "  --  Vir . TO PROSPER MONTGOMERY WETMORE , AS A RECORD OF HIS WORTH , AS A TRIBUTE TO HIS GENIUS ; AND , AS A TOKEN OF ESTEEM , THIS TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS FRIEND , THE AUTHOR . PROLOGUE . BY WILLIAM LEGGETT . SPOKEN BY MR . BARRY . To rouse each slumbering passion of the breast , Bid cowering guilt his hideous form detest , Add grace to goodness , energy to truth , Ardour to age , and thoughtfulness to youth , With guileless mirth the ills of life t ' assuage , For these did Wisdom first erect the Stage , There , breathless Wonder , with dilated eyes , Saw the pale shades of former ages rise  --  Caught from the hero 's glance a kindred glow , Or mourned with real tears dissembled wo ; With shuddering awe , heard mad Ambition own The crimes that raised him to his tottering throne ; And learned that power , achieved by guilty deed , Decks with false glare the head it dooms to bleed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mock what they gild , and whilst they light , consume . True to the purpose of the scenic page , An untried bard this night employs the stage ; From no wild tale of necromantic sprite He draws the scene , to charm your dazzled sight , But boldly copies nature 's mazy chart Of vice and virtue , to instruct the heart . Here learn what terrors rack Guilt 's throbbing breast , And pale his cheek , though fortune light his crest : What generous ardor glows in honor 's form , Great in the calm , and greater in the storm . Such are the scenes our bard presents to view , And trembling trusts to nature and to you . Mar not his hope  --  be candid , yet be just ; Praise where you ought , blame only where you must .

Officer Like one , whose training for an age had been , Amidst the din of war : he bravely fought , And veterans yield him well deserved praise . Man . Maniri Then is a double victory achieved ! Duke . Duke of Florence This adds new lustre to our country 's fame .

Neri The battle 's won ; Giordano will return With greener laurels circled round his brow . He is my cherished friend , and to his power Am I indebted for the rank I hold , And therefore I have made his cause my own  --  That noble cause , which , from his throne will hurl The reigning despot , and a nation free . He 's ignorant of his heart , but well I know He needs a spur to rouse his nature up . That I will be :  --  first , for my love to him ; And second , for the State lacks skilful hands , To weed the useless roots that waste its sap . But more than all , revenge will then be mine ;  --  Revenge for wrongs which fester on my heart . My wife already sways us powerful friends  --  He comes , he comes ! My lord ! Enter Giordano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neri I give you joy upon your safe return : The great achievement has spread wide your fame . The city is alive with joy , and all Sound forth your name in terms of wondrous praise . Gior . Giordano ' Twill do our cause some service . Neri . Neri Sooth it will . But is it done ? Is Conradine despatched ? Gior . Giordano Ay ; Cosmo did his duty well . Neri . Neri And thou ? Gior . Giordano I 'm blameless as the unstained sword . Neri . Neri Thank heaven ! Gior . Giordano The best of chances brought the headstrong fool , Colonni , in my way ; I touch 'd him o n't  --  And now he 's gone , wild as a wounded bear , Unto the Duke :  --  nay , more , I 've spared no pains To pass the tale from ear to greedy ear .

Giordano All shall go well . I am ! When saw you Cosmo 's band ? Neri . Neri This hour , my lord : The gold you gave I lavished on them all , The which has proved them men of daring souls . Gior . Giordano Did they unto your reasons lend their thoughts ? Neri . Neri As on the issue every hope they placed . Gior . Giordano When meet you them again ? Neri .

Giordano Thou wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord , must be , And ably use thy smooth-tongued eloquence , That , should they need a prompter to the act , Thou mayst inspire them all . Gior . Giordano I will be there . But let us part ; I think it is not well , That we together meet observing eyes , For it might wake suspicion to our deeds . Neri . Neri My lord , do idle fears still sway thy mind ? Gior . Giordano I act with prudence , not with fear I 'm ruled . But let us part : I 'll straightwith to the palace , And learn how all our projects prosper there ; A smile or tear is ready at command , To meet each new occasion . Thou to the cave : My friend , farewell . Neri . Neri Be strong of heart . Farewell . Exit . Manet Giordano . Giordano Yes !

Now sleeps young Conradine , ne'er more to wake : He stood before me in my hopes of love , A venom 'd serpent in my path to fame ; But I have crushed him  --  and he stings no more . To-night Maniri by his pupil falls , Urged on by this audacious fabrication : Too much I feared his scrutinizing eye .  --  Thou glorious sun ! shed down thy golden beams , Shine on ! and nurse the laurels planted here , And make the wreath of everlasting green , That it may shadow all the dotard 's deeds , And in the self same shade scarf darkly up The son 's pretensions to succeed the sire . Now to the palace ; joy awhile reigned there For public weal  --  for private grief , laments . I 'll mock the time , and suit myself to both . Exit . SCENE III . Enter the Duke and Colonni . Duke . Duke of Florence A day so happy and so hapless too , So fraught with strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that we all rejoice ; The plot is known and that we shall suppress  --  But Conradine is dead !  --  for ever gone ! Col. Colonni This is a prologue to unruly times : A bold and quick resolve alone preserves The country 's safety and our house 's reign . Duke . Duke of Florence How was't discovered ? let me know the truth . Col. Colonni Giordano , in his letters has announced , That he by chance a knowledge of it gained : He has arrived . I met him hither bound , And from him learned a history of the plot , Which he had neither time nor power to write : And my impatience has o'erstepped his speed , To lay before your grace the dark account . Duke . Duke of Florence He is a noble one . Col. Colonni He is my friend . Duke . Duke of Florence What is the plot , and who are all involved ? Col. Colonni Here comes he now , to answer for himself . Enter Giordano . Duke . Duke of Florence Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : First , for thou art a victor safe from war ; And second , for thou canst unveil this plot , Which dares to aim against our life and throne : Pray as you love us , let us hear the worst . Gior . Giordano Maniri soars to grasp thy diadem , And hold despotic rule o'er all , whom thou More like a father than a monarch reign'st . With him are leagued a gang of desperate men , A discontented and a guilty rabble  --  Who at his nod would murder sleeping babes . Duke . Duke of Florence O , villain , villain !  --  Say on , I pray thee . Gior . Giordano The consummation of his rebel plot , Is fixed for an ungracious hour indeed : ' T is , as within the holy church we pay The funeral rites to our lamented friend . Duke . Duke of Florence Can this be so ! Col. Colonni What ! have I ears ! revenge ! Duke . Duke of Florence The time indeed is apt . Gior . Giordano From which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of this foul murder  --  yea , promoted it ; Else , had he never fixed on such a time . Duke . Duke of Florence Thy tale dispels the clouds which else had hung Darkly above me :  --  all is now revealed , And justice shall be swift and sure . Col. Colonni Nay , more ,  --  Revenge , my sire , shall be both swift and sure . Gior . Giordano Prithee , be tranquil and unfearful  --  both , For knowledge gives us time for preparation ; And in the sinews of this happy realm , A strength immortal lives , that will , my liege , Crush the foul traitor in his vaunted power . Duke . Duke of Florence I saw a serpent in my dream last night , With double head and most envenomed sting : Its eyes seemed brighter than two balls of fire , Which flashed upon me with so wild a glare , They tortured e'en my soul . I am an old man ; My blood is cold , imagination tame , And seldom do I conjure fancies up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet in this case , despite all former rule , I think my better angel hovered near , To wake my mind against some threatened ill . Now is my dream explained  --  but I shall be Prepared to meet the serpent , and to crush it . Col. Colonni I am prepared : speak ! let me know thy will . Gior . Giordano Be calm , my friend . Duke . Duke of Florence Who waits ? I 'll move with care . Enter an Usher . Bid Neri straight attend our pleasure here . Exit Usher . Gior . Giordano Deem not that I o'erstep the subject 's duty ;  --  But thou , methinks , beyond the present fear , Seem'st strongly moved : my friend Colonni too . Stop thou the treason at its fountain head , And the polluted channels soon will dry . Col. Colonni Let not Maniri live . Enter Neri . Duke . Duke of Florence Hear'st thou , Neri , Of treason ?

Exeunt Colonni and Neri . Gior . Giordano Eternal blights ! Why was his death not instantly decreed ! Aside . Be not desponding  --  all may yet be well . Duke . Duke of Florence What shall we think upon this chance , or how Reward thy love and vigilance ; we owe More than our words or largess can repay . Gior . Giordano Nay , speak not of't : my duty I have done , Not more : each thought and act is thine , through me Obedient all , in council or in field . How does the fair Imelda bear her grief ? Duke . Duke of Florence E'en woman like . Gior . Giordano Alas ! my liege , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke . Duke of Florence Grief oft delights to think , or speak of that Which was the source and fountain of its tears : And thou , my lord , new from the camp , know'st all ; Thy story may alleviate her woes . Gior . Giordano My liege , if I can shade the picture o'er , That less of horrid coloring show forth , ' Twill be a pleasing duty . Duke . Duke of Florence Didst thou speak ? We do forget ourself  --  so does this plot On our imagination fix withal , That we are bankrupt in each thought beside , And lack all courtesy . Good night . Exit Duke . Gior . Giordano Good night . May dreamless be your sleep  --  that 's a kind wish . Thus all flows well , and I shall sail to power . Now to Imelda : love , be thou my theme .

O , no , no ! It can not be  --  it passes all belief . ' T was but as yesterday I saw him here , In pride and dignity , a very god Dwelling ' mongst men . I 'll not believe the tale : It is a thought too big for my poor brain . O , gracious powers ! is this not some wild dream ! Some misconceit has surely turned the world To an outrageous frenzy . Men hear false . He lives ! ay , he must live . Death , wouldst thou dare To touch with icy hand his matchless mould ? But if ' t is so , then heaven itself must weep . Bel . Bella Alas , alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imelda Were I convinced , I then should be resigned ; But how can I believe the dreadful tale Of his untimely end ? Dost thou believe ' t ? Bel .

Bel . Bella He was a matchless man . Imel . Imelda He was of such excelling worth , that heaven Might mould a million , and not make his like . Bel . Bella Wo , wo ! he is no more : but , pray thee , turn Thy thoughts away from melancholy themes . Think of the living ; for there breathes the one , Who loves thee well , and well deserves thy love .

Exit Bella . Gior . Giordano In tears ! yet I will speak to her . Imelda ! Imel . Imelda ' T is ever thus ,  --  unwelcome guests appear , At most unwelcome seasons . What wouldst thou ? Gior . Giordano I come at an unwelcome time , ' t is true , But as a comforter and friend I come . Imel . Imelda Speak on , my lord , and say what wouldst with me . Gior . Giordano I am so moved to see thy settled grief , My heart almost denies the tongue to tell Its feelings . Imel . Imelda Oh ! Gior . Giordano We all should be resigned ! For what avail complaints , or sighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad bereavement soothe , Or bring departed worth to us again ? Tears are transparent , as it were , to prove Their unavailingness . Imel . Imelda What dost thou mean ? Gior . Giordano But , when a man so justly dear to all As Conradine expires , our better sense Will yield unto the heart 's complaint , and live Awhile on sorrow : true , he is no more ,  --  But there 's a something which will never die , His fame and worth ,  --  immortal as his soul . Imel . Imelda Thou speak'st like one who knows what ' t is to mourn . Gior . Giordano This , the most luckless chance that e'er befell . Imel . Imelda Indeed , indeed ! Gior . Giordano But who can feel thy woes ? Imel . Imelda My lot , in sooth , has been a hapless one ; For grief , like dismal clouds , has lowered on me , And shaded all the spring-time of my life . Gior . Giordano Now hope for gladness in the days to come ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every harm . Imel . Imelda Ah ! Gior . Giordano Hold , I sail too fast . Aside . Since thou hast lost so dear and kind a friend , Amidst the troubles which afflict the state , Thy gentle nature will require some one To comfort thee : and therefore I beseech , Thou'lt let thy troubled thoughts repose on me . Imel . Imelda Thou speak'st ambiguously  --  and yet , perhaps ' T is kindly meant . Gior . Giordano Perhaps ! nay ' t is , by heaven ! Imel . Imelda What wouldst thou swear ? Gior . Giordano I love thee . Imel . Imelda What is this ?  --  Gior . Giordano Yet , with such love , as might a brother love . Imel . Imelda Though feign'st a grief  --  and in the proffer lies My warrant for the thought . Gior . Giordano If I have erred , ( Which I did not intend , ) I crave your mercy .

Thus does my courage play the fool again . Imel . Imelda Strangely thou speak'st . Gior . Giordano Judge me by intents , And thou wilt think with kindness of my words . Imel . Imelda I would it were I judged thee too severely . Gior . Giordano Misfortune frowns on some , and every act ( In thought and feeling both as pure as truth ) Moved by the mutinous and rebellious blood , Is construed oft , dark as the thunder cloud , Surcharged with dire combustion  --  such a one I am . If I 've offended thee , Imelda , My sole offence is that I fondly love . What maid so cruel as call love a crime ? Imel . Imelda To what strange period does thy meaning tend ? Gior . Giordano Will not thine own dear heart my pleader be , And win me to thy favor ? While I gaze Upon the fashion of thy matchless form , The throne of beauty , innocence and worth  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power : The splendor too , which overpraising friends For poor achievements have shed round my name , Beside thy brightness sinks to worthless shade .

I 'll not be questioned now . Thus has she left me  --  like a fool I seem ; When next I sue , ' twill be as a command . Exit Giordano . Re-enter Imelda . Imel . Imelda Has he departed ? Bel . Bella Yes , sweet lady . Imel . Imelda Leave me . Exit Bella . Wo 's me ! scarce have my tears begun to flow , For the most precious flower , that ever bloomed In the rich garden of a maiden 's love , And I 'm besieged with ill-becoming suits . Away ! love , hope and happiness , farewell ! I 'll to a cloister 's gloom , there spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Bella . Bel .

Stranger I come  --  Imel . Imelda O yes , you come , To say you saw my Conradine expire . Or , gracious heavens ! is not the story false ? In mercy ! tell me , is he truly dead ? Stran .

Imel . Imelda To think that thou art safe will be to me An occupation joyous . I 'm content . To-morrow will the Senate be convened ; Till then remain unknown , when we will break , Thrice welcome guests , on their deliberations . Conrad . Conradine Thy wish shall be my will . Ne'er till this hour , Could I believe thou didst so truly love  --  Thou wert unkind before . Imel . Imelda Nay , chide me not : But let us part , lest observation 's eye Make foul of what is fair .

Conspirator Be your purse as well gilded , and I am satisfied . 3d Con. 3d . Conspirator What said Giordano ? Cosmo . Cosmo He loaded me with gold ; that is eloquent thanks . Hear me  --  I expect a visiter on the instant , who will speak of the noble deed I touched on . 1st . Con. 1st . Conspirator Who is he ? Giordano ? Cosmo . Cosmo No : your old friend , Neri . I beseech you , hear him patiently . 2nd . Con. 2nd . Conspirator If this achievement restore our wealth , and give us back our titles , it will be a noble doing . Cosmo . Cosmo It will . 1st . Con. 1st . Conspirator Such liberty and absolution too , I hope , that we may walk in Florence , and bask in the mid-day sun , fearless of the villanous law  --  not steal into it like hungry rats .

Cosmo The name sounds well with me , and I burn to do its owner service : a name is sometimes as good as a charm . But hush  --  he comes ! Enter Neri . Welcome to our palace : no gilded domes have we , no costly draperies , nor gaudy pictures to adorn our walls . The sky above us is our canopy , the casing air our halls ; and these works of nature more nicely fashioned than art 's most choice cunning , are all the embellishments of our domain . Neri . Neri I like them well . Cosmo . Cosmo The fashion changes here , oftener than in the stately palace of the Duke . Each day and night , and each revolving season , changes the drapery . Now shines the sun , then smile the sun and stars : now green , then yellow , are the annual buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . Neri . Neri My brave friends , I see you all are men , and though I have hinted the dotard 's downfal , you keep your spirits up like heroes . Cosmo .

Cosmo . Cosmo I thank you for this character ; rather let my deeds than your tongue speak for me . Neri . Neri Let this pass . Since his return , I have seen him  --  the name I will not trust aloud , even to air , to winging or to pacing things ; for it is said , that strange couriers have carried tales of old : therefore , in such a cause , I shall be cautious . Before I speak what he said of you , or propose what should be done anon , retire with me into your cave . Cosmo . Cosmo It is like our hearts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . Exeunt all into the Cave . SCENE II .  --  The Senate House . The Duke , Giordano , Colonni , Cavilido , and Senators , Attendants , &c.; Maniri in chains and guarded . Duke . Duke of Florence Conduct the traitor hence . Nay , never speak ; Thy gray hairs only , saved thee from the rack . Exit Maniri , guarded . It is decreed : Maniri is immured , And all are lodged on whom suspicion breathes . Soon for the safety of ourself and state The anthem shall arise . We owe thee much . Gior . Giordano Against our foreign and domestic foes , I 've done a soldier 's and a subject 's duty ,  --  Not more , my liege . Duke . Duke of Florence The reverend traitor was The chief adviser in our happy realm : He false , it now devolves on us to name One wise and loyal . Ere we speak our choice , We pray that brave Giordano will retire . Gior . Giordano I take my leave . I soar above my hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty trust which late the traitor held , By one more worthy must with speed be filled  --  That one , my judgment and my heart proclaim To be our own victorious general . Grave senators , how stand you all disposed ? Speak freely each : meets this your approbation ? Col. Colonni It does , my sire  --  their silence gives approval . Cav . Cavilido No ! I oppose : I will not lend my vote To raise a victor to such high control : I fear the sway his office might insure Over the people 's mind . Success in war Circles the hero in a glare of light , That dazzles those who move within his sphere . Civilians , soldiers , all might bow to him ; Pause at his word , or at his bidding move . Duke . Duke of Florence False are thy fears ; I know Giordano well . Col. Colonni As I can vouch ! from boyhood we have been In friendship strong as fable ever told . Give him your voices , friends . Why sit you mute ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his deeds The proudest records on our history 's page ; For these , would yield him all becoming honor . What is becoming ? Give him wealth immense  --  The arch triumphal , titles proud , and love , Yea boundless as the realm , or as his fame  --  But dress no hero in our civil robes . Duke . Duke of Florence Why should you fear ? Does history not record Examples parallel , and where renown , As great in council as in tented field , Has brightly marked the warrior-statesman 's course ! Ay , in a land as brave and wise and free , As the wide globe contains , there 's proof supreme . Cav . Cavilido I grant you this , but does not history too Record , that heroes by their country prized , ( And man is prone to love the brave in war ) Have made , without a stepping-stone like this , Their martial deeds a claim to civil rule , And won it too ? Then tyranny hath marched With ruthless vengeance , and with sword unsheathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I bring you instances to prove , From ancient times , or e'en in modern days , The truth and force of my asseveration ?  --  I say what has been once may be again , And , though I speak not present fears , I would Avoid all possibility of fear . Col. Colonni Who else opposes ? Silent all !  --  then none . Duke . Duke of Florence Yea , answer us ! who does oppose our choice ?  --  Who will refuse all honor to the man That 's won his country 's battles , and subdued An insolent foe ? Let him arise and speak . Cav . Cavilido Will none support me in the vote I give ? Grave Senators , to you I speak ; hear me : I pray ye all , beware . Lend not your votes To yield such power to an ambitious man , A daring soldier and the people 's idol  --  There 's danger in ' t . Who speaks ? None ! I 'm resigned . Col. Colonni He is alone . I thank ye for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ! our motion is approved . Now give him escort to the Senate-house . Exit Colonni . If he prove faithless none on earth are true : If he strive not in loyalty and wisdom , To shed a lustre on our state and throne , Then never patriot lived . Re-enter Colonni and Giordano . Welcome again ; Our choice , which by the Senate is confirmed , Bids us salute thee , as our Minister . Gior . Giordano My liege , ambition teaches some to soar Above their due  --  not me . I should decline This high and undeserved proof of love , Did not thy favor , and the Senate 's voice , Enforce me to the office . As I live Not for myself , but for my country 's weal , I will support her to my utmost nerve . We 've beat the foe  --  peace is again restored , And in its germ , domestic treason 's crushed ; Though here I now put on the civil robe , I frankly tell , that whensoe'er I can Better in field than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ease of peace , To beard the foe . Duke . Duke of Florence Thou'rt living in our heart . Enter an Usher . Usher . Usher The fair Imelda , now without , my liege , Requests an audience in the Senate-house . Duke . Duke of Florence Colonni , pray thee , bid thy sister in . Exeunt Colonni and Usher . We should not see her here , if all were well . We fear that grief has triumphed o'er her mind . How , brave Giordano , didst thou leave my child ? Gior . Giordano My liege , depressed  --  but yet not so o'ercome , That thou shouldst fear despair has stolen her wits . Duke . Duke of Florence How I have loved her tongue can not express , And when I saw her beauty budding fair , E'en like the heathen statuary of old , I worshipped my own creation . She comes ! Alas , she smiles ! we fear it is too true . Enter Imelda , attended with Colonni , Bella , and Maids . Duke . Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou well ? Imel . Imelda Well ! ay ; look I not well ? Duke . Duke of Florence Dost truly speak ? Imel . Imelda Yea , better than I look , my sire , I feel . You did not send to bid my health good morrow ! Duke .

Yes , more , much more , my friend : Long may I live in such a heart as thine . I turn , to wish thee worlds of joy , fair dame . Col.

An hour thereafter the report went round , That I was murdered and my servant fled ; On whom suspicion rested of the deed .

Unknown to all I changed my dress again , ( Remember , ' t was my first essay in arms , The sooner then you will forgive this act , ) To test what soldiers would report of me , For truth is always spoken of the dead ; But , when I learned , that couriers were sent To Florence and my father  --  I resolved To gladden those who might lament my fall .

Duke of Florence Then list , my court ;  --  here we bestow our child , And they themselves shall name the day , on which The rights of marriage shall be solemnized .

They shall not riot in each others ' arms , And I be cast despised to dark perdition .

There is a something working in my brain , And that the great conception may have birth , I need your friendly aid .

Conradine I will not urge thee ; Yet when thou wak'st such language from these strings , It seems as music bade my bosom swell , And every thought aspire above this world . Imel .

Conradine The world is full of it ; There 's not a living thing but loves its kind , And nothing is ' twixt heaven and earth so true . Sweet ever-living love ! and O , as pure As wakening zephyrs , or as opening flowers ! Imel . Imelda It ne'er was praised by man so much before . Conrad .

Conradine A moment since , I hoped thou wouldst have had A double father ; now , my love , I fear That I myself , no longer have a father . Imel . Imelda What says the letter ? It is sudden news . Conrad . Conradine My aged , honored and revered sire , Approaches dissolution ; ' t is his wish Which by my brother is in this expressed , That I be near him when his end arrives , To meet his blessing , and to close his eyes .

Bel . Bella Yes ; I heard his horse 's hoofs Sound wild impatience in the palace court . He boldly spurred the gallant steed , and , fleetly As a proud ship impelled by quarter winds , He onward rode  --  then hushed was every sound . Imel . Imelda O , hapless , hapless me ! Bel . Bella Cheer up , my lady ; From clouded mornings often come bright days , And purest rain falls from the darkest sky ; So cheer thee then , and I presage , ere long , Thy lover safely will return to thee , With pleasant news and sunshine on his brow .

It grieves me , too , to hear him laugh at fear , And boast of courage he possesses not . I 'll make him cruel , else I 'll tame myself , And turn confessor to some silly girl . Bel . Bella O , what a contrast is between you twain ! Neri . Neri I think there 's not a mortal in the land , Who , if he saw Giordano 's lily heart , Would not condemn him for so poor a tenant . Bel .

Bear up ; The time is near when all will be secure . Bel . Bella I would to Heaven thy words may be confirmed ! Neri . Neri I hear a step ; again ! hush . Get thee hence . Exit Bella . I 'll move aside , and over-hear his prate . Enter Giordano . Gior . Giordano Now he is gone , and I can freely breathe !

The Duke and daughter die , that is resolved : To fondly love , where I so deeply hate , Is treason ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall live . I fear not him ; He is a fond and unsuspecting fool , And I 'll content him , though I wear the crown . Let Neri fret ; by Heaven ! he shall not die . Neri advances . Hah ! Neri . Neri Why dost start , why wouldst escape from me ? Why cover up thy breast , as ' t were to hide The thoughts within ? Thine eyes are inward turned , Fearful to look on me , lest they reflect The broodings of thy mind . Gior . Giordano What should I fear ? Why question me ? Neri . Neri My lord , excuse my speech ; For in a cause like this , it must be plain . Why dost thou pale ? why doth the blood now seek , And then forsake thy cheeks ? wilt answer me ? Gior . Giordano Command the ocean in its rage to calm , And bid the hurricane abate its wrath ; If they obey , then will I hold the rein Upon my blood , and with the self-same case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  The blood within is like the wind without ; Both have their sway beyond all mortal power , Neri . Neri Is this philosophy ? Your erudition ! Gior . Giordano It has been proved by scientific sages . Neri . Neri I hate all sciences , and sages too ; Why should our great resolves commune with either ? Let 's speak of that which will advantage us , Nor heed those sages , who will turn their brains To find the gender of a plant or worm , And waste a life to anatomize a fly  --  Pish on them all ! What think'st thou now , my lord ? Gior . Giordano I almost yield before thy force of words . Neri . Neri If thou couldst set thy foot where now I stand , And let the earth bear such a heart as mine , Which neither tongue nor steel could e'er appal , The envenomed bowl , nor midnight murder scare , We should in this so nobly move to-night , That morning 's sun would hail us masters here . But , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gior . Giordano Fail ! we shall not . Neri . Neri Yes , we will surely fail , If thou be not both resolute and brave , Or if thou act , as I o'erheard thee say . Gior . Giordano Why dost upbraid me thus ? What overheard'st ? Neri . Neri Who in the palace shall escape our swords ? Gior . Giordano None  --  yes , only one . Neri . Neri Who ? Gior . Giordano My friend  --  Colonni . Neri . Neri By Heaven , that wretch shall be the first to die ! Swift as the darts the fabled archer shot , Which , as they flew , took fire , my sword shall pierce His heart . Gior . Giordano I am resolved  --  my friend must die : None shall escape the havoc of that hour . Neri . Neri That tone I 've heard before , but trust it not , Till I have proof . Gior .

Neri . Neri First answer me : where 's Conradine ? Gior . Giordano In hell : When thou wert gone , the devil sent him back  --  Neri . Neri This I have heard , my lord ; and that you forged A silly scrawl , to send him from the court . What motive had you for an act like this ? Gior . Giordano By Heaven ! thou question'st as I were thy slave ! Do not provoke me further . Neri . Neri Speak , my lord . Gior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived , That in his presence nothing could succeed ; I dared not vent my hate and kill him here ; That would have roused suspicion from her den , Where now she sits , as mute and dark as death . His father 's house is three days journey hence , The which , I prophesy , he 'll never reach . Cosmo succeeds  --  I look for him anon . Neri . Neri As thou speak'st , like an evil thought , he comes . Enter Cosmo . Gior . Giordano Is he dead ? Say ? Cosmo . Cosmo My lord . Gior . Giordano Speak out , and quickly ; Declare he 's dead , and give my heart content . Cosmo . Cosmo No ; he escaped me , but I slew his squire . Gior . Giordano Death and destruction ! Double gifted slave ,  --  His servant slain  --  and what is that to me ? Thou art not fit to live ; go , seek his soul  --  And yet , too poor for me to kill . Neri . Neri Good Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord ! Gior . Giordano Peace , villain , peace ! Life 's whirlwind is all spent , and I am  --  nothing . There 's not a slave who battens in the sun , That 's half so base as thou art . Neri . Neri To . Cosmo . How is this ? They speak apart . Gior . Giordano Now I repent of all my deep designs , And curse ambition , which has urged me on . Could I recall my pristine state of mind , With feelings pure and conscience undefiled , How gladly then would I lie down to die , And leave dominion to the bolder soul . My schemes achieved , what should I then have been ? What is the brightest name on history 's page ? When death approaches , who can then cry , " stay , " Or nod the head , and awe him to subjection , As man does millions of his fellow men ? O , none ! the monarch , like the slave , must yield , And give his life without one moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art sure of this ? Cosmo . Cosmo Most sure . Neri .

We 'll meet anon : They are assembled in the Sibyl 's cave . Exit Cosmo . Gior . Giordano I 've often thought upon this world  --  and wondered ! What is ambition , why are men ambitious , And what avail their petty hopes and fears , Their brief authority and baseless pride ? A few years pass  --  then , where are the renowned ? Ask the dank charnel-house ,  --  no voice responds : Ask the vain living ,  --  we may hear , they were , But now are gone , and with them is entombed Each aim and action of life 's fretful hour : The world has spared them , and regrets it not !

Neri Then , like a craven , also drown thyself . Gior . Giordano Know ye to whom ye speak , sir ? Neri . Neri I do not . I took thee for a man  --  thou saidst thou wert ; But now , thy looks and fears belie thy speech : I know thee not . Gior . Giordano What ! thou dost surely know , For thee , I placed upon one single chance , My life , nay more , my spotless reputation .

Neri . Neri I do confess it , and am thy debtor . Gior . Giordano I 've borne from thee , what man has never dared Before accuse me of . Do I lack courage ? Was it by lack of heart , that in the field , Ere I had scarcely thrice seven summers seen , I did such deeds as raised me to command ? Was't lack of courage , that , the late campaign Led on by me , subdued the insolent foe , And made him crave , on abject terms , a peace ?

Giordano Thy love has lost me . Neri . Neri My love shall make thee : To-night , with my advice , thou art a duke . Gior . Giordano Dost say so ? Neri . Neri Yes , I pledge my soul upon it . Gior .

Giordano What can I say , my friend , or how express My feelings for this love ? I 'm thine for ever . Neri .

Cosmo Hush ! they approach . Give them all ear . Enter Giordano and Neri . Gior . Giordano My friends , I greet you all with best acknowledgments . ' T is not alone , that I 've by Neri heard Your dauntless resolution ; and I see Stamped on each face the daring of the heart . To Cosmo . I grieve , that in the fury of chagrin I gave such lawless license to my tongue , As doubtless festers on the high-born soul ; But think no more of it , and be my friend . Cosmo . Cosmo Thy noble nature condescends too far ; The offence is past , and all 's forgotten now . Neri . Neri Then , is the luckless breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without , With whom we should unite ; brave spirits all , Shall they , my friends , have audience ? Cosmo .

Neri My lord , thy servant ever . Exit Neri . A pause , then re-enter Neri , followed by several Citizens . Gior . Giordano Welcome . My trusty , brave , and cherished friends , I need not now repeat again to you , The sum and secret , you 've from Neri heard ; Yet , give me ear , that I may once essay To speak the wrongs which force us to rebel . Neri . Neri Speak on , my lord . Cosmo . Cosmo Thy word to us is law . Gior . Giordano Think not that selfish aims impel me on ; No !

Conspir . Conspirator All hail  --  Giordano ! Citizens . Citizens Hail to thee  --  Giordano ! Gior . Giordano I speak to you as men ; and brave you are , With hearts and hands prepared to strike for freedom . The richest blood of olden times , has drenched Our own loved land in freedom 's holy cause : The world applauds the daring of our sires , And in each heart their monument is built . We may rank with them in a future age , If heaven should smile upon our great emprise ; And it will smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conspirator We shall have liberty . Citizens . Citizens And wide revenge . Gior . Giordano O , could the noble Medician line , From their sepulchral slumbers start to life , How would they gaze upon our abject state ! Yea , as they gazed , their burning tears of blood Would overflow the city , and arouse Each mute and lifeless thing to shout aloud , Death to oppressors , liberty to man ! Neri .

Giordano Such hearts should only live in such a time . They boast of ancient blood and noble birth ! What wondrous virtue has their blood from ours ? Where is nobility , save in the mind ? My friends , I speak to you on certain proofs , Which have convinced me of such losel deeds , That language burns , yet has not words to name Our festering wrongs , and their outrageous crimes .

Duke of Florence Well , what of that ? For such unruly times , Is aught unnatural , although to nature It speaks rebellion ? Col. Colonni Sire , he strangely talks ; In broken accents , and by gestures vague , ( For scarcely hath he breath to speak or live , ) Reveals all is not right . Duke .

I do repent , And curse the gilded trash that bought my soul . Imel . Imelda O , much I fear that there is something wrong . Bel . Bella E'en now thy royal father questions him , And on the instant , doubtless , will return To calm thy fears . Imel .

Maniri Through the dim light That sickly lives within my prison-house , I gaze on thee ; yea , were the brilliant sun Shedding his golden beams full on thy brow , Should not avoid thine eye . Duke . Duke of Florence Is guilt so bold ? Man . Maniri I never wronged thee : by my hoary hairs , And by my name , which spotless was till now ; Yea , by the love I bore and bear thee still , Before high Heaven 's all-searching eye , avouch That in intent or act , I never wronged thee .

Duke of Florence Alas ! we can not say ; To learn from thee , has been our errand hither . Man . Maniri From me ! what do I know ? I 'm ignorant . Duke . Duke of Florence Thou know'st he scarcely had returned from war , ( Ere he could turn a thought to thee , or else , ) When he set out to see his father die ,  --  For such a hapless message was received  --  And thither bound , he was in Arno 's vale This day attacked by some rebellious hand : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . Man . Maniri Returned from war ! attacked in Arno 's vale ! Mysterious all ! I do not comprehend . Duke . Duke of Florence Why did ye this ? Man . Maniri It was no act of mine . I am amazed !

Is this the face of guilt ? it can not be ! If thou didst not , who could have been so base ? Man . Maniri That I am guiltless , I again aver , But who is guilty , there 's no certain proof : Yet , look to my accuser . Duke . Duke of Florence Ha ! what 's this ? Man . Maniri Yes , look to him .

Duke of Florence Tush , tush ! suspicion merely : not one charge Canst bring against his sun-encircled name ? Think'st that aspersing him , will prove thee guiltless ? Man . Maniri I shall say nothing further of myself ; I am adjudged guilty by my peers , And quietly yield unto my hapless fate . Duke . Duke of Florence Aside . More , and still more , our heart inclines to him ; Each word and look assures us he is wronged . We are resolved . My ancient friend . Man . Maniri My sire ! Duke .

Maniri With thanks and gladness , sire . Duke . Duke of Florence Jailer , attend ! Man . Maniri Bless thee , my reverend monarch ! Enter a Jailer . Duke . Duke of Florence Strike off his fetters . Now the door is ope 'd . Jailer . Jailer This makes me glad . Duke . Duke of Florence Wherefore ? Jailer . Jailer If my liege permit , Before thee and Giordano I will speak . Man .

Enter the Duke and Maniri . Duke . Duke of Florence My friend , with cheek unblanched , with shrinkless eye , With voice unfaltering , and in look sincere , I pray thee answer us : believ'st him guilty ? Gior . Giordano Your grace amazes me ; this lawless act , So far o'ersteps the prudence of thy life , I know not how to answer . Why is this ? Man . Maniri My liege , look on him : watch his eye and lip , They , not amazement show , but guilt . Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why has the traitor 's dungeon been unbarred ? I hope thou'rt wise , as thou wert in thy prime . Duke . Duke of Florence Strange doubts have lately gathered o'er our mind ; Yet we have loved thee , almost love thee still , And , loving , doubt thy loyalty and truth . Better to live in knowledge , good or ill , Than have a something pendant o'er our head We know not of , which tortures us with fear . Gior . Giordano I know not what thy strange proceedings mean . Duke . Duke of Florence Believ'st him guilty ? Gior . Giordano Yes , my liege , I do . Man . Maniri Of treason ? Gior . Giordano Ay ! the Senate was convinced . Man . Maniri As I shall answer at the judgment seat , And as this hour He knows  --  I 'm innocent . Gior . Giordano Denying once , ' t is virtue still to swear . Duke .

Duke of Florence Jailer , attend ! Gior . Giordano What ! ha ! the craven slave ! Enter the Jailer . Duke . Duke of Florence Dost still assert his guilt ? Gior . Giordano I only spoke The damning proofs that swayed the Senate 's mind , Which Neri knew , and countless other proved . Duke . Duke of Florence Speak what thou know'st . Jailer .

My friend , We 're almost sure that thou art much abused . Man . Maniri I am indeed ; would thou , my liege , wert sure . Cav . Cavilido My heart believes thee guiltless , but the proof Was with such skill arrayed , and seemed so true , It ruled all feeling , and pronounced thy doom . Man .

What news , my son ? Hast thou discovered aught ? Col. Colonni A feeling strange prevails throughout the city ; Some move with stealthy step , and speak by signs ; Some whisper and start back , as if observed ; While others pale or redden , as they gaze Upon the firmament , and watch the stars Twinkling their fires as darkness thickens round . Old men appear as if distressed in thought , And to inquiring looks , show doubt and fear .

Duke of Florence Lo ! how ambition and unlawful pride Hath lost a stately bark .  --  Look where it lies ,  --  Forced by the waves of passion 's stormy sea , Upon the shoals of crime  --  a worthless wreck . The Curtain falls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BY MRS . HILSON . Spoken at the Wing . Nay  --  Mr. Barry  --  ' t is indeed too hard , Thus late to send me forth , to please the bard ; I do not like an Epilogue  --  the play Is long enough  --  well , if I must obey , I 'll try . Enters . The Author 's fate I 've come to ask  --  A five-act Tragedy 's a fearful task  --  Glad plaudits cheer the lucky wight who wins , But , failing , all the town will count his sins . What say ye then ?  --  I hope the question 's clear . Now pray do n't smile  --  I 'm looking for a tear . Ah ! yes , on many a blooming cheek I trace The pearly drop that gems the speaking face . Nay , blush not , ye , of manhood 's sterner heart , Nor shame to own the influence of our art : No greener wreath will circle round your name , Than feeling twines , and sympathy may claim . The plot  --  how like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dnouement must show the master skill  --  The characters  --  well drawn ? the interest  --  strong ? The time  --  nor short for action , nor too long ? The incidents , arranged with cunning hand , To hold attention breathless at command ? On all of these , in judgment you must sit , And try  --  the poet 's strength , or lack of wit . Before the bar of taste we bring our cause , And I 'm retained to plead for your applause . Poetic justice , sure the bard hath shown  --  The villain dies , his plots are overthrown ; The lady lives  --  the lover too survives  --  We are not prodigal of tragic lives . Critics may deem this faulty  --  ' t is to you , Ye kindly fair , for pardon we must sue . Ye would not see the fond confiding maid , By ruthless violence in marble laid , Nor wish that manly heart should cease to beat , To make the catalogue of deaths complete ; No  --  rather will we dare the critic 's fiat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , if death were thus in vogue , I could'nt come to speak the Epilogue.  --  Between us , do n't believe in tragic sorrow  --  The dead will all be well enough to-morrow . Friends of the drama , for the drama 's weal  --  With hands to speak how well your hearts can feel  --  Our author asks for your approving voice ; Your smiles can bid his anxious heart rejoice . No fame-nursed laurels bloom upon his brow ; His first appeal is made for favor now . Then , patrons  --  shall I say our cause is won ? I see the verdict 's right  --  my plea is done .
