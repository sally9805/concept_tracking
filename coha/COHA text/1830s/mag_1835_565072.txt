txt VARIOUS theories have been formed respecting the origin of music ; and , indeed , in attempting to account for it , we meet with difficulty which does not occur in the other fine arts . Architecture , for instance , originated in the earliest wants of man the first houses were only more convenient than the dens of wild beasts ; afterwards , from a principle inherent in our nature , attempts were made to beautify what at first was only useful . The objects of nature suggested the ornaments employed in architecture . The trunk of some tall and graceful tree was the model of the Grecian column ; a few saplings , bound together , form the Gothic . A basket of votive offerings , left on the tomb of a // Greek girl , round which the Acanthus had gracefully spread its leaves , is said to have given the idea of the Corinthian capital ; and the interweaving of the branches of a forest , which is clear of brushwood , seen in winter with a sunset sky for the background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painting and sculpture are also strictly imitative arts . This is not the case with music : no imperious physical want first called it into existence ; no models constantly prompted its cultivators to improvement . We might almost say , there is no type of it in nature ; for what , compared with mpsic as we now possess it , is the roar of the ocean , the sighing of the forest , or the warbling of birds , which form the music of nature ? If we examine music as a science , we find it involving some of the deepest mathematical calculations , proceeding upon principles as invariable and goverened hy laws as intricate as those by which the planets move on in their orbits . If xve view it as an art , we are astonished at its variety and power ; we observe that genius alone , aided by years of patience and toil , can excel in it . We find it a universal language , written and uttered alike by all civilized nations : no translations are needed for it : the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunny Italy , read it with ease . It can not perish with length of time ; it can never become a dead language , for there is no mystery about its pronunciation ; it is written in characters which suggest tones as well as thoughts , and which will never cease to do so , until the very nature of the art shall be changed . This sublime and perfect art , therefore , seems to have grown up out of nothing - a solitary monument of unaided genius . A common thing respecting its origin is , that it was first produced by the imitative propensities of men . Hearing the notes of birds , the rushing of streams , or the whistling of the wind , they endeavored to produce the same sound with the voice , or upon some rude instrument , and , gradually improving upon these beginnings , brought music to its present perfection . This theory is ingenious , but not probable . We might as well account for language in the same manner , and infer , that speech was suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dog , or the more homely sounds of more homely animals . I much prefer to suppose , that music is born within us ; that it is indissolubly allied to our nature , and belongs to us as peculiarly as language itself . Instead of being merely imitative , and addressed to the senses alone , I prefer to invest it with a high intellectual character . The cry of horror , at sudden and fearful events , the loud shout of thanksgiving and jubilee , the soft , sweet tone that lulls the cradled infant , are more than imitative sounds ; they address themselves directly to the understanding and feelings . Music // begins where language ends ; it expresses thoughts and emotions , to which speech can give no utterance ; it clothes words with a power which language can not impart . Our favorite songs are set to mnsic , because we are not satisfied with hearing them recited we want to express more vividly the emotions which these words excite within us ; and music alone will do it . Hence it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless if read in the common tone of voice . Though it is probable , that vocal music preceded all other kinds , we still know that instruments for producing sound were very early invented . We are told , in Genesis , that Jubal was the father of all such as handle the harp and the organ . ' Other references were also made to the cultivation of music in the first ages of the world . The first grand musical festival on record , however , occurred immediately after the passage of the Israelites across the Red Sea ; nor can we conceive of a more sublime celebration . Standing on the shores of that wreck-strewed sea , whose waves rolled over the lifeless bodies of their enemies , and beholding in the distance the land of their bondage , they thought of the miracles which had been wrought for their deliverance ; they remembered that , for them , the rivers had been changed into blood ; for them , the country had been desolated , the people tortured with baleful reptiles , and thick darkness had rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea had been piled up as a wall , on their right hand and on their left ; they remembered , that they were free , and the desert rang with their triumphant anthems . The account is given with that simple grandeur which characterizes the writings of Moses . Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord , and spake , saying - I xviii sing unto the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider bath he thrown into the sea . Thy right hand , 0 Lord , hath dashed in pieces the enemy . With the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood upright , as an heap , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea . The enemy said - I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied on them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them . Thoudidst blow with thy wind ; the sea covered them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her , with timbrels and with dances . And Miriam answered them - Sing ye to the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider bath he thrown into the sea . ' The Jews were a highly musical people ; they added this charm to all their celebrations , domestic , civil , and religious ; they sang at their nuptial feasts , at the inauguration of their kings , // and on birth-day festivals . The returning conqueror was welcomed with songs , and the wearisomeness of the long march was relieved by this pleasing recreation . In the temple , the music was performed by the Levites ; they were four thousand in number , and were divided , by king David , into twenty-four classes , each of which performed the music of the temple for one week at a time . They accompanied their songs by the different instruments which were then in use , excepting the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were used to summon the people , to make known the festal days , to direct the order of march , and to sound the alarm . The most ancient musical instrument appears to have been the harp . Among the Hebrews , it had four , eight , or ten stringsWith this number , it is not probable that very complicated music was produced ; but the instrument was undoubtedly used chiefly as an accompauiment to the voice . They also used another stringed instrument , of a triangular form . It was covered with parchment , drawn tight over both sides , . so as to produce reverberation , like the guitar or violin . Over this , were drawn the strings , six , nine , or ten in number . This instrument is supposed to be alluded in the Scriptures as the psaltery . The wind instruments were pipes- either single , or several joined together - trumpets and horns : the organ , as understood in the Bible , was nothing more than a simple pipe , perhaps pierced , like our ciarionet , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , the word retained the same signification in Englishthe instrument which now bears the name , being always mentioned in the plural number , so that we spoke of playing the organs , not the organ . The timbrel appears to have been much such an instrument as our tambourine - being composed of a circular frame , of wood or brass , hung round with small bells , and a piece of parchment stretched over it . This instrument was used by the dancers to accompany their steps . Finally , the Jews made use of cymbals , much like our own , and another kind not unlike the Spanish castanets , four in numbers which were worn on the thumb and middle finger of each hand , to beat time in dancing . The Greeks were great lovers of music . Their instruments were not unlike those of the Jews . Their principal and most ancient one , was the harp ; besides which , they used the pipe , trumpet , and flute ; and we may reasonably suppose , that music was carried to a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , and speaking a language which , for melodiousness , has never been matched . I suppos , e their ordinary singing to have been somewhat like that of the Italian peasants of the present day ; and there certainly is no popular // The Origin and Progress of Music . music so delighful as this . Returning home in crowds from their labors , or wandering by midnight through the streets of their cities , they invariably join in the full chorus they are untaught , but their taste is so correct , and their voices so fine , that they are able to sing in perfect time , and produce rich harmony : and the traveler , from some less genial climate , aroused from his slumbers by this midnight chorus , which , in the pure , still nights of Italy , seems to fill the air , almost fancies that he has listened to tones from a better world . The Greeks possessed even greater natural advantages that the modern Italians . Their taste for the fine arts is without any rival ; and the clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to those of any modern civilized nation . They began very early , however , to reduce music to a regular science . In 546 , B. C. , Casus wrote a treatise on the theory of music ; and Pythagoras investigated the mathematical relations of tones . The division of the scale , as explained by Vitruvius , . is somewhat intricate ; it consisted of two octaves and a half ; but these octaves , however , contained only half the compass of our own - as the Greeks appear to have used half-notes and quarter-tones , where we employ the whole and sernitones . As there is much unc*rtainty still , respecting the signification of their terms , it is not worth our while to go into the detail upon this point . It is worthy of remark , however , that the Greeks had so cultivated music , that their language was employed in the science exclusively , and seems to have been as intimately connected with it , as Italian is at the present day . Vitruvius remarks , that , harmony is a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacquainted with the Greek language , because it is necessary to use many Greek words , to which there are no corresponding ones in the Latin . ' The Greeks evinced considerable knowledge of harmony , in an expedient to which they resorted for aiding the voices of their actors . Their theatres were very large , and open above , so that it was almost impossible for the voice , unaided , to fill them : numerous musical instruments , somexvhat resembling a bell in shape and tone , were therefore suspended around the interior of the theatre , at regular intervals , in such a manner that their focus was in the middle of the stage : they were made to chord with each other ; and the actor 's voice , falling equally on all , reverberated in clear and unbroken tones . Another use made of musical tones , by the Greeks , was in their military engines . The Catapulta was a machine for throwing arrows and stones . A thick plank , of some elastic wood , having one end firmly fixed , was bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosed , the // plank returned violently to its original position , and discharged the missile with great force . The accuracy of the aim depended upon drawing with equal force each cord by which the plank was bent back ; and , in order to be certain of this , they struck the cords when in a state of tension , and determined , by the musical tone it returned , whether it were drawn tight enough or not . In closing our remarks upon Greek music , we can not forbear citing a very pleasant writer , in the Edinburgh Review , upon the subject : Greece , ' says he , was , without exaggeration , the land of minstrelsy . It is not to a few great names and splendid exhibitions , to temples and theatres and national assemblies , that we need appeal for the proof of this assertion . View her people in their domestic occupations , their hours of labor and refreshment ; peep into their houses , their work-shops , their taverns survey their farms , their vineyards , their gardens : from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek weaver sang at his loom , the reapers sang in the field , the water-drawers at the well ; the women , grinding at the mill , ' beguiled their toils with song . On board ship , was heard one kind of strains ; around the winepress , peeled another . The shepherd had his own peculiar stave - the oxherd , rejoicing in ballads more suited to horned bestial  --  the godlike swineherd disdained to be outdone . Greek nurses , like other nurses , soothed fretful infancy with lullabies Greek bathing-men were given to be musical . At bed and board , in grief , in love , in battle , in festivity , walking , running , swinging , sitting or recumbent , still they sang . Young men and maidens , old women and children , woke the untiring echoes . Beggars asked for alms , in verse . No occasion , great or small , of a mortal career , was without its appropriate harmony . Marriage had its epithalamia , its soporific strains at midnight , its rousing strains in the morning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to drop the curtain to soft music . In Italy , music had made some advances before the time of the Romans . On this subject , an American writer makes the following remarks . We can not doubt of the existence of music in Italy antecedently to the time of the Romans ; although no treatise has been handed down to us , on the subject , written in the Oscan or Etruscan langaage . When we bear in mind the number and splendor of the cities , possessed by the latter of these nations , the luxury of their inhabitants , the skill of the artists , particularly in the plastic art , and in the fabrication of those vases denominated Etruscan , which equal , in point of beauty , the famous Murrhine vases-when we cast our eyes on Capua , which was called Caput Urbium , from the circumstance of its being the first of the Etruscan colonies - on Pozzuoli , whose immense amphitheatre has survived the ravages of time , and served as a // model of the famous Coliseum of Flavianus - on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities-can we for a moment believe , that in such a country , in other words , in all the southwest districts of Italy , the musical art alone should not have been carried to the highest degree of perfection ? ' The Romans borrowed songs and musical instruments from this nation and from Greece ; and they employed music on the same occasions as these two ; but especially for religious ceremonies and in war . The flute was used on the stage to sustain the voice of the actor ; and it is supposed that the great orators employed a musician for the same purpose , when they addressed the people in the forum . Jt was not until the time of the emperors , however , that music reached its perfection among them . In the age of Augustus , ( as we are told ) the magnificent hymn , written by Horace , in honor of Apollo and Diana , which has been preserved to our day , was set to music and sung by two choirs , alternately- one composed of females , the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the succeeding Emperors , the art was cultivated with great care ; the instruments used were nearly the same as those of Greece , and it is probable that they were extremely good . One of them has been preserved uninjPred , to our own time . This instrument , which is the origin of the trombone , one of the most important pieces in modern bands , was dug up recently in Pompeii , where it had been buried for nearly two thousand years , and was presented by the King of Naples to the Emperor of Austria the lower part is of bronze , and the upper half , with the mouth-piece , of pure gold . The tones of this instrument are so fine , that modern art has never been able to equal them . The Emperor Nero excelled in playing on the harp ; and his reign may be considered the golden age of classic music . But , the art was solemnly proscribed at Rome after his death , for it was too painfully associated with his crimes ; it reminded the people of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his venerable preceptor , of his brother and his mother and both his wives ; it reminded them of the monster , who set fire to the city , and , during the nine days ' conflagration , sang to his harp of the burning of Troy . This epoch may be regarded as the close of Ancient Music . ' It was received into the Christian church atter this , and there developed with a power which was unknown to antiquity . Two buildings , on distant and opposite hills , in Rome , seem to record these facts : on one hand , is seen a bleak , weatherworn tower , rising in lonely grandeur amid the ruins of the past . On this tower , Nero is said to have stood , enjoying the awful fire he had occasioned , and exulting , with harp and song , over // the scene of destruction and woe which was passing beneath . On the opposite side of the city , and beyond the Tiber , stands the magnificent temple of St Peter 's - the most sublime and glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder of earth . There , are heard those marvelous tones , never equaled and inimitable - the perfection of Christian music . These edifices may be regarded as the monuments of ancient and modern* music ; each tells its own tale.
