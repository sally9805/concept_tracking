txt THIs volume is both a just and generous tribute to the memory of a good man ; - one of the martyr school , - whose names " smell sweet , and blossom in the dust . " The capaci-. ties of his character were such , that had he lived in any age or country , their energy must have hurried them into development , and distinction too , as inevitably as the waters flow to the sea . They did so as it was ; regardless indeed , apparently , of their destiny for a while , and wavering here and there by " many a winding bout , " through subterranean realms of shade ; yet true to themselves , through all things , - purified by the filtration they encountered , - accumulated , - accelerated , - and so struggling , and still struggling , onward and farther on , till finally the daylight gleamed , and they poured themselves forth to the sunshine , in the rejoicing rush of the cataract . Obscurity , penury , persecution , disaster , passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and how vainly do they , each and every one and all together , contend with tl ) e unconquerable xviii These things , we know , have become comparatively common in our times , - almost common-place . It is emphatically the adventurous age we live in . The Argonautic was not half as much so . The Roman was tame in comparison . The Chivalrous was sluggishness itself . The spirit which belonged then to individuals , belongs now to the era . That which was little above the physical propensities , - the blind impulse of ambition or acquisitiveness , or both , - and was busied almost exclusively , of course , like the strong man 's plirenzy , with wreaking its vengeance and wasting its vigor in sightless strivings to pull down the pillars of the great sanctuary of society , even over its own head , - that spirit ( if it can be called such ) is subdued at length in some good degree into subordination to the intellectual , social , spiritual instincts of man . New avenues are opened to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided between a camp and a charnel-house . Mind , instead of force , has become the arbiter of nations ; mind is the medium of influence , the measure of advancement , the minister to the gratification of those old longings of humanity , which , though never to be reasoned out of it , may yet be , and have been , . a thousand times refined . A diligent minister it is , - indefatigable indeed , but willing and disetetionary , - admitted to the privilege of advising and to the participation of results , - a companion and counsellor , more than a slave . The spiritual instincts , strictly , are included in the cataiogtie of resuscitated powers . The manifestations of these are in their nature noiseless , and void of ostentation ; and their achievements are the same ; but they are none the less real , nor the less considerable , for the want of those qualities which most attract the admiring gaze of men . The missionary spirit , alone , were sufficient to characterize the age . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental , as those have severally described it who chanced to be engrossed by its changing aspects ; - it is the age of each and all , - of glorious exertions , and great and splendid victories in all , - the age , as we began with saying , of adventure . The application of steam to purposes of navigation was an adventure . The railroad was another . Every discovery of science , and every // application of it in art and in practice , were others . So was the American Revolution ; and so was the French . So was the Temperance Reform ; and so was the Bible Society ; and the whole organization of Public Benevolence ; and the schmne of the Education of the People ; - all of them , and my riads more , harmonious issues of that stupendous source of sublime events and eAperiments , - the mind of man , - fairly awakened at last from its slumbers , and , as a giant refreshed , relieving its panting energies with the luxury of adventure . The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of enterprise . He devoted himself early to the cause of African Colonization , itself one of the noblest demonstrations of the enlightened intellect , and courageous but considerate enthusiasm of the titnes . At a critical period in its history , he became its ruling director ; and for years afterwards , the pregnant years of the formation of its first character , - the responsibility of its whole regulation depended upon him alone , as the Colonial Agent of the Institution . Nor is it too much to say , that the absolute preservation of the Colony , and its present existence , may be ascribed to his incredible exertions of an equally incredible energy ; united , indeed , with an extraordinary fitness in other respects , for the place he was found in at the momentous juncture referred to . Had the Colony utterly failed , and especially under the pressure of those gloomy circumstances , which it will be seen that Ashmun so effectually resisted and repelled , the shock , doubtless , would have proved fatal to the Association itself , and proportionately discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that charity , as well as to that unfortunate people themselves , in every similar and subsequent department of benevolent labor , at home and abroad . The scheme of colonization , indeed , - any more than the design of meliorating the condition of that people at large , could not have been destroyed . That scheme was , and is , and will be . indestructible . It might have been , and probably would have been , as transplanters say , killed to the ground ; - but killed to the root , it could not , and can not be . Its principles are in the circumstances of the population of this country , essentially vital , not to say indispensable ; and the application of them in experiment , however it might be or may be postponed or embarrassed , can no more be prevented , sooner or later , in one or another modification , than can the progress of // that population , and the growth of the country which contains it . Ashmun was born in the little town of Champlain , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among ten , of a respectable yeoman , who settled in that section at a period when it was a mere wilderness . He was designed for the farm , but a remarkable love of books , which he displayed in early life , decided his parents to give him a liberal education , and he commenced preparing for college at the age of fourteen . Soon afterwards , becoming deeply religious , he determined on adopting the clerical profession ; and the firmness with which he adhered to this resolution , alone , unadvised , and tempted as he was , - tempted by his poverty and his ambition , - is a striking evidence of the early maturity of that moral character , which subsequently proved the security , and sustained the welfare of all that depended on his official management and personal exertion . Enticements seemed to assail him , indeed , with the express determination , so to speak , of turning him aside , or driving him back from his purpose ; - sallying out upon him as he trudged along , - " remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something after the fashion of the abusive apparitions in the Arabian Tale , who so doggedly beset the way of the pilgrim along the hill-side , in his search for the singing-tree . For example , three years after commencing his preparatory course , in which no doubt he was greatly delayed by his situation , we find him in the town of Troy , unacquainted with any person there , without recommendation to any body , and with a few shillings only in his pocket , casting about for some employment which might procure him the means of farther pursuing his studies . In numerous applications he was unsuccessful . At length , he fell in with an attorney , principal justice also of the village , who promised him the aid he needed , which was in fact but apou-sto , in the business of " assisting him " a little , as the young man describes it " among his papers . " This gentlemen was pleased with him , and he offered to give him a complete course of legal tuition , and maintain him meanwhile in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him the greater portion of his time for the prosecution of favorite pur* suits . The justice , it seems too , " had a very small family , a // growing fortune , and treats me with the greatest respect . " * Probably , however , the advantages thus tendered him were conditional , and required the abandonment of his first designs . We find him , therefore , making farther inquiries of a person in Vermont , and proposin0 to engage in some business , " the avails of which , at the end of three more years would assist him in acquiring an education . " The resolution was clearly inflexible , and yet it is not till a year later that we find him in Middlebury College . Here he sustained himself , as so many others of the distinguished alumni of New England Colleges have done , by teaching a school as much of the time as the college regulations would permit , *but pursuing his studies all the while with an unwearied zeal , which , while it essentially injured his health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars of the institution to which he belonged . Thus will the invincible spirit of an iron resolution triumph over every obstacle . He says of himself in his Journal , and that justly , speaking of his residence at Troy , " I believe that at that time no offer of emolument , or of earthly distinction , would have seduced me from my purpose . " Such men are the " tenaces propositi . " Ashunun 's proposition bad been long before elected . He yearned for a sphere of spiritual usefulness , wider than the confinement of even any profession would allow him . He felt instinctively that such would be his true element in society ; and from the hour his heart was bent upon that end , nothing but death could stand in the way of its attainment . Circumstances , indeed , did stand , like lions " in the way . " Every thin0 opposed him . But what are circumstances to him who looks them fearlessly in the eye ? The royal animal will not bear that scrutiny of a human soul ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must submit to be harnessed and trained like a beast of burthen , - quails , and crouches howling away , under the same insufferable terror . The young many s incessant application , as might have been expected , soon compelled him to abandon his studies altogether for a time , and to travel through Connecticut and other sections , for the restoration of his health . Doubtless , though he appare*itly succeeded in its recovery to a tolerahle extent , it was but just tolerable after all ; and there can be no // reasonable question that at this period were established the incurable sources of that irritability and feebleness , which covered so much of his after life with gloom , and so much thwarted his most anxious desires , and finally , in the prime of his days , forced him to yield to the trials of a foreign climate and a laborious station , - after struggling for years with both , - through mere exhaustion of this early enfeebled frame . How filled are the annals of American Colleges with cases of this kind I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those which Ashmun possessed at the outset , and with such character too , - such energy , ambition , zeal to be useful , - have thus broken themselves down in the fine flower of a noble vigor , that , duly husbanded , might have made them the blessing and praise of the world . Who can estimate the loss to literature , liberty , religion ; - the loss from disease , and from death , alike , - the loss in what has been done , and in what has not been , and in how it has been done ; - to say nothing of the misery endured , and the imbecility entailed , and of the ultimate incalculable influences of all , including the contagion of evil example , ou the generations yet to follow us ! How extraordinary that persons ofsane mind in other respects , can labor under the horrible hallucination , that such a course will prepare them for usefulness ; and that like the poor Hindoo , who would fain flatter himself that he honors his Maker by swinging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily labor of their difficult suicide , deem themselves to be accomplishing the great ends of their existence ! Ashmun was so reduced in Connecticut , it seems , as almost to despair of ever returning to his friends ; * and yet his exertions , as Mr Gurley states , in several towns , were " frequent and great . " No wonder that " hundreds felt his appeals as those of a dying man . " He was dying . The whole of the residue of his life was a lingering torture . He struggled nobly , and accomplished wonders , - enough to prove the great things of which he was capable , - but the mind had battled the body till it was finally worn out and beaten down , and nothing remained for it , but to be dragged and dragged behind the chariot wheels , as it were , of its enemy , till its enemy itself became exhausted . We were prepared to expect from Mr. Gurley , an appropriate comment on this portion of the career of his subject , whose // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in higher estimation than we do ; but the evil , enormous as it is , has become too common to be relieved . Our professions are getting to be encumbered " with invalids , as Napoleon once wrote to his obedient legislature , that his hospitals were , - at the same time , demai*ding a fresh body of " men , - grown men , " - for it was the boys that drooped and fell by the road-side . The Biography we say , might have saved us this digression . The calamity has become national and alarming , till it assumes almost the hue of a crime . We feel that it demands at least a rebuke . Ashmun , however , was destined yet to live many years ; and his vacation , in spite of his injudicious use of a part of it , had the effect to restore his vigor in some good degree . He returned to College , and remained there some time longer . Pecuniary embarrassments then encountered him again , and he became a student at the Vermont University , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to the episode which follows next , in relation to the lady whom he afterwards married , we shall enter no criticism ; we hasten to a more agreeable part of the history . He engaged as principal , at the early age of twenty , of a newly instituted seminary , at Brewer , in Maine ,  --  since become flourishing at Bangor , - designed to promote Theological Education ; and here he labored , as well in his official capacity , as in his private studies , and his missionary expeditions besides , with an amazing energy and a corresponding success , which make us the more regret that occasion should have existed for the following sharp and sensible advice , addressed to him by a venerable clergyman , a trustee of the school - " You have preached twenty-five times in two months , that is thirteen we should have said twenty-five times more than you ought to have preached . You do right to tell me your faults , and I shall do right in reproving you . Hear me then . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race will be short . You ought to begin as you can hold out . Preach only when duty calls , and attend more to a regular course of studies . Count me not your enemy , because I thus write . It is not the language of hatred , but of love . " We thank Mr. Gurley for inserting these golden rules , even in a note . " Begin as you can hold out . " It should be marked in marble on the walls of every room where the mind 's martyrs burn themselves out by the // slow fire of the study . We want a new Temperance Reform , - not for those who drink too much , but for those who think too little . For the history of Mr. Ashmun 's residence in Maine , of the incidents connected with his marriage , and his various exertions at Baltimore , till he became editor of the Theological Repository , at the seat of government , we must refer the reader to the Memoir . At this period we begin to perceive the distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Review which he published of the second annual report of the Society , and in which he maintained the position that the Colony , to accomplish a benevolent design , must have for its basis the formation of the Christian Religion , is distinguished by the clearness characteristic of his mind , and has not been superseded to this day by maturer views regarding the same important topic . For three years , he discussed these matters in a desultory but increasingly interesting manner , till in 1820 he issued a periodical , intended to be exclusively appropriated to them . They had not , however , as yet , excited any thing like a general interest , and the work did not proceed . His resolution now wavered . It was not for lack of energy ; but peculiar circumstances , which we need not here revive , filled him with distressing doubts of the influence of his ministry . He had already preached a year or two ; but he undertook , in this stage of useless embarrassment , the study of medicine , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while , to earn by his daily labor , added to what he calls , " The weight of a most losing literary enterprise . " Still his destiny went on . At the request of a brother of the lamented Samuel Bacon , - a Massachusetts ' man , from Worcester County , - who had recently deceased , in the earliest attempt to found a colony on the African shore , - he engaged in the composition of a memoir of that gentleman . It was extended to a volume of over three hundred octavo pages ; and the work gives evidence of a vigorous enthusiasm and laborious reflection and research . Yet it occupied him apparently , with all his other engagements and anxieties brooding over him , but a few months of a single season . It seems that having got his materials together , he would shut himself in his room , and for days be visible only at his meals , or perhaps content himself with a cold collation , for which he trusted a servant ; and whatever the weather might be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to his study , upon Pennsylvama Avenue , half a mile distant , there to remain incessantly busy with his volume , till a late hour of the evening . But the work was finished , and the writer survived . We find him in charge of a Baltimore expedition of African emigrants , with whom , in August 1822 , he landed at Cape Montserado , sole agent , - his predecessors having by this time returned to America , - for the affairs of the little colonial settlement . We shall not follow the course of the Memoir . That would be essentially to furnish a history of the colony , which , in fact , Mr. Gurley has done , for all the period of Mr. Ashmun 's administration , embodying in his sketch a variety of documents and anecdotes of lively interest , which never before have seen the light , and whose value no person was better qualified to appreciate than himself . Whatever may be the disposition of the descendants of the first African colonists , " In the long line of coming days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors , - or the rational curiosity , in any quarter , to investigate the origin of one of the most remarkable movements of the age in which it began ; or let its course he as it may , it never can be said that the foundations of the scheme were laid , as those of other states have been , in obscurity ; or that the materials are wantin g for tracing the growth of the oak , back even to its source in the acorn . An outline of the situations severally in which Mr. Ashmun found the settlement at his arrival , and in which he left it at his death , - bearing in mind the means at his disposal , - will convey , perhaps , the best conception of the nature of his labors , and indeed no feeble estimate of his character also . It may at the same time be of service , in aiding those who are sufficiently ready to disparage and despise what has been done , - without much of a corresponding disposition to do anything themselves , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their fellowcitizens who have produced these results , such as they are , and to those who regard them as among the most extraordinary which human energy has , in any age , accomplished , or the wisdom of henev lerice projected . A purchase of territory from the native rulers had been effected ) previous to Ashmun 's arrival , but neither was the negotiatiori as yet wholly consummated , nor were any documents // defining the limits of the premises in possession of the Amencan party . The site of what is now Monrovia , on the Cape , as well as the greater portion of the peninsula , , was a complete wilderness , overgrown with dense forest , entangled with vine and brushwood ,  --  the haunt of savage beasts , - divided here and there only by the narrow pathway , .. cut by the natives , for access to the shore . In the bosom of this vast desert , just be gan the germ of civilization to be disclosed . A small spot bad been scooped out , as it were , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accustomed to hollow a log for the purpose of their rude navigation . About thirty huts were raised , and a small store*house , insufficient for its purpose . Some of the settlers were still without shelter of their own . What public property there had been was chiefly consumed hy a recent fire . No preparation had been made for the next expedition . The surrounding country was populous with hordes of savages , eager for booty , and ignorant of the character of these new-corners , - ard , in fact , they had already made no equivocal manifestations of a most formidable hostile purpose . Finally , the whole population of the settlement , including the Baltimore emigrants . did not exceed one hundred and thirty , of whose ability for defence it is sufficient to remarK that but thirty-five were capable of hearing arms . What auspices were these for an American colony in the very heart of the slave-coast ! Nor were the imnmeoiate circumstances of Ashmu.n 's landing better calculated to inspire him with sanguine expectations of success . The vessel , was scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shore , forced her off with the loss of an anchor ; and it was only with extreme difficulty that , after vain attempt fur forty-eight hours to sail out of the hay , the anchor being providentially recovered , she was at length brought to a fixed position , at the distance of some miles from the settlement . The weather continued boisterous ; the boatmen became sick ; the principal boat used in landing the cargo was lost ; and it cost the Agent a month of incessant labor , finally to accomplish that indispensable labor . *X e shall see more of his trials in the sequel . He commenced his administration with vigor immediately on his arrival . A colonial journal was opened . Inventories were made of the condition of the colony . A store-house was bebuildino first desi market-house , in gun , and a gned for a set // order for the re-captured Africans , who had formed a part of the last expedition . Efforts were at once used to ascertain the disposition of the chiefs . The agent had interviews with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits of conciliation to other potentates too numerous to mention . He extended the plan of the town . He gave the Africans a settlement of their own , and furnished them a system of instruction in all the practical arts of life . He made arrangements for receiving a few of the children of the natives into the colony , as pupils in civilization . And all this was subordinate to the great object of defence , and had been the work probably of less than a week ; for as early as the 18th we find it recorded , - a con* stant record being kept by the agent himself , - that " the present martello tower was planned , laborers employed in clearing the site , and a particular survey taken of the military strength and means of the settlers . " This survey shows a singular state of things . Of the Americans , " twenty*seven , when not sick , were able to bear arms , " t.hough , by the way , to bear them was all they could do , being wholly untrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors , now includin0 the duty of keeping 6p a continual night-watch of no fewer than twenty of their number . Then there were five iron guns , and cne hrass one , belonging to the settlement , hut unfortunately buried in the mud on the opposite side of the water ; besides , that four of the pieces required carriages before they could be used at all . When to this account it is added that there was no fixed ammur*ition , and very little of any sort , and that only hy great exertions and with much delay , was it practicable to load the only gun provided with a carriage , - we have a tolerable idea of the resources of the colony for defence against the myriads of barbarians who now hovered , hy day and night , nearer and nearer , over what they instinctively regarded as al* ready their appointed prey . We have omitted the mention of " forty muskets in store , which , with repairing , were capable of being rendered serviceable , " - that is , we suppose , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the element of Ashmun ; and he now hegan to live ; his indecision , if the remains of it had still lingered , floated away into thin air , like the mist of the morning . rrIirteen African boys , of the United States ' agency , were enrolled , and exercised in the use of arms . The guns were with infinite la // bor , one by one , transported into town , and mounted upon rou*h carriages . The muskets were repaired . The ammunition was made up . The toil of clearing the skirts of the settlement from the thick woods around it , which furnished a cover for the enemy 's approach , was commenced and carried on with energy . Military laws were issued , officers appointed , the settlement surrounded with abatis or other fencework , and ' the artillery stationed . The rains all this time were immoderate , and nearly uninterrupted . At length sickness came . Mr. Ash mun was seiied with a fever on the 25th . His wife had an ore gloomy . Interattack three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natives , and their children recalled . The recent emigrants were gradually taken down , till by the 10th of September , only two of their number remained well . Ashmun , meanwhile , held on , and bated not one jot . For four weeks he maintained " a difficult struggle , " as he calls it , with his disorder , but was never utterly discouraged . It was no uncommon thing for him during this period , to pass the night in delirious sufferin* , , and the subsequent morning in directing personally the execution of the public works ! What a magnificent spectacle of Christian courage and human energy , inspired indeed with more than mortal hopes I The whole history of the contests of civilization , and Christianity for a foothold in Pagan territory , does not furnish a more brilliant illus ration of the elements of perseverance , and success , which both comprise . Take another scene . On the 6th , the Agent , having matured his plans , and guarded against the event of his own decease , by communicating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together , read his instructions , published the regulations which he deemed essential to the general welfare , and addressed them on their condition and duties* Six days after we meet with this passage in his journal - " Rain falls in floods . The sick all seean better , except firs . Ashmun . Size is speechless and almost without the use of her reason . There is no rational hope of her recovery . Alt remedies which her husband dares to venture , have been tried in vain . " ' We scarcely need remark that no ' medical aid could be had in the colony . Again , he beheld " a female of most delicate constitution , iz1i'ng under the infin- ' ence of a mortal freer , in the corner of a miserable hut , ( to ventilate which in a proper manner was impossible ) , . on a // couch literally dripping with water , which a roof of thatch u'as unable to exclude . " She expired on the 15th , and poor Ashmun was relieved of her distress . He remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several weeks more , - incapable even of motion at times ; and it was not till the 7th November that he was able to recommence his entries . Fortunately , his people had made good progress meanwhile . He had not only possessed these brave fellows of his plans , but of no small portion of a less communicable quality of preparation , - the invincible intrepidity of his own spirit . FQrtunately , also , - using this word in its popular acceptation , - through the diligent faithfulness of an unknown individual , the Agent was now informed of all the movements and counsels of his barbarous enemies , from day to day ; and it is but justice to observe , that he apprised them frankly that he was so ,  --  at the same time warning them of his own wishes to continue at peace , and his equal determination , if attacked , to teach them " what it was to fight white men . " * There had been , and was , no pretext of a cause of hostility on their part ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the imputation to him , by his own countrymen , of a disposition , which no man could be farther from feeling , to embroil the colon yn a xvanton warfare . The frightful odds arrayed against bim , indeed , - and sure to be so , in case of any rupture , - 15 in itself abundant proof that he could cherish no notions of a belligerent policy . The miserable condition of the colony , too weak to resist even an ordinary attack , - his efforts in due season to conciliate his neii*hbors , - . and his remaining during the whole difficulty strictly in a posture of ( lefence , till , as mere lawyers say , he was " driven to the wall , " - are circumstances each of them equally and entirely conclusive on the same point . That conclusion indeed would have seemed almost self-evident , but for the discussions which some persons have affected to raise in regard to it . It would be gratifying to be informed what more peaceable or more forcible policy , either , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceable to conciliate or more forcible to prevent . Literally , " as far as possible , " in our Opinion , he followed the spirit of his divine master ; and we rejoice that , only in the exhaustion of that contirwency , he was found adequate to the subsequent crisis . // It caine on apace . On the 7th he had advices of a fresh movement . He inspected his works , and reviewed his gallant little force , - assuring them , " as the cause was emphatically that of God and their country , they might confidently expect His blessing . " The men slept on their arms , hut the night passed , as also Saturday the 9th , and Sunday the 10th , without alarm , though only the women and children on the latter day were considered at liberty to attend divine service , and the enemy were beard of , as encamped in a force of from six to nine hundred men , only half a mile from the village . About daylig**t , the next morning , they marched on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The savages marched up with a front of ten yards , discharged their muskets , and ran forward to seize the post at which they aimed . Some confusion followed . The guard retreated farther , on the reserve . Luckily , the barbarians were caught by their avidity for plunder , which they stopped to search for in some scattered houses . The settlers rallied . Two guns were brought up . The second discharge staggered the whole native force . A few innsketeers , besetting their flank , increased the agitation . in twenty minutes they recoiled . The guns made horrible havoc , in a mass of eight hundred men , fully exposed , and densely crowded . It was insufferahle . They raised a yell of savage terror , and fled en masse to the woods . Their loss was very large , hut never precisely ascertained ; Mr. Ashmun gives the following account of the greater part of his own . " One woman who had imprudently passed the night in the house first beset by the enemy , had received thirteen wounds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her house with her two infant children , received a wound imq the head , from a cutlass , and was robbed of both her babes ; but providentially escaped . A young married woman , j with the mother of five small children , finding the house in which they slept surrounded by savage enemies , barricaded the door , in the vain hope of safety . It was forced . Each of the women then seizing an axe , held the irresolute barbarians in check for several minutes longer . Having discharged their guns , they seemed desirous of gaining the shelter of the house previous to reloading. - At length , with the aid of their spears , and by means of a general rush , they over Mrs. Ann Hawkins ; who after tong and ineredibte sufferings recovered , and is yet living . $ Mrs Minty Draper . * Mary Tines. // came their heroine adversaries , and instantly stabbed the young-. est to the heart . The mother , instinctively springing for her suckling babe , which recoiled through fright , and was left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , and providentially escaped to the lines , unhurt , between two heavy fires . " The force of the settlers amounted to thirty-five persons , including six boys , and about half of them were engaged , the rest duly maintaining their stations . The proportion of numbers , therefore , was atleastforty to one , in the enemy 's favor ! The lines were now contracted , the dead buried , the wounded disposed of as well as they could be , and the men freshly disciplined . On the 17th , half the people as the journal states , had the extraordinary privilege of attending divine service . Fresh efforts were made for peace , but in vain . The 23d , was observed as a day of humiliation , thanksgiving and prayer . A Liverpool vessel put in , and served ro keep off the enemy for some days . At this time , exclusive of rice , there was not fifteen days ' provision in store , - the population were subjected to " allowances , " - the ammunition was insufficient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to these facts we add that seven of the children were now in the hands of the natives , and quite a number of the people wounded and sick , not to say dispirited , we shall he able to appreciate the spirit which the Agent still continued both to exhibit , and to inspire , in a great degree , into those around him . The savages came on again , in the morning of December 2nd , in two opposite quarters . In one , three several onsets were most bravely resisted , with some carnage . In the other , they had four times rushed forward , and were driven back by the heavy guns . They then flied off for another post , hut the Agent perceiving the movement , lay in wait from the stockade , and gave them as they passed such a reception as soon staggered them again . The order of retreat was issued , and the whole force , after a series of skirmishes , which continued over an hour , almost instantaneously disappeared . Their loss was very considerable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - probably as many as fifteen hundred . Their plan of attack was judicious , and firmly supported , and their musketry managed with activity at least , since it seems " the quantity of shot lodged in the paling , and thrown within the lines was almost incredible . " They loaded sometimes a foot deep , with iron // and copper slugs . They had cannon , but loading them was a half-hour 's business , and the adroitness of the colonists in the use of the same articles , was by them ascrihed to sorcery . Two of the latter were badly , and one mortally wounded . Mr. Ashrnun received three bullets in his clothes , but escaped safe . The settlers universally behaved with the utmost coolness and vigor . On an equal distribution of the shot among the guns after the hattle , less than three rounds for each were found remaining ! And thus ended one of the most remarkable contests recorded in all the history of man . It saved the colony at the time from total destruction , and has preserved its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , from that day to this . It must have been noticed , how striking were some of the escapes of the Agent , as well as the colony . Another case of the kind occurred on the 3d , when an accidental alarm , given by a guard , proved the means of bringing relief to the settlement . It was a British schooner , with stores , and having on hoard the celebrated traveller Laing , by whose influence the chiefs were afterwards bound to a truce . A midshipman and eleven seamen , were left to see it preserved ; nine of these died within a month . Mr. Ashmun relapsed again into his fever , but his guardian genius succored him by the opportune arrival of a medical Frenchman , who administered a violent remedy , which cured him . The captives were restored . Trade was opened with the natives , and visits made among them . A new expedition came out in May . Ahout this time he wrote home , - " We are now ahout one hundred and fifty strong , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store-houses , and a heavy , substantial stone-tower , mounting six pieces of ordnance . Harmony and industry in a good degree prevail . Thus you see we are prepared to go on and fulfil the anxious wishes of the friends of the cause , in relation to the cultivation of the lands , and the formation of a regular , moral and happy society . " A change indeed ; ! And all accomplished , within a few months , and by the energy of a single man ! " A young man , " too ,  --  as his biographer , who has conducted this narrative with great animation , well remarks , - " and hred to letters , of retired habits , educated for the ministry of Christ , unknown to fame , the victim of disappointment , burdened with debt , touched by undeserved reproach ; " - *. and , of course , he might have added , waiving his domestic afflictions , - with a feeble constitution at best , now // exhausted almost to the last degree of endurance , by a long process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last expedition , and his presence somewhat relieved Mr. Ashmun of his labors , though he still continued acting a.s agent . It is a striking illustration of his character , how eagerly he embraced this little interval of comparative leisure , for a few months , - which doubtless his health demanded should be so used. , - to rush freshly into the old habit of indefatigable application to his studies . Four hours daily , for three months , he devoted , in that enfeebling climate , to Blackstone 's Commentaries ; and French , and history and criticism , and politics , and works of imagination even , and a good deal of constant composition besides , were added to the labors of the law . In the next March , we find him writing , as might be expected , to the managers , for an opportunity to return to this country , on account of his growing infirmities , which however came not . His only relief was a voyage to the Cape de Verde Islands ; in the preparation for which he ruptured an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to the last point of exhaustion , when , - as his better star sometimes arose , when he looked for it least , - a French vessel came in sight , and a surgeon stopped his hemorrhage in half an hour . But we will not pursue the history in its details . Many of them , it would be as unpleasant as it is needless to revive . Of the misunderstandIng between the Agent and the Board , and the explanation of it , a full account is published in the Memoir ; but it is enough to remark here , that justice was done at last , and that both the Society and the public at large were finally convinced that , while the progress and prosperity of the settlement were wholly ascribable to him , as long as he remained there , - and a most essential proportion of them , from that time forward , it would probably be vain to expect that the place , by his departure left vacant , could ever he supplied . Even by the close of 1826 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lie had laid , immovably , on that heathen shore , the foundations of a Christian empire . " The colonists were universally attached to him . The barbarians , who had fought him , now knew him by the cudearing titles of " Head-man for all their country , " and " Father of we all . " An excellent system of laws was established . New and flourishing settlements had been founded , and great accessions of valuable territory mada // in various directions . Two handsome churches adorned the village of Monrovia . Batteries , forts , a market house , a Lancasterian school house , a town house , and several other buildings were at this time going up . The colony was in perfect health . A colonial schooner was launched . The commerce had increased with such rapidity , that traders had made a profit of over *3O , OOO between January and July , in African produce sold to foreign vessels ; and a New England merchant , who landed a cargo , worth *8 , OOO , was paid for the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a public library , at this period , of twelve hundred volumes . What a contrast to the state of affairs four years before ! The annals of colonization , from first to last , furnish no precedent for it . Mr. Ashrnun continued in the colony till he was no longer able to discharge his duties , and a voyage was resorted to , as the last source of a hope of recovery . On the 25th of March , 1828 , attended by the affectionate good wishes of all his people , he went on hoard the brig Dorris , " and with the feelings , " says his Biographer , " which seek despairingly for expression , through the eyes of the dying , in their last fixed look upon an object which the heart holds fast to its final moment , " left Africa forever . He spent some time at St. Bartholomew 's , - felt his strcn0th revive a little , and took passage for New Haven in July , - was exhilarated for a day or two by the joy of arrival among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai*-ranged his private affairs , - bequeathed his little property to the cause of African missions , - dictated a letter of business , from his bed , on the last day of his life , - prayed over his little African ward , who stood in tears beside him , - affectionately parted with those who watched with him to the end , ( including the friend who has given in this memoir so beautiful a proof of his appreciation of the martyr 's character ) , - and at length " expired gently , and in a moment , on the evening of the 28th of August , 1828 , in the thirty-fifth yearof his age . " We shall close the-ma0nificent but melancholy scene , with the eloquent closing passages of the volume before us , including , it will be perceived , a sketch of one of the most touching little incidents it is possible to conceive . The reverential affection of Ashmun for his parents , and indeed the faithfulness with which he clung to every attachment , were among the most delightful traits , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fond admiration of all who knew him . // " A large concourse of the citizens of New Haven , and of the neighboring towns , united in a solemn tribute of respect to his memory , and attended his remains to the grave . The assembly had already filled the Central Church , to which the body of the deceased was conveyed , and the Minister of Christ just concluded his humble supplications to the God of all mercy and consolation , when a venerable , solitary female , entered the congregation , and with a look which told what her tongue might in vain have essayed to speak , approached the corpse . It was the mother of Ashmun ! Every heart in that vast assembly beat fainter , as they beheld this aged matron , who had travelled for several days and nights from a remote part of the country , in the hope of embracing her living son , pressing her lips and her heart upon the coffin which concealed all that remained of that son in death , forever from her sight. * " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( which has been given to the public ) was a just and eloquent defence of the spirit , that animates the martyrs to a great and good cause , and under the power of which Ashmun had sacrificed his life in the service of Africa . His example ( said the preacher ) shall speak . ' " There have been men whose names are way-marks ; whose examples , through successive ages , stir the spirits of their fellow men with noble emulation . What has been done for God , and for the souls of men , and for the cause of wretched human nature , by the lustre which gathers around the name of David Brainard . How many lofty spirits has the simple history of his toils and sorrows kindled and roused to kindred enterprise . Other names there are , which beam from age to age with the same glory . Howard , Clarkson , Swartz , Mills , - what meaning is there in such names as these . Our departed friend will add another to that brilliant catalogue . He takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellated spirits , who have gained A name in heaven , by power of heavenly deeds ' " Let us praise God for the light of his example , which shall never be extinguished , and which , as it beams on us , shall also beam on our children , and our children 's children , moving them to deeds of godlike benevolence . The warmth of the season rendered it imprudent to open the coffin , - a circumstance painful at the time , - but which left uneffaced in the memory of the venerable parent of Ashmun , those pleasing ideas of her son , which his early manly beauty had impressed upon it. * // PraIse for yet one more name , with power endowed To cheer and guide us , onward as we press ; Yet pne more image , on the heart bestowed , To dwell there , beautiful in holiuess . ' " We have come to his grave . A simple , but beautiful monument , erected by the Managers of the American Colonization Society , in the church-yard of New Haven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which affection and piety have planted with trees and flowers , as if anxious to throw a charm and fragrance around the resting-places of the dead ) , bears the name of Ashmun . This monument may perish , but that name never , it is engraven on the heart of Africa . " In his person , Mr. Ashmun was tall , - his hair and eyes light , - his features regular and cast in the finest mould , - his manners mild , yet dignified , - and in his countenance , an expression of the gentlest affections softened the lineaments of a lofty , firm , and fearless mind . " He early saw the truth and felt the power of the Christian Religion . Its principles were ever living and active in his soul . The passions of youth might war against them , - in the conflict with temptation , they might seem , for a moment , giving way ; but they were indestructible , - of the seed of God that liveth and abideth forever . " In grief , and temptation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pain , - when so cast down by affliction , that his soul became weary of life , he acknowledged himself under the discipline of the Almighty ; he praised the name of God with a song , and magnified it with thanksgiving . While , with David , he remembered the works of God and his wonders of old , his troubled thoughts were soothed , and he exclaimed , " Why art thou cast down , 0 my soul ? Why art thou disquieted within me ? Hope thou in God ; for I shall yet praise Him , who is the health of my countenance and my God . ' Strengthened by the consolations of God , his spirit rose towards the innumerable company of just men made perfect , who , once in tribulation like his , , now stand inaccessible to misery or to danger , on the mountains of glory , ' and seem to bend upon him looks of tenderness and love . Such is the power of dispensing blessings which Providence has attached to the truly great and good , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for death consecrates their example ; and the wisdom , which might have been slighted at the council-table , becomes oracular at the shrine . Those rare excellencies , which make our grief poignant , make it likewise profitable ; and the tears which wise men shed for the // departure of the wise , are among those that are preserved in J1eaven. ** " Spirit of Ashmun ! dost thou not look down upon me , while to that cause , to which thou gayest thy all , thy life , I dedicate this humble offering to thy worth ? I cast it on thy grave , - for there , a potent and unslumbering spirit dwells , which will not leave it voiceless . Thou hast not lived , - thou hast not died in vain . I hear responded from ten thousand tongues , thou hast not lived ,  --  thou hast not died in vain . The light thou hast kindled in Africa shall never go ouit ; the principles thou hast exemplified , are true and everlasting . Thy country shall yet , - shall soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetter shall be worn by the guiltless , - when upon Africa , now just awakening to a sense of her miseries , and stretching out her hands for help , she shall have conferred , in the free spirit of the Great Master of Christians , her language , her liberty , and her religion ; rewarded with the gratitude of millions , and the honors of all nations clustering thick upon her , - Africa , - America , - the World shall know , thou hast not lived , - thou hast not died in vain . Thou hast left behind , Powers that will work for thee ! air , earth , and skies ; There 's not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee ! thou hast great allies ! Thy friends are exultations , agonies , And love , and man 's unconquerable mind . ' We might have called attention to those portions of this work which discuss , in a very able manner , some of the most interesting subjects connected with the scheme of African Colonization ; but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , which , independently of the peculiar qualifications of Mr. Gurley for doing them justice , can not fail to secure them sufficient consideration . Faults , also , could be pointed out in the composition ; and the size of the volume , in our opinion , might be reduced beneficially for its circulation ; but it is , as we called it in the outset , so intrinsically both a just and generous work , - so liberal and so laborious , alike , - that we can indulge in no disposition to criticise for a moment . It would have been a far more grateful and a far more useful task , were tbere space for it , to illustrate from the pages of this single volume , as it would have been easy to do , with what surprising sagacity the mind of Ashmun , in the // infant stage of the scheme to which he devoted his life , had completely apprehended and anticipated all the principles subservient to its prosperity , and all the consequences involved in its issue . Its ablest advocates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afresh from the study of his writings , as well as from the observation of his policy . No man more deeply felt , especially , how essential to tbe great ends of the Colony 's establishment , not to say to its existence , - would be found the reliance of its managers , and the cultivation of the character of its population , on the basis of the Christian religion , as a point of primary moment . He perceived , too , the importance of its commercial capacities , and the greater importance of sustaining its agriculture , its arts , its system of education , its strict morality , its health , its harmony with its neighbors ,  --  in a word , of making it at all events , and above all things else , a desirable place for the colored man to go to . That is the sum and substance of the plan ; and it is simple , intelligible , unexceptionable ; and what is more to the purpose , practicable ; and not practicable only , hut available to an indefinite extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish the population , whose welfare is and was the first consideration for its maintenance , and for its institution , - and as the providentially inexhaustible and splendid abilities and fitness of the other continent to receive . All this is substantiated ; and the colony , therefore , should it perish to-day , no more than Ashmun , " would have lived in vain . " It would have accomplished a great purpose , - the great purpose of all others , - the establishment of a conclusive experiment in fact , and of an inevitable inference in reason , that the degree of the extension of that experiment , and its benefits hereafter , may now safely be left to the experience , added to the intelligence , of the American people ; and that it will be limited only by the amount of the energies which those powerful agents , severally interested in its development , from time to time , shall themselves be willing to expend in its prosecution . To make the Colony , we say , a desirable resort of the colored man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It implies everything in the mode of the management , and everything in the nature of the results . It implies , as Ashmun well knew , a scrupulous care in the selection of emigrants , and a slow and cautious progress of the settlement for many years , - a policy , from the temporary // postponement of which to the gratification of a general eagerness to hurry the benefits of the institution , all its temporary inconveniences niay be plainly deduced . It implies , not emigration of more colonists , but education and care of those already gone over ; not the increase of the Colony as a prime policy , but its welfare first , and of course its increase after ; its reputation ; the already beginning series of new experiments , rising around it , ( like the flourishing Pennsylvania and Maryland settlements ) , each improved by the practice of the last , and by the genial light of the period in which it originates ; th' gradual growth of a system of voluntary emigration ; the spread of a prosperous commerce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the slave-trade of the coast ; the promotion of science ; the propagation of Christianity ; in fine , as we said before , the indefinite amplification of the entire scheme , with all its immense and endless issues.
