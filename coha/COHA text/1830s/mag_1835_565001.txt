txt I HAVE been a wanderer on the face of the earth , and am not yet satisfied to be at rest . In this interval , I set down for your amusement - for edification I may not call it - some notices of men in different climates and under various governments . China has a vast population , for there is little celibacy , war , or pestilence ; many find no cover set for them at nature 's table - the straightened parents suppress the best law of nature , and cast their helpless offspring upon the streams . The infants , thus abandoned , are tied in a box , and many are rescued by public officers . It xvould be batter , that the officers should be appointed rather to receive them from the parents . The water , like the land , hath its inhabitants - two millions , to whom the earth is but an occasional element , have no home but the frail barks on the rivers . These boats , at the large cities , are moored in lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole population may be one hundred and fifty millions ; of these , one million and two hundred thousand are soldiers - better fitted , however , to suppress insurrections at home than to achieve foreign conquests . The Chinese are , to an extreme , the reverse of warlike , or the Great Wall had never been built to show how much their industry exceeds their courage . In all China , there are but about a hundred family names , and the Chinese are sometimes called , collectively , the hundred names . ' No marriages are contracted between persons of the same name . The Chinese dress , it has been said , was devised by Modesty herself , though it is little indebted to Taste . It is loose and clumsy , and conceals the shape . The Chinese have a repugnance to the display of the human figure , even in sculpture ; the less they have of virtue the more they pretend to decorum . The chief garment is a long and loose robe , bound with a silken sash , from which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rich pipe , tobacco-pouch , two watches , and a fan . No gentleman is dressed without his fan . This peaceful instrument hangs in a case , like a scabbard , and is xvorn alike by civil and military . The dress of the females nearly resembles that of the men but the colors are more gaudy . A Chinese lady conceals every part but her face ; she trims her eyebrows into an arched line , stains her teeth , paints her face , and permits her nails to grow several inches - carrying them in a sheath of bamboo . Her // feet are cramped , in childhood - making childhoo I a season of torture , and crippling her through life , so that she rather totters than walks . The compressing bandages occasion so much pain , that children are sometimes restrained by force from tearing them off . The shoe of a belle is four inches in length and two in width . These horrid feet are called golden lilies. * As the Chinese never change their dress from motives of cleanliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as there is no washing machine , no washing , and but an unfrequent dipping of the garments in ley , - the presence even of a grandee may he detected hy more than one of the senses . There are no handkerchiefs , hut little pieces of paper are used for the nose , and the hands are wiped on the sleeve of the rohe . Truth requires it to he said , that vermin spare not the highest classes . One badge of servitude only is retained - the long queue , derived from the Tartars . It is a single tuft of hair , depending from the crown , xvhile the rest of the head is shaven : it reaches to the waist , and is terminated hy a braid of silk . A Chinese can not he more disgraced than hy losing his queue , or more affronted than by having it pulled . When he stands , it hangs down , but when he runs , it stands out:horizontally . The Chinese are neither so good nor so had as they have been represented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society in which there was no discord , though there was no freedom , were prone to overvalue it , and the French writers spread the same delusion over Europe . Two opposite parties in France vied in extolling the Chinese - the Jesuits , to show the linportance of a country they were converting - and the philosophers , that they might prefer the doctrines of Confucius to Revelation . Subsequent travelers , finding much of this praise undeserved , were perhaps disposed to deny credit to the Chinese for their actual virtues , and described them , in general terms , as dishonest , inhospitable , cowardly , false , and ungrateful . No foreigner , however , has of late had an opportunity of seeing them to good advantage , and it is admitted that they are , with all their faults , tractable , frugal , cheerful , and most industrious . Their moral virtues rest upon a slender foundation , but their habits are domestic . The despotism of the government , the severity of the police , and the demoralizing tendency of corporeal punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks , must lead to the abasement of the people . The bamboo , like the cudgel in Russia , is never at rest ; it is the image of authority ; honor and generosity vanish before it , and falsehood and meanness are as general as the fear of it . The shadow is followed , rather than the substance ; ceremony is a greater study than duty . Yet , nothing is more common than moral inscriptions in houses and shops ; they are a part of Chi // nese ostentation . They are like much of the national lore , indisputable truisms , as - when men discover their errors , they ought to reform ; ' act with sincerity , and you will be trusted . ' A saying peculiarly Chinese , is - music distinguishes the honorable from the ignorant ; cereniony , the courtier from the plebeian . ' Ceremony makes up the life of a Chinese ; it is his study , his guide ; there is no authority so strong with him as custom . The very children of the higher classes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrains them from the natural sports of childhood . The books of ceremonies are numerous , and regulate nearly every occurrence in life . The invitation to a feast is repeated several times , in writing , before it is accepted , and after this distant skirmishing the battle of ceremony begins . A Chinese banquet is not to be tasted without long study and practice in the ceremonial . Vauban never had more indirect modes of approaching a fortification than the Chinese have in sitting down to dinner . Each guest has a small table to himself , but no one must begin until all are ready ; and in eating , the company preserve the regularity of a drill . To drink , is a more serious undertaking . The head-waiter , falling on his knees , invites the company to take a glass , when the parties rise , as one man , and walk solemnly into the middle of the room , each one holding his cup with both hands ; these they raise as high as their lips , and then sink them almost to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is repeated several times , each one watching intently the progress of the other , and no one drinking until , after many attempts , the cups all touch the lips at the same moment . The cups are then drained and inverted , and , after various salutings , the company return to their seats . To the Chinese , we are indebted for that convenient subterfuge , the visiting-card ; hut we have reduced to a single slip , that which is , in China , a pocket-volume . The Koton , or act of adoration ' to the emperor , is performed by nine prostrations . The English diplomacy , on these ceremonies , consumed as much time as the object of the mission , and after all their caution , the distrustful strangers were marched back to their ships , under flags , describing them as tribute-bearers to the emperor . By an imperial order , it was arranged , at Lord Amherst 's reception , that His Majesty should , with profound veneration , ascend the throne , in the Palace of Light and Splendor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the band should play the Lung Ping , ' or a glorious subjugation . ' Then the great officers were to proclaim the word Peen , ( whip ) and the band to play Che-ping , a subjugating sway . ' The Chinese , though insolent to foreigners , for whom the common term is foreign devil , are timid before magistrates , having // been trained to obedience under institutions that have inverted the very passions and instincts of nature . A Chinese child is early made to believe that the emperor is the general Tather , and that to resist his authority is both treason and impiety . The books abound in anecdotes of dutiful children ; they uphold the fifth commandment ; parents are cherished , and infants abandoned to perish . Many of the incidents related of filial duty are peculiar . The highest encomiums have been bestowed on the son of parents who were too poor to purchase curtains to their bed ; he prescribed it to himself , to lie motionless upon his own couch and let the mosquitos feast upon him , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number that afflicted his parents . But the art of defence is taught in books , though there are no pitched battles . The Canton Register says , that the first lesson of a boxer is to thrust , for hours , at a bag of sand , and he varies his assault in the maneuvres called  - -   - -   - -   a dragon thrusting out his claws , a drunken China-man knocking at your door , and a crane and eagle reciprocally embarrassed . ' To an American traveler , China seems like another planet . Its peculiarities of language and customs have preserved the nationality , by rendering difficult all communication with foreigners . The first impression of a stranger is , that he is in the midst of a redundant population ; everywhere he sees masses of people , chiefly of one sex , for females are secluded . The good-humor of the crowd is remarkable ; there is no brawling or complaint , except the wailing of some unpitied offender undergoing the bamboo , for justice here is prompt , if not discriminating . In the interior , the foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pagodas ; he sees fields without cattle or enclosures , and soldiers in paper helmets and quilted petticoats , fanning themselves , or kneeling to salute a passing officer . The shops glitter with varnish and gilding , and gaudy lanterns are suspended before them , incribed - they do not cheat here , ' to remove the more probable belief that they do . There are many T ) rocessio1*s , civic , military , ntiptial and funereal . In these is music , in which noise prevails over harmony . The streets offer every variety of occupation . There , the barber has his chair , the cobbler , his bench . At sunset , the tumult of the busy and the idle ceases , the streets are deserted , and the city is quiet . The Chinese have , if not invention , a great talent for imitation , and copy , very exactly , any European work . Their powers of deception are great , and the cheats of a city almost equal in number every bargain and sale . No purchaser , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weight ; and many a foreigner , at Canton , has bought as a capon only the skin of one , adroitly stuffed ; or as a ham , a gammon , from which he could slice nothing but chips . The condition of females is universally // the test of civilization , and in China their lot is deplorable . Few of them can read , and all , whose condition permits it , are secluded . They are drudges and slaves , not wives . They are contracted without their own consent , and they may be repudiated without their own fault . The stronger sex have made the laws which bind the weaker to domestic servitude , forgetful that Providence has entrusted the protection of the weak to the generosity of the strong . The Chinese have considerable skill , and many secrets in the arts , which they seem to have obtained by accident , for they are ignorant of the principles . They have lenses and spectacles , without a knowledge of optics . Their music is rude and discordant , and , to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate numbers , readily , by means of a table with balls . They carve neatly , in ivory and xvood , and we are familiar , in this country , with their concentric moveable globes , one within another , and all cut from one piece of ivory . Many of their inventions were anterior to the same in Europe , but they have been little improved . They had , centuries ago , a knowledge of gunpowder , of the magnet , and of printing . Yet , their guns are clumsy match-locks ; their types , stereotype pages cut in wood ; and their mariner 's compass is a guide little to be trusted . Types are so cumbrous , that they are housed in large buildings , and a memorandum is made in a book , stating where they may be found for a future edition . The general beverage is tea , which is taken at all hours , and always without sugar or milk , hot water being poured upon the leaves in the cup . The tea is much improved by a voyage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canton , is a box which has been returned . The conoscenti in tea are very careful to boil the water over a fire made of pine , in an earthen vessel made in a particular province , and to infuse it in a cup of another kind . The manner of presiding at a tea-table is , in this ceremonious country , an art with its principles , rules , and instructers . The emperor , Kien Long , recorded the virtues of tea in an ode , which may be read on half the tea-cups in the Empire . On a slow fire set a tripod , whose color and texture show its long use ; fill it with clear snow-xvater , boil it as long as would turn a fish white , and a cray-fish red , throw it upon the delicate leaves of choice tea in the cup , and let it remain as long as the vapor rises in a cloud . At your ease drink this precious liquor , which will chase away the five causes of trouble . We may taste and feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' The Chinese language has no affinity with any other . In the tongues of Europe , the knowledge of one is a step towards another ; but when the linguist has mastered many languages , he has few principles to aid him in the Chinese . The written and // oral languages are entirely different . The spoken is composed entirely of monosyllables , and these are few , though they are varied by various tones and inflections , some of them so delicate , that they escape an European ear ; thus , the word po signifies , among many other things , an old woman , a captive , wise , inclined , a very little , to boil , to winnow rice , to prepare , and to cleave . This ambiguity of language leads the Chinese to use many gestures and contortions of body , in speaking ; and they often make with a finger the sign or character which expresses the thing . The number of sounds in the language , which can be expressed in English , are about three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two hundred different ideas . All words are indeclinable ; there is neither gender , number , case , mode , tense , or person . This defect is remedied in part by an invariable order , or following of the words . Their written language is good in theory , only it expresses no sound - being intended , without the intervention of it , to represent ideas alone . The characters are , some of them , rude representations of the objects signified , as in the sign for a woman , child , &amp;c . The character for a prison is an enclosure  --  and a dot in it , represents a captive . The character for a tree , if used twice , represents a thicket - and thrice , a forest ; that for time , repeated , is eternity . Many of the emblems , expressing simple ideas , are ingeniously compounded ; thus , the character for mother and water , when combined , make the sea , mother of waters . Good and word , unite to make praise ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - also , by the sign for a broken reed . The signs for ear and door , make to listen ; to grieve , is expressed by a heart and knife ; and to meditate , by a heart and field . A bargain is denoted by a word and a nail . The sign for a barber is compounded of the characters for razor and respect ; and comfort is expressed by the emblems for rice and mouth . Happiness is denoted by the characters for children and land ; and this symbol embroidered , is often presented by the emperor as a mark of peculiar favor . The Chinese are as little gallant in their signs as in their courtships . The sign for a wife is compounded of woman and broom ; and security is represented by a claw placed over a woman . To scold , is expressed by the signs for two women ; and levity is a man between two women . Conceited , is a woman and to strut ; anger , a woman and sour wine . handsome , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a woman and take . There is a general key , by which about two hundred characters , which enter into the composition of most others , may be known . These characters mark the principal objects of nature , and are the roots or genera of the language . The dictionaries are arranged in reference to them . The heart is one of these roots ; and the curved lines for heart , enter // into the character , for all sentiments , passions and affections . Under the genus hand , are arranged all trades and manual employments ; and under that of word , all kinds of speech , dehate , stu ( ly , writing and knowledge . Some of the usual figures of speech are peculiar ; a mat or bed is called the kingdom of sleep ; the head , the sanctuary of reason ; the eyes , the stars of the forehead ; the stomach , laboratory of aliments ; and a lamb , a sucker on its knees . The xvounded , in a battle , are said to be spoiled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fundamental part of the Chinese penal code , has been translated by Sir George Staunton . The first and greatest crime is treason , which is defined to be an attempt to violate divine order of things upon earth ; resistance to the emperor , is therefore a disturbance of the peace of the universe . ' The punishment for treason , is to be executed by a lingering and painful death ; the criminal 's goods are confiscated , and all his male relations , over sixteen years of age , and within the degree of father , grandfather , son , paternal uncles and their sons , are put to death . If under sixteen years , they are enslaved . The other crimes , defined next after treason , and punished with nearly equal severity , are desertion , or quitting the empire to adhere to a foreign power ; parricide , or an attempt to murder a parent , grandparent , uncle or aunt ; massacre , or the murder of three or more members of one family ; sacrilege , or stealing from temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or administering to him any improper medicines ; impiety , or disrespect to parents or near relations , or refusal to honor their memory ; discord , or maltreating members of the family ; and insubordination , or rising of the people . The penalty for these crimes is never remitted . In the laws regulating the palace , it is provided that the emperor s physician shall receive a hundred blows , if he administer unusual medicines ; and that the cook , if he serve up unusual food , shall first swallow it and then receive a hundred blows . If his majesty ask a question , the first officer in rank is directed to reply ; and if an inferior should speak first , he is muleted in a month 's salary . Any officer of state , who ambitiously addresses the emperor , in artful terms , soliciting places , is punished by a hundred blows , and if he falsely accuse another officer , is beheaded . The government is , in theory and practice , a despotism . The will of the emperor is above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general Father , for his government , such as it is , is called paternal.
