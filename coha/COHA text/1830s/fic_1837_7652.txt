Hoffman , Charles Fenno , 1806-1884 : IMPROMPTU TO A LADY BLUSHING. from Impromptu to a lady blushing ( 1837 ) 1 The lilies faintly to the roses yield , 2 As on thy lovely cheek they struggling vie , 3 ( Who would not strive upon so sweet a field 4 To win the mastery ? ) 5 And thoughts are in thy speaking eyes revealed , 6 Pure as the fount the prophet 's rod unsealed . 7 I could not wish that in thy bosom aught 8 Should e'er one moment 's transient pain awaken , 9 Yet ca n't regret that thou  --  forgive the thought  --  10 As flowers when shaken 11 Will yield their sweetest fragrance to the wind , 12 Should , ruffled thus , betray thy heavenly mind .
