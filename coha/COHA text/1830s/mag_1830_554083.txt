txt Perhaps no question , since the organization of the general government of the United States , has attracted more attention among the thinking members of our community , than the present controversy respecting Indian rights . Other questions have borne a more immediate relation to the present interests of the people . Embargo , xvar , commerce , the triumph of one political party and the defeat of another , are topics in which the mass of the inhabitants of a free country feel a deep interest , and on which they express their feelings strongly and simultaneously . It can not be expected , that the condition of a few tribes of secluded Indians should at once claim and secure the sympathies of millions , who are occupied , if not engrossed , by their own pursuits , and who spend little time in contemplating the sufferings of men whom they never saw , or in attempting to redress grievances , which are totally different from any that are likely to be imposed upon themselves . Yet , with all the disadvantages of their situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , virtuous , and honorable of the American people , who would deal justly and faithfully by them , and who would make personal sacrifices of time , labor , and money , to protect and defend their rights . Indeed , so far as the people of the United States understand the subject , and are free from the influence of violent political partialities , their feelings are almost universally favorable to the claims of the Indians . All profess to wish well to the remnants of tribes still among us , and doubtless the great majority , with the qualification just mentioned , are sincere in their professicns. // On the subject of the rights of the American aborigines , there has been much loose reasoning , and some quite as loose morality . It xviii be found , however , that respectable writers have more frequently been led into error by stating extravagant cases , and raising imaginary difficulties , than by examining the foundation of title to lands , or by looking at facts , as they took place on the settlement of this country . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehement and sweeping censures of the conduct and policy , pursued by colonists from Europe . The occasion of these censures , it was supposed , could be removed in no other way , than by making out for Europeans a paramount title , partly on the ground of superior civilisation , and partly because they were commonly in the habit of using land for tillage , which was not generally done by the original inhabitants of America . It is to be remembered , also , that self-interest has always been able to engage advocates to enlarge , fortify , and defend , the pretensions of the xvhites ; while the Indians have had no logicians to expo*e the sophistry of those , who would make the worse appear the better reason ; ' nor counsel , learned in the law , to study and plead in their behalf ; nor historians to gather up and preserve the evidence of acknowledgments in their favor , or of the wrongs they have suffered . Orators they have had , the power of whose eloquence has a thousand times frustrated the schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these schemes were always renewed and repeated till they became successful . The eloquence , by which they were resisted , was evanescent ; but the motives by which they were prompted , never ceased to operate . The discussions of the last nine months , especially those upon the floor of Congress , have brought before the public , it may be presumed , all the theories upon the subject of Indian rights , that have ever been promulgated . We are not able to mention a political measure , or a legislative act , that exhibited in Congress more decisive proof of elaborate investigation , than appeared in the debates on the bill to provide for the removal of the indians . In preparing the present article , we have made free use of the materials supplied by these discussions , whenever they appeared to suit our purpose . The question that presents itself , at the very threshold of the discussion , is , What were the relative rights of the North s'lmerican Indians , and of the early discoverers , to the lands of this // continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It xviii be satisfactory to ourselves ; though we would by no means enforce it dogmatically upon our readers . When disentangled from all extraneous topics , it is a question on which every honest and intellibent man can easily form an opinion for himself . We say , then , that the discoverers of America had a right to take possession of such parts of this continent , as they found unoccupied by human beings . This right they derived from the Creator of the world ; and it can not be disputed . But when they found portions , ( even if those portions amounted to the whole , ) occupied by the original inhabitants , the discoverers had no right to eject the possessors . Hoxv is it conceivable , that the mere discovery of a country should give the discoverers a title paramount to the title of natives , whose ancestQr5 had been in possession from time immemorial ? The mere statement of the case shows the inherent absurdity of a claim , which has been so often made , that many people seem to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an Indian to hold possession of a country , merely because he once chased a deer over a tract containing a thousand square miles ? Were we disposed to be captious , we should answer this question by asking , whether a ship-master can take possession of land by sailing within sight of it ? The Indian may as well hold possession in one case , as the ship-master take possession in the other . The fact is , that neither of these acts amounts to a possession . Let us make this matter a little more practical . We will suppose that an English discovery ship , followed by a little colony , sailed along the coast , from the bay of Fundy to the r*outh of Penobscot river ; and , finding no inhabitants , landed there and began a settlement . After a few months , an Indian visits the new comers , and tells them that they are occupying his land , to which he can by no means consent . They ask him , by what right he claims the land ; where he lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he claims the land between the Penobscot and the bay of Fundy , because some ten years before he spent a month there in hunting and fishing ; that his principal residence is on Connecticut river , where he has a little patch of corn and pumpkins ; that he sometimes visits Hudson river and lake Champlain ; but that he probably never should have come to the Penobscot // again , unless he had heard of intruders taking possession of his land . The colonists , if they were kind-hearted and honest men , would hear him patiently , and assure him , that they did not intend to encroach upon any man 's land ; that he had not made out a title ; that he neither had possession of the land , nor had he the slightest pretence for desiring it ; that they would not molest him upon Connecticut river , and he must not molest them in their new settlement . if , in such a case , the Indian were to collect his countrymen and make war upon the colony , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend themselves against him , as against any other assailant . It ought to he said here , that probably no North American Indian was ever so silly , as to make a formal claim , like the one which has been described . The case was stated , in order to answer the question so triumphantly asked by various writel 's , whether the chasing of a deer over an immense tract of country gives the Indian a right to exclude civilised men from that tract ? It is plain enough , that a single hunting excursion is not an actual possession , though it is a great deal more than a mere discovery from a ship 's deck ; and it would furnish quite as valid an objection to a new settlement by civilised men , as to a new appropriation to purposes of hunting by other Indians . We do not deny , that there may be cases , where discoverers may be debarred from taking possession of unoccupied lands , on the ground that they might probably be dangerous neighbors . If honest and reasonable fears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicinity , the new comers ought not to complain , if required to give proof , by a just and humane intercourse , of the most upright and honorable intentions . We go upon the assumption , that honest men can always establish a character for honesty ; such a character , as that other men , civilised or uncivilised , will not be afraid to trust them . Certainly the inconvenience is much less , that colonists should be obliged to establish a character for themselves , than that the native inhabitants of a country should be obliged to take every adventurer to their bosom , without stopping to ascertain whether he is a viper or not . We have supposed a case of unoccupied lands . It is believed , however , that very few such tracts were found by the // early discoverers ; and that these few were of very small dimensions . The American continent was generally , though sparsely , inhabited ; and most of the inhabitants had a permanent residence , within known limits . We xviii therefore look a little at facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century . Colonists arrived in rapid succession . Tbe natives were in the actual occupancy of the soil . Their possession was in no sense fictitious , or constructive . There were multitudes of places , which had not been vacant of inhabitants from the times of the remotest tradition . Other places were visited periodically , and regularly , for purposes of hunting . It appears to us , that both these kinds of possession were perfectly good ; and that an attempt to divest the natives of their country , thus in their possession , on any plea of discovery , is not only monstrously unjust , but is an insult to the common sense of mankind . We shall be asked , whether this continent should he left in a state of perpetual wildness , covered with ir*terminah1e forests , and unsubdued by the labor of man ? We simply answer , that the plainest rules of morality forhid us to appropriate to ourselves the property of others without their consent . The question about excluding civilisation from a whole continent is a very imposing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , some uncontrollable urgency of the case , which could not be resisted without opposing the manifest designs of Providence , and disre0arding the comfort of mankind . But this assumption is altogether a mistake . The natives of America , xvhenever kindly treated for any length of time , were easily induced to receive European settlers as their friends . The question has no practical application to the natives at all . They did not keep perpetual guard on their shores to drive off new settlers . Many of them felt gratified to have xvhite men come and share their country with them . In short , there was little difficulty in obtaining from the natives an honest and peaceable possession of lands , on every part of the coast . The necessity , therefore , which makes so prominent a figure in all discussions of this subject , never existed . Should the question still be pressed , and should we be required to answer what we would advise , in case a new world should now be discovered , the inhabitants of which should pertinaciously refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , that no code of political morality // should be introduced into the new world , which was not held to be sound and genuine morality in the old . If , in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , the sovereign of a populous country might take possession of a sparsely settled territory belonging to his neighbor , merely because he could put the land to a better use than his neighbor was inclined to do , Europe might have afforded opportunities enough to carry the principle into practice . Large portions of Prussia , Poland , and European Russia were at that time very thinly inhabited . When such a chapter had been fairly inserted in the law of nations , and had been found convenient in its application to such a power as Russia , it would be quite soon enough to force it upon the natives of America . The Christian powers of Europe made what they called the Law of Nations . Why not first apply their own law to themselves ? If it may be forcibly demanded of a community , which has much land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land to a populous neighbor , why not make a great international agrarian law , by which Europe should he parcelled out to the different nations , in a compound ratio , having regard to the nuinher of souls , and the relative productiveness of the land ? Even in our own days , there are many places upon the Eastern continent , where land might he claimed hy all the arguments , which are set in such formidable array against the possession of the American Indians . Vattel speaks of erratic tribes . ' Hoxv many hundred erratic tribes of Tartars are there ? How many of Arabs ? The Tartars ( at least many of them ) , pay no attention to agriculture , and are scarcely more civilised than were the associates of Powbatan , or king Philip . The fact is , that the great title to land , from the days of Noah to the present time , both in respect to communities and individuals , has been a lawful occupancy ; that is , an appropriation to one s oxvn use of what previously belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous lawful possessor . The formality of deeds , and covenants , and guaranties , has respect to the evidence of title , and not to the substance of it . Over a great part of the world , indeed , the law of the strongest has been the only governing rule of action . But wherever natious , or individuals , have pretended to respect each other 's claims , and to act upon principles of moral rectitude , the title // to property has not been made to depend upon the use to which the possessor applies his property . He must , indeed , so use his own as not to injure his neighbor ; but more than this he is not required to do . Nations are not to be asked , whether they gain their subsistence by hunting , pasturage , fishing or agriculture , before it can be determined , whether they have a title to their own country or not . The only question , which an honest man need to put , is , Have you a lawful possession of a country within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affirmative , the whole matter of title is forever at rest . The United States would contend with a very ill grace for the doctrine , that unsettled lands may be seized by those , who need them for the purpose of cultivation . How many millions of the people of France , Germany and Ireland might appropriate to themselves good farms in the States of Indiana , Illinois and Missouri ? Why should they not take immediate possession and set up their own forms of government ? It is worse than idle to say , that an uncivilised man has not the same title to property , that a civilised man would have , in the same circumstances . There is not , there never was , a law of nations that explicitly made this distinction . It is admitted , that an Indian has as good a title to his canoe , as an English merchant to his ship . Why not as good a title to his landing-place , his little island , and his wigwam , as an English gentleman to his park and his villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they brought with them charters from the kings of Europe . It may be worth while to spend a few moments in the inquiry , What were the legitimate uses of these instruments ? It is very obvious to the attentive reader of history , that the right of discovery was set up by the maritime nations of Europe rather against each other than against the aborigines of America . The master passions of ambition and avarice were excited and inflamed to an astonishing degree ; and all the great discovering powers aimed to grasp as much as possible of the new continent . Spain and Portugal could not engross the whole . England and France would come in foi a share . In these circumstances , it became gradually established , that one power should not interfere with the settlements of another ; and boundaries were agreed upon , within which the subjects of the respective powers might , exclusively of all // other Europeans , carry on their commercial enterprises , and make their respective settlements . Stipulations of this kind were mutually beneficial . They prevented many collisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency , injurious to the natives . Still , the adoption of such a course was entirely optional with the discovering powers . Any one of these powers , in accordance with the principles already stated , might take possession of any unoccupied land upon the American continent ; or might purchase of the natives any land not previously sold by them to Europeans . How far a possession , thus lawfully obtained , should extend in every direction , xvould he a matter of sound judgment , or of reasonable construction . The Spaniards were not entitled to he the sole visitors of America , merely because Columbus discovered it . The fact that Henry Hudson entered the river , which now beam 's his name , furnishes no good reason why new settlers from four different nations might not have obtained lawful possession of Long Island , Connecticut , New Jersey , and the west hank of the Delaware . All that an infant colony could rightfully demand of other infant colonies , was , that they should not plant themselves so near , as to cut off those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . If there had been no conventional arrangement , therefore , between the sovereigns of Europe , the subjects of any one of these powers might have made settlements upon any unoccupied lands , or upon any lands of which possession could he fairly obtained . A charter granted hy a King of England , for instance , to certain individuals among his subjects , legitimately implied the following things ; first , that he would guaranty the territory , which he had branted , against the claims of any other European power ; secondly , that he had not granted , and would not grant , the same territory to others of his subjects ; and thirdly , that the grantees were to hold the territory , xvheu actually settled , as a part of his realm , under such principles of jurisdiction and legislation , as might be properly applied to other parts of his realm . So much would be fairly and naturally implied in giving and receiving a charter . Specific conditions might be inserted , at the pleasure of the King , which , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that the conditions did not invade the inalienable rights of his subjects , nor of any other persons . // But nothing can be more extravagant than to suppose , that the charter of an English king could deprive of their rights the inhabitants of a distant continent ; or that their title to land or rivers could be in the slightest degree invalidated by the magical effect of a parchment , signed by a man of whom they never heard , and who knew nothing of the regions which he conveyed , nor of the people by whom these regions were inhabited . Several of the charters conveyed territory bounded by lines of latitude , and extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific ; and certainly the King of England had as good a right to take lands from the natives of California as from the natives of Cape Cod . If he could properly drive a Narraganset from his fishing hut , at the mouth of Newport harbor , he might seize the beaver-traps of the Sioux on the head waters of the Mississippi . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the head of a discovering nation , hold a single mile on the Atlantic coast , against the will of the original owners , he might seize and hold the entire continent , so far as the rights of the natives were concerned . To the consequences of such a doctrine we may advert on a subsequent page . We have spoken of the legitimate meaning and effect of a royal charter . In point of fact , however , the kings of Europe did , in some instances , assert the right to subdue the natives by force , and to appropriate their territory , without their consent , to the uses of the colonists . The King of Spain founded this right solely on the grant of the Pope , as the vicegerent of Christ upon earth . The Kings of England , in the sixteenth century , placed it on the superior claims , which Christians possessed over Infidels . Spain acted in accordance with her princil ) les , and treasured up a fearful amount of guilt and infamy , which will be remembered against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known . It is a pleasing consideration , however , that there were individuals , even in the court of Spain , who utterly disclaimed and rejected these absurd and tyrannical doctrines . Mr. Huntington , in the course of his researches on the Indian question , ascertained , that the civilians and crown lawyers of Spain gave their advice against receiving the Pope 's grant ; and one of the bishops in a treatise dedicated to Charles V. , uses this strong language : " The natives of America , having their own lawful kings and princes , and a right to make laws for the good government of their respective dominions , could not be expelled out of them , // nor deprived of what they possess , without doing violence to the laws of God , as well as the laws of nations . " ' This opinion is so obviously just and reasonable , that it would not seem deserving of particular praise , had it not been pronounced in a period of great superstition , and in opposition to the doctrines , then prevalent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can express the indignation of every honorable man , that in the United States , and at the present day , the attempt should be made to prove , by the weakest and vilest sophistries , that the natives of America had no rights , either of territory or government ; and that the discovery of a cape , or an island , was a constructive possession of a tract of land extending across the continent ? The charters given by British kings , during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , are generally silent respecting the natives . Lands , rivers , and so forth , are granted , in precisely the same manner , as if there had been no inhabitants . This course was very far from being honorable . The rightful occupancy of the Indians should have been explicitly acknowledged , and a fair and lawful manner of purchasing their title should have been prescribed . The very silence of the charters on this subject shows , that the extravagant claims of the sixteenth century were abandoned , as utterly untenable . It shows also , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarchs , which was altogether unjustifiable , and a disposition to leave the Indians to the arts and the cupidity of adventurers . If religious persecution had not driven to these shores some of the best and most honorable men in the world , it is not improbable that serious encroachments would have been made upon the rights of the North American Indians , under color of the royal charters . A few details can be gathered from the early history of this country , which indicate an undue reliance upon these charters ; but we have seen no evidence , that the Indians were , in a single instance , deprived of their lands , under any pretence of right to these lands , subsisting in the King of England . It is true beyond all question , that the early settlers at Plymouth , at Salem , at Saybrook , and , as a general rule , all along the Atlantic coast , purchased the lands upon which they settled , and proceeded in their settlements with the consent of the natives . Nineteen twentieths of the land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled by the whites in the western states , came into our possession as the result of amicable treaties . The small portion , claimed by right of conquest , was wrested from the indians in strenuous war . It was no fictitious or constructive conquest . Every inch of ground was contested ; and most of the wars , which issued in acquisition of territory from the Indians , were forced upon our fathers , and were strictly defensive or1 their part . Some small portions of territory were abandoned by Indians , because they preferred to live at a greater distance from the whites . In a word , the first settlers of the Anglo-American colonies , and of the Dutch colony on the Hudson , purchased lands of the Indians , or professed to have purchased them , in the most honorable manner . Although doctrines were sometimes asserted in theory , which would have abridged the rights of the Indians , yet we do not find in practice a single demand of territory from them , on the ground that the king of England had granted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way ; and every purchase of land from the Indians was made in such a manner , and under such circumstances , as to be a fair and full admission of their right to sell ; and , of course , an admission of their original title . At an early period of the settlement of Massachusetts , as we learn from ilutchinson 's history , the most ample and explicit declarations were made by our fathers to this effect ; viz , that the natives had derived from God a perfect title to their country ; that they were subject to their own government , and to no other ; and that no human power could divest them of these rights . Soon after the emigration commenced from Boston and its neighhorhood to the banks of Connecticut river , murders were perpetrated by Indians residing not far from Springfield . The governor sent to Mr. Pynchon , the magistrate or leading man of the new settlement , directing that the murderers should be apprehended for trial and punishment . Mr. Pynchon declined obeying the order ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians were not under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts . This fact is stated with admirable clearness , as follows I grant that all these Indians are within the line of the patent ; but yet , you can not say they are your subjects , nor yet within your jurisdiction , till they have fully subjected themselves , ( which I know they have not , ) and until you have bought their land . Until this be done , they must be esteemed // as an independent , free people . ' This passage indicates a discriminating mind and an honest disposition . It is in the true spirit of our declaration of independence , issued more than a hundred years afterwards , in which we asserted , that governments derive their just powers front the consent of the governed . ' In this extreme case of actual murder , committe dby Indians near the white settlements , and within the chartered limits of the colony , this magistrate had the candor to admit , that the perpetrators were not amenable to the laws of the whites , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was admitted by the governor to be valid . The only method of proceeding against the Indians would have been to demand satisfaction , and , if it should be withheld , and the cause should have been deemed sufficient , to declare war in the last resorL It is true that the colonists , and sometimes the agents of the government at home , talked to the Indians about the grandeur of the English monarch , the number of his people , the breatness of his power , his *villingness to protect his friends , and his ability to punish his enemies . In these discourses , some vague expressions about his sovereignty were doubtless uttered ; but always in such a sense , as to lead the natives to think that it was a great benefit to live un ( ler the king 's protection ; that his character was altogether paternal ; and that living under his care implied only , that Indians living in this manner were not to join the French or the Spaniards , and were to remain secure in the possession of their lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eye , nor has it been intimated in the late discussions , that any instance can be found , in which an English colony , or an English agent , told the Indians , that they had no right to the lands on which they were born ; that the king of England had granted their country ; and that they were now subjects of the king , amenable to his laws ; all their own laws and customs being abolished by his order . There would have been as little safety as honesty in making such a proclamation , at any period of the colonial history . Treaties were made with the Indians from the first . Some of them were observed on both sides , with exemplary fidelity . When differences arose , and wars succeeded , the change of feelings and of circumstances was often owing to the improper conduct of individuals . Even war did not always , nor often , prevent a return to a regular diplomatic intercourse . Treaties // were made , in numberless instances , and in every part of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rightful independence on the part of the Indians , as on the part of the whites . About the middle of the last century , alliances with the Indians became very important , and were much sought by the English and the French . The terms of these alliances usually were , an engagement of protection , accompanied with presents , made by the European power to the Indians , and the admission of a qualified dependence by the latter . It was never understood , however , that the Indians were to be deprived of their lands without their consent , or that their laws and customs were to be in any manner affected . Before the commencement of the revolutionary war , the policy of Great Britain had become fixed and uniform on this subject . The Indians were not to sell their lands to individuals , nor to the enemies of the king . They were to live under his protection , and to remain secure in the possession of their hunting-grounds and of their independence . Whenever they were disposed to sell their lands , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either of the colonies , or of the mother country , as the circumstances of the case might be . This right of pre-emption , and the cognate right of succeeding to the possession of any portion of the country which the Indians might abandon , or where they might become extinct , were claimed by virtue of discovery . All the principal tribes of Indians agreed , by formal stipulations , that they would not alienate their lands , except to the government . Those who would stretch the right of discovery to such an extravagant extent , as not to leave the Indians any rights at all , allege , that the highest judicial tribunal in this country has decided , that the Indians have the occupancy merely , while the title to the land is in the government . From this statement , the terms of which seem not very favorable to the Indians , it is inferred , that the Indians have not , never had , and never can have , any title to their land ; and , as the supreme court is justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next inference is , that , in point of morality , there is no danger of ' encroaching upon Indians , for they have no rights either of person or property . Now in this interpretation of the opinion of the court , there are several great mistakes . As to the title of the European sovereigns to Indian lands* // as gained by discovery , the court simply declares what were the claims , laws , and practice , of the mother country and the colonies . The claims and the practice were uniform to this extent ; viz , that the natives could not sell their lands to foreigners , nor to individual white men . Of course , the government could be the only purchaser , and the only successor to the Indian title . This right of pre-emption and of succession was called by the court a setz*n in fee , or an ultimate title ; it being the only remaining title , after the occupancy of the Indians should cease . The name given to the right of pre-emption could not in any manner affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the nature and the extent of their occupancy were concerned . The court considered the law to he as above described ; and of course all judicial tribunals were bound so to declare it . Not a few persons have supposed , that the mere recognition of the right of discovery , as above described , was tantamount to a declaration , on the part of the court , that the right of discovery , as claimed by European sovereigns , even in its greatest latitude , was reasonable , equitable , and binding upon the natives . This is a total mistake ; and it originated from a misconception of the proper functions of a court of law . Such a court is bound to declare what the law is , and not what it should he . In every well regulated govermnent , the legislative power is kept distinct from the judicial ; and in Great Britain and America , this distinction is marked by plain and positive rules . A court can neither make , alter , nor repeal a law ; nor does tbe announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the court is bound to recognise , imply that , in the opinion of the court , such doctrine , or such usage , was originally wise and salutary . On the contrary , courts of law are often called to sustain and enforce particular acts of legislation , which the judges would by no means approve , if they were called to act as legislators . It would he a hard case , indeed , if our judges were required to sanction , with the weight of their private character , as moralists , philanthropists , and Christians , all the laws , which , as parts of our code , they are hound to enforce . And , on the other hand , the laws of the country would be in a curious predicament , if they might be set aside , that is , repealed , by the court , whenever the judges , looking at them as philosophers or legislators , should deem them unwise or inexpedient. // The slave trade furnishes the best possible illustration of the subject . This trade was recognised as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a great length of time ; and till it was made unlawful by positive statute . If a case had occurred in this country , ( and , for aught we know , cases may have occurred , ) it must have been pronounced a lawful traffic here , at any time previously to 1808 . The same judges , who must then have sustained it as a legitimate commerce , must now declare it piracy , and sentence a man to be hung for engaging in it ; and yet the private opinion of the jt*dge as to its inherent enormity , may not have undergone the slightest change . Let it be understood , then , that the judges of the supreme court have only decided what the law is , respecting the right of pre-emption as founded upon discovery ; but that they have not declared what they think would have been the wisest and best manner of regulating this subject originally . For ourselves , we have no hesitation in ( leclaring , that we consider the supposed right of pre-emption to be an encroachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive how the sailing of an English ship in sight of Cape Cod should give the king of England any right to dictate to the Indians in Massachusetts , respecting the sale of their lands . We therefore hold , that these Indians might properly sell their lands to Frenchmen , or Spaniards , although an English vessel had sailed along the coast , and seen it , before the Frenchmen and Spaniards arrived . Having said this , however , we feel bound to add , that the English government might lawfully prescribe on what terms English subjects should purchase lands of Indians ; or it might forbid them to purchase as individuals at all . Great Britain and France might agree , that they would not purchase within certain limits ; and such an agreement might be a great convenience to the parties , while the Indians could not justly complain of it . Proceeding one step further , the Indians might stipulate with the powers of Europe , that they would not sell their lands to individuals , but only to the governments respectively , with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to peace , and to the promotion of the permanent interests of all parties . Such , very nearly , was the state of things , at the commencement of the revolutionary war . // The opinion , which we have expressed , as to the right of pre-emption , seems to us to be the obvious dictate of reason and honesty . How can one wan assume the right of prescribing in what manner another man shall dispose of his own property ? And how can there be one rule of morality and honesty for individuals , and another for communities ? But we are willing to fortify our opinion a little by authority . About the middle of the last century , an English trader , by the name of Trent , purchased of Indians a large tract of land lying on the Ohio , and delivered them a considerable quantity of goods in payment . The deed was formally executed ; and the contract was well understood by the parties . The question arose , whether this was a valid purchase , or not . Counsellor Dagge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a written opinion in favor of the validity of the purchase . They founded their opinion on the fact , that the Indians were the original possessors and true owners of the land . Of this opinion , dated in 1755 , Patrick Henry , Benjamin Franklin , and Edmund Pendleton , gave their written approbation . There could be no question that , so far as the Indians were concerned , the sale was a good one , they not having at that time entered into any stipulation with the government not to sell to individuals . rrhe only question seemed to be , whether Trent was not prohibited , by the regulations of his own government , from taking the grant . This was settled , we believe , ( though we have not the authority at hand , ) by the formal assent of the government to the transaction . We have already remarked , that the mere act of buying land of the Indians was , in the circumstances of the case , an acknowledgment of their title . But it is alleged against our ancestors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rate , that it was no purchase at all ; that this mode of acquiring lands was tantamount to a declaration , that the Indians had no title , and therefore had no claim to a compensation . These positions have been gravely taken and earnestly defended ; and , as perhaps no subject has been more misrepresented and misunderstood , we think it worth while to spend a few moments in considering it . The first settlers , it is said , gave the Indians for their lands only a few trifling articles , of little cost , and less intrinsic value ; therefore the Indians were not admitted to have any title to their lands , and the contract was not hinding on either party . // This is a fair specimen of much of the reasoning on the subject . It seems strange , that the purchasers should plead , that a bargain is not binding on themselves , for the simple reason that they obtained the lands at too cheap a rate . One would think , that the other party could demand to be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it not a maxim , in all civilised countries , that a man can give away his property , unless it be charged with the claims of his creditors ? His consent , fairly and deliberately yielded , is all that is necessary to a transfer of his property . In cases where a valuable consideration is necessary , the amount is not material . In a conveyance of a house and land , the consideration is equally valid , whether it be five dollars or fifty thousand . The great thing to be obtained of the Indians was their consent to the settlement of their country by whites . Many fair and honest arguments could be used with them , and were used in fact , to induce them to give their consent . They were treated altogether as reasonable beings , and not as brute animals . In every part of the continent , they showed themselves to be possessed of a very good share of natural sagacity . They were told that the settlement of Europeans among them , or near them , would be much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a regular traffic secured , by which they might procure articles of essential value to them ; that they would thus greatly improve their condition ; that the British king was powerful and would defend them against all foreign nations ; that , if they would acknowledge him as their great Father , he would regard them as his children , and protect them against every species of injustice ; and especially that their lands should not be taken from them , or settled , without their consent . These declarations , and many more of the same general nature , were made to the Indians , all along the coast . In some instances , they were persuaded by these arguments , much more than by the accompanying presents . They received the whites as brothers ; they were proud of them as neighbors and allies . The cases were not few , in which strong personal friendships were formed between the red man and the white ; friendships , which were maintained with perfect fidelity during the lives of the parties . Now it appears to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that , if not a farthing of property passed from // one party to the other , the possession of the whites , thus obtained , is good in law , in honor , and in conscience . Indeed , if the whites had been hired to come and settle , and the Indians had given the skins of all the beavers , which they could catch in ten years , as an inducement , the possession of the whites would not be the less lawful on that account ; nor would the title of the Indians to their remaining lands be in the least degree invalidated , because they had freely given away a part , with the design of gaining kind and valuable neighbors . If the Indians had a right to give away their lands , they surely had a right to sell them at a low price . But there was in fact , no reason to complain of the price . The settlers usually gave as much for land as it was then worth , according to any fair and judicious estimate . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket and a jack-knife ; and this would appear to many to be a fraudulent bargain . It would , however , by no means deserve such an appellation . The knife alone would add more to the comfort of an Indian , and more to his wealth , than forty square miles of land , in the actual circumstances of the case . And as to the white purchaser , the land could be of no value to him , till he had made it of value by his own labor . It is matter of history , that the English colonists as a body , so far as they had property , were great losers by their settlement here . They were noble spirited men , and property was not their object ; if it had been , they would have been egregiously disappointed . Not one in a hundred could have sold his house and farm , ( either ten , fifteen , or twenty years after the settlement , ) for as much as they had cost him , at a fair estimate of the labor bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be curious to ask these scrupulous men , who say that the Indians ought to have received a greater price for their lands , How the proper standard could be fixed * Our ancestors were not prophets . They were not certain but that their settlements would fail , as other settlements had failed before . If they should succeed , the settlers could not tell what the intermediate difficulties would be ; nor how many reverses must be experienced before they should be successful . But suppose they had been assured , when Boston was settled by the pilgrims in 1630 , that lands on Ann-street would sell for ten pounds an acre in 1670 ; that lands on Washington-street , between Summer and Bedford-streets , would rise to the same value before // 1700 ; that 1a*ds in the west part of the peninsula would be taken up for building-lots soon after 1800 ; and that the site of an insurance-office in State-street would be sold for fifteen pounds a square foot in 1825 . How would all this affect the price , which ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these prices were they to regulate their offers ? These facts , seen with absolute certainty beforehand , would not have proved that the land , on which Boston has been since built , was worth a farthin0 in 1630 . There are millions of acres of land in the Carolinas , which would not at this moment be accepted as a gift ; and yet , as a planter of credit and character assured the writer of this article , much of this land will produce , with very little labor , one hundred and fifty bushels of sweet potatoes to the acre . Two hundred years hence , it will probably bring a hundred dollars an acre . Perhaps some of those kind-hearted gentlemen , who think that our ancestors dealt hardly by the Indians , in giving them so small a price for their lands , would like to purchase some of the best tracts on the Columbia river ; or , if they prefer an inland district , some of the best intervals near the head waters of the Yellow Stone . These tracts are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he ought to give the same price for them , as he would be obliged to give the present owners of lands on the Connecticut , or the Susquehanna , for an equal number of acres , he can doubtless act accordingly . The probability is , that within two hundred years , every acre of land in North America , which shall then be capable of cultivation , will command a good price . Dr. Dwight has , somewhere in his travels , perfectly vindicated our ancestors from any just imputations on this subject . Among other facts , he mentions the following-One of the first settlers of Northampton , a few years after the settlement began , and the Indian title was extinct , made a bargain , in which it was left optional with the other party to take five shillings or several hundred acres of land in that town  --  the money being deemed a fair equivalent for the land , which was then the undisputed property of a white man . The whole matter is summed up by Dr. Dwight , in the very sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fathers first came hither , was like water , too abundant to be the subj*ect of prsce . Perhaps it will be asked , if land was so abundant as not to // be the subject of price , how could there be any title to it ? and why might it not be taken from the possessors without their consent ? We answer , that the abundance of a thing has nothin to do with the title to it . A man worth a million of money has as good a title to the last dollar as to the first , though a very small part is necessary for the comfortable support of his family . The master of a foreign vessel , anchoring in the river Thames , fills his water-casks without asking permission , or making compensation . Does it follow , that the waters of the Thames are of no value to the British people , and that the government has no jurisdiction over that river ? When this continent was first settled , a few square miles of land were of little consequence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the most eligible parts of the continent have passed into the possession of the whites , the small remnants of good land now inhabited by the original proprietors are without value to them ; much less , that they have no title to their land , because it is alleged to have been formerly of no value . The reason why land , in the possession of Indians , was formerly of little value , has long ceased to exist . Then , if they sold a tract , they had interminable regions remaining ; now , they have not enough left to enable them to keep their community separate from the whites . As the quantity in their possession has diminished , its value has become enhanced as a matter of course . But neither the diminution of quantity , nor the enhancement of value , has any thing to do with the validity of the title . Unless we greatly deceive ourselves , the candid reader of the preceding pages will agree with us in the folloxving conclusions ; viz. That the original possessors of this continent had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their actual possession , when it was discovered by Europeans ; That whether this title were recognised or not by English kings , or English courts of law , it should now be allowed in the fullest manner , by every correct moralist and every states-man ; That although discovery gave a right to take possession of unoccupied parts of this continent , it gave no right whatever to dispossess the natives of any lands , which were known to be theirs , whether used for hunting , fishing , pasturage , mining , agriculture , or any other purpose ; // That the consent of the natives was necessary , before the whites could take lawful possession of Indian lands ; That although the kings of Europe might agree among themselves as to the limits within which they would purchase lands of the Indians , and might prescribe to their subjects , respectively , the manner in which purchases should be made ; yet that the Indians were not bound by any of these measures , till they had voluntarily assented to them ; That the Indians , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities by compacts or treaties ; That , whatever doctrines may have been asserted in theory , the practice of the early settlers , and of those who succeeded them , were based upon the foregoing principles ; and That , previously to the American revolution , the right of the Indians to the peaceable occupation of their own country , till they should voluntarily relinquish it , was fully admitted by the government of the mother country and of the colonies , and was sustained by the deliberate opinion of some of the ablest men of the age . But if we were to admit , that Indians had no right to their own lands when this continent was discovered , and that they were to be considered as without the pale of human society , and to be hunted down as buffaloes and bears , it by no means follows , that their character and relations would remain the same , after the white settlers had entered into friendly engagements with them . This , in point of fact , was always done by the settlers , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians was , we are brethren , children of the same Almighty Lord and Father of all . We have come to do you good . We wish to live in peace with you . As you have much land , will you not grant us a little , and admit us into your neighborhood ? ' The Indians answered , though sometimes with hesitation and fear , you may settle by our side , and you may have land within certain limits . ' Compacts of this kind were made between the first settlers and the Indians , along the whole line of the Atlantic coast . From the moment , in which they were made , whatever the respective rights of the parties might have been previously , the question of lawful title should have been considered as forever settled . The Europeans had chosen to regard the red men as human beings , and not as buffaloes and bears . They had addressed them as reasonable beings , and found them accessible // to motives , and susceptible of love and hatred , hope and fear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their proposal had been accepted . They had admitted a title in the original possessors , by accepting grants from them ; and , by agreeing upon limits , they acknowledged the title of the Indians to all lands not purchased from them . No conclusion can be safer , or more unquestionable than that the bare assignment of limits between communities , with the declaration , reciprocally made , the land on this side belongs to us , on the other side to you , is an acknowledgment of a per .. feet title . Not only is this the natural meaning of the act , but , in the first settlements of this country , it was often and solemnly expressed as the meaning ; and no other meaning was ever assigned to it . Now with what face could the colonists , after having obtained a settlement in this manner , turn round upon the Indians , and say , you had no tight to the land you granted to us ; and you have none to the remainder ? We shall take the whole . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be apprehensive , that the Indians would be employed against them by the mother country . To the Indians our fathers were no strangers . Their modes of warfare , their history , their competency to enter into contracts* their claims to territory , were well known . With this perfect knowledge of their rights and their character , the first Congress , more than a year before the declaration of independence , directed proper talks to be prepared for the several tribes of Indians , with a view to engage their continued friendship , and their neutrality in the unhappy dispute with Great Britain . ' In September , 1775 , a treaty with the Six Nations was reported to Congress , and various resolutions were passed , all having for their object the maintenance of friendship with the Indian tribes , as independent sovereignties . In March , 1776 , it was resolved , that Indians should not be employed as soldiers , in the armies of the United Colonies , before the tribes to which they belong should , in a national council , held in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the express approbation of Congress . ' A more honorable stand could not have been taken by this most illustrious body . The national rights of the Indians were acknowledged in the fullest and yet the most delicate manner . Congress was not willing that // tribes should be exposed to retaliation and injury , on account of the acts of individuals ; nor that they should be drawn into a war without time for deliberation , or without their consent . In October , 1777 , it was resolved , that it be earnestly recommended to the President and Assembly of the State of Georgia to use their utmost exertions to cultivate peace and harmony with the indian nations . ' The next year , a treaty was formed with the Delaxvare Indians , by which the parties hound themselves to perpetual peace and friendship , and to an alliance offensive and defensive . The United States guarantied to the Delaware nation all its territorial rights , in the fullest and most ample manner , as it hath been bouude* hy former treaties , as long as the said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Here is an instance of a solemn guaranty to an Indian nation , given in the extremest crisis of our nation 's peril , and therefore under circumstances , which rendered it doubly sacred . The transactions of the revolutionary Congress , in relation to the Indians , were very numerous ; and they were all regulated by the principle , that Indian tribes were distinct communities , and had a perfect right to their territory , and to their own forms of government . By the articles of confederation , all public intercourse with the Indian tribes was made a national concern ; and the several States thus relinquished to the United States the right of making treaties with these tribes . In 1785 , the treaty of Hopewell was formed between the United States and the Cherokees . By this compact , peace was made , boundaries were fixed , and permanent relations estahlished between the parties . The Cherokees consented to come under the protection of the United States , and of no other sovereign . Prisoners were exchanged ; and it was agreed that no future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of a manifest violation of this treaty ; and then , not till after a demand of justice , and a declaration of hostilities . Intruding whites were ahandoned to the Indians to be punished according to their discretion ; and criminals , taking refuge in the Indian country , were to he delivered up to the United States for punishment . From a mere reference to these topics it is manifest , that the national character of the Cherokees was admitted in the fullest sense ; and that there was an implied guaranty of their // territory , inasmuch as definite boundaries were fixed , and white men were forbidden to transgress them . Against this treaty North Carolina and Georgia protested , on the ground that it was an exercise of power by the United States , not confided to them by the articles of confederation . The whole difficulty arose from different constructions given to the following sentence , in one of the articles : The United States , in Congress assembled , shall have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the trade and managing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States , provided that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violat4 . ' The affairs ' of the Indians here intended are shown by contemporary history and legislation to have been their public affairs , or their intercourse with the whites . There is not the slightest reason to suppose , that it had any reference to the laws , customs and usages of the Indians among themselves . Some of the Indian tribes had been broken up , or dissolved , and the individuals were either settled among the whites , or wandered about without any fixed residence . By Indians , not members of any of the States , ' were probably intended all the tribes , which remained upon their original territory , and in their original independence . The exact meaning of the proviso it seems not very easy to ascertain . It may have been this : viz , that it was not the design of the parties to these articles to restrain the legislative right of any State in regard to the Indians , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards ascertained . In point of fact , the several States had never exercised any right of legislation over Indians residing within fixed limits , upon their original territory . This had not been done , even in the oldest States , in reference to any considerable body of Indians , though several communities of this kind had been surrounded by white settlements , and were clearly included within the external limits of States . By every sound rule of construction , a proviso should not be so interpreted as to make the principal clause inoperative , unless such an interpretation be unavoidable . But as the chartered limits of the several States embraced all the territory within the United States , it is evident , that the framers of the articles of confederation must have supposed , that there were Indians within the United States , not members of the several States , nor subject to State legislation . As a controversy existed , in regard to the disposition , which // should be made of unappropriated lands , it is probable that much difficulty was experienced in framing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federalist , declared it to be obscure and contradictory , ' and expressed his gratification that nothing like it had been introduced into the constitution . The protest of North Carolina and Georgia was referred to a committee of Congress . An elaborate report was made in support of the power of the general government , as it had been exercised in the treaty of Hopewell ; and that treaty went into full effect . It should be understood , that these two States did n* assume the positions now taken , that Indian tribes are not competent to make treaties ; that treaties made with them are not binding ; and that the several States may extend their laws over the Indians without their consent . The controversy was on the single point , whether treaties should be made with the Indian tribes by the United States ; or by separate States with the tribes within their respective chartered limits . The State of Georgia was particularly desirous to make contracts with the Indians for the acquisition of their lands , without any restraint from the United States . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred , argued , that all public relations with the Indians are strictly a national concern ; and that , as the nation was called upon to conduct wars with the Indians , it was necessary that treaties should be made under no other authority than that of the United States . When the constitution was formed , the treaty-making power was expressly given to the general government , and expressly inhibited to the several States . By the same instrument , Congress was invested with power to regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian tribes . ' All treaties then in existence , and all treaties , which should be made thereafter , were declared to be the supreme law of the land , paramount to all State laws and constitutions . No dispensing power was given to any branch of the government , nor to all the branches united . The reason is obvious . No treaty can be dispensed with , or set aside , by one of the parties . If the terms of a treaty are burdensome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other way , except by an appeal to arms . When the meaning and effect of treaties come under judicial // investigation , the courts of the United States are the tribunals , to which this duty is assigned by the constitution . Hence an opinion has arisen , and has sometimes been expressed by gentlemen of respectability , that the supreme court of the United States might declare a treaty void , on the ground that it is unconstitutional . But the court is invested with no such power . It might as well declare one part of the constitution void , on the ground that it is inconsistent with some other part , as a treaty void , because it transcends the powers of government . It must be takei* for granted , that the framers of our constitution made a plan , the parts of which are not inconsistent with each other . At any rate , if there be an inconsistency , the people of the United States must remove it . In like manner , if the President and Senate make a treaty , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powers . The treaty-making power involves all the high attributes of sovereignty . The framers of the constitution manifestly intended to lodge this power in safe hands . If they committed a mistake , the people can , by an amendment of the constitution , make a different disposition of it . Treaties are , in their nature , transactions of a higher character , than constitutions of internal government . The whole human family is interested in securing the faithful observance of engagements between nations ; and this interest greatly increases , if one of the parties be weak and the other strong . Such nations as England , France , Russia , and the United States , can take care of their own interests ; but , if the sanctity of treaties is to be violated , how is it possible that the weak should ever be protected ? Questions as to the meaning of treaties may often arise and they must often be decided , so far as they affect individuals , at least , by some tribunal known to the laws . But to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside a treaty , in which another nation is interested , is altogether preposterous . Were a question to arise between France and England , as to the validity of a treaty , would England be satisfied with having the matter decided by the French court of cassation , or France with a judgment of the court of king 's bench in Westminster-Hall ? One of the first objects of attention , after the organization of the general government under the constitution , was our public relations with the Indians . With the Creeks , occupying the region which now forms the central and south-western parts of // the state of Georgia , no national treaty had then been made . They stood in a very threatening posture , in the vicinity of white settlements . They , with the aid of the neighboring tribes , could bring fourteen thousand warriors into the field . A quarter of that number xvould have been sufficient to keep the new settlers in a state of consternation , through an extent of five hundred miles on the frontier . During the first session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the twenty-second of August , 1789 , the President of the United States , attended by General Knox , came into the Senate , and laid before that body a statement of facts , proposing several questions for their advice and consent . Among these questions was the following : Whether the United States shall solemnly guaranty to the Creeks their remaining territory , and maintain the same , if necessary , by a line of military posts ? ' This question was answered by the Senate in the affirmative ; and necessary funds were ordered , at the discretion of the President . In pursuance of this advice and consent of the Senate , three distinguished men were appointed commissioners to treat with the Creeks ; but , for reasons which we are not able to state , the negotiation was not successful . The next year , twentyfour Creek chiefs were induced to visit New-York , which was then the seat of government . A treaty was here negotiated by the secretary of war , under the immediate eye of General Washington . It was authenticated with uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous vote of the Senate . The fifth article is in these words : The United States solemnly guaranty to the Creek nation all their lands within the limits of the United States , to the westward and southward of the boundary described by the preceding article . ' It is impossible for any fair and honorable mind to doubt as to the meaning of this stipulation ; and therefore we will not detain our readers with any remarks upon it . On the 11th of August , 1790 , General Washington , as President of the United States , transmitted to the Senate a special message , on the subject of our relations with the Cherokees . This was four days after the treaty with the Creeks was signed , during which interval it had been ratified . In the message , the treaty just formed was alluded to as the main foundation of the future peace and prosperity of the south-western frontier . ' The President insists , however , upon the necessity of having // the treaties with the other tribes in that quarter faithfully performed on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherokees , by the treaty of Hopexvell , had placed themselves under the protection of the United States ; that the whites had subsequently intruded upon the Indians ; and that Congress , in September , 1788 , had forbidden such unwarsantable intrusions . He announces his determination to exert the powers intrusted to him by the constitution , in order to carry into faithful execution the treaty of Hopexvell , and concludes his communication with the following question : Shall the United States stipulate solemnly to guaranty the new boundary , which may he arranged ? ' The Senate , by a resolution in almost the same words as the question , advised and consented solemnly to guaranty the new boundary . ' The President followed this advice ; and the treaty of Holston was formed , July 2 , 1791 , by the seventh article of which , the United States solemnly guaraoty to the Cherokee nation all their lands not hereby ceded . ' The treaty of Holston is the basis of all subsequent negotiations . In the first treaty of Tellico , which was formed under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they will continue the guaranty of the Cherokee country forever , as made and contained in former treaties . ' Regniar treaties , negotiated by commissioners with full powers , and all duly ratified by the Senate , were made with the Cherokees during every administration , down to that of Mr. Monroe , inclusive . There are fifteen of these most formal and solemn compacts . During all the period which has intervened since the date of the treaty of Hopewell , there has been constant intercourse with these tribes , by letters from the President and the war department , and by agents residing among the Indians , as organs of communication with them . All these transactions have been in accordance with the principles announced by General Washington , and recognised by his successors . The Indians were always made to understand , that their territory was to remain inviolate , unless they freely consented to part with it . The intercourse-laws have all proceeded upon the same principles . Intrusion upon Indian lands is forbidden under heavy penalties , which are graduated according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership , or which would alarm the Indians with the apprehension of a claim , are visited with peculiar severity . In the treaties , and // in the laws , there are numerous provisions in relation to inferior subjects , which imply that the Indians had a government of their own , that was to continue permanently ; and there is not a syllable , which has the most distant implication that the United States , or any separate state , claimed , or ever would claim , the right of legislating over the Indians , or exercising any power over them , not expressly given in the treaties . The last compact with the Cherokees , except one , was negotiated by General Jackson in 1817 . The preamble states , that a part of the Cherokees wished to remove beyond the Mississippi , and a part wished to remain . The design of the transaction was to promote the views of both parties , and to give both an assurance of our patronage , our aid , and good neighborhood . ' It was expressly stated , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fixed laws and a regular government . ' Mr. Calhoun negotiated the last treaty with the Cherokees , in 1819 . The preamble declares , in effect , that the Cherokees as a body wished to remain on the land of their fathers , with a view to their national preservation . It is implied , that the treaty was made to secure that distinct object . By the fourth article , a permanent school fund is created , which is expressly appropriated to diffuse the benefits of education among the Cherokee nation on this side of the . /Ilississippi . ' The next article extends the intercourse-law over the Cherokees , as a permanent protection ; which , therefore , can never be repealed , as to the Cherokees , without their consent . We have thus drawn a hasty outline of the principal stipulations , by which the integrity of the Cherokee country is guarantied , and the rights of the inhabitants secured . What other community is there on earth , that can show so many muniments erected for its defence , within the short period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current of public transactions , all running with an irresistible tide in the same direction , and without meeting with any obstacle , that could make even a ripple ? With what other people have the United States ever entered into stipulations , after so much consideration , and under circumstances of the same solemnity ? The father of his country , soon after he was inducted into the office of chief magistrate of the United States , distinctly inquired of the Senate , whether they would advise him to offer a solemn guaranty of their country to the Creeks . Being answered in the affirmative , the guaranty was made as soon afterwards // as a treaty could be negotiated . A year had elapsed , however , and the Senate was called upon to ratify the guaranty , which it had advised . This was done unanimously . The President then began a similar course in regard to the Cherokees . The same guaranty was proposed , given , and ratified ; and , during the progress of these transactions , another year had elapsed . Thus , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when commissioners were appointed ; and probably on other occasions . The Senate was composed , in great part , of the very men , who had been members of the convention , by which the constitution was formed . It is incredible , that they should mistake the meaning of that instrument , on so important a subject . The same guaranty has been implicitly ratified in every subsequent compact . The terms of the stipulations are perfectly intelligible , so that there is no room for doubt , or cavil . If the United States are not bound by these engagements , how is it possible for a nation to bind itself ? and how is it possible for a weak party to know , whether its rights are to be protected , or not ? or rather , how much reason is there to fear , that a weak party has no rights , and that the law of force must always prevail ? It is admitted by some , that were it not for other obligations , by which the United States are bound to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians would hold us as a nation . They suppose , that the obligations to the several states are prior to these treaties with the Indian tribes . But , after all that has been said and written on this subject , we have not seen the slightest evidence , that there are any incompatible obligations . Every treaty with every Indian tribe may , unless we are greatly mistaken , be fulfilled to the very letter ; and yet no engagement , either express or implied , now in existence between the United States and any separate state , or any community , or individual , would be in the least danger of violation . The claims of Georgia , under the compact of 1802 , are supposed to form the strongest case of incompatible obligations ; and we admit that these claims have been so represented , as to puzzle some intelligent minds . If fairly stated , however , they furnish no occasion for doubt or embarrassment , on the part of the general government , or of complaint on the part of Georgia . // It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of independence , sustained by the revolutionary war , and confirmed by the peace of 1783 , vested in that state all the rights of the British king to the land within its chartered limits ; and that the United States have guarantied to each state all its rights of territory and government . The United States were , therefore , at the date of the treaty of Hopewell , bound to Georgia by an obligation incompatible with the terms of that treaty . This being the case , the first obligation must remain inviolate , and compensation must be made for the violation of the second . Upon this statement , we can not help remarking , that , if true , it is a most humiliating one . The articles of confederation were considered and adopted by the wisest men , whom the country was able to send to Congress , in the brightest period of our history . Our relations with the Indians were fixed by the same men , at the same period . Both subjects were in the highest degree interesting to the whole country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigines , depended in a considerable degree our national character , and the freedom of the frontier from the terrible and protracted calamity of an Indian war . And yet , with all these mighty interests at stake , they entered deliberately into clashing and contradictory engagements . If they did this , they must have made false representations to the Indians , on subjects of vital importance . They must have pretended to exercise powers which they did not possess ; and , under the pretence of giving an equivalent , which they bad no power to give , and for the loss of which they can not make indemnity , must have obtained , from the poor , deluded , suffering Indians , terms of great value to the United States , and especially to the people on the frontier . It is a great mistake , however , to suppose , that the worthies of the revolution committed an error so little in accordance with their general character , and of such disastrous issue to the Indian nations . Nothing but the most positive stipulations , absolutely irreconcilable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of such an error . We need not be alarmed for the reputation of our most eminent statesmen . There is not even an apparent discrepancy between the stipulations , either express or implied , of the states among themselves , and their united stipulations , as one party , with the Indians as another . As to the succession of* Georgia to the rights of the British // king , it was settled before the revolution , that the King could not take actual possession of Indian lands for the use of his subjects , except in pursuance of treaties made with Indians ; and as to the confederated states guarantying to each state the right of taking lands from the Indians by force , because these lands lay within the chartered limits of a state , the direct contrary was expressly provided . The United States were invested with the treaty-making power , under the confederation , as well as under the constitution ; and this power was often and solemnly applied to the Indian nations . The confederated states , and not any one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians were , and must be , sustained at the national expense . Treaties of peace and limits must of course be made by the nation . Besides , the United States never admitted , that the separate states were entitled to what were called the crown lands ; that is , the lands still remaining in the possession of the Indians , and reserved by royal proclamation for their continued occupancy . So far from guarantying the Indian lands to Georgia , the confederated states maintained , that whatever claim the whites had to these lands ,  --  the claim to extinguish the Indian title by amicable purchase ,  --  belonged to the United States , and not to Georgia . The clAm was resisted by that state , and was finally put to rest by the compact of 1802 . In this compact , the cessions are mutual , or reciprocal . Georgia cedes to the United States all her right , title , and claim ' to lands west of a certain line ; and the United States cede to Georgia all their claim , right , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lands , which were thus ceded by Georgia to the United States , now constitute the states of Alabama and Mississippi . The cession was made on certain conditions ; and among these conditions is an engagement , that the United States shall , at their own expense , extinguish , for the use of Georgia , as early as the same can be peaceably obtained , upon reasonable terms , the Indian title to the county of Talasse , and so forth , and to all the other lands , in the state of Georgia . ' This is the stipulation , which is mainly insisted on , as imposing upon the United States the obligation of obtaining , at all hazards , the Cherokee lands for the use of Georgia . But the bare reading of the clause is sufficient to show , that the obligation is conditional . The title was to be extinguished peaceably , ' and on reasonable terms . ' Of course , the Indians had the acknowledged // power of keeping their country forever , if they pleased ; and this would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . In fulfilment of that stipulation , however , the general government has purchased the Indian country , as fast as the original proprietors would sell . In this process , the whole Creek territory , within the chartered limits of Georgia , has been obtained for the use of that state , and is now settled by its inhabitants . Portions of the Cherokee territory have also been ceded , so that twenty millions of acres , in the whole , have come into the possession of Georgia , since the execution of the compact . About five millions of acres still remain in the possession of the Cherokees , over which territory and all its possessors , Georgia claims the right of extending her laws . Not only is the engagement with Georgia conditional , but the very terms of the conditions are inconsistent with the use of any means , but those of persuasion and argument . The Indian title ' is acknowledged as in existence , and is to be e*vtinguished , ' before the lands can be obtained for the use of Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no fewer than five treaties with the Cherokees , and two with the Creeks ; and it was perfectly well known to the parties , that treaties were the only means , by which the Indian title could be extinguished . In the very paragraph of the compact which contains the stipulation , it is stated , by way of description and recital , that the President of the United States has directed that a treaty should be held with the Creeks ; ' and , in a previous paragraph , the United States engage to open a land-office , for the disposition of the vacant lands thus ceded , to which the Indian title has been , or may hereafter be , extinguished . ' It thus appears , that the very instrument , under which Georgia has pressed her claim , shows most conclusively , that no means of violence were to be used ; that all public intercourse with the Indians was to be held by the United States ; and that Georgia was to have no agency , direct or indirect , in extinguishing the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument ,  --  a passage inserted for the purpose of protecting the Indians in their rights , during all future time . Georgia made it an express condition , that any new state to be formed upon the ceded territory should conform to the articles , ( one ex // cepted , ) of the ordinance for the government of the territory north-west of the Ohio . ' Among these articles , to which such new state should conform , is one , of which the following sentence constitutes a part : The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians ; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent ; and in their property , rights , and liberty , they never shall be invaded or disturbed , unless in just and lawful wars , authorised by Congress ; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall , from time to time , be made for preventing wrongs being done to them , and for preserving peace and friendship with them . ' When the compact here under consideration was adopted and confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the deed of cession is fully , absolutely and amply , ratified and confirmed , in all its parts ; and is hereby declared to he binding and conclusive on the said state , her government and citizens , forever . ' Thus Georgia , in the most solemn manner , bound herself not to sanction any invasion or disturhance of the Indians in their rights , and secured the imposition of the same obligation upon new states afterwards to be formed . Consequently , when Mississippi and Alabama were admitted into the Union , the ordinance of 1787 , containing the passage above cited , was expressly adopted by each of these states , as the indispensable condition of its admission . In December , 1827 , not three years ago , Georgia , by an act of her legislature , asserted the right of taking possession of the Cherokee country by force . She declared , that the Indians were tenants at her will , that she wanted their lands , and would have them . It is not our intention , after all that has been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim . There may be some use , however , in stating briefly , in how many ways , and for what length of time , Georgia has bound herself not to assert it . 1 . Oglethorpe , the founder of the colony , and all his associates , went upon the ground that the Indians had a right to their own lands . He solicited permission to settle at Savannah ; and every foot of territory , which he and his successors gained , was gained by treaties and defined by known boundaries . The engagements were numerous and positive , that whites should not intrude upon any lands , which the Indians had // not sold . The general intercourse between the parties stood entirely upon this basis . The colonists came as friends of the Indians . In this character alone , and with a view to the permanent benefit of the Indians , did they plead for the cession of lands . For many years after the first settlement , they might have been cut off , in a single day , by the natives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the negotiation of which , the governors of Georgia , the two Carolinas , and Virginia , and the King 's superintendent of Indian affairs , were associated . AlL the southwestern tribes were represented , and their right to their own lands was in the strongest manner implied . Thus , in the infancy of the colony , and during forty-three years before the declaration of independence , the treaties , and the daily intercourse , were all in favor of the rights of the Indians . 2 . In the course of the revolutionary war , various negotiations were held between the Cherokees , and the authorities of Georgia . A treaty was formed at De Witt 's Corner , in 1777 , by commissioners duly empoxvered by the States of South Carolina and Georgia , and by Indian councils . The whole aspect of the transactions is that of negotiations between independent powers , capable of binding themselves and their posterity . After the close of the war , several other treaties were made between the Cherokees and Georgia , acting as an independent State . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding ones . 3 . Georgia was one of the confederated States ; and , during the existence of the confederation , the treaty of Hopewell was formed . Georgia remonstrated against it on the single ground , that it belonged to her , as a separate State , to treat with Indians occupying a part of the land within her chartered limits . She did not object to the great principles of the treaty ; that is , a definite boundary and an implicit guaranty . Congress was not convinced by her remonstrance . On the contrary , a proclamation was issued by Congress , in 1788 , to enforce the treaty of Hopewell ; and preparations were made to march troops from the Ohio to defend the Cherokees against intruders , according to the stipulations of that instrument . In 1790 , General Washington , in the second year of his presidency , declared the treaty to be in force , and expressed his determination to execute it . Thus , as a confederated State , was Georgia bound by this treaty with the Indians , as truly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // 4 . The federal constitution provides , that all treaties previously made , ' and all which should be made thereafter , shall be the supreme law of the land . ' The treaty of Hopewell was then in existence . In the language of Mr. Bates , Georgia , by adopting the Constitution , a reed , at least , to this treaty . Nor is there the slightest foundation for the suggestion , that she did not intend to affirm this treaty . Let it be recollected , that this treaty was not only uniformly called a treaty , and known as such , but of all other treaties , this was most likely to be distinctly in view . 1st . Because it was the subject of her remonstrance to Congress in 1786. 2d . Because the boundary to which it related had been a matter of perpetual dispute between her and the United States ; and , 3d . Because , when she adopted the Constitution , the proclamatjon of Congress was then before the people , requiring submission to this very treaty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georgia . Of all subjects , therefore , which Georgia had openly and fully in view , this was the most prominent , made so by the important contemporaneous events which affected that State individually . But , independent of all this , it is enough that it was then deemed a treaty , and , as such , was made the supreme law of the land . ' p. 239 . The constitution also provides , that treaties shall be made by the general government , and shall not be made by separate States ; so that , by acceding to the constitution , Georgia bound herself in advance , as did every other State , to abide by every treaty which should be proclaimed as a treaty , by the competent authority of the nation . How is it possible , that this power could have been lodged in other hands , than those of the nation ? And how can it be contended , for a moment , that every State is not bound by these highest acts of national sovereignty ? 5 . During the thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government and the compact of 1802 , seven treaties were formed between the United States and the Indian nations residing within the chartered limits of Georgia . The two first of these treaties , one with the Creeks , the other with the Cherokees , contain the articles of solemn guaranty , which have so often been mentioned . It is believed , that all these treaties received the unanimous approbation of the Senate . No advocate of Georgia has asserted , so far as we have been able to learn , that a single Senator of Georgia withheld his assent from any of these treatLs . The treaty of // Hoiston , containing the guaranty of the Cherokee country , was never made the subject of complaint in any form . The treaty of Tellico , in which the guaranty was declared to be forever , was negotiated by George Walton , an eminent citizen of Georgia , in honor of whom she has lately called a county by his name . Preceding treaties are , iii this document , recognised as in force , together with the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue . ' 6 . It has been shown at large , that by the compact of 1802 , Georgia acknowledged the validity of treaties , and looked to them as the only legitimate method of extinguishing the Indian title . 7 . Since the compact of 1802 , ten treaties have been made by the United States with the Cherokees , and six with the Creeks ; all in accordance with the principles of previous treaties . It is not intimated , that any senator from Georgia , or from any other State , objected to their ratification . By these treaties Georgia obtained possession of Indian lands , nearly equal in extent to all New England , except Maine . 8 . All the constituted authorities of Georgia , including her Governors , legislators , Senators in Congress and Representatives , have uniformly , down to the year 1827 , admitted the validity of treaties with Indians . The legislature and the delegation from that State in Congress , were in the habit of urging the United States to make new treaties with the Cherokees and Creeks . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed a memorial to the President of the United States , in which it is declared , that the State of Georgia claims a right to the jurisdiction and soil of the territory within her limits . She admits , however , that the right is inchoate , remaining to he perfected hy the United States , in the extinction of the Indian title . ' In 1825 , the Governor of Georgia , now a Senator in Congress , commanded obedience to a treaty with the Creeks , as the supreme law of the land . The last commissioners , who attempted to treat with the Cherokees , ( both of them citizens of Georgia ) , announced in writing , that the Uni* ted States alone could negotiate with the Indian nations , or extinguish the title to their lands . In these various ways has Georgia , during the whole period of her existence , from 1733 to 1827 , acknowledged the necessity of obtaining the Indian territory by amicable treaties . All her eminent statesmen ,  --  all her constituted authorities ,  --  have // united in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . How is it possible , that a State should ever be bound , if Georgia is not bound by these transactions ? If England were bound to France by stipulations , which could be supported by a thousandth part as much evidence as exists on this subject , and should refuse to acknowledge the obligation , the whole civilised world would denounce her as regardless of her faith . Yet , so many plausible words have been used , and there has been so much parade of reasoning on the subject of State rights , and conflicting powers , that some respectable and honorable men have been misled . The scene is distant from the northern States . A dimness is cast over the whole subject , in many minds , as to the condition and rights of Indians living in the woods . We have thought it might be useful , therefore , to change the scene , and to state a case perfectly parallel , though relating to a different tribe , and a different State , in order to make the matter so plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that one of the New England tribes of Indians , the Mohegans , for instance , were found on the arrival of the pilgrims , in possession of all the territory now contained in Massachusetts ; that they permitted the first settlers to land , and received them as friends ; and that they made new cessions of territory , as the settlements were extending . The whites encroached , difficulties arose , and wars succeeded ; yet peace was repeatedly made , on equal terms , and by the establishment of a known boundary . This was the progress of things , we will suppose , till the commencement of the revolutionary war , when the Mohegans , having placed themselves under the protection of Great Britain , and being persuaded by agents of the mother-country , took up arms against the colonies . We will proceed with the supposition , as though it were history , and without further interruption . In 1777 , Massachusetts held a negotiation with the Mohegans , by commissioners with full powers , when a peace was made and boundaries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe in 1783 and in subsequent years . Massachusetts , being a member of the confederation , a treaty was made with the Mohegans by the United States , in 1785 , by which peace was established , prisoners were exchanged , reciprocity was observed on other important points , and an implicit // guaranty of territory was given . Massachusetts protested against this treaty , on the ground that she alone ought to negotiate with Indians occupying a part of her chartered limits , but not denying the right of the Mohegans to their own country and government . Congress was not in the least moved from its purpose by this protest ; hut held that the United States had the sole power , by the articles of confederation , of making treaties with Indian nations , situated as the Mohegans then were . In 1788 , Congress issued a proclamation against intruders with the express obj2ct of ' enforcing the treaty . After the adoption of the federal constitution , General Washington declared the treaty of 1785 to he in force , and that he should use all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it maintained with good faith . At the moment of making this declaration , he sent a special message to the Senate , proposing this question : Does the Senate advise and consent solemnly to guaranty to the Mohegans the lands which they occupy ? ' To which the Senate ( the members from Massachusetts being present ) , unanimously answer in the affirmative . A treaty was formed in the year 1791 , between the United States and the Mohegans , by which Connecticut river was made the eastern boundary of the Indian country , which then embraced what is now the western part of Massachusetts , the southern part of Vermont , the northwestern corner of Connecticut , and the part of New York which lies east of the Hudson river . In this treaty , the United States solemnly guaranty to the .7I'Iiohegan nation all their lands not hereby ceded . ' Mauy stipulations are made , and , among the rest , the Mohegans engage , that they will not form any treaty with a separate State . They grant to the United States the privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to navigate the Housatonic river . The United States promise to give them implements of husbandry , that they may become herdsmen and cultivators , and with a view to their permanent attachment to their soil . The United States also engage , that , if any citizen of the United States shall go into the Mohegan country and commit a crime there , or do an injury to a peaceable Indian , such citizen shall be punished by the courts of the United States , in the same manner as if a similar crime had been committed within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts , or within any territorial district of the United States . The Mohegans , on their part , agree to deliver up for // punishment any of their people , and any who take refuge in their nation , who have committed trespasses upon neighboring whites ; and , in consequence of the various stipulations in their favor , they agree to be under the protection of the United States , and of no other sovereign whatever . This treaty was ratified by tl ) e Senate unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Vermont making any objection ; and Massachusetts never having objected to the guaranty of 1791 , down to the present day . Seven years afterwards , another treaty was made with the Mohegans , negotiated by an eminent citizen of Massachusetts , acting as a commissioner of the United States , which expressly extends the guaranty of the Mohegan country forever . Massachusetts having long had claims to western lands , which the United States would not acknowledge , a compact is formed between that State and the United States , in 1802 . By this compact , Massachusetts cedes to the United States all her claim to the western lands , accepting as an equivalent a large sum of money and an engagement that the United States would extinguish the Mohegan title as soon as it could be done peaceably , and on reasonable terms several clauses in the compact implying , that the title was to be extinguished by treaty with the Indians , and that the treaty was to be made between them and the United States , Massachusetts having no agency in any such transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and the Mohegans , all with the acquicscence of Massachusetts , and some of them at her solicitation . By these treaties , she acquired lands of the Mohegans , till their territory , so far as Massachusetts is concerned , was reduced to what lies west of the counties of Franklin , Hampsaire and Hampden , where the Mohegan nation still remains , upon the ground derived from the immemorial occupancy of preceding generations . In one of these treaties , the Mohegans granted to the United States the privilege of a road , which should pass through their country from Rutland , Vermont , to Litchfleld , Connecticut . In another it was stipulated , that the agent of the United States , residing among the Indians for their benefit , might cultivate land for a field and garden , so long as he should reside there in that capacity . In the last of these treaties but one , a treaty negotiated by the individual , who is now President of the United States , provision was // made for the permanent residence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were confirmed ; and the very last , negotiated by the individual , who is now Vice-President of the United States , is declared to be formed for the preservation of the Mohegan nation ; provision is made in it for a permanent school fund , to be expended in the country now occupied by that nation ; and the intercourselaw of the United States is permanently pledged for the protection of the Mohegans against the whites . In the war of 1812 , the Mohegans sent a larger proportion of warriors than any State in the Union , according to their numbers , volnateering their services under the banners of the United States . They fought by the side , and under the orders , of the commander , who is now President of the United States . Some of their bravest and best men fell on the field of battle ; and those , who survived , were cheered and applauded as faithful allies , and generous disinterested friends , fully deserving the guaranty , which they had received . The State of Massachusetts , however , importunately presses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature all the while acknowledges , that treaties must he made by the United States , before the title can be extinguished . The Governor of Massachusetts , in 1825 , proclaims treaties with the IXlohegans to be the supreme law of the land . The Representatives in Congress from Massachusetts , as late as the spring of 1827 , leave upon the records a formal protest against a law , which assumed that a certain treaty with Indians was void on account of fraud . The reason assigned by these Representatives was , that a treaty was an instrument of so high a character , that rights vested immediately on its execution , and it could not be set aside , even by a subsequent treaty , and for manifest corruption . In the mean time , while these treaties , and laws for their execution , were carried into effect with the universal acquiescence of the rulers and people of every State in the Union , the Mnhegans were making rapid improvements in civilisation . The Secretary of War ( Mr. Crawford ) , whom we will suppose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol of that State , took the lead in promoting the best interests of the natives . He wrote an official letter to invite the co-operation of benevolent societies with the government in measures for the intellectual and moral improvement of the Indians . // From him the first impulse was received toward the support and establishment of schools , by the General Government , for the instruction of Indian children . Various efficient causes of improvement were in operation ; and the Mohegans formed a regular republican government , upon the best models . All these things were perfectly well known to the inhabitants of all the northern States . If a gentleman was travelling from Boston to Albany , he knew he was to pass through the Mohegan nation . He did pass through it . He knew when he crossed the limits . He saw the natives at work on their farms . He lodged at their houses . He visited their schools . He spent the Sabbath with them , and engaged with them in the most solemn ordinances of public worship . He read their newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . They told him what their relations with the United States were , and that they were accurately and minutely described in treaties . They added , that , in the execution of these treaties , white intruders had been tepeatedly driven off , by the armed force of the United States . The people of Albany , of Northampton , of Hartford , and of Rutland , came into the Mohegan nation , to witness the improvement of the Indian pupils ; and the teachers returned these visits . All the people knew what the Mohegan nation was , and what its rights were , as solemnly guarantied by the United States . Not a State in the Union had its limits more exactly known , or its separate existence more positively guarantied . But , while things were in this condition , Massachusetts suddenly resolves , in December , 1827 , that she has waited long enough for the Mohegan lands ; that , as she can not get them by negotiation , she has a right to take them by force ; that she will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have failed ; that the Mohegans never had any right to their country ; that they are the tenants at will of Massachusetts ; that their lands belong to her ; that the King of England gave them to her two hundred years ago ; and that she wants the Mohegan lands , and will have them . These things Massachusetts solemnly declares , before the world , in the year 1827 , by resolutions adopted in both branches of her legislature ; and she directs her governor to send a copy to the President of the United States , which duty was faithfully performed . The next year , 1828 , Massachusetts extends her laws over // the Mohegans ; and annexes all that part of their territory , which lies within her chartered limits , to the counties of Franklin , Hampshire and Hampden . She enacts at the same time , that no Mohegan , nor any descendant of a Mohegan , shall be either a party or a witness in a court of justice . These measures she follows up , in 1829 , by enacting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the tribe from emigrating , he shall be liable to imprisonment four years ; and if any member of the tribe shall endeavor to prevent any chief from selling the whole Mohegan country , he shall be imprisoned not less than four years , nor more than six years . When the civilised world begins to express astonishment at these remarkable doings , Massachusetts bestirs herself to produce arguments in justification ; and her arguments are these . 1 . She alleges , that the American aborigines were in a state of nature , when New England was first settled from Europe , and men in a state of nature can neither be entitled to property , nor to the protection of law ; from whence she infers , that the Mohegans may justly be driven from their patrimonial inheritance , although they are not in a state of nature , but have lived by her side under the protection of international and municipal law , for two hundred years . 2 . She alleges that , according to Vattel , erratic tribes , savages in the hunter state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lands to their more civilised neighbors for cultivation ; therefore the Mohegans , who are not an erratic tribe , and not in the hunter state , but herdsmen and cultivators , may justly he ejected from all their lands , which they have derived from their ancestors , which they have neither forfeited nor sold , and which have been guarantied to them for ever by the United States . 3 . She says , that it is an established principle , that barbarians should yield to civilised men ; and therefore the Mohegans , who are not barbarians ; who have demeaned themselves peaceably towards the United States for the last forty years ; who have learned to read and write ; who have a printed language of their own , and send forth a newspaper weekly , shall leave their native land and seek a residence elsewhere . Not appearing to be altogether satisfied with these reasons , Massachusetts says , that she is to be the only judge of her own limits ; that she shall defend her exclusive right to her own territory ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no business to meddle with her affairs : that , therefore , she is not bound by her assent to the constitution of the United States , which says , that the meaning and effect of treaties and laws are to be decided by the courts of the United States ; nor by her own compact of 1802 , which admits the Indian title , and prescribes the manner in which it is to be extinguished , if extinguished at all . In short , she declares roundly , that she will interpret all her obligations for herself , without asking the opinion of any one ; or , in other words , that her present inclination is her only rule of duty . Mutctto nomine , de te Fabuict narratur . This rapid sketch of supposed history is a faithful exhibition of the actual conduct of Georgia ; though it is by no means so strong an exhibition , as a fuller statement would make it . How is it possible to doubt , that the south-western tribes of Indians , living on lands which they derived from their fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and the United States , have a perfect original right , and a perfect right by compact , to the continued occupancy of their country , as long as they please to occupy it ? Those who urge the removal of the Indians say , that such a measure would be greatly for their advantage . Our limits do not permit us to enter at large into this question of utility . If the Indians remove to better their condition , it is manifest that their removal should be voluntary . They should have time to consider the subject . No threats should be used . They should have abundant opportunity to examine the country , to which they are to be removed . The territory allotted to each tribe should be designated , and the title made clear . It should be rendered certain , that they can be protected in their new residence , from the encroachments of lawless whites . If all this can be done , and the Indians , with an intelligent regard to their own welfare , uninfluenced by threats , or bribes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not a man in the country , who would object to it . Before a reflecting and benevolent man will take the responsibility of advising the Indians generally to remove , he will examine the subject thoroughly ; and will gain satisfaction on several topics , some of which are the following . In the first place , it should be ascertained , that there is good // land enough , at the disposal of the United States , for the accommodation of all the tribes to be removed . The land should not only be capable of cultivation ultimately , but should now be in such a condition , that Indians can live comfortably and contentedly upon it . But a large tract of territory , which would answer this description , must be extremely valuable hereafter ; much more valuable , than the remnants of their hereditary possessions , to which some of the tribes are reduced , and to which others might consent to reduce themselves , if they could rest secure in the guaranty of the United States . In order to be certain as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is habitable , accurate surveys should be made by competent and responsible agents ; and ample opportunity should be given to the Indians to explore their future habitation for themselves . Again ; it should be made to appear clearly , that the Indians are to enjoy security in their new place of residence . This can be done in no other way , than by showing , in the most decisive manner , that they are to be protected where they now are . If they can not he thus protected , it is futile to talk about protection any where . If they may now be dispossessed of their original inheritance , because they are within the chartered limits of states , they may hereafter be driven from the lands which they shall receive as a grant from the General Government , because they will then be within the national limits of the United States . The General Government can do no more , in regard to securing a title to the Indians , than the several States have done repeatedly . If these engagements of States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , prove utterly insufficient to protect the Indians , how can the acts of the General Government alone afford any solid ground of confidence ? Constitutional scruples now exist in one shape . Twenty years hence they will exist in some other shape ; and , in whatever shape they exist , they may be made the pretext for taking Indian lands , unless compacts are to be executed according to the intention of the parties , clearly expressed in the compacts themselves . Beside a guaranty of territory , these Indian tribes , before they refriove , should have good reason to rely upon the protection of the United States against mischievous white intruders . For various reasons , which there is not room here to specify , the emigrant Indians will be much more exposed to // renegados from civilised communities , than they are on the land of their fathers . The country to be allotted to the tribes , which shall remove , is much easier of access , than the present Cherokee nation . Steam-boats , with hundreds of intruders , can ascend the Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allured thither by the money , which will be distributed for annuities , salaries , and rations . The victims of their rapacity will be numerous , and crowded together . The more easily the Indians yield to temptation , the less sympathy will be felt for them . The more protection they need , the less will they receive . Already , the emigrants , though comparatively few in number , experience these evils . The Cherokees of the Arkansas , who have removed only a hundred miles , have been terribly annoyed by dealers in whiskey since their removal . The reason is , that the emigrants were expected to receive a considerable sum of money from the United States , and greedy speculators were on the spot to profit by it . If we may judge by a reference to the known principles of human nature , or by what has taken place already , we can not suppose , that agents of the United States among the Indians will be men of sufficient virtue , intelligence , and public spirit , to make vigorous and persevering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is done , the emigrant Indians will be destroyed . If all the preliminaries can be fixed to the satisfaction of the Indians , and of the disinterested and intelligent portion of the American people , a removal may properly be commenced . But even in this case , the process should be gradual . Let the first trial be made by a small tribe , with great caution , and under the most favorable auspices . If this should prove successful , the larger tribes would have more confidence in the plan , and the government and people of the United States would see the need , and the benefits , of continued caution and vigilance . There is no need of haste . Indeed , there is no apology for it . One of the Senators of Georgia said in his place , towards the close of the debate on the Indian bill , that Georgia had a very inconsiderable interest in this question . The friends of the Indians knew this perfectly well before ; but they did not expect so distinct an avowal from such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , in private conversation , that there is no necessity for removing the Indians . No well-informed man can doubt the correctness of this re // mark . How , then , can the people of the United States justify to themselves , or to the world , a course of measures , which is not called for by any exigency , which appears inconsistent with the most obvious principles of fair dealing , and which , as many of the best and wisest men among us fully believe , will bring upon the Indian tribes either a speedy or a lingering ruin , and upon ourselves the deep and lasting infamy of a breach of faith ? qwq tions. career in the son who so long lingers among the last of those bright clouds , " That on the steady breeze of honor sail In long succession calm and beautifuL " Here stands to-day as of yore our little city of the rocks ; here let her stand forever , on the man-bearing granite of the North !

We praised the Puritans because we did not *nd in ourselves the spirit to do the like . We praised with a certain adulation the invariable valor of the old war-gods and war-councilors of the Revolution . Washington has seemed an exceptional virtue . This praise was a concession of unworthiness in those who had so much to say of it . The heroes only shared this power of a sentiment which , if it now breathes into us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we shall not longer flatter them . Let us shame the fathers by superior virtue in the sons . JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL . AI ! rEn a man 's long work is over and the sound of his voice is still , those in whose regard he has held a high place find his image strangely simplified and summarized . The hand of death , in passing over it , has smoothed the folds , has made it more typical and general . The figure retained by the memory is compressed and intensified ; accidents have dropped away from it and shades have ceased to count ; it stands , sharply , for a few estimated and cherished things , rather than , nebulously , for a swarm of possibilities . We cut the silhouette , in a word , out of the confusion of life , we save and fix the outline , and it is with his eye on this profiled distinction that the critic speaks . It is his function to speak with assurance , when once his impression has become final ; and it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to deliver myself on such an occasion as a critic . It is not that due conviction is absent ; it is only that the function is a cold one . It is not that the final impression is dim ; it is only that it is made on a softer part of the spirit than the critical sense . The procc*s is more mystical , the deposited image is insistently personal , the generalizing principle is that of loyalty . I can therefore not pretend to write of James Russell Lowell in the tone of detachment and classification ; I can only offer a few anticipatory touches for a portrait that asks for a steadier hand . It may be professional prejudice , but as the whole color of his life was literary , so it seems to me that we may see in his high and happy fortune the most substantial honor gathered by the practice of letters from a world preoccupied with other things . It was in looking at him as a man of letters that one got closest to him , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding his career as in the last analysis a tribute to the dominion of style . This is the idea that his name most promptly evokes , to my sense ; and though it was not by any means the only idea he cherished , the unity of his career is surely to be found in it . He carried style - the style of literature - into regions in which we rarely look for it : into politics , of all places in the world , into diplomacy , into stammering civic dinners and ponderous anniversaries , into letters and notes and telegrams , into every turn of the hour - absolutely into conversation , where indeed it freely disguised itself as intensely colloquial wit . Any friendly estimate of him is foredoomed to savor potently of reminiscence , so that I may mention how vividly I recall the occasion on which he first struck me as completely representative . The association could only grow , but the essence of it was all there , on the eve of his going as minister to Spain . It was late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London on his way to Madrid , in the hushed gray August , and I remember dining with him at a dim little hotel in Park Street , which I had never entered before and have never entered since , but which , whenever I pass it , seems to look at me with the melancholy of those inanimate things that have participated . That particular evening remained , in my fancy , a kind of bridge between his old bookish and his new worldly life ; which however had much more in common than they had in distinction . He turned the pages of the later experience with very much the same contemplative reader 's sense with which , in his library , be had , for years , smoked the student 's pipe over a thousand volumes ; the only difference was that a good many of the leaves were still to cut . At any rate , he was enviably gay and amused , and this preliminary hour struck me , literally , as the reward of consistency . It was tinted with the promise of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all behind it , and what was to come seemed an ideal opportunity for the nourished mind . That the American years had been diluted with several visits to Europe was not a flaw in the harmony , for to recollect certain other foreign occasions - pleasant Parisian and delightful Italian strolls - was to remember that if these had been months of absence for him , they were for me , on the wings of his talk , hours of repatriation . This talk was humorously and racily fond , charged with a perfect drollery of reference to the other country ( there were always two  --  the one we were in and the one we were n't ) , the details of my too sketchy conception of which , admitted for argument , he showed endless good nature in filling in . It was a joke polished by much use that I was dreadfully // at sea about my native land ; and it would have been pleasant indeed to know even less than I did , so that I might have learned the whole story from Mr. Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , a magnificent conception , an admirably consistent and lovable object of allegiance . If the sign that , in Europe , one knew him best by was his intense *national consciousness , one felt that this consciousness could not sit lightly on a man in whom it was the strongest form of piety . Fortunately for him , and for his friends , he was one of the most whimsical , one of the wittiest , of human beings , so that he could play with his patriotism and make it various . All the same , one felt in it , in talk , the depth of passion that hums through much of his finest verse - almost the only passion that , to my sense , his poetry contains , the accent of chivalry , of the lover , the knight ready to do battle for his mistress . Above all it was a particular allegiance to New England - a quarter of the earth in respect to which the hand of long habit , of that affection which is usually half convenience , never let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic to him , for he felt in his pulses the whole history of her origines ; it was impossible to know him without a sense that he had a rare divination of the hard realities of her past . The Biglow Papers show to what a tune he could play with his patriotism - all literature contains , I think , no finer sport ; but he is serious enough when he speaks of the " strange New World , that yit wast never young , Whose youth , from thee , by gripin ' need was wrung , Brown foundlin ' of the woods whose baby-bed Was prowled round by the Injun 's cracklin ' tread , And who grew'st strong thro ' shifts and wants and pains , Nussed by stern men with empires in their brains . " He was never at trouble to conceal his respect for such an origin as that , and when he came to Europe in 1877 this sentiment was one of the things he brought with him at the top of his luggage . One of the others was the extraordinary youthfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it was only with the lapse of years that the relation of age settled . upon the right note ) constantly forget that he had copious antecedents . In the times when the difference counted for more - old Cambridge days that seem far away now - I doubtless thought him more professorial than he felt , but I am sure that in the sequel I never thought him younger . The boy in him was never more articulate than during the last summer that he spent in England , two years before his death . Since the recollection comes of itself , I may mention , as my earliest impression of him , the charm that certain of his Harvard lectures - on English literature , on Old French - had for a very immature person , who was supposed to be pursuing , in one of the schools , a very different branch of knowledge , but who on dusky winter afternoons escaped with irresponsible zeal into the glow of Mr. Lowell 's learned lamplight , the particular incidence of which , in the small , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I recall with extreme vividness . He talked communicatively of style , and where else , in all the place , was any such talk to be heard ? It made a romance of the hour - it made even a picture of the scene ; it was an unforgettable initiation . If he was American enough in Europe , in America he was abundantly European . He was so steeped in history and literature that to some yearning young persons be made the taste of knowledge sweeter , almost , than it was ever to be again . He was redolent , intellectually speaking , of Italy and Spain ; he had lived in long intimacy with // Dante and Calderon ; he embodied , to envious aspirants , the happy intellectual fortune - independent years in a full library , years of acquisition without haste and without rest , a robust love of study which went sociably arm in arm with a robust love of life . This love of life was so strong in him that he could lose himself in little diversions as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural , everything that had color and character , and no gayety , no sense of comedy , was ever more easily kindled by contact . When he was not surrounded by great pleasures he could find his account in small ones , and no situation could be dull for a man in whom all reflection , all reaction , was witty . I waited some years really to know him , but it was to find at once that he was delightful to walk with . He spent the winter of 1872-73 in Paris , and if I had not already been fond of the streets of that city , his example and companionship would have made me so . We both had the habit of long walks , and he knew his Paris as he knew all his subjects . The history of a thing was always what he first saw in it - he recognized it as a link in an interminable chain . He led , at this season , the most home-keeping , book-buying life , and Old French texts made his evenings dear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he usually stayed ) into an intensely local and extremely savory little hotel in the Faubourg Saint-Germain , unknown to tourists but patronized by deputies , where the table d'h*5te , at which the host sat down with the guests and contradiction flourished , was a page of Balzac , full of illustration for the humorist . I used sometimes , of a Sunday evening , to dine there , and to this day , on rainy winter nights , I never cross the Seine amid the wet flare of the myriad lamps , never note the varnished ru*h of the river or the way the Louvre grows superb in the darkness , without a recur-January , rent consciousness of the old sociable errand , the sense of dipping into a still denser Paris , with the Temps and M. Sarcey in my pocket . We both spent the following winter - he at least the larger part of it - in Florence , out of manifold memories of which certain hours in his company , certain charmed Italian afternoons in Boboli gardens , on San Miniato terraces , come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had indeed memories of earlier Italian times , some of which he has admirably recorded - anecdotes , tormenting to a late comer , of the superseded , the missed . He himself , in his perpetual freshness , seemed to come so late that it was always a surprise to me that he had started so early . Almost any Italy , however , was good enough for him , and he kept criticism for great occasions , for the wise relapse , the study-chair and the vanquished hesitation ( not timid , but overbrimining , like a vessel dangerous to move ) of that large prose pen which was so firm when once set in motion . He liked the Italian people - he liked the people everywhere , and the warm street life and the exquisite idiom ; the Tuscan tongue , indeed , so early ripe and yet still so perfectly alive , was one of the comforts of the world to him . He produced that winter a poem so ample and noble that it was worthy to come into being in classic air - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as a summary of all his vigors and felicities , his most geniaf achievement , and ( after the Harvard Commemoration Ode ) the truest expression of his poetic nature . It is hard to lend to a great old house , in Italy , even when it has become a modern inn , any associations as romantic as those it already wears ; but what the high-windowed face of the Florentine H6tel du Nord speaks to me of to-day , over its chattering cab-stand and across the statued pillar of the little square of the Holy Trinity , is neither its ancient // 1892 . James Russell Lowell. honor nor its actual fall , but the sound , one December evening , by the fire the poet pronounces " starved , " of " I can not think he wished so soon to die With all his senses full of eager heat , And rosy years that stood expectant by To buckle the winged sandals on their feet , tHe that was friends with Earth , and all her sweet Took with both hands unsparingly . " Of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gathered from his talk , after he took possession , late in the spring of 1879 , of the post in London rendered vacant by the retirement of Mr. John Welsh ; much of it inevitably referring to the domestic sorrow - the prolonged illness of his admirable wife - which cast over these years a cloud that darkened further during the early part of his English period . I remember getting from him a sense that a diplomatic situation at Madrid was not quite so enlivening as might have been expected , and that for the American representatives at least , there was not enough business to give a savor to duty . This particular representative 's solution of every personal problem , however , was a page of philology in a cloud of tobacco , and as he had seen the picture before through his studies , so now he doubtless saw his studies through the picture . The palace was a part of it , where the ghost of Charles V. still walked and the princesses were what is called in princesses literary . The diplomatic circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whist ; what his own share of the game was animated by may be left to the imagination of those who remember the irrepressibility , on his lips , of the comic idea . It might have been taken for granted he was well content to be transferred to England ; but I have no definite recollection of the degree of his satisfaction l* &gt;rehand . I think he was mainly conscious of the weight of the new responsibility , so that the unalloyed pleasure was that of his friends and of the most enlightened part of the public in the two countries , to which the appointment appeared to have an unusual felicity . It was made , as it were , for quality , and that continued to be the sign of the function so long as Mr. Lowell exercised it . The difficulty - if I may speak of difficulty - was that all judgment of it was necessarily a priori . It was impossible for him to know what a success , in vulgar parla*ice , he might make of a totally untried character , and above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . During the years of his residence in London on an official footing it constantly struck me that it was the office that inclined , at every turn , to him , rather than he who inclined to the office . I may appear to speak too much of this phase of his life as the most memorable part of it - especially considering how short a time it occupied in regard to the whole ; but in addition to its being the only long phase of which I can speak at all closely from personal observation , it is just to remember that these were the years in which all the other years were made most evident . " We knew him and valued him ages before , and never stinted our appreciation , never waited to care for him till he had become the fashion , " his American readers and listeners , his pupils and colleagues , might say ; to which the answer is that those who admired him most were just those who might naturally rejoice in the multiplication of his opportunities . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of what these opportunities were to be , and in fact there was no defining them in advance ; what they proved to be , on the spot , was anything and everything that he might make them . I remember hearing him say , a day or two after his arrival , " Oh , I ye lost all my wit - you must n't look to me for good things now . " The words were uttered to a gentleman who had found one of his // " things " very good , and who , having a political speech to make in a day or two , had thriftily asked his leave to bring it in . There could have been no better example of the experimental nature of his acceptance of the post ; for the very foundation of the distinction that lie gave it was his great reserve of wit . He had no idea how much he had left till he tried it , and he had never before had so much occasion to try it . This uncertainty might pervade the minds even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his start ; but those friends would have had singularly little imagination if they had failed to be struck , in a general way , with the highly civilized character of his mission . There are circumstances in operation ( too numerous to recite ) which combine to undermine greatly the felicity of the representative of the United States in a foreign country ; it is , to speak summanly , in many respects a singularly uncomfortable honor . I can not express more strongly how happy Mr. Lowell 's opportunity seemed to be than by saymg that he struck people at the moment as enviable . It was an intensification of the impression given by the glimpse of him on his way to Spain . The true reward of an English style was to be sent to England , and if his career in that country was , throughout , amusing , in the highest sense of the term , this result was , for others at least , a part of their gratified suspense as to the further possibilities of the style . From the friendly and intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be a kind of drama , a spectacle ; and if one had already lived a few years in London one could have an interesting prevision of some of its features . London is a great personage , and with those with whom she establishes a relation she always plays , as it were , her game . This game , throughout Mr. Lowell 's residence , but especially during the early part , was exciting ; so much so that I remember being positively sorry , as if I were leaving the theatre before the fall of the curtain , when at that time , more than once , I found myself , by visits to the Continent , obliged to turn my back upon it . The sight of his variety was a help to know London better ; and it was a question whether he could ever know her so well as those who could freely consider the pair together . He offered her from the first a nut to crack , a morsel to roll under her tongue . She is the great consumer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing the image , I should say that she is too unwieldy to feed herself , and requires , in. recurring seasons , as she sits , prodigiously , at her banquet , to be approached with the consecrated ladle . She placed this implement in Mr. Lowell 's hands with a confidence se immediate as to be truly touching - a confidence that speaks for the eventual amalgamation of the Anglo-Saxon race in a way that , surely , no casual friction can obliterate . She can confer conspicuity , at least for the hour , so well that she is constantly under the temptation to do so ; she holds a court for those who speak to her , and she is perpetually trying voices . She recognized Mr. Lowell 's from the first and appointed him really her speaker-in-chief . She has a peculiar need , which when you know her well you understand , of being eased off with herself , and the American minister speedily appeared just the man to ease her . He played into her talk and her speeches , her conimemorations and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes . She has immense wheels which are always going round , and the ponderous precision of which can be observed only on the spot . They naturally demand something te grind , and the machine holds out great iron hands r draws in reputations and talents , or sometimes only names and phrases . Mr. Lowell immediately found himself , // in England , whether to his surprise or no I am unable to say , the first of after-dinner speakers . It was perhaps somewhat to the surprise of his public there , for it was not to have been calculated in advance that he would have become so expert in his own country - a country sparing of feast-days and ceremonies . His ' practice had been great before he came to London , but his performance there would have been a strain upon any practice . It was a point of honor with him never to refuse a challenge , and this attitude , under the circumstances , was heroic , for he became a convenience that really tended to multiply occasions . It was exactly his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of his mission , the particular manner in which it made for civilization . It was the revanche of letters ; that , throughout , was the particular note of the part he played . There would have been no revanche if he had played it inadequately ; therefore it was a pleasure to feel that he was accomplished up to the hilt . Those who did n't like him pronounced him too accomplished , too omniscient ; but , save in a sense that I will specify , I never saw him commit himself unadvisedly , and much is to be forgiven a love of precise knowledge which keeps a man out of mistakes . He had a horror of them ; no one was ever more in love with the idea of being right and of keeping others from being wrong . The famous Puritan conscience , which was a persistent part of his heredity , operated in him perhaps most strongly on the scholarly side . He enjoyed the detail of research and the discussion of differences , and he had an instinct for rectification which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have noted - the serenity of that larger reputation which came to him late in life , which had been paid for in advance , and in regard to which his finished discharge of his diplomatic duties acted , if not , cer tainly , as a cause , at least as a stimulus* The reputation was not , doubtless , the happiest thing ; the happiest thing wa* the inward opportunity , the chance to absorb into an intelligence extraordinarily prepared a peculiarly full revelation . He had studied English history for forty years in the texts , and at last he could study it in the pieces themselves , could handle and verify the relics . For the man who in such a position recognizes his advantages , England makes . herself a museum of illustration . She is at home in the comfortable dust of her ages , where there is no need of excavation , as she has never been buried , and the explorer finds the ways as open to him as the corridors of an exhibition It was an exhibition of which Mr. Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living ; it brought him back repeatedly after his public mission had expired , and it was perpetually suggestive to him while that mission lasted . If he played his part so well here - I allude now more particularly to the social and expressive side of it - it was because he was so open to suggestion . Old England spoke to him so much as a man of letters that it was inevitable he should answer her back . On the firmness and tact with which he acquitted himself of his strictly diplomatic work I shall not presume to touch ; his success was . promptly appreciated in quarters where the official record may be found , as well as in others less discoverable to-day , columns congruous with their vituperative " headings , " where it must be looked for between the lines . These latter responsibilities , begotten mainly of the Irish complication , were heavy ones , but they were doubtless , for Mr. Lowell , the keenest interest of his term , and I include them essentially in the picture afforded by that term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrasts have been effectively timed ; in which the invading and acclaiming world has entered too late // to interfere , to distract , but still in time to fertilize ; in which contacts have multiplied and horizons widened gradually ; in which , in short , the dessert has come after the dinner , the answer after the question , and the proof after the patience . I may seem to exaggerate in Mr. Lowell 's history the importance of the last dozen years of his life - especially if the reckoning be made of the amount of characteristic production that preceded them . He was the same admirable writer that he appears to-day before he touched diplomacy - he had already given to the world the volumes on which his reputation rests . I can not undertake in this place and at this hour a critical estimate of his writings ; the perspective is too short and our acquaintance too recent . But I have been reading him over in fragments , not to judge him , but to recall him , and it is as impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would be with the pretension to be final about it . He looms , in such a renewed impression , very large and ripe and sane , and if he was an admirable man of letters there should be no want of emphasis on the first term of the title . He was indeed a man , in literature ; essentially masculine and active and upright . Presenting to survivors that simplified face that I have spoken of , he almost already looks at us as the last accomplished representative of the joy of life . His robust and humorous optimism rounds itself more and more ; he has even now something of the air of a classic , and if he really becomes one it will be in virtue of his having placed as fine an irony at the service of hope as certain masters of the other strain have placed at that of despair . Sturdy liberal as he was , and contemptuous of all timidities of advance and reservations of faith , one thinks of him to-day , at the point at which we leave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his stand on the ancient cheerful wisdom , many of the ingenious modern emendations of which seemed to him simply droll . Few things were really so droll as he could make them , and not a great many , perhaps , are so absolute . The solution of the problem of life lay for him in action , in conduct , in decency ; his imagination lighted up to him but scantily the region of analysis and apology . Like all interesting literary figures , he is full of tacit as well as of uttered reference to the conditions that engendered him ; he really testifies as much as Hawthorne to the New England spirit , though in a totally different tone . The two writers , as witnesses , weigh against each other , and the picture would be imperfect if both had not had a hand in it . If Hawthorne expressed the mysticism and the gloom of the transplanted Puritan , his passive and haunted side , Lowell saw him in the familiar daylight of practice and prosperity and good health . The author of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as lie was the least flippant of jesters and the least hysterical of poets . If Hawthorne fairly cherished the idea of evil in man , Lowell s vision of " sin ' * was operative mainly for a single purpose - that of putting in motion the civic lash . The Biglow Papers are mainly an exposure of national injustice and political dishonesty ; his satiric are dor was simply the other side of the medal of his patriotism . His poetry is not all satirical , but the highest and most sustained flights of it are patriotic , and in reading it over I am struck with the peculiar definiteness it borrows , in parts at least , from this particular inspiration . The look at life that it embodies is almost never vague or irresponsible ; it is only the author 's humor that is whimsical , never his emotion nor his passion . His poetical performance might sometimes , no doubt , be more intensely lyri // cal , but it is hard to see how it could be more intensely moral - I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . His play is as good as a game in the open air ; but when he is serious he is as serious as Wordsworth , and much more compact . He is the poet of pluck and purpose and action , of the gayety and liberty of virtue . He commemorates all manly pieties and affections , but does not conceal his mistrust of overbrimming sensibility . If the ancients and the Elizabethans , he somewhere says , " had not discovered the picturesque , as we understand it , they found surprisingly fine scenery in man and his destiny , and would have seen something ludicrous , it may be suspected , in the spectacle of a grown man running to hide his head in the apron of the Mighty Mother whenever he had an ache in his finger or got a bruise in the tussle for existence . " It is visible that the poetic occasion that was most after his own heart was the storm and stress of the civil war . He vibrated in this long tension more deeply than in any other experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted his noblest verse , and gave him what he relished most , a ground for high assurance , a sense of being sturdily in the right and having something to stand up for . He never feared and never shirked the obligation to be positive . Firm and liberal critic as he was , and with nothing of party spirit in his utterance , save in the sense that his sincerity was his party , his mind had little affinity with superfine estimates and shades and tints of opinion ; when he felt at all he felt altogether - was always on the same side as his likings and loyalties . He had no experimental sympathies , and no part of him was traitor to the rest . This temper drove the principle of subtlety in his intelligence , which is the need of the last refinement , to take refuge in one particular and I must add very spacious corner , where indeed it was capable of the widest expansion . The thing he loved most in the world after his country was the English tongue , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was in fact a sort of agent in his patriotism . The two passions , at any rate , were closely connected , and I will not pretend to have determined whether the western republic was dear to him because he held that it was a magnificent field for the language , or whether the language was dear to him because it had felt the impact of Massachusetts . He himself was not unhappily responsible for a large part of the latter occurrence . His linguistic sense is perhaps the thing his reputation may best be trusted to rest upon - I mean , of course , in its large outcome of style . There is a high strain of originality in it , for it is difficult to recall a writer of our day in whom the handling of words has been at once such an art and such a science . Mr. Lowell 's generous temperament seems to triumph in one quarter , here , while his educated patience triumphs in the other . When a man loves words singly , he is apt not to care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter may be quite indifferent to the chemical composition of his colors . But Mr. Lowell was both chemist and artist ; the only wonder was that with so many theories about language he should have had so much lucidity left for practice . He used it both as an antiquarian and a lover of life , and was a capital instance of the possible harmony between i*magination and knowledge - a living proof that the letter does not necessarily kill . His work represents this reconciled opposition , referable as it is half to the critic and half to the poet . If either half suffers just a little , it is perhaps , in places , his poetry , a part of which is I know not what to say but too literary , more the result of an interest in the general form than of the stirred emotion . One feels at moments that he // speaks in verse mainly because he is penetrated with what verse has achieved . But these moments are occasional , and when the stirred emotion does give a hand to the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest order . His poems writte*m during the war all glow with a splendid fusion - one can think of nothing at once more personal and , in the highest sense of the word , more professional . To me , at any rate , there is something fascinating in the way in which , in the Harvard Commemoration Ode , for instance , the air of the study mingles with the current of passion . The reader who is eternally bribed by form may ask himself whether Mr. Lowell 's prose or his poetry has the better chance of a long life - the hesitation being justified by the rare degree in which the prose has the great qualities of style ; but in the presence of some of the splendid stanzas inspired by the war time ( and among them I include , of course , the second series of The Biglow Papers ) one feels that , whatever shall become of the essays , the transmission from generation to generation of such things as these may safely be left to the national conscience . They translate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in them that all younger Americans , those now and lately reaching manhood , may best feel the great historic throb , the throb unknown to plodding peace . No poet , surely , has ever placed the concrete idea of his country in a more romantic light than Mr. Lowell ; none , certainly , speaking as an American to Americans , has found on its behalf accents more eloquently tender , more beguiling to the imagination : - " Dear land whom triflers now make bold to scorn , ( Thee from whose forehead Earth awaits her morn . ) " " Oh Beautiful ! my Country ! ours once more ! Smoothing thy gold of war-dishevelled hair O'er such sweet brows as never other wore , And letting thy set lips , Freed from wrath 's pale eclipse , The rosy edges of their smile lay bare ! " Great poetry is made only by a great meaning , and the national bias , I know , never made anything better that was . not good in itself ; but each time I read over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more august and pathetic , does it appear . This is only a proof that if Patriotism preserves it she will show excellent taste - which she has been known in some cases not to do . If I were not afraid of falling into the tone of literary criticism , I should speak of several of the impressions - that is , of the charmed absorption - accompanying an attentive reperusal of the four or five volumes of Mr. Lowell's. poetry . The word I have already used comes back to me - it is all so masculine , so fine without being thin , so peculiarly solid in its felicity . It is intensely literary and yet intensely warm . - warm with the contact of friendly and domestic things , loved local sights and sounds , the color and odor of New England , and ( here , particularly , warm without fever ) with the sanest , lucidest intellectual life . There is something of seasonable nature in every verse - the freshness of the spirit sociable with earth and sky and stream . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more effective from the general ground tone of reason . What could be more strangely sweet than the little poem of Phnbe , in Heartsease and Rue - a reminiscence of the saddest of small bird - notes caught in the dimmest of wakeful dawns ? What could be more largely vivid , more in the grand styl&amp; of friendship and portraiture , than the masterly composition on the death of Agassiz , in which the very tenderness of regret flushes faintly with humor , and ingenuity broadens at every turn into eloquence ? Such a poem as this - // mensely fortunate in reflecting an extraordinary personality - takes its place with the few great elegies in our language , gives a hand to Lycidas and- to Thyrsis . I may not go into detail , or I should speak of twenty other things , especially of the mellow , witty wisdom of The Cathedral , and of the infinite , intricate delicacy of Endymion - more tremulous , more penetrating , than any other of the author 's poetic productions , I think , and exceptionally fine in surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , in regard to Mr. Lowell , not so much produced as productive - productive of a clear , delightful image of the temper and nature of the man . One says of them , not that they are by him , but that they are his very self - full of his opinions and perceptions , his humor and his wit , his character , his experience , his talk , and his intense consciousness of race . They testify to many things , but most of all to the thing I have last named ; and it may seem to those whose observation of the author was most complete during the concluding years of his life that they could testify to nothing more characteristic . If he was inveterately , in England and on the Continent , the American abroad ( though jealous indeed of the liberty to be at home even there ) , so the lucubrations of Parson Wilbur and his contributors are an unsurpassably deliberate exhibition of the primitive home-quality . I may seem to be going far when I say that they constitute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate , at any rate , his inexhaustible interest in the question of style and his extraordinary acuteness in dealing with it . They are a wonderful study of style - by which I mean of organized expression - and nothing could be more significant than the fact that he should have put his finest faculty for linguistics at the service of the Yanl*ee character . He knew more , I think , about the rustic American speech than all others together who have known anything of it , so much more closely , justly , and sympathetically had he noted it . He honored it with the strongest scientific interest , and indeed he may well have been on terms of reciprocity with a dialect that had enabled him to produce a masterpiece . The only drawback I can imagine to a just complacency in this transaction would have been the sense that the people are few , after all , who can measure the minute perfection of the success - a success not only of swift insight , but of patient observation . Mr. Lowell was as capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impatience . He never forgot , at any rate , that he stood for all such things - stood for them particularly during the years he spent in England ; and his attitude was made up of many curious and complicated and admirable elements . He was so proud - not for himself , but for his country - that he felt the need of a kind of official version of everything that in other quarters might be judged anomalous there . Theoretically he cared little for the judgment of other quarters , and he was always amused - the good-natured British Lion in person could not have been more so - at " well-meaning " compliment or commendation ; it required , it must be admitted , more tact than is usually current to incur the visitation of neither the sharper nor the sunnier form of his irony . But in fact the national consciousness was too acute in him for slumber at his post , and he paid , in a certain restlessness , the penalty of his imagination , of the fatal sense of perspective and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , moreover , to be an empirical American , and he had organized his loyalty with a thoroughness of which his admirable wit was an efficient messenger . He never anticipated attack , though // it would be a meagre account of his attitude to say it was defensive ; but he took appreciation for granted , and eased the way for it with reasons that were cleverer in nothing than in appearing casuaL These reasons were innumerable , but they were all the reasons of a lover . It was not simply that he loved his country - he was literally in love with it . If there be two kinds of patriotism , the latent and the patent , his kind was essentially the latter . Some people for whom the world is various and universal , and who dread nothing so much as seeing it cornered , regard this particular sentiment as a purely practical one , a prescription of duty in a given case , like a knack with the coiled hose when the house is on fire , or the plunge of the swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the foreground of the spirit - they consider that it shuts out the view . Others find it constantly comfortable and perpetually fresh - find , as it were , the case always given ; for them the immediate view is the view and the very atinosphere of the mind , so that it is not a question only of performance , but of contemplation as well . Mr. Lowell 's horizon was too wide to be curtained out , and his intellectual curiosity such as to have effectually prevented his shutting himself up in his birth chamber ; but if the local idea never kept his intelligence at home , he solved the difficulty by at least never going forth without it . When he quitted the hearth it was with the household god in his hand , and as he delighted in Europe it was to Europe that he took it . Never had a household god such a magnificent outing , nor was made free of so many strange rites and climes ; never , in short , had any patriotism such a liberal airing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the American order could have an infirmity , I think it was because it would have cost him so much to ac knowledge that it could have communicated one to an object that he cherished as he cherished the English tongue . ! J'hat was the innermost atmosphere of his mind , and he never could have afforded , on this general question , any policy but a policy of annexation . He was capable of convictions in the light of which it was clear that the language he wrote so admirably had encountered in the United States not corruption , but conservation . Any conviction of his on this subject was a contribution to science , and he was zealous to show that the speech of New England was most largely that of an older and more vernacular England than the England that to-day finds it queer . He was capable of writing perfect American to bring out this archaic element . He kept in general the two tongues apart , save in so far as his English style betrayed a connection by a certain American tact in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxical in the contention that the language had incurred no peril in its western adventures ; this is the sense in which I meant just now that he occasionally crossed the line . The difficulty was not that his vision of pure English could not fail in America sometimes to be clouded - the peril was for his vision of pure American . His standard was the highest , and the wish was often , no doubt , father to the thought . The Biglow Papers are delightful , but nothing could be less like The Biglow Papers than th' style of the American newspaper . He lent his wit to his theories , but one or two of them lived on him like unthrifty sons . None the less it was impossible to be witness of his general action during his residence in England without feeling that , not only by the particular things he did , but by the general thing he was , he contributed to a large ideal of peace . We certainly owe to him ( and by " we I mean both countries - he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is always danger between country and country , and danger in small and shameful forms as well as big and inspiring ones ; but the danger is less and the dream of peace more rosy when they have been beguiled into a common admiration . A common aversion even will do - the essential thing is the disposition to share . The poet , the writer , the speaker , ministers to this community ; he is Orpheus with his lute - the lute that pacifies the great stupid beasts of international prejudice ; so that if a quarrel takes place over the piping form of the loved of Apollo it is as if he were rent again by the M*nads . It was a charm to the observant mind to see how Mr. Lowell kept the M*nads in their place - a work admirably continued by his successor in office , who had , indeed , under his roof , an inestimable assistant in the process . Mr. Phelps was not , as I may say , single-handed ; which was his predecessor 's case even for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any rate , during these years , were effectually snubbed , and will , it is to be hoped , never again hold their snaky heads very high . The spell that worked upon them was simply the voice of civilization , and Mr. Lowell 's advantage was that he happened to find himself in a supremely good place for producing it . He produced it both consciously and unconsciously , both officially and privately , from principle and from instinct , in the hundred spots , on the thousand occasions , which it is one of the happiest idio*yncrasies of English life to supply ; and since I have spoken so distinctly of his patriotism , I must add that after all he exercised the virtue most in this particular way . His new friends liked him because he was at once so fresh and so ripe , and this was predominantly what he understood by being a good Amencazi . It was by being one in this sense that he broke the heart of the Furies . The combination made a quality which pervaded his whole intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his public speeches , of his talk , of his influence , was simply the genius that we had always appreciated in his critical writings . The hours and places with which he had to deal were not equally inspiring ; there was , inevitably , colorless company , there were dull dinners , influences prosaic and functions mechanical ; but he was , substantially , always the messenger of the Muses , and of that particular combination of them which had permitted him to include a tenth in their number - the infallible sister to whom humor is dear . I mean that the man and the author , in him , were singularly convertible ; it was what made the author so vivid . It was also what made that voice of civilization to whose harmony I have alluded practically the same thing as the voice of literature . Mr. Lowell 's style was an iimdefeasible part of him , as his correspondence , if it be ever published , will copiously show ; it was in all relations his natural channel of communication . This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of his happy exercise of a great opportunity as at bottom the revanche of letters . This , at any rate , the literary observer was free to see in it ; such an observer made a cross against the day , as an anniversary for form , and an anniversary the more m ? *morable that form , when put to tests that might have been called severe , was so far from being found wanting in substance , met the occasion in fact so completely . I do not pretend that during Mr. Lowell 's residence in England the public which he found constituted there spent most of its time in reading his essays ; I only mean that the faculty it relished in him most was the faculty most preserved for us in his volumes of criticism . It is not an accident that I do not linger over the contents of these vol // nines - this has not been a part of my undertaking . They will not go out of fashion , they will keep their place and hold their own ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those stamped sentences of which we are as naturally retentive as of gold and silver coin . Reading them over lately in large portions , I was struck not only with the " good things " that abound in them , but with the soundness and fullness of their inspiration . It is intensely the air of letters , but it is like that of some temperate and restorative clime . I judge them perhaps with extravagant fondness , for I am attached to the class to which they belong ; I like such an atmosphere , I like the living fragrance of the book-room . In turning over Mr. Lowell 's critical pages , I seem to hear the door close softly behind me , and to see in the shaded lamplight one of the sweetest chances that life gives us of being happy . I see an apartment brown and book-lined , which is the place in the world most convertible into fairyland . The turning of the leaves and the crackling of the fire are the only things that break its stillness - the stillness in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evocation , of resurrection , of transmission , of insight , of history , of poetry . It may be a little room , but it is a great world ; it may be a deep solitude , but it is a mighty company . In this critical chamber of Mr. Lowell 's there is a charm , to my sense , in knowing what is outside of the closed door - it intensifies both the isolation and the experience . The big new westem order is outside , and yet within all seems as immemorial as Persia . It is like a little lighted cabin , full of the ingenuities of home , in the gray of a great ocean . Such ingenuities of home are what represent , in Mr. Lowell 's case , the conservatism of the author . His home was the receding past - it was there that his taste was at ease . From what quarter his disciples in the United States will draw their sustenance it is too soon to say ; the question will be better answered when we have the disciples more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to distinguish the quarter from which they will not draw it . Few of them , as yet , appear to have in their hand , or rather in their head , any such treasure of knowledge . It was when his lifetime was longest that the fruit of culture was finest in him and that his wit was most profuse . In the admirable address on Democracy that he pronounced at Birmingham in 1884 , in the beautiful speech on the Harvard anniversary of 1886 , everything is so supremely well said that we seem to be reading some consecrated masterpiece ; they represent , in the highest perfection , the maturity of a masterly talent . There are places where he seems in a sort of mystical communication with the richest sources of English prose . " But this imputed and vicarious longevity , though it may be obscurely operative in our lives and fortunes , is no valid offset for the shortness of our ' days , nor widens by a hair 's breadth the horizon of our memories . " He sounds like a younger brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , could not have uttered a statelier word on the subject of the relinquishinent of the required study of Greek than that " oblivion looks in the face of the Grecian Muse only to forget her errand . " On the other hand , in the address delivered in 1884 before the English Wordsworth Society , he sounds like no one but his inveterately felicitous self . In certain cases , Wordsworth , like *lias the prophet , " stands up as fire and his word burns like a lamp . ' But too often , when left to his own resources and to the conscientious performance of the duty laid upon him to be a great poet quand m*rne , he seems diligently intent on producing fire by the primitive method of rubbing the dry sticks of his blank verse one against the other , // while we stand in shivering expectation of the flame that never comes . " It would be difficult to express better the curious evening chill of the author of The Excursion , which is so like the conscious mistake of camping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very many persons in England who valned Mr. Lowell 's society that the termination of his official mission there proved not the termination of the episode . He came back for his friends - he would have done anything for his friends . He also , I surmise , came back somewhat for himself , inasmuch as he entertained an affection for London which he had no reason for concealing . For several successive years he reappeared there with the brightening months , and I am not sure that this irresponsible and less rigorously sociable period did not give him his justest impressions . It surrendered him , at any rate , more completely to his friends and to several close and particularly valued ties . He felt that he had earned the right to a few frank predilections . English life is a big pictured story-book , and he could dip into the volume where he liked . It was altogether delightful to turn some of the pages with him , and especially to pause - for the marginal commentary in finer type , some of it the model of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is very possible not to feel the charm of London at all ; the foreigner indeed who does so is a very rare bird . It marks the comparative community of the two big branches of the English race that of all aliens Americans are most susceptible to this many-voiced appeal . they are capable of loving the capital of their race almost with passion , which for the most part is the way it is loved when it is not hated . The sentiment was strong in Mr. Lowell ; a part of the spirit of his maturity ( or shall I say of his youth ? ) was lodged here , and at the end he came back every year to feel the touch of it . He gave himself English summers , and if some people should say that the gift was scarcely liberal , others ; who met him on this ground , will reply that such seasons drew from him , in the circle of friendship , a radiance not inherent in their complexion . This association became a feature of the London May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank confusion of July . It pervaded the quarter he repeatedly inhabited , where a commonplace little house , in the neighborhood of the Paddington station , will long wear in its narrow front , to the inner sense of many passers , a mystical gold-lettered tablet . Here he came and went , during several months , for such and such a succession of years ; here one could find him at home in the late afternoon , in his lengthened chair , with his cherished pipe and his table piled high with books . Here he practiced little jesting hospitalities , for he was irrepressibly and amusingly hospitable . Whatever he was in his latest time , it was , even in muffled miseries of gout , with a mastery of laughter and forgetfulness . Nothing amused him more than for people to dine with him , and few things , certainly , amused them as much . His youth came back to him not once for all , but twenty times for every occasion . He was certainly the most boyish of learned doctors . This was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had formed the habit of spending at Whitby , on the Yorkshire coast . It was here , I think , that he was most naturally at his ease , most humorously evaded the hard bargain of Time . The place is admirable - an old red-roofed fishing-town , in one of the indentations of a high , brave coast , with the ruins of a great abbey just above it , an expanse of purple moor behind , and a convenient extension in the way of an informal little modern watering-place. // The mingled breath of the sea and the heather makes a medium that it is a joy to inhale , and all the land is picturesque and noble , a happy hunting-ground for the good walker and the lover of grand lines and fine detail . Mr. Low*ll was wonderful in both of these characters , and it was in the active exercise of them that I saw him last . He was , in such conditions , a delightful host and a prime initiator . Two of these happy summer days , on the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my memory : one of them a ramble on the warm wide moors , after a rough lunch at a little stony upland inn , in company charming and intimate , the thought of which , to-day , is a reference to a double loss ; the other an excursion , made partly by a longish piece of railway , in his society alone , to Rievaulx Abbey , most fragmentary but most graceful of ruins . The day at Rievaulx was as exquisite as I could have wished it if I had known that it denoted a limit , and in the happy absence of any such revelation altogether given up to adventure and success . I remember the great curving green terrace in Lord Feversham 's park - prodigious and surely unique ; it hangs over the abbey like a theatrical curtain - and the temples of concord , or whatever they are , at either end of it , and the lovable view , and the dear little dowdy inn parlor at Helmsley , where there is , moreover , a massive fragment of profaner ruin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pr*au of which ( it was a perfect English picture ) a company of well-grown young Yorkshire folk of both sexes were making lawn-tennis balls fly in and out of the past . I recall with vividness the very waits and changes of the return and our pleased acceptance of everything . We parted on the morrow , but I met Mr. Lowell a little later in Devonshire -0 clustered charms of Ottery ! - and spent three days in his company . I traveled back to London with him , and saw him for the last time at Paddington . He was to sail immediately for America . I went to take leave of him , but I missed him , and a day or two later he was gone . I note these particulars , as may easily be imagined , wholly for their reference to himself - for the emphasized occasion they give to remembrance and regret . Yet even remembrance and regret , in such a case , have a certain free relief , for our final thought of James Russell Lowell is that what he consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his name and fame - they stand for delightful things . He is one of the happy figures of literature . He had his trammels and his sorrows , but he drank deep of the full , sweet cup , and he will long count as an erect fighting figure on the side of optimism and beauty . He was strong without narrowness ; he was wise without bitterness and bright without folly . That appears for the most part the clearest ideal of those who handle the English form , and he was altogether in the straight tradition . This tradition will surely not forfeit its great part in the world so long as we continue occasionally to know it by what is so solid in performance and so stainless in character .
