txt WHEN a man has by any means , good , bad or indifferent , succeeded in raising himself a few inches above the average level of humanity , a strong curiosity is excited about his person , habits and manners . The expression of his countenance , the fashion of his dress , the style of his conversation , and the character of his hand-writing become immediately objects of interest and inquiry . When we are told that Dr. Johnson used to help himself from the sugar-bowl with his fingers , we feel that we are in possession of an important truth , and we never should have pardoned the biographer of Dr. Parr , had he omitted to tell us that he smoked a pipe every day after dinner . To gratify this natural feeling , it was our intention , before saying any thing about the poetry of Mr. ilalleck , to give a very minute description of his personal appearance , conversation and manners , and to show that all the peculiarities of his genius might be seen in the shape of his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . But there 20 // was one slight difficulty about this , which met us at the outset , which was , that we never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Halleck , even in the street ; and although we feel perfectly qualified , and are ready , at a moment 's warning , to review a book without ever having read it , we are not yet sufficiently " hardened into the bone " of criticism to talk about a man 's looks and conversation , without ever having seen or heard of him . Some time ago , there appeared in one of the London morning papers , an elaborate and minute account of the performance of a celebrated actor , the evening before , while , in reality , owing to the sudden illness of the performer himself ; another play had been substituted for the one originally advertised . The hardihood and moral courage of that critic we contemplate with admiration and despair . If ever the critics should form themselves into an order , we should vote for him to be grand-master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little out of favor just now . But we are young at the trade and timid , and must confine our remarks to Mr. Halleck 's poetry , and , luckily , it is a subject about which a good deal may be said , and all on the same side . Mr. Halleck 's warmest admirers have never contended that he sits upon the first form in the school of poets , and is to be ranked among those inspired masters of the art , who can strike every chord of feeling and thought , and bring forth sounds terrible as the coming on of an earthquake , or sweet as the music of birds . He has never threaded the mazes of the human heart , nor mused profoundly on the conduct and opinions of men . He does not attempt to describe the effects of strong passions upon various natures and how they sometimes exalt a low character into sublimity and degrade a great one to the clay of the meanest . He does not seem to have reflected very deeply on the workings of his own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . He looks at nature with a poet 's eye and paints its features with a poet 's pencil , but he reads in its ample page none of that deep philosophy , which creates a mysterious union between the mind of man and the mute forms of the external world . Woods and mountains are to him picturesque objects , but he does not feel , in looking at them , " A presence that disturbs him with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the blue sky , and in the mind of man . " He has lived in the world and in the fashionable part of it , and has had occasion to observe the carriage and manners of men , rather than the native grain of their natures , and has seen more of the expression of character , than of the character itself . His poems are like cabinet pictures , or rather like paintings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not regret the absence of sublimity of conception , variety in expression , and breadth of manner . But it would be doing great injustice to Mr. Halleck to class him among that class of poets of which Pope is the head , who describe exclusively , artificial life and manners . His veins tingle with a true poet 's love of natural beauty , both of form and of spirit , and his eye is quick to di . // cern its presence . Probably if he had passed all his life in the woods , his muse never would have caught a single fine lady air , but have had all the wild grace of a wood-nymph , and every minute beauty and delicate grace of nature would have found a home in his heart , and a tribute in his pages . And , as it is , his " Weewawken " and " Wyoming " show that he has looked at better things than paving-stones and brick walls , and with no unheeding or unadmiring eyes . The first thing , that strikes us in reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of the humorous and pathetic . He seems like " two single " poets " rolled into one ; " and his mind presents a singularity of formation , analogous to that of the Siamese twins . Read his serious poems alone , such as " Magdalen , " or those beautiful verses beginning , " The world is bright before thee , " which ten thousand albums can not make hackneyed , and you would suppose him to be a man steeped in romance , whose common language was sighs , a stranger to mirth and smiles , and whose mind was crowded with images of tenderness and gloom . You would picture him to your mind 's eye , as a pale and melancholy man , in suit of solemn black , with dark , mysterious eyes , a low and sweet voice , a woman 's gentleness , and a child* s simplicity , much given to serenading and repeating poetry by moonlight , and not a whit to songs and suppers . You would as soon think of a Lord Chancellor 's fiddling a jig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a man 's cracking a joke , or even laughing at one very boisterously . On the other hand , take him in another point of view , and read his " Sketch , ** or " Domestic Happiness , " and you would think the mantle of Prior had fallen upon him , and would set him down for one of the merriest souls that ever chirped over a winecup , and " doffed the world aside and bade it pass . " You would never suppose he knew how to sigh , or had ever talked sentiment this side of the third bottle . Harlequin 's playing Hamlet would not be so wild an incongruity as such a man 's being " melancholy and gentlemanlike . " So readily does he slip from grave to gay , that if he ever begins a piece in a serious and penseroso style , you may be pretty sure that he will fall into his comic vein , before he gets through . Take , for instance , his " Ainwick Castle , " which begins with a stateliness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Images of romantic beauty follow each other in rapid succession ; we are carried back to the days of feudal glory and warlike emprise , we catch the gleam of armor , and the trumpet 's sound makes the blQod beat quicker in our veins ;  --  the plume of Hotspur and the scarf of Lady Katharine flit , like visions , before our eyes . And through this picturesque writing there runs a sweet and tender moralizing vein , tinged somewhat with a melancholy hue , which , like the ivy clinging round a ruin , envelopes the whole with its pensive and touching beauty . While we are in the airy regions of cloud-land , and quaffing exciting draughts of poetic ether , quick as thought the scene is changed ; our fairy visions vanish , the wings on which we mounted are paralysed , and we find ourselves lying flat upon our backs on the familiar earth . Since the days of the man in the Arabian tale , who went to sleep a Caliph and awoke nobody at all , there never was a more sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality . We are fallen upon the days of steamboats and Lyceums , of stall-fed citizens , // of beaver hats , and whole heads under them . We are a little provoked with the author , who has kindled up all this romantic flame , merely to have the pleasure of putting it out at once with a bucket-full of ridicule . We feel somewhat as we should , if we had been cheated out of our money ( and may be our tears ) by the piteous tale of a beggar , which turned out to be all humbug . This is a very curious combination of talents , and very strange to those of us who have but one of the two , and doubly so to those who have neither . In the one case , the intellectual process is directly the reverse of that in the other , and the objects are looked at , from totally opposite points of view . In the one every thing is referred to the ideal , properly so called , and in the other to the comic ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very curious , this is not a very rare , union . Here an opportunity offers itself ( which , were we a regularly bred critic we should certainly improve ) of being very learned on the subject of this mixed style of writing , where tragedy and farce succeed each other like the black and white squares of a chess-board , where sober truth is told in a merry vein , and a lurking laugh in the sleeve runs through what sets out to be serious . We might trace its history from Italy , where it took its rise , through the literatures of all the nations of Europe , and crowd our pages with great names from Boiardo to Byron ; but we will be merciful to our readers , and hope they will to us ; and , if they find us particularly dull , console themselves by thinking how much worse it might have been . It would be a difficult matter to say in which of his two styles Mr. Halleck is the more successful . Our opinion would probably be somewhat influenced by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of readers suppose that humor is his distinguishing attribute and excellence . But this arises from two causes ; one is , that humor so delicate and fine as his , is a very rare thing ; much more so than the power of originating thoughts of serious beauty ; and the other is , that his humor is very peculiar and entirely his own ; whereas , sentimental poetry must always bear a strong family likeness , though individuals will differ , of course , in their styles of thinking and writing . But the question is , whether his admirers themselves would prefer to have written his serious or his comic poems , or which of the two they would least wish to have never been written at all . For ourselves we should not know what to say to this dilemma . It is true that his humor is of the most delicate and refined kind , and it seems as if the Graces had presided over the birth of each line . There is none of the sting of wit which creates as much fear as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles into a loud laugh ; but there are a thousand little airy graces hovering over the words , like hummingbirds over a flower ; new combinations , and analogies , and unexpected turns of thought , rapidly succeeding each other to the close , so that we read the last word with a new-born smile upon our lips . There is so much of honest feeling and truth about him , and so little of bitterness , and he seems to take such good-humored and just views of life , that we feel an inward glow spreading itself through us as we read , and are more reconciled to ourselves and the world for the rest of the day . We can go all lengths in our admiration with a safe conscience , for he ridicules the peculiarities of classes and not of individuals , and // his lash never cuts through the skin . But while we thus do justice to his humorous poems , we do not in the least forget the admiration which his serious ones challenge for themselves . They present the undying excellence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most crystal purity . There is nothing diseased in his melancholy , and when he is sentimental his good genius makes him stop this side of mawkishness . Indeed there is a very healthy tone about every thing he has written ; nothing seems the fruit of unnatural excitement ; he evidently does not belong to the gin-and-water school of poetry . His thoughts , if not very original and profound , are by no means commonplace ; and if they were , we could forgive it , so becoming is the garb they wear , and so delicious is the cadence of his verse . Who can read his verses on Burns , or his " Magdalen , " and say that humor ishis distinguishing characteristic ? Who can be insensible to the feeling , the sensibility , the tenderness and the imagination , that breathe from every line and hallow every word of these beautiful poems ? The heart and the pulse of a true poet are here  --  the bright dreams , the romantic hues , the thrilling sense of the beautiful and the grand , " imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the faculty divine. ** They strike you , too , as the productions of a man with whom poetry is the natural expression of thought , and who writes for the same reason that a bird sings , or a child frolics . If we were asked , what is the peculiar charm of Mr. Halleck 's poetry , and what it is that distinguishes him from the other poets of our country , we should answer in one word ,  --  Grace . One of his tuneful brethren may be more reflective , another more intense and passionate , and another may translate more easily the hieroglyphics of nature , but none of them are so graceful as he . He is graceful in every thing , in his thoughts , in the appropriateness of his imagery , in the grouping of his words , and in the magic harmony of his numbers , which , from the lips of a fine reader , are as good as music . Every one must have observed how much effect he will produce by a single epithet , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how much novelty and aptness there is in his illustrations . To enumerate instances would be almost to copy out his poems , word for word . This uncommon gracefulness of expression , which gives the same kind of indescribable charm to fine thoughts , that the cestus of Venus is feigned to have done to a beautiful face and figure , is partly the effect of nature , and partly of art . He is evidently a careful writer , and does not belong to the school of Lucilius , who , as Horace says , would stand upon one foot and dictate two hundred lines in an hour . Mr. Halleck knows well that the most enduring works are those which are the slowest in construction , in mental architecture at least . His poetry reminds us of an antique Cameo , in which we know not which to ad mire most , the beauty of the material or the exquisite finish of the workmanship . Without knowing any thing of the matter , we should say from internal evidence merely , that he was a slow writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the least , as many lines as he left . Nothing that he has written bears the marks of carelessness or haste . You can not say of any of his poems , " it would have been better for his fame , if he had never written this ; " but every individual line has been , as it were , a drop to swell the tide that bears him on to immortality . // It is to his grace and elegance that Mr. Halleck owes his universal popularity , for , take the world through , these are the qualities most generally acceptable . Grace of manner without beauty of person , goes farther than the latter without the former , to say nothing of its wearing so much better . And in the same way , grace and elegance of expression will secure a man a greater number of readers than originality or profoundness of thought , without the charm of felicitous diction . In illustration of this remark , we never met with a person who did not read Mr. Halleck 's poetry with pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another Wordsworth , but all are charmed with " Alnwick Castle " and " Connecticut . " His power of language is truly magical . The right words always come at his bidding , and he puts them invariably into the right places . He has cut into the very heart of the noble Saxon tongue , and his language has a racy and idiomatic flavor , worthy of English verse in other days , when it was in its early and vigorous manhood . He is uncommonly graphic in his style ; he does not write merely , but he paints , and his poems are a gallery of pictures . He is free from the common and obvious faults of style . He is not obscure , nor diffuse , nor unnatural . He is never in the unhappy predicament of a man who " knows but ca n't express himself . " Neither is there any affectation or trickery about him ; he never uses quaint or outof-the-way words , but he is distinguished by a straight-forward manly simplicity , which opens our hearts to him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stands alone , and is beyond the range of the remarks we have been making . We need hardly say that we refer to the lines on Marco Bozzaris , which can not be praised in too extravagant terms , and which make us half inclined to take back what we said in the early part of this paper , and disposed to rahk their author , at once , among the first class of poets . Of this splendid poem it is not too much to say , that it has not its superior of its kind , in the English , or , we may venture to add , in any other language . It is worthy of being bound up with Pindar and Filicaja . Never did the lyric muse soar on a more vigorous pinion or reach a higher elevation . Every line is brimfull of inspiration and every word is baptized in fire . It is such a poem as might have been written by Eschylus , and sung by the Grecian army , as the setting sun bathed in his golden splendor their victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those poems with which the rules of ordinary criticism have nothing to do . It is above their atmosphere , if we may so say . To apply them to it would be like measuring the arch of a rainbow by trigonometry , or guaging the solid contents of the gold and crimson clouds that gather round the dying sun . It addresses itself to the senses as well as to the understanding , and it is felt in the blood no less than in the heart . It brings before us the glorious sights and sounds of war , the gleam of armor , the waving of plumes , and the streaming of banners , " the thunder of the captains and the shouting , " the fierce voice of the trumpet , and the faint huzzas of dying conquerors . The eye and the cheek kindle and the heart burns as we read , and we could rise up and charge the Macedonian phalanx with a single rush in our hands . Thd quiet fame of a scholar , for a moment , seems poor and tame to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow-worm 's lamp to the sun at noonday . Though its illustrious subject died in the arms of victory and in the holy cause of liberty , we can not but think he would have felt an additional glow of satisfaction , had he known of the glorious monument , which the genius of poetry was to rear for him in a land beyond his " sire 's islands of the blest . " It is fashionable in criticising an author , to say something about his faults , and without stopping to consider Mr. Halleck 's less obvious defects , ( which we might have some difficulty in finding out ) we propose to close our article with saying a word or two upon his great and prominent fault ,  --  which is that he has written so little . Now , although there are many things in this world which are valuable in the inverse ratio of their abundance , we never heard that Poetry was one of them . Even if it be what one of the Fathers called it , the " Devil 's wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as intoxicating as a large one . Perhaps it may be said , that , in these days of Souvenirs and Magazines , the infrequency of the fault should be its apology , but he has no more right to be chary of his favors than the mob of poets have to be so liberal . If he think that his own tones of finest melody will be unheard amid the tumultuous bray of the long-eared race , we will reply by a pretty fable from Lessing , which is very good and very short . A shepherd once complained to a nightingale that she did not sing . " Alas , " said the nightingale , " the frogs make such a croaking that I have no wish to sing . " " True , " replied the shepherd , " but it is because you are silent that we hear them . " In short , Mr. Ilalleck owes it to himself , his country and the reading public that he should write often . He has heard , probably , of a s6mewhat musty proverb about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were the autocrat of Russia and he one of our subjects we should insist upon his writing so many lines a year , on pain of being sent to Siberia . Since this article was commenced , we have read that Mr. Halleck is to be the editor of a Magazine in the city of New-York . We wish him as much success as he deserves , and we can say nothing more than that . We hope he may receive golden opinions from all men , and exchange his own notes for another sort of notes which have a very magic sound , and which , when properly arranged , form the tune of " Money in both pockets . " We are sure of the success of the work , for one stanza of his would buoy up the rest of the number , were it unmingled lead.
