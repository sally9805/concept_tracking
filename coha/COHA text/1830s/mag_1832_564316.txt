txt UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES . UNIVERSITY OF NoaTn-CARoLI*x. - The annual commencement at this institution , is said to have been uncommonly brilliant and interesting . The examinations of the students , and all their exercises , passed off well . The Hon. William Gaston delivered an oration before the two literary societies of the College . The senior class consisted of twenty-two , upon whom was conferred the degree of Bachelor of Arts . Eighteen received the degree of Master of Arts . WILLIAM-AND-MARY Coaaaea . The public exercises were held as usual , on the 4th of July , and made an interesting and imposing display . There were twelve graduates , of whom seven received the degree of Bachelor of Arts , and five that of Bachelor of Law . " From the number of matriculates and grammar scholars the past year , and from the increasing desire mknifested by the students to secure the honors of the institution , the most animating prospects may be indulged . The college is now evidently in a prosperous condition . The extent of classes is as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable Bishop Madison . At present , the range of scientific instruction embraced in the studies of the college , will ch llenge a comparison , in point of utility , variety , and extent , with the scope of any similar institution in our country . " HARVARD UNIvERsiTY . The annual exhibition of the junior and sophomore classes took place on Monday , July 16 . On Tuesd* y , the day following , the customary exercises of the senior class on leaving college were performed ; - the Class Oration , by Sa'nuel Osgood o ? Chariestown-  --  the Poe7n , by J. S. Dwight of Boston . The usual examination of the students of the Divinity School was on Wednesday the 18th . On the same day , after the exercises of the divinity students , there was a meetin of " The Philanthropic Society of the Divinity School . ' The Christian Register states that the students of this school have interested themselves in the condition of the priso ? iers in the State Prison at Charlestown and the county Jail at Cambridge , and have regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious instruction . Their attention to the prisons excited an interest in the condition and wants of other classes of the community , and resulted in the formation of the Philanthropic Society . The annual commencement will take place on the last Wednesday in August . MOUNT T. MARY 'S Coaaaox , Emmataburg , Maryland . The Baltimore American contaius an account of the distribution of prizes at the late cornmencement in this institution . The mere catalogue occupies more than a column . The institution is said to be in a flourishing condition . " By the increase of its resources it is furnishing new facilities to the students in every department of learning , and ,  --  with perfect ood will to the other literary institutions of the country ,  --  is impatient of being surpassed by any among them in the power and will to impart knowledge to youth , and secure the extensive patronage which it has hitherto obtamed from the near and distant states of the Union . " MISCELLANIES . EDUCATION OF TIlE BLIND . Dr. S. G. Howe , who , ten months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools for educating the Blind , has recently eturned to Boston . Dr. Howe went out as the special Agent of the New-England Asylum , and , but for the miserable policy of the Prussian Government , which prevented him from visiting several important institutions in that Kingdom and Germany , he would have returned with a mass of practical information that mu t have been of the greatest advantage to the contemplated institution in Boston . As it is , Ile has not returned enlptyhanded . He visited several celebrated schools in England , Scotland , and rance . From an institution in Paris he has brought a young gentleman , Mr. Trencherri , to serve in the capacity of an instructor , and one every way qualified for the office . This young gentl&amp; man is bout 20 years of age , and lost his sight when he was about 4. lie has no conception of colors , but // regard to all objects , the notions of which dep*iid upon the exercise of other senses Ian that of seeing , he appears to be well informed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School whence he came . His knowledge of that abstruse science , and the rapidity with which he answers questions that require arithmetical operations of considerable length , are truly surp*ising . The mental operation by which he arrives at the solution of a problem , is unknown . Questions of a difficult character and requiring a greater exercise of memory , such as the extraction of roots and the involution of high powers , he works out on a table with a set of types representing figures , and made for the purpose . He is an accomplished performer on the organ , piano-forte , and violin . Books for the use of the blind are psinted on thick paper , without ink , the letters being raised above the surface , by a strong impression , resembling what are called embossed cards . Such books Mr. Trencherri reads with great facility , tracing the words and letters with his fingers . On the Maps which are used at the Edinburgh School , the boundaries of states and kingdoms , rivers , and the shores of the ocean are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the map . But these are expensive and difficult of construction . Dr. Howe has made one or two by way of experiment , in the same manner as the books are printed , which will answer the purpose better , and be much cheaper . He has also brought home with him several specimens of articles manufactured by persons totally blind , such as lace , net-work , stockings , caps , purses , &amp;c. that would excite admiration if they were the work of those who had eyes to guide their fingers ; but when it is considered that they are manufactured with the assistance of but one sense-that of feeling-the spectator can not suppress his astonishment . The New-England Asylum has yet but scanty means wherewith to carry on its proposed work  --  a work which , we trust , will be a blessing to numerous unfortunate human beings , by enabling them to support themselves in comfort and independence . It is not expected that it will be entirely an eleemosynary institution . The pupils will feel that they can do something in return for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy in the consciousness that they can lay the world under obligations of a pecuniary as well as a moral character . AN EEL IN TilE STOMACH . Mrs. Hanson , the wife of Samuel B. Hanson , of Belfast , Me. aged about 23 , was found , eight months since , to be in a declining state of health , in consequence of what was considered a deranged state of the abdominal and thoracic viscera , originating from Leucorrheaa . The symptoms were such as to warrant the presumption , and she was treated accordingly by several scientifie physicians , for something like six months , during which time she gradually declined in health , until the system became extremely exhausted and emaciated . About five weeks since , it was ascertained that a living creature of some kind , and of considerable magnitude , actually existed in the stomach . This was ascertained by placing the hand on the gastric region , when a vigorous squirming motion was felt through the emaciated integuments , as well as from her own repeated and positive declarations . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the then existing state of exhaustion , the system could sustain the action of medicine of sufficient power to destroy the animal . After some deliberation and consultation with the husband and friends of the afflicted , together with the urgent sohicitiations of the patient , it was determined to make an effort , which resulted on the fourth day in the evacuation of an Eel , ten inches in length , and of the usual size . The skin and flesh were denuded considerably by partial digestion , but the form was sufficiently entire to convince the most incredulous of its identity . She is now in a very low state , laboring under all the symptoms of ulceration of the stomach and bowels . She is supposed to have taken it some years since in drinking from a spring in the evening , at which time she was sensible of swallowing some solid substance of very small dimensions . The medicine given produced very little disturbance to the general system , and was sustained without much increased exhaustion . SARATOGA AND ScHENECTADY RAiLROAD . This road is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Balston Spa , the embankment and masonry over the valley of the Kayaderosserns not being finished , passengers are taken half a mile , in post coaches , to the commencement of the rail-road on the north side , and from thence proceed by rail-road to // Saratoga Springs . The coaches on this rail-road are of a new and improved construction , fitted up in the most commodious and elegant manner , and make their trips with the utmost regularity and despatch . Passengers leaving Albany at half-past six in the morning , breakfast at Schenectady , take the nine o'clock train on the Saratoga rail-road , and arrive at Saratoga at half-past eleven o'clock , A.

WHEELING . A correspondent of the New-York Advocate and Journal , at Wheeling , Va . amongst much valuable information , relating to the prosperity of manufactures , and the progress of internal improvements , in that part of the country , states that a company bad been formed with a captital of $200,000 , for the purpose of facilitating the transportation of goods to and from Baltimore , by which line articles will be received from Fredericktown , where the rail-road terminates , in six days ; which place has , within a few years , and from its being a small village , increased its population to the number of 7000 . The writer enumerates a long list of manufacturing establishments , employing about 900 hands , and turning off articles in their different lines , worth upwards of 400,000 dollars per annum ; besides many other establishments , the value of whose productions is not estimated , because probably unknown .

THE DOG . At a late fire in the city of New-York , the following incident occurred , which tends in a striking degree , to illustrate the sagacity and fidelity of that roost excellent animal ,  - -  the dog . A young man slept in the third story of the building in which the fire originated . His dog , lying by his bed-side , scented the fire which had broken out below . He immediately endeavored to awake his master , by lay-173 ing his fore paws on his breast , and drawing them gently over his body . The young man aroused himself , but not suspecting the object of the animal , fell again to sleep . i'he dog then seized the bed-clothes , and stripped them off his master , who a second time covered himself up and went to sleep . The dog , aware that no time was to be lost , took hold of the young man 's shirt with his teeth , and tore it from his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chamber , and he saved his life by descending the tackle fall , which he threw out of the window , hand over hand . The worst of the story remains to be told . In his hurry to escape destruction , the young man forgot that his keeper had no means of descent , and burst into a flood of tears on finding that he could not return to save him . The faithful creature perished INnIAN PROPHEcY . The Cherokee Phenix states that forty or fifty years ago , while living in their ancient rudeness , and practising customs which now remain only as vestiges , the Cherokees were accustomed to be addressed , when assembled in their Town houses by certain individuals , who were to be found in every village , it is a fact , however , which many living eye-witnesses can testify , that they actually foretold the events which are now taking place in relation to the south-western Indians . It was their custom , on the occasions above mentioned , to take their station and relate the traditions of the nation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to their forefathers and would bring their account to the time in which they lived , when a new era in their history would commence , in consequence of the approaching settlements of the white man . In speaking of the future destiny of their nation , they foretold with a remarkable exactness the principal events which have since taken place in its history . This part of their address was something like the following . " Ourelderbrother ( meaning the white people-using the singular for the plural ) has become our neighbor . He is now near us , and already occupies our ancient habitations . But this is as our forefathers told us . They said , my feet are turned towards the west-they are never to turn round . Now mark what our fathers told us . Your elder brother will settle around you-he will encroach upon your lands , and then ask you to sell them to him . When you // Miscellanies. give him a part of your country , he will not be satisfied , but ask for more . In process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will tell you that your mode of life is not as good as his , whereupon you will be induced to make great roads through the nation , by which he can have free access to you . He will learn your women to spin and weave and make clothes , and learn you to cultivate the earth . He will even teach you his language and learn you to read and write . But these are but the means to destroy you , and to eject you from your habitations . He will point you to the west , but you will find no resting place there , for your elder brother will drive you from one place to another until you get to the great western waters-These things will certainly happen , but it will be when we are dead and gone . We shall not live to see and feel the misery which will come upon you .

A few weeks ago , Mr. Reese , of Peters township , Franklin county , living on the base of North Mountain , was about to dig for water ; and , as there is a very large spring issuing out of the rocks , at the foot of a hill of considerable height , and a kind of sink-hole some distance above the spring , he thought he probably could come on the stream-accordingly he commenced digging in the sink-hole , and had proceeded but a few feet , when he could plainly hear the water running , seemingly with great rapidity ; and at the distance of about twenty feet from the surface , came to the water , at the lower extremity of a fissure in the rock , which immediately expanded into a large and beautiful cavern , the entrance of which is partially obstructed by loose rocks , which , after advancing a little distance , entirely disappear , and instead of loose rubbish , solid rocks appear enameled with spar of different colors . In every direction are to be seen the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some places , majestic ceiling . Concretions , without number , and of almost every color , size and dimension , are seen pointing downwards from the ceiling , and inwards from the sloping wallssome white , some red , some brown , some gre en , and others transparent as glass , and all solid as marble . They threaten the curious adventurer with being torn to pieces by their craggy points , if he attempts penetrating any further into it ; and indeed , in some places he is obliged to proceed in a stooping position , in order to avoid them . In proceeding up this subterraneous passage , you are obliged to walk in the run nearly all the way . The run is in some places dry at the present season of the year . Yet it is evident from the bed of the run , and other visible marks of the water that in some parts of the year the water must flow through the different channels in large quantities . Even at this time there is a great deal running through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident from the great noise it makes , in falling over the craggy rocks which impede its progress . There are in the principal channel several falls , which might very properly be denominated cataracts  --  the extent of the cave is yet unknown , as it has been but partially explored ; the greatest distance any person has been up it yet , is about 800 feet , at which distance there was no appearance of its termination . In ascending this cave , the eye is most agreeably struck with its grandeur-as at every step new wonders present themselves-here is the spar formed into trees , shrubs , &amp;c. which make it have the appearance of a petrified grove-in some places the spar is formed into the likeness of men , birds , beasts , organs , &amp;c. and in one place , raised on a pedestal , is a striking resemblance of a half unfurled flag . Besides this , there are hundreds of other likenesses , which I shall not attempt a description of . When we first saw them , we were only surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination , we were struck with amazement , knowing them to be mere productions of nature ; who hitherto , in solitary silence , had , in her playful moments , unseen and unheard , dressed the scene as if for her own amusement . Private Letter . Nxw 0 NAIIENTAL TEE . The American Farmer announces the receipt of the seed mentioned in the following extract of a letter from Commodore Porter , to J. S. Skinner , Esq . of Baltimore , dated Constantinople , Feb. 16 , 1832 . " I now send you what will be a curiosity in the United States , the seed of the Guul-aghad , or the rare tree . It is the most beautiful thing of the kind I have ever seen . It grows to the size of // 175 qwq Discipline at length , O'ecloolced and unemployed , fell sick and died .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all of them copyists ; and tread the common road , without inquiring whether there is a nearer direction or a smoother course . Except in the case of a few chosen geniuses  --  to be thrown on circumstances in which we should be forced to devise for ourselves-is exceedingly perplexing and painful . We may see the truth of this illustrated in the trifling example of dress . If our tailors and milliners were forced , every season , to contrive the fashions which we wear , we should see them nearly as much baffled as a third rate poet would be to write a sonnet without sylphs , or dewy walks , or moonlight shades , or birds // warbling in the groves . So rare is originality , that the proverb is hardly strong enough in its expression ; Necessity is not always the mother of invention . When we are thrown on new paths we often try to walk by old rules ; and hence , even the suggestions of Providence and the lessons of Nature are often spread before us only to show what slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our own country has afforded many mortifying illustrations of the truth of these remarks . The peculiarity of our condition hasbeen , that man , taken off from the old foundations of social life , has here been put upon his own exertions ; and in a new country every thing was to be shaped anew . When our fathers crossed the Atlantic they left the sceptres and ribbons of noble blood behind them ; and they had to establish a chief magistrate without a king ; a legislative assembly without hereditary lords . They broke away from all prescriptions ; and had to raise up the institutions of society with reference only to the best interests of its members . All the impediments of ages they might bury , if they chose , in the waves of the ocean ; and the voice of authority , so sacred in Europe , would be lost in the distant roar of the waters they had crossed . The first fathers of New-England , notwithstanding the charge of bigotry , which has been heaped upon them by bigots of an opposite creed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had compared the future and the past ; and they had modeled in their minds , no doubt , a form of policy , which they believed would exalt the dignity of man . They were great men , equal to the great station they were called to fill . Allowing all this , I must still be permitted to advance an opinion , not the most flattering to our national pride-that the bane of our country has been too deep a reverence for certain forms of social life which have been handed over to us from the old world . We have not , with a quick eye , caught the peculiarities of our situation . We have not suffered our manners to spring up from our soil , nor made our souls , like our lakes , mirrors to reflect our own scenery . Americans in our pride and our prejudices , we have not been sufficiently American in our thoughts and conceptions . We have too often been doing in the arts of peace , what Braddock did , in war , when he disregarded the counsels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and have thus lost the benefits , or greatly impaired them , of the old world and the new . 1 am aware that this remark may be met with many powerful arguments by one disposed to take the opposite side . He will contest its justice , and say that I betray the honor of our country ; he will point me to our manufactories and steam-boats , and ask , If these present no monuments of American invention , suited to American wants ? He will pronounce the names of Rittenhouse and Franklin ; and , in more recent times , of Whitney and Perkins ; and call on me loudly to retract an assertion which is a slander on our land . I own , indeed , that there are splendid exceptions to the truth of my remarks ; and so there are exceptions to the most exact remarks you can make on nations and people . We always , when we lay down moral propositions , strike a balance amidst thousands of items on both sides of the book . The Dutch are thoughtful and grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French are gay  --  but does not Paris itself contain some musing and mournful minds ? All general truths admit of ex* // ceptions ; and though it may be true that our countrymen have done much to accommodate their manners to the condition to which Providence has called them , yet this does not prove that our lot would not have been better , if we had done more . The bearing of my remark mi* , ht be illustrated by many examples . The war of the revolution was carried on with the highest patriotism and with great ability ; but I believe it is very generally conceded now , that our fathers did not meet the British with all the advantages of their peculiar situation . There was some lack of invention in their mode of war . They were too solicitous to form a regular army , when there were no posts to defend , ( for the British took all the great towns , ) and they introduced too much of the tactics , which had grown up in different scenes , and were neither accommodated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill had given them hints where their great strength lay ; and they should have acted as David did , when he put off the royal armor , and chose to approach the giant with his sling and five smooth stones from the brook . In a word , ( not to be arrogant , since our very wisdom comes from previous mistakes , ) may we not say , without departing from the reverence we owe to these great patriots , that they should have left the country open to their foes ; have permitted them to scatter ; should have cut off the parties and worn them out in a desultory warfare , since they were sure to lose the battle when inexperience met discipline and host was opposed to host ? It may not be proper for me to make the remark ; but I can not help harboring the suspicion , that the whole of our judiciary system is an illustration of my first position . It is not American ; it grew up in Saxon ages  --  and unless it has a vast fund of latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxon night . It is impossible to read a modern indictment without laughing . If the jury knew the case exactly , before the trial , I am sure they must be perplexed after the reading of such a paper . So much for transplanting English Jaw to republican ground . If , according to the theory of our government , every man is a law-maker-then it is important to make the whole science as intelligible as possible , that every man may understand his duty . The same truth is illustrated in our political history . We forgot that we were a peculiar people and were not sufficiently peculiar in our views . I have a great respect for the old Federalists . I believe that their party contained some of the best men our country ever produced . I speak freely of the party , for I speak over its tomb . It has long since been dead . But it is impossible not to see that they lost their influence and missed of their aim , by not adapting their language , and often their measures , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Aristocrats ; they often used language more fitted for the longitude of London than that of Philadelphia ; and they fell , because they were not content to debate American questions with American views . There vas single great man who did them more harm , than 11 their collected wisdom could repair . It was Edmund Burke . He opposed the French Revolution  --  and they opposed it ; and true enough , it was a volcano , shaking the earth and filling all the air with its inflammatory cinders . But Burke opposed it on English principles ; C nd they should have opposed it on American principles . After the publication of his books , the productions of all // our federalists became tinged with Aristocracy ; they were attracted out of their regular orbit by this splendid comet that crossed their path ; and they laid themselves open , needlessly and extravagantly , to the shafts of their political opponents-as if they were defending all the ancient incumbrances for which the war of the revolution was fought to free us . Even our literature has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American novels and American essays , which were as remote from our manners as if they had been translated from the Persian tales . Jn a word , we are a young nation , and we have often bowed with too much veneration to the idols of the east . We have worshiped the rising sun when we ought to have turned our eyes to the splendor with which he fills our western sky . Because the eastern minds are models in some departments , we have been too prone to consider them as models in all  --  and their bright examples have sometimes led us to a rash imitation , but more frequently , perhaps , to a rash despair . In no one thing has this crippled spirit of imitation more prevailed , or done more harm , than in the construction of our seminaries of learning . We are a peculiar people ; our country is peculiarly situated , and all our citizens have peculiar duties to perform . We need , therefore , a peculiar education . Our fathers have been praised for their diligence in establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a praise , their real claim to which , we ought not to diminish . Yet it is impossible not to see that their schools and colleges were modeled too much on old principles . In the college at Cambridge , all the forms of the old logical disputes were kept up , until within the memory of a man whom I remember . They were conducted in Latin  --  the old syllogistic forms were preserved-the subjects were as remote as possible from common life ; and although Mather says , they did not , as at Oxford , study Aristotle on their knees ; yet his philosophy , modified as it was in the middle ages , was held in too much veneration . Their higher schools had a reference solely to the university . Every town containing one hundred families was obliged to keep a grammar school , where Latin and Greek were taught ; and nothing more . The common schools , I apprehend , were in a very low state . Looking over the old records , we find such poor writing and spelling handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we have no great reason to boast of the learning of our fathers . Arithmetic was taught very imperfectly ; and grammar and geography scarcely thought of . There were undoubtedly very learned men in those days ; hut there was not that diffusion of learning which is necessary to elevate the general mass of the people to comprehend their own rights . If it were not invidious , I might point out an instance where the same spirit of imitation has impaired the usefulness of our schools at the present day . In the large towns of England , there are numbers of children growing up in ignorance , owing to the poverty of their parents ; and it is extremely desirable to establish some cheap system of instruction . In these circumstances , th eLaneasterian plan certainly has its value . It is an abridgement of labor which makes some instruction possible where none existed before . But lo ! with the usual felicity of servile copyists , we have introduced it into our country ; and have set aside the old method of spontaneous // effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of intellectual hopper , where they must be ground in a mill . All self-exertion prevented ; all responsibility lost ; every generous feeling crushed ; and the whole body taught to march on like a platoon of soldiers , as if they were moved by one spring and were parts of a single machine . The sole merit of this plan is , that it saves money . It is certainly better to see children in such a school than pitching coppers about the streets ; but , with this slender merit , it is certainly worse than the worst plan of instruction that was ever before devisedWith the same cement ever sure to bind , They bring to one dead level every mind . I can easily imagine that such a school may make excellent sailorsand soldiers ; for they are expected to be automatons . But for republicans , for freemen , for self-controlling , and elevated masters of their own destiny-it is not the place . We certainly can afford something better ; for money spent in building up the public intellect , is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a triumph of public spirit over avarice ; but it is an action of the truest economy-it is an expense for which a man receives a large reversion ; it is a fee paid to intelligence and virtue , those great moral sentinels , whose vigilance keeps the public heart sound ) and the rich man 's coffers safe . One of the causes which ha* tended to detract from our public schools the attention and encouragement which they ought to receiveis the very fact , that the system is old . This is an age of innovation and novelty ; and we are all of us more or less fascinated by their charms . Only let a new plan start up , and we have a copious supply of strolling gentlemen and strolling ladies , ( who want nothing but rags to resemble other strollers , ) who are very ready to espouse it . They enter into it with all the ardor which commonly accompanies a shortlived passion . One heads the subscription paper ; another carries it about ; a third pleads for it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the waters of a stagnant life . In the mean time it is hardly inquired , whether there are not other calls of benevolence more important ; which can be pushed forward with less expense , because they are already in operation ; and which are in danger of sinking , because they are not addressed to the most morbid passion of the human heart . I am not speaking against plans of real utility because they are new . No doubt we have much to learn ; let their utility be shown , and they deserve our cordial support . But let us not , in the rage of innovation , desert all that is solid and substantial in past experience . It is always a presumption in favor of a plan that it has been tried . The stars of the firmament are not the less bright because they have twinkled in the heavens since the dawn of creation ; and our minds should not he distracted nor our attention diverted from the objects which have hitherto been our happiness and our glory . We are too apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them ; and they will go on well without our attention . This is a mistake . There is not a human institution that can bare to be neglected . There is always a tendency to degenerate ; our schools need perpetual reviving . If you wish to he beneficent from the purest principles ; if you would do good with no other reward than the secret consciousness of having done it-then you must attend to these old institutions . If this is not done , nothing // will be perpetual . The pleasure of forming a new design is the hope that it will be permanent ; but if we are always running after novelties , it is a law of our actions , these very novelties will cease  --  and we sanction by our example a rule which overthrows what we have done . To make a people anxious for any improvement , there must he before the mind a vivid conception of something better . Savages will never desert their huts and caves until you can teach them to appreciate the value of well-built houses and comfortable homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we now enjoy , and the possibility of attaining it-is the first step towards any improvement . Now I am afraid that there generally prevails a low idea of the standard of excellence in schools : the old man feels jealous lest his son should know more than himself ; and hence the same qialifications in schoolmasters and the same mode of teaching , satisfies from generation to generation . Not that I would encourage rash innovations . These have injured our schools full as much as any prejudices against improvement . In modern times , too much has been aimed at in some of our district schools . They are often kept but a few months in the year ; and to multiply the studies for so short a time as is allowed to pursue them , is certainly to forget the objects for which such schools are established . If you fill a common school with a great many splendid branches-recommended by a sounding name  --  the consequence will be , that in the general ambition to rise , the more necessary branches will be neglected . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and others attempt grammar and composition , who have not yet learned to read . I have often noticed this evil in common schools . There is a general passion to rise to the higher branches . It is scarcely possible to make them step up to knowledge by the necessary grades . Children , like men , are governed by names ; and the reputation of science is more prized than the thing itself . We should graduate the studies according to the time of the scholars , and the opportunities allowed to gain them . There is another error which has hurt our schools : the flood of books which has been poured upon us , many of them compiled with the weakest judgement , presenting a distracting variety , and exposing parents to a needless expense . Some of these books seem to be designed to supersede all effort on the part of the scholar . They are opiates for the mind . I find some books , with every page sprinkled over with lines and circumfiexes to teach the reader to pronounce without the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those lame who were riot so before . Indeed , I should not hesitate say , that the path to knowledge may be made too easy  --  the mind overpropt , omits all exertions of her own ; for to conquer difficulties increases her strength . There has been another innovation which argues a depraved taste . It is well known with what clearness and simplicity the old writers of the English language express themselves . Their thoughts shine through their expressions ; and language was not then a glittering veil throWn over darkened sentiments ; but it was a polished glass , which revealed and beautified the conceptions of the author in the reader 's view . This is true of such men as Addison , Swift , Pope , Goldsmith , Paley . It is partly true of Shakspeare , Milton , Burke ; whose diction , if it is sometimes // tinged with mysticism and fancy , is yet , on the whole , never found to cloud their thoughts . But all this , by the modern writers , is completely reversed . They seem to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sated with themselves . Hence they labor their expressions ; they depart as far from the colloquial as possible . They roll words on words and heap metaphor on metaphor ; and as for their poetry , it is not even written to be understood . Now , such writers are the last whom I should select to form a school book of ; especially it is a subject of peculiar indignation to see them crowding out such accomplished models as Addison and Goldsmith . Yet , we have school books almost entirely compiled from such writers-the glittering fogs of the moral landscape ; the riddles and Delphic oracles of the Christian world . Perhaps I am wrong , however , in complaining of their obscurity ; for such is their moral character , that our best security from their corrupting our children is , that they are too obscure to be understood . Let us leave them to their beloved darkness ; it only serves to conceal their passions and their crimes . I shall now pass to another topic which , I fear , is rather a delicate one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood ; and if so , I trust I shall avoid giving offence . The grand object of instruction in this country , is the diffusion of knowledge : it is not to form a privileged class , who are to engross all the refinement and intelligence , and leave the poor to sink into that abject and contented ignorance in which poverty is prone to grovel . Now , in order to make the whole community move onward in this course of improvement , you must aim to bind the interest of all classes of citizens ; the rich and the poor , the learned and the unlearned , into one common bundle . Nothing should be done to withdraw the attention of our most enterprising citizens from our most common schools . There the rich and the poor should meet together ; there their children should join  --  the rich man7s son to learn that it is by a rough contest with the rougher members of society , that he is to work his way through life ; and the poor man 's son to catch some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this mixture of character that improves our minds , and forms the harmony of this sometimes jarring world . A public school , thus constructed , is a sort of prelude to their subsequent life ; it is an epitome of the great republic . It stimulates their powers ; it calls forth their virtues ; it braces them to meet temptation ; and it gives the character a vigor and a consolidation which it can acquire no where else . One such boy , thus educated , is worth more than a thousand moonlight characters , formed in the shade , and fitted never to leave it . Some , to be sure , in some weak parts , may be tainted and seduced ; but , after all , the evil , if you will consult experience , is overbalanced by the good . Perhaps you will say , My son in this way will meet bad boys ; true  --  but he must meet bad boys unless you retire to some wilderness . We were certainly made for social life ; we must face this world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg in when we begin other exercises-in childhood Send your son , therefore , into the world , but faithfully warn him against its allurements and vices . Now I would respectfully suggest , whether private schools , by forming an unwise separation , do not break in on this order of Nature and Providence . Whether they do not tend to produce and // perpetuate invidious distinctions-whether by withdrawing the attention of the rich and influential fro1 common schools , engrossing the talents of the best teachers , they do not leave them in a worse state ? and whether we may not here see the germ of evils which may spread through the whole system of life ? I desire to stand corrected if I am wrong ; but these are suspicions which have frequently crossed my mind . They are doubts and fears which I should he glad to find removed . It is true , it would be hard to compel the rich to send to our common schools in their present state . But if they did send , would they not soon be elevated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the very soul of republicanism . Franklin and Washington were educated with boys from the poorest families . There is another mistake which it appears to me extensively prevails ; and that is the exclusive attention which is paid to colleges-as if these high institutions ought to he first in the public mind . This is one of those erroneous habits of thinking which we have inherited from the old world . Legislatures and leading men have turned their principal thoughts on colleges ; important institutions , I own , but still hearing no comparison with common schools in the influence they exercise on the country at large . More than h*'lf a million has been given by the state to Harvard College alone ; an institution to which the rich resort , and much more likely to take care of itself than the humble school of a common town . It seems strange that the fostering care of the legislature should be extended to the strong and withheld from the weak . Would it not he better that these higher professors of learning should be put upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , who are less likely to have a reputation , should receive some legislative encouragement or support ? The present mode seemingly reversee all political rules-it gives bounty to a trade which can go on without such bonnty-yes , where it has sometimes been positively injurious ; and it withdraws it from one which really wants encour'mgernent . Cert inl* it is the instruction of the lower classes ( by lower I mean poorer ) to which the le0islature should lend its chief attention . They are most apt to sink into ignorance . It is the D e ' * J510 of knowledge which is the soil of *epublicanism . It h not the marble foe . tam xv ich gushes up in the capitol , surrounded by its colonades , which is to xv ter the country ; but it is the native brooks and rivulets , adorned by no splendor , winding among rushes and reeds , diffused to rough the lan w , liLe the veins through th' bodyeach one of them an object of Uttle v* lie ud Imost es*oing ttention ; an yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country  --  the source of **hi its ferility and beauty .

The profesKon his not r*nked igh enouTh in the public estimation . There is no art or science which is more difficult to att , more abilities are called for , and in supreme excellence in where more diligence required , than the art of buildimig up human minds . It requires the 1*st exertions of the best men . And here let one word be said to remove that foolish impression , that school keeping vov. mu , 6 // tends to narrow the intellect , that it is a sort of mechanical task from which every high-minded man would shrink away who could find something better . This impression has arisen , partly from some fictitious writings in which the schoolmaster is seldom introduced but to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being certain that school-keeping ( but not more than any other profession ) will narrow a weak and indolent mind . You all remember Goldsmith 's beautiful , but somewhat ludicrous description of the country school-masterThe village all declared how much he knew ; T was certain he could write and cypher too ; Lands he could measure , terms and tides presage , And e'en the story ran that he could gauge ; In arguing too the parson owned his skill , For e'en tho ' conquered , he could argue still . But let us not be deceived by fiction-let us look on real life . Aschain and Milton were schoolmasters ; so were Goldsmith and Johnson . The fiction writers seldom introduced a clergyman without painting a mind narrowed by the profession , a ridiculous and benevolent being , whom , if we partly respect , we are compelled to laugh at . But when I remember that Owen and Baxter , and Burkley , and Butler , and Edwards , and Fenelon , were clergymen , I feel not much distressed lest this profession should cramp any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exalted powers . The truth is , the mind exerts its natural vigor in every profession . It is the prerogative of genius to do well whatever it is called to do . There is scope for it in navigatin* a vessel , in managing a farm , and certainly in the important art of training up imino*tal minds . Young men , therefore , may dismiss their fears on this score . No employment is more responsible ; none calls more for the best application of the best powers . It must be confessed , however , that every man of talents is not fitted for a schoolmaster . It requires a peculiar tact ,  --  a facility of discipline , a facility of communication ; and , above all , the art of waking an interest in the mind of the pupil . We find some teachers whose very eye and motion , whose voice and manner awe the whole school into instant silence . They seem to govern without effort , they have no agitation or bustle about them , they touch the machine and it moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar Jove them , and even when they punish , their most terrible blows fall on the heart . Now the possession of such a man is invaluable . If you find such an one , secure his services ; let him not go . Do not lose him for a fe*v paltry pieces of silver . He is a respectable man ; give him a respectable price . Such men are not found every day ; and almost any reward you can give him is cheap , compared with the forced , lazy services of different characters , whom you had better hire to be away . The difference between a good and a bad workman is very great in all professions ; but especially so in this . A poor schoolmaster is a very poor thing . The form of our school-houses has had no inconsiderable influence in sinking the character of our schools . Whoever has traveled through our country towns must have noticed certain ambiguous huts , of which he has doubts , whether they wore pens ei*ected for certain // grc*edy animals , whom we feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seem to be contrived by certain ingenious architects to be as inconvenient as possible , and certainly Robert Fulton never hit his object better . The seats are narrow , the children crowded , the air close , though the windows are broken ; the desks uneasy , the floor ripped up , the plastering falling , the funnel broken , the room smoky , in short , a place for nothing , arid every thing out of its place . I have heard a very respectable man say , that he had known bad habits of body , such as stooping and distortion , contracted in these rooms of torture , fit for the purposes of the inquisition . Even in larger towns there is a miserable parsimony in erecting these edifices . You can see the ghost of a dollar sitting on every lintel and door post . If any where we should consult comfort , it is in these seminaries of our children . How can you expect a child to sit for three hours , without moving , on a hard oak board four inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some school-houses this is expected . Besides , as squalid poverty injures the morals , so a miserable schoolhouse injures the mind . The best printed books and the best built houses should be reserved for the young . Nor let any one object that it is fanciful to attribute so much to the make of a building . Some of the most important results in politics , have come from causes equally trifling in appearance . It was the size of a house that made two branches in the British legislature ; and has handed down to us and to all posterity the important doctrine of a check in legislation ; of the concurrence of two bodies being necessary to passing a law . There has been also a great want of attention on the part of parents to the instructers ; and on the part of the instructers to the parents . There should be a close intimacy and a perfect co-operation . I would advise every parent to get acqu* inted with the schoolmaster ; and every schoolmaster to visit the parents of his pupils it would prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is , even in some strong minds ( this is a strong man 's weak point ) in believing the tales and misrepresentations of their children . A boy is corrected , and goes ho* e under the deepest excitement , to tell his story . It is sure to have calumny enough ; if not a large quantity of positive lies . Parental partiality gets the better of reason , and the instructer is condemned before lie is heard . It is true , all parents know that children are partial and prejudiced creatures . They are all ready to confess it in general terms ; yet , when it comes to their own case , they are almost as childish as the children themselves . " True , children are not to be trusted ; but my little Tommy-I never caught him in a lie in my life . He speaks the truth I dare say-it is incredible that Tommy should lie . " Yes , very incredible , that an exasperated boy , who has deserved twenty whippings before he has received one , and deserved twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , what men never do-no not the coolest-be an impartial witness in his own cause . There ought to be a complete partnership between masters and parents respecting government . They ought to consult one another , support one another , and never divide their strength . Tell your child that he has not deserved one correction ; and it is ten chances to one , but that he will so behave as to receive a dozen more . // The separation of religion from our literary instruction , has had a tendency to diminish the excellence of them even in a literary view . It must be granted , that amidst the diversity of sects of which our community is composed , it would be difficult to carry any particular system of religious instruction to the extent to which each party might desire . The Unitarian would notlikethe Assembly 's Catechism ; nor the Churchman the Cambridge Platform . But surely under pretence of liberty of conscience , all religious instruction should not be kept from tender minds at such an important season . No measure of utility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motive . Ambition may fire the politician , and fame animate the poet , but in the plain , homely duties of common life , no work will stand which has not religion for its base . We ought to have religious teachers ; and religious motives ought be constantly brought up in the government of a school . What is it that gives an increasing interest to the Sabbath school ? What is it that has rolled on the Missionary cause amidst all the scorn and neglect with which some have treated it ? It is hec*'use these operations stand connected Ith the red name of religion . * A touches the deep strings of the human *o I ; ari* xvhc* that motive is w* uting , the cause , though use ful , is apt *o and ush .

Some have none so far , a to taft o ' h nishing the Bible from them as an *iemeni*y noo* Such a measure , I venture to say , would be as dis strou to hitei* tore as to religion itself It is the very best book to lead th' mind from m*terialism to thinking ; to give its history and morality in its simplest dress . There is no composition in which such high ides are brought out in language so perfectly level to the conception of a child . It is the purest well of English literature . That plain , sLong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that booh , exists in its purity , and h spread out over every page . It is the very book which I should select of all others ; as familiarizing the obscure ; embellishing the beautiful ; embodying the spiritual , and giving attractions to the sublime . What is it that has made Bunyan 's Pilgrim , such a favorite with children ? It is because , with all the sublimity of Homer , it has brought out these great objects i the language of the nursery . It carries you into a splendid temple on a go-cart . It is just so with the Bible . It has great thoughts for humble minds ; and if that book should he lost to our system of education , its ph ce will never be supplied until the wisdom of man can rival the wisdom of God . The last cause which I shall mention as injuring our schools , is one which has injured us in all other respects-it is that narrow policy , which in counting cents , neglects minds , and spares to spend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! we want public spirit . We want comprehensive , foreseeing minds . The Quarterly Review , with its usual bitterness , has remarked , that you can not pass a group of Americans talking together without overhearing the word dollar . You are sure to overhear something about dollar . The word is good English , and we have certainly a right to use it as often as we have occasion  --  but I wish it might be used a little oftener in a different connection . The charitable man often talks of dollars ; so does the man of public spirit . No matter how often you talk of your dollars , if you are resolved to do good with them . If we could afford a little more expense , if we could be rid of that poverty whose seat is chiefly in the mind , we could build better school-houses , we could employ better instructers , we could afford more time to our children and ourselves ; we could adopt a policy more noble , more worthy of ourselves and our land . Rich men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own children ; and we have schools whose chief excellence is their expense . But there is not liberality enough toxv* rds the public . Charity too often wit* ers an*. des at the sight of a t x bill . Charity did s* y ? he *ax hil is OitC* the deatn of j istice . Loo ' over our la is . See the wretched xvigwams which are used for schoolhouses ; see the characters which are employed for schoolmasters ; count the sums raised ; the time used and the time lost , and then pronounce if Solomon did not utter some wisdom when he said- Tiere is that sc tteret a *d et *tcreas 2t and tk vs is flat it *t/ it Ideth yore tha . is meet , *nit it tendeti to poverty . Such are the auses which I uspect have operated to impair the usefulness of our common schools . Our first duty is to remove these and all other impediments . We nuA lean to value this system not the less because it is old ; and give the Lesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp of utility from time . We must form just conceptions of what these institutions might be ; we must place the bright ideal of improvement before us . We must endeavor to give more of our attention to common schools , and form a higher estimate of their immeasurable importance . We must not think of the favored few ; but endeavor to send instruction to the many . We must endeavor to impress on the public mind , and especially on parents , a sense of the vast importance of education . School committees and instructers should visit the parents , and endeavor to see that the children are actually sent . In some places the attendance is very irregular . We must see to it , that we have instructers , who are men of principle ; apt to teach , and able to dischar* , e their duty . We must be willing to build spacious and convenient school-houses ; and visit them , and take a deep interest in the subject . We must give our time and our money to this great c*use . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country , and the sacred name of religion ; and finally , we must implore the blessing of God on these institutions , that he would take them under his holy keeping , shed o them his constant gra c , and make them the sources of that knowledge which adorns this life , and that wisdom which leads to salvation . They ought to be the subjects of our most earnest prayers . There is a close connexion between ignorance and vice ; and in such a country as our own , the connexion is fatal to freedom . Knowl // edge opens sources of pleasure which the ignorant man can never know  --  the pursuit of it fills up every idle hour , opens to the mind a constant source of occupation , wakes up the slumbering powers , gives the secret victory contest and the secret unveils to our astonishment ideal worlds ; secures us from temptation and sensuality ; and exalts us in the scale of rational beings . When I pass by the grog-shop and hear the idle dispute and the obscene song-when I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and shouting as they go-when I discover the boat sailing down the river , where you can hear the influence of ruin by the noise which it makes-I can not but ask , Were these people taught to read ? Was there no social library to which they could have access ? Did they ever know the calm satisfaction of taking an improving volume by a peaceful fire-side ? 0 did they ever taste the luxury of improving the mind ? You hardly ever knew the young man who loved his home and his book that was vicious . Knowledge , is often the poor man 's wealth . It is a treasure that no thief can steal , no moth nor rust can corrupt . By it you turn his cottage to a palace , and you give a treasure which is always improving and can never be lost . " The poor man , " says Robert Hall , " who has gained a taste for good hooks , will in all likelihood become thoughtful ; and when you have given the poor a habit of thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the gift of a large sum of money , since you have put into their possession the principle of all legitimate prosperity . " Nor is it to the poor alone , that this remark applies . The rich need occupation . Their hearts are often like seas , which , stagnant under a breathless atmosphere , putrify for the want of a wave . Employment , roused by some noble object , is the secret of happiness ; and of all employments , mental labor lasts the longest . The body soon tires ; but the mind , divine in its origin and immortal in its destiny , pursues its labors with transient pausings ; and rises from every check with fresh vigor to continue its eternal flight . What a beautiful picture does Cicero give of the secret happiness his studies opened to him . " You will not blame me , respected judges , at least you will pardon me , if , while some are hurried in business ; some keeping holidays ; some pursuing pleasure ; and some giving their hours to sleep ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should steal a little time for the recollection of my studies and the improvement of my mind . " Yes , he loved these things better than recreation ; to him they were more profitable than business and sweeter than sleep . " Will our government last ? Will America be happy ? " are questions often asked with great solicitude . The warm monarchist confidently answers no , and the warm republican , as confidently yes . But in my opinion the result depends on a class of men whose names are seldom mentioned in connexion with politics . It depends on our schoolmasters ; on our having enough of them well principled and well qualified ; and posted in their proper citadels-every village school . I repeat it again , it is the diffusion of knowledge that must save us . It is often said that knowledge and education must be the // guardians of our republic . But knowledge where ? Education for what class ? The land may be full of seminaries , and yet the country may fall by pure ignorance . Rome never had brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more knowledge . Cicero , Virgil , Horace-these very names are enough to prove the claims of their country to the highest improvement . But where was this knowledge ? It was confined to privileged classes ; it was locked up in expensive libraries ; it was concealed in noble villas ; it was monopolized by the few , only to enable them to crush the many beneath the invisible chains they were preparing for the mind . There can not be a more favorable opportunity for the overthrow of liberty than this great inequality . If all were ignorant , they would stand upon a level , and in the balance of disabilities liberty might be safe . But let the rich be well educated , and the poor neglected , and the fall of freedom is certain . The light will predominate over the darkness ; the thinkers will rule ; and the ignorant will be slaves . Before I relieve the reader 's patience-already too much abusedpermit me to make one suggestion more . Why is it that human nature never will be excited in proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions-they set us in a flame ; questions of the deepest utility-they put us asleep . It is strange ; it is passing strange . We know our own folly ; we smile at it ; and yet we keep it . Only let some party question start up in our assemblies from the evening caucus to the floor of Congress , and every tongue is unloosed , and every heart is on fire . Day after day is consumed in the strife ; and the whole country is on a blaze in the concern . Yet no permanent good is gained or lost by the victory or defeat . It is a mere contest of passion , as transient as it is violentraging and passing away . But let some question of permanent utility come up , over which reason watches , but ambition sleeps , and you can hardly command attention enough to investigate the subject . The feelings of the orator are not touched , the ear of the community is not opened . Ah ! Human nature is laboring under a great disease . We must seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
