txt No one who has ever seen the subject of the opposite sketch , on one of the occasions selected by the artist , the delivery of a speech in the Senate , will need the addition of the name , to recognize in it the distinguished Senator from South Carolina whose name heads this page . He has been selected for the fifth number of our Political Portrait Gallery , because he may , at the present moment , be considered to occupy a position more prominent and remarkable , in various points of view , than any of the other public men now on the stage before the eye of the country . Mr. Calhoun is of Irish extraction , his father having been a nadye of that land of warm hearts and excitable temperaments , hough he left it in early childhood . The family emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1733 , from which , after a number of years , they removed to Virginia , and thence finally , in 1756 , to South Carolina . He was born in 178*2 , being the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father , Patrick Calhoun , was distinguished for his daring spirit manifested in the command of a force of border rangers for the defence of the frontier settlements , against the Indian ( especially the Cherokee ) hostilities . He married , in 1770 , a young lady of the name of CaIdwell , of Charlotte county , Virginia . Mr. Calhoun is therefore now in his fifty-sixth year . He exhibited very extraordinary natural powers of mind at an early age , though his education before the age of eighteen was comparatively but little attended to , the three or four years preceding that age having been spent at home , in the invigorating pursuits of agriculture , and the sports of the field . lie had been taken home by his parents from school , on account of the injury which his health had sustained , from the severe application to which he had been excited by a strong enthusiasm for historical reading , supported by a patient industry rarely exhibited by so young a mind . In 1800 his school education was resumed , and in 1802 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudiments of the Latin grammar , he entered Yale College in the Junior class ; - at the head of which his commanding natural powers enabled him to graduate , with the higW* est honors . He spent a year and a half at the Litchfield law school ; and , completing his legal studies in the office of Mr. Desaussure , in Charleston , was admitted to the bar in 1807 , where he immediately took a high rank , on the circuit of his native district , Abbeville . VOL . Il . NO . V. E // From his earliest years , he was remarkable for an enthusiastic ' devotion to free principles , taking a prominent position on all occasions among the most ardent of the friends of human freedom , and the enemies of strong governmental powers . This seems to have been the general tone and bias of his mind from the earliest age . He entered Congress in 1811 , having served two years in the Legislature of his native State . Since tbat period , he has been always on the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iiv prominence to none , in all the important public affairs of the times . A distinguished position was immediately conceded to him , by general consent , in the ranks of the Republican party , of which he was of course a member , being one of its most zealous and powerful champions . He was placed second on the Committee on Foreign Affairs ; of which he soon became chairman , on the retirement from Congress of Gen. Porter . This post was , it will be remembered , at that time the leadership of the Republican party in the House . His maiden speech was in defence of his report recommending a declaration of war , against a powerful attack by Jobn Randolph ; it placed him at once in the first class of parliamentary orators . His extraordinary powers had full scope in that . position , which he maintained with all the enthusiasm , energy , and inexhaustible resources of genius , by which he was so remarkably characterized . His patriotic services to the country at that trying time will always constitute a bright page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings that may have arisen out of subsequent collisions of great parties and interests ought to be permitted to obscure . His course at this period presents one feature especially worthy of remark , as having some bearing , in the way of illustration , upon the just understanding of his subsequent political life , and his present actual position . He displayed a strikingly bold independence of party obligations , as they are more commonly estimated by public men prominently engaged in the campaigns of party warfare . Though a leading member of the Republican party , he did not hesitate to oppose it in several important measures , to which a distinct and decided party character had been given ,  --  in some instances successfully , and in others in vain ; - witness his support of the Navy against a strong tide of party unpopularity ,  --  his opposition to the embargo , and the non-importation and non-intercourse acts ,  --  and to the great scheme of the Secretary of the Treasury ( Mr. Dallas ) of a non-specie-paying national bank , which was strongly urged as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No enemy can deny Mr. Calhoun the credit of having manifested on these occasions an independence , and highminded sincerity of views , entitled at least to this passing notice . The next important measure with which he is associated was the charter of the Bank of the United States . He was at the head of // he Committee on Currency , which reported the bill for that purpose . The fact is not to be disguised , nor the responsibility of the act cast if . But that responsibility has to be shared with the Republican party as a mass . It committed undoubtedly an egregious error . It was a grievous fault , and grievously hath Ca3sar answered it . The Republican party yielded- reluctantly and hesitatingly indeed-to a pressure of circumstances , arising out of the utterly deranged state of the currency , industry and business of the country , and the state of bank suspension of specie payments throughout the greater part of the Union , when the general subject of banking was very imperfectly understood , and the plausible ideas on which the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be false , were in full sway and vogue ,  --  a pressure of cir*umstances upon a party in administration , in a severe crisis , and responsible from day to day for the practical course of affairs in the nation , of which it is scarcely possible for us of a later day to appreciate the full force . Mr. Calhoun now denies any material inconsistency , fairly and liberally regarded , between his present views and those on which he acted at that time . We shall have occasion to remark below upon the exact position , wIth respect to former and present opinions , on the subject of a bank , entertained by Mr. Calhoun , on which all readers can form their own judgments on this question of consistency ,  --  if , indeed , it be deemed one of vital importance , after a lapse of upwards of twenty years , under circumstances so materially changed , on a subject illumined in so great a degree within that period by the lights of experience and the progress of the popular developement of opinion . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-an admission which has in fact been made by Mr. Calhoun himself . The Republican party at that period was certainly not entirely free from the injurious effect of the long possession of power . A period of war , moreover , has necessarily a tendency to strengthen the governmental action . And in the state of exhaustion and general derangement succeeding the war , it was natural that the minds of the party in power should flow rather in a centripetal than a centrifugal direction , in relation to the powers and action of the Government . Such was undeniably the case . The purity of he good old Virginia doctrine of 98 was certainly considerably tarnished , by lon and trying exposure to temptation ; and the charter of the Bank , the minimum principle in the Tariff of 1816 , and some of the ideas and measures of the time on the subject of Internal Improvements , it can not fairly be denied , planted seeds of mischief , from which rapidly grew consequences whose evil influence will yet be long and deeply felt , in the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience for which the Republican party has since had to pay so bitter a penalty , will never be forgotten , ... -. as a warning to politicians and to parties , never // to yield , ii any degree , an essential principle to any ap*nrent ur-* gency of expediency . Without dwelling upon the other prominent points of Mr. Calhoun 's short but brilliant career in Congress , as a member of the House of Representatives , we pass to his appointment by Mr. Monroe to the head of the Department of War , in December , 1817 , at the age of thirty-five . The adaptation of his mind to the practical business of administration was here subjected to a severe test . The state of disorder in which he found the complicated concerns of this Department , is well known , and may be best proved by the fact that it was overwhelmed with a burthenof not less than fifty millions of dollars of unsettled accounts , and all its intricate machinery to a great extent disorganized . The credit has always and universally been conceded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient officers th ' t ever presided over any of our public departments . The arrears of unsettled accounts were speedily almost entirely extinguished ; the army was reorganized in an admirable manner , in point of discipline and eco omy , on its peace establishment ; the West Point Academy was revived , and placed on a sound and effective footing ; a thorough system of fortifications , maritime and frontier , wa* organized ; and so perfect a sy tem of financial administration was brought by him into operation , as well in the disbursements of the Department as in the payment of pensions , that not a dollar of the immense amount of money which has been dis ursed by that Department ( exceeding a hundred millions , ) from that period to the present time , has been lost . Nor ought an allusion to be omitted , to the coast survey , originated under his administration ; to the fine gallery of Indian portraits , of which he laid the foundation , now so interesting an ornament to the Department ; as also to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially those on Indian affairs , internal improvements , and the reduction of the army . He presided over that Department with the highest credit to himself and utility to the country , till the close of Mr. Monroe 's second term , and his own election to the Vice-Presidency , in 18*2* . His name had been brought before the public as one of the candidates for the Presidency , but withdrawn . On the election of Mr. Adams over Gen. Jackson , by the House of Representatives , his own favorite , Mr. Crawford , being out of the field , he was naturally placed in the Op-. position , as well y the mode of that election-bei g by the House , in opposition to the manifest popular preference-as by his natural party affinities , lie discharged the duties of that position with efficiency and dignity . lie has repeatedly made the remark since , that the leisure of that position , and its comparative retirement from active participation in party affairs , at the same time that it afforded a clear and close view of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirming his attachment to the State-Rights school of  |p0-  // itics ; strengthening and extending his views farther than they had efore gone ; and satisfyiag him that the federative principle was he true conservative principle of our system . That before that period his habits of thinking on the subject had been comparatively loose , though always based on the exposition of the Republican doctrine in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 98 and 99 , and in Mr. Madison 's imperishable Report . They were thenceforward reviewed , and more strongly defined and settled ; and it was there that the conviction forced itself on his mind , that there were no other means practicable , to arrest the tendency of affairs towards a Federal centralization fatal to the rights of the States , than by a trial of the experimel t of the extent to which the power of the principle of State sovereignty might be carried , in a direct collision with the usurpations of the Federal Government . On Gen. Jackson 's election by the people , in iS 8 , he again came *n as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel which so shortly thereafter ensued between him ant the President , we shall not here make any remark . They are fully before the public in the copious publications of correspondence and *statements made at the time . Far from us be the ungracious task of revivin* the remembrance of bygone occurrences of so disagrecable a nature on all sides , whatever may be the respective opinions of ndividuals or parties . The effect is all with which we have to do . Mr. Calhoun became placed in an attitude of deep hostility to the President and his principal friends , so strongly and severely per onal , as to extend ali ost of necessity even to political relations . His popularity was shattered ( at least with the great body of the Democratic party ' ) even as the earthen vessel , in the collision . A morbid itterness of feeling towards Gen. Jackson 's entire Administration seems to have arisen out of these personal relations . In a word , Mr. Calhoun soon found himself decidedly in the Opposition , ' and was seen to enact the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , that seem natural to that relation . The affair of Nullification soon succeeded ; and Mr. Calhoun , in obedience to the call f his State , resigned his seat in the chair of the Senate , as VicePresident , to take his place in that body as a Senator from South Carolina , and as her espec*al champion before the country for the justification of the course which that State was then pursuing . Nullification ' is , then , the title by which the next chapter in Mr. Calhoun 's life is headed  --  a word of dread and portentous sound in some portions of the Union , while in others it is regarded , at least by lar*.e parties , as the watchword of safety to the liberty , the real interests , and the permanent union , of our Confederacy . Mr. Cab lioun may he regarded as having been the master spirit of that affair - whether for glory or the reverse all must determine according to air respective views . Nullification is now a bygone thing , and it // 70 John C. Cathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , than it could be at a time when it was considered to be on the eve of deluging the country with the blood of civil war , and of rending asunder our thrice-blessed Union of the States . The Nullifiers have scarcely been fairly treated by public opinion at the North . Their motives , and the spirit in which they acted , have , in our opinion , been too harshly judged , while the theoretic ground of constitutionality on which they planted themselves , has been comparatively little understood . Our notice of it must necessarily b very brief and slight . The high Tariff of 1828 went into operation , in despite of the discontent and strenuous opposition of the South , or the cotton-growing : interest of the Union , by whom it was regarded with the utmost detestation , as utterly unconstitutional-as contrary to the liberal principles of political economy , as elucidated hy the modern developemeut of that science , which abhor all restriction and all legislative tampering with particular interests  --  and as an unjust and t annical sacrifice of their interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The payment of the national debt was considered to remove the only possible shadow of legitimacy , on national grounds , which could-be claimed for it . Yet there appeared no hop of effecting a change in that career of restrictive policy , for the protection of a sectional manufacturing interest , recommended to popularity , with a majority of the people and of Congress , under the specious name of ' the American System , ' without the introduction of ' some new elements of action into the relations between the conflicting parties and opinions , which should shake that massive aseendency of a majority , abusing its power over a minority ; and should force the former hack to that respect for the violated rights and interests of the latter , for which all other means seemed insufficient . We wish simply to state the theory of Nullification , according to the ideas of those who should understand best their own intentions and grounds of action . In such cases , when a minority interest is driven by what it considers the oppression of a majority , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for other interests to enter fully into the exasperated feelings , and perhaps exaggerated views , on which the parties in question proceed , nor to judge fairly of the fact on which their justification must depend , namely , the extent of the oppression under which they are sufferin* . In all collisions of interests , it is exceedingly difficult to be just , within even the narrowest limits , to our antagonist ,  --  while we claim the extension of the broadest liberality to ourselves . But now , when Nullification is hut a memory and *n abstraction , the time has arrived , not only for justice , but for that generosity , which a truly enlightened and philosophical history should always extend to the motives of men and parties . The State of South Carolina , armed with the single principle of the State sovereignty , undertook the combat with the giant of the protective poL* // PoliUcal Portraitg. - No . V. 71 icy , arrayed in the panoply of Federal power . The events of the contest , a short but severe one , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solemn convention assembled , planting itself on the reserved rights of its original soverei*nty , declared the law in question unconstitutional , and therefore essentially null and void , and decreed that it should not be executed within the limits of its State jurisdiction ,  --  in a word , it nullified , ' appealing to the two following passages from the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions , long established as embodying the political creed of the Republican party , in justification of the constitutional around thus assumed by it : " Resolved , That this ass*mhly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare , that it views the powers of the federal government as resultin* , from the compact to which the States are parties , as limited by the plain sense , and intention of the instrument constituting that compact , and as no farther valid than they are authorised by the grants enumerated in that compact ; and that in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compa the States , who are parties hereto , have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arresting the progress of the evil , and for maintaining within their respective limits , the authorities , rights , end liberties appertaining to them . " Virainia resolutions of 1 *9S , by Mr. Madison . " Resolved , That this commonwealth considers the federal union , upon the terms and for the purposes specified in the late compact , as conducive to the liberty and happiness of the sever-I States : That it does now unequivocally declare its attachmeat to the union , and to that compact , agreeably to its obvious and real intention , and will he among the last to seek its dissolution ; That if those who administer the general government , be permitted to transgress the limits fixed by that compact , by a total disregard to the special deleaations of power therein contained , an annihilation of the State aovernments , and the erection upon their ruins of a general consolidated government , will be the inevitable consequence ; That the principle and construction contended for by sundry of the State legislatures. that the general government is the exclusive judge of the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop nothin short of despotism , since the discretion of those who administer the goinrnment , and not the constitution , would be the measure of their powers ; That the several States who formed that instrument , bein sovereign and independent , have the unquestionab right to judge of its infraction , and that a NtTLLIFIt3ATJON by those sovereignties of all nauthorised acts done under color of that instrument , is the rightful remedy . " Kentucky resolutions of 1799 . The original draft of which was made by Mr. Jefferson . Nor did the State confine itself to simple arguments , and paper declarations of opinion and intention . The Federal Executive being bound , by the most solemn sanctions of oath and duty , to enforce the execution of the Federal laws , even , if necessary , with the arm of physical power , the State placed itself in an attitude of military preparation , for the defence of its position ; organized and armed its own physical force ; and succeeded in arousing so determined and excited a state of feeling in its citizens , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have maintained its position to the last extremity ,  --  a position , manifestly , exceedingly difficult to be overcome , if thus maintained , by any physical power which could have been brought against it . The result all know . A compromise was agreed upon between the conflicting interests . A gradu 1 reduction of the protective duties , // down to the scale of mere revenue taxation , was agreed upon , to be consummated in the year 1845* . Which party may be entitled to claim this compromise as a triumph , it would be very unprofitable to discuss . Whether the abandonment of the principle of protection , on the one side , to be fully carried into effect at an appointed , and not far distant , period , was a submission on the part of the American-System ' interest ,  --  or whether the acquiescence in the tariff laws , the burthen of their oppression being reduced , and gradually lightened from year to year , was a submission on the part of the adverse interest-is now of little consequence , though an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the two leading representatives of those interests in the arrangement of that compromise . The truth lies perhaps midway between the two extremes . There was mutual concession-triumph and submission on both sides . On the one side , Nullification was in a very difficult and delicate position . A tremendous power of moral influence against it , from all the rest of the Union , hemmed it round , and pressed upon it with an irresstible , though impalpable , force . It was weakened also hy intestine division , the Union party in the State itself being very formidable , , and being rendered the more so from the in- temperate manner in which the excited pas ions of the time hurried the dominant party in the State to use their power . It was not supported by the other Statcs of the South , and was certainly made to totter to its base by the ponderous blows dire ted upon it by General Jackson , acting as the Federal Chief Magistrate , supported as he was , on this question , by all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more untenable . It was in the wrong , as to the mode of remedy , and the , constitutional argument went against iL In such a situation , however resolute and gallant might be the spirit of the State , however strong in the self-concentration of her own indomitable will and energy , taking counsel of despair , it is manifest . that a compromise on grounds so honorable and equal ,  --  the principle contended for being recovered by her , in exchange for a temporary sacrifice of interest ,  --  afforded a very fortunate and providential escape from a position , which was fast becoming too hot to hold . While , on the other hand , the advocates of the protective policy were in a situation not much more favorable , in a country in which Public Opinion is the one omnipotent ruling principle , against whose power it is vain for any intere*t long to contend . It was apparent that that policy had now reached a point at whi h its ascendency was to be maintained only at the expen* e of civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resting on a foundation of policy ( ev*n as f'r as the true interests of the manufacturers themselves were concerned ) at the best , hollow and doubtful-at variance with the principles of liberty which animate the genius of our people-plainly hostile to the spirit of the Constitution , at least as understood by the Repuhui* // can party of the Union , in possession of the Executive administration of the government-that policy could not possibly have ven* tured to the point of shedding a single drop of blood for its mainte* nance . Its own friends could not have supported it to that extrem* ity . Or if they had done so , it would have been the signal for its total annihilation . Its position was not more tenable than that of South Carolina , and there can be no doubt that the compromise tariff was the very best bargain that could possibly have been made in behalf of the American System . ' The truth is , that a civil war in this country , or a separation of the Union , is a thing in its nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we confidently trUst for all future ages . In violent collisions of interests , the excited passions of the contest may lead to the brink of the precipice , but they can never have power to urge the people , our sixteen or seventeen millions , the one step beyond , to the fatal plunge . The wrong opinion must then yield to the right , by an irresistible moral necessity ; or if there is wrong on both sides , it must be abandoned by both , and a compromise must be the result . In such relations between principles and great interests , individuals are of much less consequence than they are often supposed . They act but as representatives and agents , obeying a compulsion before which they are , personally , but as straws before a tempest . That compromise could not but have taken place . It was a necessity , which could not but have worked itself out by some means or other ,  --  through one set of agents if not thron h another . We are rio friends of Nullification , thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge it liberally . There was much of wrong , mixed up with much of right , in it . It was right in the end proposed , the overthrow of the restrictive and protective system , which we consider as not less hostile to the spirit of the Constitution , than to the true principles of political science . It was wrong in the means-because all other means had not been exhausted-or , at the very least , wrong in the forms and theoretic grounds of procedure , as it was certainly too violent and intemperate in the mode . Under the Constitutioi and the compact it could not rightfully nullify ,  --  .. whether the circumstances were such as to justify a recourse to the ultim ratio of a revolutionary attitude , it is not for us to pro* nounce . Nullification was revolution , in its spirit and its substance ; and the misL ke committed was , in claiming to be within the forms of the Constitution , when in truth the State took up a position be yond and above them , on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal principle , and on the other the State* Rights principle , the centripetal and centrifugal forces of our system , were both carried to extreme . But so it often is in great contests for reform ,  --  the reforming principle is frequently carried to excess , and intemperately administered , and that very excess and // violence , though they distress and convulse at the time , and may even awaken opposition from those who really sympathize with the end proposed , do often seem to have been perhaps indispensable to success , or at least to its early achievement . Such are our leading views of Nullification ; the expression of which may probably be unpopular with both parties . It has certainly done some good ,  --  that is not to be denied . It was a little hurricane while it lasted , but has left a beneficial effect on the atmosphere . It can have no bad effect as an example to be imitated on slight occasions , whenever a State may differ in opinion with the Federal Government on a question of constitutionality , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Government on this occasion was so energetic , as fully , at least , to vindicate its rightful authority , while its strong measures did not , and , from the nature of the principles involved , could not , extend in their operatioa beyond the statute book and the assertion of right . It is , however , very certain that the protective system in our federal legislation will never raise its head agaia in this country ,  --  though whether it received a death wound from Nullification , or merely died a natural death , as is now asserted by its friends ; in the ripeness of its allotted years , after ac* complishing its object of establishing a national system of inanufacture , it is not necessary for us further to consider , being fully satisfied of the fact and with it , and willing to give the past to oblivion and fix our thoughts and action upon the more important present and future . Mr. Calhoun continued decidedly and very energetically in Opposition to General Jackson 's Administration , his opposition being marked by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , acting under the stimulus of strongly excited personal feelings . Opposition to Executive usurpation ' was the quarter of the field , in the general , party contest that was raging , particularly occupied by him . This position placed him of course in alliance with the Federal party ,  --  - an alliance which certainly made it an exceedingly difficult matter to define the exact meaning and scope of the broad common name adopted by the Opposition party , that of " Whigs . " This was a false position , to be oc upied by Mr. Calhoun , and that name may be said to have been under a dark eclipse during that period . It was of course manifest that this Opposition was but a rope of sand ,  - -  that no permanent union could subsist between elements so widely hostile in their fundamental principles ; and that success would of necessity be the immediate signal for dissolution . There can be no question , that that success would have been the overthrow of the Republican , and the elevation to power of the Federal , party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Opposition must , of course , have been absorbed into the greater body , and politically annihilated . The first fruits of the victory would have been a National Bankwith // the whole train of manifold evil naturally flowing out of such an institution , and such a policy in control of the Federal government . It is due to justice here to give the version of Mr. Calhoun 's own friends , of his party position at this period , which is substantially as follows : - Lt is true indeed , that thc Administration was an administration of the Democratic or Republican party , the party always identical , in the main , with the State-Rights , as contradistinguished from the Federal , party . But he regarded it as corrupt in the character of its men and its measures , and as carrying the Executive power to a height of abuse which justified a temporary alliance even with the extreme Federal party , for the purpose of humbling and reforming it . The episode of Nullification , too , had a considerable influence in confirming a decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends . On the bank question , the leading practical question involved in the contest of the parties , Mr. Calhoun considered the Administration experiment , of a State Bank Deposite System , as even a worse alternative , both in constitutionality and policy , than a National Bank , independently of the consideration of the excessive Executive power exercised in the mode of carrying that experiment into effect . Such would be , substantially , as fairly stated as in oUr power , the explanation of that anomalous political relation held by Mr. Calhoun towards the two main parties ,  --  in alliance with the extreme the farthest removed from his own abstract principles , to oppose and overthrow the administration elected and supported by the party to which his o rn school properly belonged , though the latter had committed the fault of pushing the State-Rights principle to an impracticable and revolutionary excess . I-us course through that period was looked upon in a different light by the friends and party of the Administration , and gave rise to very strong feelings , which were of course reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widen and ( leepen the existing breach . It was generally considered to be prompted solely by a reckless passion of ambition and vindictiveness , sacrificing all the ties and affinities of a common school of party principles , to feelings and objects of a nature purely personal-with Rule or Ruin for its desperate motto . And it was looked upon with a sense of resentment and indignation the stronger from the full appreciation entertained of the high character of his intellectual powers , as also of hL great personal influence . It is not for us to decide between these different constructions of his course at that period ; the events are so recent as to be fresh within the memory of all ; and the expression of our opinions on the subject would have but very little importance or influence . The truth would probably be found , by the dispassionate and candid searcher , at some intermediate point-there being on the one side doubtless much injustice and misrepresentation , and on the other some considerable self-de1u* // sion , and strong bias , taking its origin and complexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our views of the truth of that plausible charge against the late Administration , of an unconstitutional expansion of the Executive power , have been sufficiently explained in a former article ( February Number , Art . I. ) to render any further allusion to it in this place unnecessary . It is , of course , well known that Mr. Calhoun stands now in the altered relation of a supporter of the policy of the present Administration , which differs from the last in little else than in the change of the individual at its head . On this point , our remarks must be of necessity brief-with reference to our limits of space . Our view of it is simply this . Mr. Calhoun and the ultra State-Rights party were in a false position , in conducting such an opposition against the late Administration , as to constitute a support to the antagonist party , with which they had even less of natural affinity than the party actually in power . If that opposition had been successful , it would have placed the Federal party at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced , and factitious , and , from the nature of principles , and the laws which govern the combinations of political parties , could not permanently endure . As soon as the temporary causes of this alienation of parties naturally one and the same , and distinguished in principles rather by a difference of degree than of kind should be removed , by the irresistible operation of time , they must come together again . No human power could long keep them apart . Between the powers of principles , and the affinities of great masses , individuals , even the greatest , are comparatively nothing . If they should place themselves between , with their personal motives and influence , in the hope of keeping them apart , they must be crushed into annihilation as between two great millstones . Nullification is now , in our day , as has been remarked above , a memory , and nothing more ,  --  a mere abstraction of theory , 50 far as all practical affairs of the present , or prospects of the future , are concerned . The charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Executive power , if heretofore swollen , by the influence of sufficient causes , up to the full level of its banks , though it never overflowed them , has now subsided naturally hack to its accustomed channel . The purity of the present Administration , in the school of Democratic and State-Rights principles , is too manifest on its very front ,  --  - the great issue between the parties is too plainly the same , essentially , as in the unforgotten contest between the same parties at the close of the last century ,  --   --  to leave it possible for any considerable portion of the South to remain long in Opposition . Individuals may repre* sent and precede masses , in these great combinations of parties , hut they do not lead thei . They are borne on by them ,  --  or rather all act by a common law , impelling all in the same direction . the individual loses all his influence-which can never in this country // 77 have any other basis than the representation of a principle or a popular sentiment  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast himself in the w* y of that mighty movement . We do not therefore acquiesce in the claim which has been advanced triumphantly by Mr. Calhoun , in his recent encounters with the leaders of the Opposition in the Senate , that his sudden interposition has rescued the Administration from destruction . Such an idea is founded on a misappreciation of the relative importance of men and principles . Even had he not been sincere in hi* principles , but actuated solely by unworthy selfish motives of calculation , ( and we believe unhesitatingly in his profound and enthusiastic sincerity , which no one who knows the man could ever dream of doubtin* , ) he could not choose but take that course . The last link of the causes which had bound him to the great error of his political life , his alliance with the Federal Opposition to Gen. Jackson 's administration , was broken , having gradually become attenuated to the point of disappearance ,  --  and he could not have remained much longer in that artificial and highly forced relation . the position had become utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political annihilation . Is it not evident that the moral power which he now brings to the , support of the financial policy of the Administration , is derived from his representation of a great party and its principles  --  a representa* tive character which must force that course upon him , by a moral necessity to oppose which would be equally destruction and dis-honor ? This remark is not intended in any depreciating sense or spirit . Far from it . We admire Mr. Calhoun 's recent course in the highest degree , and are fully conscious of the magnanimity of motive by which he has been actuated , of the moral influence which has accompanied his accession to the support of the Administration on the Divorce question , and of the signal services rendered by his powerful arm in the giant struggle of the debate . But what are men , even the greatest and the highest , in comparison with principles and with millions ? The Opposition have clearly evinced their angry appreciation of the important bearing of Mr. Calhoun 's movement , by the strenuous efforts made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to counteract the effect of its moral influence , by destroying his character as a statesman , by the cry of inconsistency , and even by the insinuation of corrupt motive . Without insulting Mr. Calhoun by admitting the latter to be entitled to any notice , after he has himself stamped it in the dust in scorn , ' we must make a passing allusion to the former . The inconsistency in principles charged upon Mr. Calhoun , relates mainly to his late opposition to , and present support of , the Administration , and to his views on the subject of banking and currency // now maintained , as contrasted with those which placed him in the ranks of the supporters of the Bank of the United States , in its recent contest with the Government . Those of a more ancient date , as alleged , it is not worth while , on such an occasion as the present , to enter into . This charge Mr. Calhoun met and refuted , in a most masterly style , in his speech in reply to Mr. Clay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to its general outline , this . His relations to the two parties had been such as have been above described . Lie had acted on grounds independent of both ; and though he had been placed by circumstances in the attitude of a temporary ally of the Federal party to reduce the overgrown Executive power  --  the object of their common hostility-he had nothing else in common with that party , and owed it no allegiance nor fidelity . It was universally known that there was even less natural affinity between his principles and theirs , than between him and the common enemy ; an they had no right nor reason to count upon his permanent alliance with them , after the causes on which he had acted had ceased to operate . The overthrow of the Administration , at the present crisis , would produce the consummation the most to be deprecated by his party , the accession of the Federal school of politics to power . The Administration being now practically reformed in the obnoxious points which had excited his opposition , and being now no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive power , his causes for hostility to it were correspondently modified . Thus much for his personal and party relations ; and he could only be accused of inconsistency , and of " going over , " by those who looked upon the contest of the parties in no other light than as a struggle for power between the Ins and the Outs , and who were enraged by his refusal to continue , a volunteer ally , in their service to help them into power , when in truth such a course would have involved an utter faithlesness to the principles of his own beloved State-Rights party ,  --  principles , always cherished by him and proclaimed above he din of the party cries of the day . On the latter question , relating to his opinions on the currency , Mr. Calhoun certainly annihilated the charge forever , in the powerful speech already alluded to , in reply to Mr. Clay-by the indisputable evidence of the record . We must refer the reader to that speech , which every one , of both parties , ought to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the publication of that speech no one can hereafter repeat the charge without incurring the liability , himself , of wilful calumny . It is sufficient for us here to state the exact ground assumed by him , and supported by the amplest evidence of extracts from his former speeches . His idea of the true constitutional doctrine of the powers of the Federal Government in relation to the currency , was this ,  --  that if the Government recognize // 79 the paper of the banks as money , by receiving and circulating it , it is then bound to regulate the security and uniformity of what it conducts its fiscal action in , by any means necessary to that object ,  - -  this power and duty being derived directly from the principle of uniformity of taxation , in the Constitution ; and a national bank would be a more efficient , and not less constitutional mode than a league of State Banks . The latter is the worst of all the alternatives possible in the case , both from its effect on the currency , and from the dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially the Executive , power . The framers of the Constitution were , as all admit , " hard-money men , " and contemplated and intended the use of real money alone , the precious metals , in the fiscal concerns of the Government . The practice arose , under the original auspices of Hamilton , of dealing in bank paper , accompanied with that of depositing the revenue in banks ; which connection with those institutions , as a system , became , in process of time , so intimate and apparently indissoluble , that the question of its constitutionality or even expediency , was not an open one for any practical or useful purpose . There stood the fact , resting on a foundation seemingly as broad and deep as the foundations of the eternal hills ; and abstractions of opinions and arguments , whether in relation to its constitutionality or good policy , could no more shake it , than the winds whistling around the base of the mountain . Thus connected with the banking system , and dealing in a paper currency , made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were concerned , the Government was bound to regulate it , even by the means of a National Bank , if that was the most efficient instrument for the purpose . The question was never a free and open one , to be considered de novo , on original grounds of principle , before the present time . The recent explosion of the system has not only effected the *total separation of the Government from it , by operation of law itself , but the opinions of men have been matured by time and experience to the point of preparation for a return to the original constitutional ground from which the Government never ought to have departed . The choice of practicable alternatives is not now , as on the former occasions , between a national bank and a league of banks , but between the latter and the divorce . Either of the two extremes he pro . ferred to the middle course , which united the evils of both ,  --  be infinitely preferred the last to both the others , now that , for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a position as to admit the possibility of a free choice . During the period of the contest between the late Administration and the Bank of the United States , though it is now so frequently referred to as period of sound and healthy currency , he had understood the real hollow character of that fair-seeming outward show of health and prosperity . He was that the currency was bloated , and was in a career of expansioli // John C. Calhoun .. April , that threatened an eventual explosion such as has occurred . He considered the State Bank deposite system as calculated to promote that tendency ; and that a National Bank under the control of Congrcss , and suitably organized and regulated with reference to the object in view , afforded the only means of arresting that tendency , and , to use his own phrase at the time , to unbank the banks . ' He was therefore in favor of renewing its charter with proper modifications , for twelve years , being two years longer than the renewal of that of the Bank of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom and example of the economists and legislators of that country , in determining upon our own future system . He had always entertained , and frequently expressed , great doubts as to the principles on which our whole banking system was based ,  --  doubts as to its beneficial influence on the real prosperity , happiness , morals , and liberties of the people . He had distinctly intimated on a former occasion that if the question had then been between ban/c and no bank , he should not then have been found on the former side of it . After the removal of the deposits , he had even stated that if the existing illegal and unconstitutional* connection between the Executive and the league of banks was to continue , he should himself feel bound to introduce a proposition to divorce the Government altogether from the banking system , by prohibiting it from receiving or touching bank notes at all . And he was now most happy to embrace the first opportunity that presented itself , of realizing the aspiration , long cherished but never before feasible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a return to the original intent of the Constitution , after all always found by experience to be the wisest policy , as it is the purest honesty ,  --  at least according to the Republican and State-Rights school of politics . Such was , substantially , Mr. Calhoun 's defence of himself against this charge of inconsistency of opinions . We regret that it is not in our power to publish the extracts from his former speeches by which he supported it ; it is sufficient for us to say , that they fully sustained the position which he assumed , and to refer the reader , both as a point of some political and historical interest , and as justly due to Mr. Calhoun , to the speech itself in which he quotes those extracts . Mr. Calhoun has had to sustain a tremendous battery of attack , at the present session , from the two great leaders of the Opposition , Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster ; and these encounters of intellect-whatever may be thought of the propriety of time and place-have presented scenes of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest of mutual attack and defence went back to the commencement of the public lives of the eminent combatants , and afforded a highly interesting review of the political history of the country for the last twenty or thirty years . We have no space to travel over // the same ground , but have no hesitation in saying , that the combat appeared to us like that between the rock and the waves , and thaTt Mr. Calhoun established a vast intellectual superiority over both his great assailants together . His strong and far-reaching grasp of mind , his power of rapid and profound analysis and generalization ,  - -  pooily evaded by sneers upon his metaphysical ' and visionary ' genius , - his vigor of intellectual bound , and the self-evident can dor , depth and earnestness of his convictions , showed in signal superiority , ( according atleast to our opinion , ) over the mental attributes of the more dexterous lawyer and politician , able , powerful and great , as both unquestionably are . The long protracted passage at arms between him and Mr. Clay , in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , brought constantly to mind the recollection of the encounter , in the desert , between the heavy mail-armed Christian knight and the agile and dexterous Saracen , of Scott 's romance of The Crusaders ,  --  a comparison of which the justice may very fairly be acknoxvledged by the friends of both parties . Mr. Calhoun is , undeniably , a great man . For a number of years past , as has been before remarked , he has been , according to our view , in a false position ,  --  lost and entangled in a morass , into which he was insensibly led by an ignis fatuns of personal feelings . He is now all himself again-MacGregor 's foot again on his native heath . We had supposed it scarcely possible for him ever to become extricated from that false position , and again on firm and open ground . Probably no other man than himself could have thus effected it , by a single great stroke of genius . In that act , and in the mode in which performed , he has most emphatically shewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by his immediate declaration of support , on the reading of Mr. Van Buren 's Message at the Extra Session , and by the zeal and power since manifested by him in the van of the debate on the great question of the divorce , will constitute an imperishable monument of honorable fame . Inferior men would have sunk under the crisis-as we have seen so many sad instances . With Mr. Calhoun there was no hesitating , no negotiating , no wavering , no special-pleading about details , but he came out at once with all the energy of great intellectual power , all the confidence of immoveable strength of convictions , and all the frankness of conscious honesty and patriotism of purposetook his stand on the Constitution and on broad principles , indifferent how his abandonment of former party connections and the formation of new ( so far as they should naturally arise out of the common support of common principles ) might be received by either party-and , in a word , proved himself by that single act , emphatically a great man . Whether the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever forgive Mr. Calhoun the manner and spirit of his Opposition VOL . II . NO . V. // to President Jackson 's administration , notwithstanding all explana tions of circumstances and motives , well as he may have retrieved his position ,  --  we may not say ; nor whether the odium attaching to the word Nullification , ' will ever be forgotten ,  --  even though the recollection of it be accompanied with a thought upon the gallantry and self-devotion with which , in that affair , according to the views of his friends , he sacrificed himself , probably for life , to a principle That question is to be solved by time alone . We will conclude this article , which has insensibly extended , in the frank explanation of our views of Mr. Calhoun 's party course and position , far beyond the limits of our intention , with the following sketch of him , drawn by a personal friend of that gentleman , a distinguished Representative from his own State , in the other House of Congress . Our own views on the subjects touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing pages , to render it unnecessary for us to make any invidious modification of this portraiture by the hand of a friend , though it is proper for us thus to designate the quarter from which it proceeds . " Mr. Calhoun has evidently taken Demosthenes for his model as a speaker  --  or rather , I suppose , he has studied , while young , his orations with great admiration , until they produced a decided impression upon his mind . His recent speech in defence of himself against the attacks of Mr. Clay , is precisely on the plan of the famous oration De Corona , delivered by the great Athenian , in vindication of himself from the elaborate and artful attacks of A*schines . While the one says : " Athenians ! to you I appeal , my judges and my witnesses ! "  --  the other says : " In proof of this , I appeal to you , Senators , my witnesses and my judges on this occasion ! " A*schines accused Demosthenes of having received a bribe from Philip , and the latter retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he himself had notoriously done . Mr. Clay says , that Mr. Calhoun had gone over , and he left to time to disclose his motives . Mr* Calhoun retorts : " Leave it to time to disclose my motives for going over ! I , who have changed no opinion , abandoned no principle , and deserted no party-I , who have stood still and maintained my ground against every difficulty , to be told that it is left to time to disclose my motive ! The imputation sinks to the earth with the groundless charge on which it rests . I stamp it down in the dust . I pick up the dart which fell harmless at my feet . I hurl it back . What the Senator charges on me unjustly , he has actually done . He went over on a memorable occasion , and did not leave it to time to disclose his motive . " In the conception and arrangement of the whole speech , in fact , there is a remarkable similarity to the speech of the great Athenian . And where could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invective-lofty de // clamation-for all that is spirit-stirring and glorious in eloquence , there is not on record , in any language , as noble and perfect a specimen as this Oration for the Crown . " Mr. Calhoun , in the simplicity and brevity of his sentences , throughout all his speeches , shows the model he has studied . In fact his whole character and life are eminently Greek . His striking and grand conceptions-with his unassuming and plain manners-his calm dignity and composure-his sternness and exemplary purity in private and public life , all show that he has bathed deep in the fountains of antiquity . " In one faculty of the mind he surpasses any public man of the age , and that is in analysis . His power to examine a complex idea . and exhibit to you the simple ideas of which it is composed , is wonderful . Hence it is that he generalizes with such great rapidity , that ordinary minds suppose , at first , he is theoretical ; whereas he has only reached a point at a single bound , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to attain . It is a mis*-take to suppose that he jumps at his conclusions without due care and consideration . No man examines with more care , or with more intense labor , every question upon which his mind is called to act . The difference between him and others is , that he thinks constantly with little or no relaxation . Hence the restless activity and energy of his mind always place him far in advance of those around him . He has reached the summit , while they have just commenced to ascend , and can not readily discover the path which bas lead him to his lofty and extensive view . " Mr. Calhoun evidently has studied our system of government very profoundly and philosophically , on the leading ideas of the school of Jefferson . His great speech in reply to Mr. Webster , on the fede*. rative principle of the Constitution , and the sovereignty of the States , is one of the most profound and finished commentaries upon that noble instrument and its formation , that has ever been produced by the genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the points of controversy with his distinguished antagonist to such a degree , that he compelled him to deny that our system of Government was a con. *titutional compact ; and finally forced him to the position , that the Government itself had substantive and independent rights , as if the Government was not made by the Constitution , and had no existence , in a sin6le attribute , without it . This debate was managed with great power and ability on both sides . Both speakers saw that the whole argument turned upon the point whether the Constitution was a compact or not . If it was admitted , the wit of man could not avoid the conclusion , that each party to the compact must of necessity judge of its provisions and infractions , or surrender up their original character as sovereign contracting parties , to a government // with power to define its own limitations , and , of necessity , to make and unmake the compact at the xviii and pleasure of those who might chance to give it impulse and vitality . This subject eminently suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he coasoquently exhibited a power of argument-  --  a distinctness of analysisand a luminous investigation of the attributes and nature of government-which will stand a monument to his fame , as long as the American eagle shall present to the world that bright constellation of independent States which now glitte ; and blaze around its brow . No human being can read that speech without feeling that it contains the same doctrines which were proclaimed in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 98 , and in the immortal report of Mr. Madison , around which the Republican party rallied with the devotion of those who felt the liberties of their country to be involved . " As a public speaker and debater , Mr. Calhoun is energetic and impressiveto the highest degree . Without having much of the action of an orator , yet his compressed lip-his erect and stern attitudeshis iron countenance , compressed lip , and flashing eye-all make him at times eloquent in the full sense of the word . No man can hear him without feeling . His power is in clear analysis-suppressed passion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency of the present day , it is vain and idle to contend with him . It has been the subject of his daily thought for more than twenty years . He is before his age , but he will , triumph , and posterity will be astoni *hed at the profoundness and the sagacity of his views . Many suppose that he has an absorbing ambition ; but this is a mistake , and it arises from the natural activity of his mind on all questions of much interest , and his constant and ardent patriotism . Devotion to the honor and liberties of his country is his consuming passion , and his ardent pursuit of what he conceives to be her interests is mistaken by the superficial observer for overweening ambition . Ambition he has , but it is high and noble , and like the Roman 's , identified with love for Rome . his nullification , so much misunderstood and misrepresented , was with him a pure and enthusiastic devotion to the true spirit of the Constitution and the permanent interest of the whole Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if weakness it can be called , is his free and unreserved confidence in those who are not his friends . This arises from the natural iategrit* and unsuspecting character of his heart . Another weakness perhaps is , that he talks too much , forgetting that there is often dignity and power in impressive silence , particularly after a man has acquired fame . This arises , however , from the simplicity of character and great love of truth , which makes him eager to present her to others that they may receive and love her too , with veneration equal to his own "
