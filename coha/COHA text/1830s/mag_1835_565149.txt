txt Every civilized nation , except England and the United States , has its own music , as distinctly marked , as strongly characteristic , and as truly national as its literature . The Scotch , Irish and Welsh have their own wild and grand strains , in general incomprehensible to the Southern ear , yet occasionally swelling beyond their native hills in bursts of passion , or breathing notes of the deepest pathos , to which the Switzer and the Italian listen in silence and tears . The French still rejoice in the grand national airs of the young Henry , the Marseilles Hymn and the Parisienne , while their musical literature is increased by the graceful strains of Boildien and A.nber , so fitted to the exquisite pantomime of Taglioni , or by the more grand and romantic measures of their adopted Meyerbeer . What shall we say , too , of the music of Germany - deep and metaphysical as the thoughts of her sa*es and her poets ! The dreamy grandeur , the profound pathos , the rich ornament , the romantic and lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the solemn splendor of her ancient feudal castles , her vast cathedrals , and her matchless ruins . Spain , too , is not wantino : the voice of her high-souled chivalry , not unmingled with tones of Moorish gallantry , comes to us in the delicious romances with which the land is filled . Yet , from all these we turn with delight to the land of song  --  the fair , the glorious Italy . Music is national in Italy , as painting and sculpture are national - they are born there . In variety and compass , the music of Italy seems to embrace , in a degree , the music of all nations . In the wild and heart-moving tones of the Miserere , the poetry of Ossian seems to be embodied : in depth of pathos , there are passages which rival the deep sentiment of Spain and Germany , in the compositions of Donixetti , and in grace and sprightliness , Rossini hardly finds a rival in France . Why is it , then , that England has no national music ? Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her doctors , of Oxford and Cambridge , of so short a life ? The nearest approach to a national music is the Cathedral Chant - the grandeur and beauty of which , we are ready to acknowledge ; but the opera and the oratorio have never been carried to any degree of perfection in England by native composers . The great secret of a want of a national music in England , we believe to be the want of general taste in the art . It is not enough that the rich and the great should lavish their thousands upon successful performers ; that they should build their costly theatres , and import their southern singers by hundreds : the taste must be spread among the people ; it must be found in the cottage , rather than in the palace ; the peasant must sing at his labors ; the a chorus must ring in the streets ; the public singer must chant the lays of the people , if we would have a truly indigenous niusic . Now these are precisely the effects to be expected from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand object seems to be the general diffusion of musical taste and knowledge ; and though its effects must be slow in be- // Critical , JVotices. coming visible , still we have no doubt - if the plan of the fonnders be persevered in  --  the result will be , in the course of two or three generations , that we shall be essentially a musical people . In the third annual report of the academy , the objects of its foundation are recapitulated . The first and most important of these , is the general cultivation of musical taste : The Boston Academy of music is not a musical society in the common acceptation of the ter* . It is not the object of this association to promote among its members a knowledge of music , or to gratify their taste , or acquire skill in the performance of it . With these matters , as a society , we have nothing to do . The only end and aim of those who compose it , is to raise music , as a branch of education , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuse a knowledge of its principles arnon* all classes , and , as subsidiary to this end , to endeavor to remove the prejudices which impede its progress , arid to correct the abuses to which it is liable . In doing this , they use the same means which other societies adopt in advancing their objects . The only personal advantage which they expect to secure by their efforts , is to partake in the gratification which will be common to all , when the art is more justly appreciated , and more generally and successfully cultivated . ' The report goes on to state that , although the Academy consider church music the most important department of the art , their object is not bounded by any single branch , but extends to all in which instruction may be desired . They are desirous of rendering music a part of the system of popular education in the country , which we deem to be the surest way of diffusing the taste in the community at large . Another very important object of the Academy is to publish collections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point in the report are admirable : But in order that the art may produce its proper effect upon mankind , it is necessary to provide music which is of a pure character , as well as to cultivate the voice ; to select that which is suitable to be sung , as well as to sing it in a suitable manner . A correct musical taste , in its extended sense , comprises something more than an ear capable of appreciating sounds and their distinctions . Something of a more intellectual nature enters into its composition . He who desires to make any great proficiency in the art , should become in some degree a philosopher , and be able to tell , not only one sound from another , but what sounds are suited to express or arouse different states of feeling . To do this with accuracy , supposes an acquaintance with the depths of the human heart - the fountains of thought and feeling - to which the mere casual observer never attains . There must he likewise an intimate knowledge of the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflection , intonation , etc . As the eloquence of the orator consists in felicity of thought , combined with felicity of expression , so when deep emo*-tion is expressed in appropriate musical sounds , we have the eloquence of music . But if those who have excelled as orators , have found it necessary or profitable to study the productions of the masters who preceded them , it will be found equally necessary for those who would form a correct musical taste , to cultivate an assiduous acquaintance with the works of the best composers . To assist them in this object , the Academy hope to be able , from time to time , to publish collections or pieces of music in various styles , both sacred and secular . ' Much has already been accomplished by this excellent institution . The school for gratuitous instruction , open on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons , has been crowded ; between eight hundred and one thousand children , and from four hundred to five hundred adults have been enrolled in the classes ; besides which , the professors have taught large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which give abundant testimonials of the success of their efforts . A class has also been formed of teachers of music , whose qualifications will Un- // 3O* doubtedly be improved by the assistance of the Professors of the Academy ; and a most important and valuable aid has been afforded to them by the Manual ' of musical instruction , prepared by Mr. Mason . We have ourselves examined this little work , with great interest and satisfaction , and believe that it will be found to answer the ends proposed better than any work of the kind that has yet appeared but we will cite higher authority in praise of it . Mr. William Gardiner , of Leicester , England , the author of that beautiful work , the Music of Nature , ' speaks of the Manual ' in the following letter , addressed to James A. Dickson , Esq. , of Boston : Leicesler , February 26 , 1835 . My DEAR SIR ,  --  I have duly received your letter , also the parcel , for which I am truly obliged to you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Mason , and thank him for the very ingenious little book he has sent me , and the valuable collection of psalmody . It is remarkable , that in this country though we have works upon music as far back as Thomas Morley , certainly we have not a book , as yet , comparable with the Manual , printed at Boston . It is highly creditable to the new world , to set us such a pattern . IVILLIAM GARDINER . ' Under the auspices of the Academy , a choir has been formed , consisting of about one hundred members , of both sexes , who meet once a week with the professors , , for instruction and practice ; their advance is very great ; they have already giverm six oratorios , which , though unaccompanied by any other instrument than the organ , were truly delightful ; and we believe that the large audiences who have been assembled to hear them in the Bowdoin Street Church , have never listened to them but with feelings of astonishment at their proficiency , mingled with pleasure at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year , given three concerts , which have satisfied all who were skeptical , that the plan of giving general instruction in music , is entirely practicable . Many pupils in these classes read music more readily , and perform it with greater correctness and taste , than the leaders of ' choirs ; many of whom have held the highest places as performers in our churches . Lectures on the subject of music , accompanied occasionally with illustrations by the choir , have been given in Boston , Hartford , and the city of New-York , and have universally excited attention and interest , showing how much might be done , if the efforts of the Academy could be more widely extended . The influence of the Academy is already great , and is felt far beyond the precincts of its establishment . A few facts , mentioned in the report , will show this It is gratifying to the friends of music , and especially to the members of this Academy , to know that the cause which they have espoused is gaining strength in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is gradually giving way in proportion as information is disseminated . The influence which this institution is exerting at the present time upon the subject of musical education and taste is extensively felt . Their reports have been uch sought after , and read with avidity . The works which they have put forth for the promotion of the art , have met with a ready sale . Inquiries have been made respecting the mode of our operations , from various quarters . Letters have been received from persons in Georgia , South-Carolina , Virginia , Illinois , Missouri , Teilnessee , Ohio , Maryland , New-York , Connecticut , Vermont , New-Hampshire , and Maine , besides many individuals and societies in Massachusetts , asking for information relative to measures which they ought to adopt , in order to introduce music as a branch of education into the community where they live . In Portland , they have formed an academy for this purpose , which is doing considerable for that object . Mr. TIsley , // Critical . N'otices. the professor , has had under tuition during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults . In Cincinnati , another has been formed which seems to be in active operation . Mr. T. B. Mason , the professor connected with the last named institution , has several hundred children under his instruction , besides a number of adult classes , one of the latter consisting of students connected with the theological seminary in that place . The professor writes that the subject of music is rising in estimation in Cincinnati ; and the influence of that city on the western country is , as we all know , very extensive , and it is important among other things that the inhabitants should set a just value upon all branches of education . ' During the past year , an important step has been taken to ensure the success of the Academy , by providing a suitable room for meetings , to practice and for concerts and oratorios . The Federal Street Theatre ' has been leased and fitted up as a music saloon ; and we understand that Mr. Appleton , of this city , is now building a very large organ , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the interim . The building was dedicated as a place of worship , and was set apart for the objects of the Academy - which partake in a high degree of a religious character - on the fifth of August last ; and the address , which we have named at the head of our article , was delivered on the occasion by the President of the association . Before examining this performance , we wish to say a word of the author , in his connexion with the beautiful art of which he appears as the patron . With a fine taste for music , cultivated by long attention to the science , and by hearing the best performers in the old world , Mr. Eliot combines a sincere desire to promote the knowledge of the art at home . His constant and personal efforts , for many years past , to improve the music at the Stone Chapel , where he is himself the leader of the choir , have resulted in great success ; and often have we listened , with thrilling pleasure , to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious old organ . We wish that Mr. Eliot 's example might be followed in more instances than it is ; that our ladies and gentlemen would not think it a condescension to appear in the singing-galleries of our churches for the sake of praising God . But enough . If one is found who will render the great service to the community of setting a better example , he has our most hearty thanks . The address before us is written with the elegance of a scholar , the enthusiasm of an artist , and the fervor of a Christian . In discussing the just claims of music upon the attention and interest of the community , the author considers the importance of the art , in its influence upon society , as an auxiliary to education - as a means of happiness , and as exciting emotion particularly of a religious character . We forbear making extracts , because if we begin we know not where to stop . We should gladly transfer the whole to our pages . We must only entreat our readers , who feel any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we are sure they will be richly rewarded . We will not , however , deny ourselves the pleasure of making one extract : If this be so , is it any thing less than a duty we owe to ourselves and to society to watch well what kind of music is to be cultivated among us , what kinds of passion are to be excited by it , what kinds of feeling are to be stimulated by its sympathetic power ? It is for the purpose of attempting our part in the performance of this duty , that we now dedicate this ball to pure and elevating and holy harmony . No corrupting influence shall henceforth be spread from these walls ; but here shall the child be early taught the beauty and charm of exquisite art . Its own voice shall aid in the developement and expansion of the best feelings of its heart ; and // 311 love to its fellow mortal , and a holy fear of its God shall grow with its knowledge and its stature . Here shall the adult practise on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger feeling and a more cultivated understandin* to the execution of the most expressive music . Here shall the ear he feasted , and the heart warmed , and the soul raised above everything hase or impure , by the sublimity , the pathos , the delicate expression which music only can give to language . Here shall be trained those who not only feel , hut shall acquire the power of making others feel those emotions of love , gratitude , and reverence to God , and of sympathy and kindness to men which are most suitably expressed in the solemn services of the Sabbath ; and here , too , shall he sung those anthems of praise to the Most High , which , if they delight us now , will constitute and express the fullness of our joy in the more visible presence of Him whose name is excellent in all the earth .
