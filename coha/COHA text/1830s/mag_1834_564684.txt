txt TnE perfection of human virtue is the joint production of piety , benevolence , and self-love ; three great principles implanted in our nature by the author of our being . To produce the happiest results , some may supl ) ose , that each of these principles must be not only aided , but controled by the others ; that if we can not be too devout , we may love ourselves , or our fellow-creatures , too much . I am inclined , however , to think that no other restraint is required for either of these native passions , than what is imposed by genuine wisdom , by extensive and correct views of nature , and the immutable destinies , to which all creatures are subject . It is true that , from the influence of sympathy , we may give away that which may soon he indispensable to our own comfort or subsistence , or we may sacrifice , to a momentary effort of benevolence , our life , or our most efficient powers of body or mind . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager pursuit of our selfish ends , we may turn a deaf ear to the voice of wo , and trample on the vital interests of all who come in our way . What then ? Do these concessions affect the position we have taken ? Does the blind devotee of any passion , however tender , however disinterested , promote , in the most effectual manner , the happiness or comfort of others ? Is the common good secured , on any ordinary occasion , by depriving ourselVes of the power or means of benevolent exertions for months and years to come , and becoming , perhaps , dependent on others for the necessaries of life ? To save a fellow-creature from death or extreme distress , it is generous , it is noble , to assume a large share of his suffering or danger ; but enlightened benevolence , in proportion to the strength and authority , with which it reigns in our bosoms , will forbid us to go beyond our strength in those generous exertions , which // might and would be shared by others , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counterbalanced by any probable advantage . As little are the objects of enlightened self-love attained by those , who care for nobody but themselves By every indulgence of his ruling passion , the selfish man counteracts every effort he makes . To say nothing of the retribution of a future state , he gives up , at once , the richest and the most durable enjoyments of life , and subjects himself to a train of disappointments and woes , which he can neither measure nor count . He engages in perpetual warfare with earth and heaven-with all creation , not excepting himself . His conduct is no less absurd , than if he threw away his silver and gold , and endeavored to fill his coffers with bubbles ; or rejected substantial and delicious food , expecting to find a feast in chaW or a banquet in vapor . From the experience of six thousand years , we know there are cravings in human nature , which piety and benevolence alone can satisfy . As well might we hope to preserve fire without fuel , or life without breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation of benevolence and devotion . Though the semblance of prosperity and happiness may thus be attained , we know it to be a phantom , and those ; who are deceived by it , are in a piteous delusion . It is the same benevolent principle , which , according to the sphere , or the circumstances and relations , in which it acts , makes the faithful husband or wife , the kind parent , the dutiful child , the affectionate brother or sister , the disinterested friend , the generous neighbor , the undeviating patriot , and the ardent philanthropist ; and such is the harmony of these several characters , that , so far as circumstances favor , they are and must be simultaneously or successively united in the same persons . True , we may counterfeit the virtues of any station or relation and , from misapprehension , we may deviate widely from our proper course in one sphere , while we faithfully discharge our duties in another ; but still it may be laid down as a principle , that he , who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither will nor can be disinterested in any other . The selfish neighbor , for instance , must change his nature , before he can become a real patriot , or a cordial friend . The name of patriot has been claimed by many , in almost every age and country , who had no just pretensions to that name ; and not only claimed , but allowed by the infatuated or corrupt . It may farther be observed , that real patriotism has been regarded as a magnificent virtue ; as peculiar to men of genius , or the favorites of fortune . It is time that such misapprehensions were corrected ; that the nature of patriot ism were better understood , its obligations more generally felt , and its highest honors more extensively presented to the eye of virtuous ambition . What , then , is meant by a patriot ? Most certainly it is one , who loves his country , and does every thing in his proper sphere to promote her true honor , prosperity , and happiness . To deserve this name , it is seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of slaughter , to build navies or fortifications , to control senates by the power of eloquence , to labor for years in the mines of philosophy , or to invent or improve any of those arts , which are the objects of high admiration . If the definition given above be correct , all that is substan // tial in this virtue , or , in other words , all that is really essential to it , is within the reach of every man , woman , or child ; of the poor as well as the rich ; the man of plain common sense , no less than the genius or the scholar . The peasant , who gdverns with integrity and discretion the little commonwealth within the walls of his house and the enclosures of his farm ; who trains up four or five sons or daughters in habits of sobriety , intelli * ence , and active virtue ; is incomparably more entitled to the name of patriot , than most of those , who have assumed the narne ,  --  than most of those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a family , however humble in station , is generally obvious to an attentive eye ; and where it is not to he distinctly traced , there can be no reasonable doubt of its reality and importance . The same blood , which is now flowing in a finger , will , sooner or later , pervade every other part of the body , not excepting the head arid the heart , and communicate more or less of the health or disease in its own condition . Of the truth and importance of these remarks , we may find many a bright illustration in the genealogy of those , who have been most conspicuous , at once for the stations they have filled , and the benefits they have conferred on their country . in our republic , it is remarkable that many of those , who have filled the highest seats , and have been most deserving of pubLic favor , have been the immediate sons of farmers or mechanics . To understand the nature of patriotism , we must discern clearly the nature of public happiness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to the distinction of a patriot , we must inquire how far he has contributed to the real , the universal , the permanent benefit of his country ; or at least , how far he has endeavored to advance it . National happiness does not consist in a martial name . It is very questionable , at least , whether any advantage is derived from this source , any farther than it contributes to public or private safety by discouraging lawless invasion ; and there is reason to believe that martial exploits have more frequently invited , than deterred , new assailants . In a chivalrous or a warlike age , the desire of assaulting and overcoming one , who is famous for the victories he has gained , will of course add new fuel to an ambition , which is already too much inflamed . Hence the splendid warrior , as such , has no title to the name of a patriot . This depends not en the brilliancy of his victories , but on the disinterested zeal , with which he has incurred personal danger , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Nor is there any invariable connexion between public prosperity and munitions of war , the number or magnitude of armed vessels , the extent of fortifications , or the plenitude of arsenals or magazines . Every superfluity of this kind is a dead loss for the present , and may be found an oppressive tax on future ages , while it may conduce , in several other ways , c* national infirmity and suffering . Consequently , the politician , who aspires to the honor of a patriot , must found his claim on something else , than that of contributing , by the most decisive influence , to the promotion of such establishments . Nor , again , does any one merit the name of patriot by the mere acqursitmon of territory for his country , either by victorious arms , or efficient counsels . The history of the world has proved , that neither // happiness , nor power , nor wealth is likely to be commensurate with a very extensive empire ; but the reverse in each particular is more frequently the final result . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman empires . Finally , we may assert , that national happiness may be very far from corresponding to the increase of population , the accumulation of wealth , or the improvement of the arts , whether useful or ornamental . The political ecor .. zmist , therefore , who makes either of these , or all the several things , which have now been mentioned , the ultimate or the principal objects of inquiry and pursuit , . can not , without a perversion of language , be called an enlightened patriot . The best results of his professions or endeavors would be an image without substance , or the body without the spirit of his anticil ) ations . On a little reflection it must be evident ; that , in estimating the happiness or prosperity of a nation , we must inquire into the balance of all that is enjoyed , , and all that is suffered by each and every individual contained in the nation ; and the aggregate of all these computations will be the answer to our general inquiry . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nature , but they are one and the same thing . Consequently , if we would ascertain the most effectual means of promoting the welfare of a nation , we have only to inquire , what is comprised in the well-being of an individual ; we are to consider how far it is generally affected by outward circu instances and how ' far it is or may be independent of these , inseparable from personal character , from intellectual attainments and moral habits . It has been observed , that all the social virtues are in perfect harmony one with another ; that they are all animated by the same spirit of benevolence , operating in different spheres and relations . To this we may add , that all the legitimate objects of our pursuit have one and the same bearing , and that we can not take a single step toward one , which does not carry us equally fbrward toward every other . So far as we consult well for ourselves , for the ultimate promotion of our own personal happiness , we advance the happiness of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and of the world ; thus accomplishing the will of him , whom it should be our final object to please . On the other hand , while we study the good of our fellow-creatures in all the relations they bear to us , both near and remote , we can not possibly miss of the highest enjoyment , our circumstances in life will admit . If these things be true , we may consequently add , that every deviation from any of the grand purposes of life is an equal deviation from every other ; that every neglect of one involves the neglect of all ; and that even a practical mistake in judgement must have an effect on the inseparable interests of the individual , and of ' all the circles of society , in which he moves . The true patriot , then , must be a wise and good man , active and prudent , just and benevolent , and last , though not least , devout in the full import of the term . He will regard his own personal interest , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his family , and his particular friends ; and , to secure his private and domestic prosperity , he will be industrious , temperate , frugal , and discreet . He will set a value , a high value , on those outward advantages , which are regarded by others . The difference between him and other men // is , that he seeks and infallibly secures something better than money , or reputation , or power . his chief enjoyments are not those , which arise immediately and directly from his outward attainments , whether small or great . They are derived fiom the cultivation of his mind , and the exercise of his moral and religious feelings , and from the hope , if not the assurance* that , while he is doing his utmost to improve the state of things at home , he is contributing most effectually to the general good . This , he knows , will be the effect or the tendency of his example , . at least . While he devotes every interval of leisure to mental employments , he does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gratification of his own vanity ; but for the improvement of those talents , which will enable him to contribute more , in a variety of ways , to the essential benefit of his fellow-creatures . Does he engage in lucrative pursuits ? It is not for the mere purpose of becoming richer than his neighbor , nor of procuring those luxuries , which are commanded by money ; but for the far nobler end of promoting the welfare of others . To his enlightened and benevolent mind , the highest advantages he derives from his private attainments , are reflective . They are those , , which naturally and necessarily flow back to him from the society , on which they have exerted their benignant influence . By the unalterable laws of heaven , " it is more blessed to give than to receive . To unperverted nature , it is delightful to see others happy ; and especially when the spectator has reason to believe , that he has himself contributed essentially to that enjoyment . A regard to the general good , most certainly , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; in choosing our husiness , or profession . It . is not enough , that the place or employment be adapted to our natural taste , or our present inclinations . It is not enough , that it he countenanced by the*law of the land , or the general sentiment . It is not enough , that we have reasonable satisfaction of our capacity for it , , and of the personal advantages to be derived from it . A consideration far more significant than either of these , or all of them together , is , whether it will be useful to others ; whether the emoluments , we hope to enjoy , will be a gain or a loss , on the whole , to society ; whether it will render it more or less united , virtuous or happy . Nothing but necessity will induce a true patriot to receive any thing from society , for which he does not render a complete equivalent . He will not , willingly , be indebted to any man , or community , so long as he has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , the favors he de . rives from them . He will earn , by substantial merit , all the benefits of his social intercourse . Hence , he must have peculiar reasons to persuade him to enter a profession , which is already crowded with four times the number , which the public good requires ; and in which his talents are likely to be more than lost to his country . Lie will engage in no l&gt;ranch of traffic , which is evidently injurious to public or private morals , nor in any of those speculations , which consist merely in buying and selling , without contributing , in any way , to the advantage or convenience of others . From the preceding remarks , may be readily inferred , what influence the enlightened patriot will be disposed to exert on the sentiments , the habits , and the condition of society , in all its circles , from the least to the greatest . He will be an advocate of personal liberty , civil and // religious , so far as it may be reconciled with public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will labor incessantly , for the diffusion of useful information , among all classes , from the highest to the lowest . He will make it a primary object to provide for the education of the young ; and contribute all in his power to furnish the poor with the means of turning their leisure hours to a good account . lie will discountenance , in the rich as well as the poor , every kind of luxury , which has a tendency to enervate the body or the mind ; and especially that intemperance , which brutalizes every thing human . He will be opposed to those amusements , of every kind , which are not compatible with economy , with refined feelings , and with the habits of virtue . On the other hand , he will encourage the arts of every kind , so far as they are likely to contribute to substantial comfort and enjoyment , and to diversify the labors and pursuits of an industrious community , without producing unfavorable consequences . He will do every thing in his power to preserve those institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to counteract the restless spirit of innovation , which is threatening to sweep the land with the besorn of destruction . He will look on stability , as one of the best characteristics of good laws , arid good measures ; that permanence and regularity , without which no calculation can be any thing more than conjectures ; no enterprize can be safe , no labor can be sure of its reward . Nor will he limit his views , or his benevolent feelings to his native country . He will plead for uni* versal justice and generosity ; for that integrity and fair-dealing with all other nations , which might be a better defence from invasion , than the largest armies or navies . He will realize , that the influence of a free , wise , virtuous , and prosperous nation , must , from the nature of things , diffuse itself through other lands , and bring back , in return , a degree of glory and happiness , to be attained in no other way ; infinitely surpassing , in real value , all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest . Such are some of the principal traits of the genuine patriot . How much , then , has the name been misapplied ! How littha reason *ha 've we to believe in the disinterestedness of those , who volunteer their service to the people , and use all the means , they acquire in rewarding those who suppport their pretensions ! All public men , however , are not selfish impostors . All are not indifferent to the general good . All do not prefer their own aggrandizement to the essential interests of their country . Different ages , both ancient and modern , have furnished examples of those , who have been more willing to perform the labors , than to receive the emoluments or the honors of office . Moses , who had been caressed in the Egyptian court , from his infancy to his fortieth year , cheerfully relinquished all the honors and luxuries of the palace , that he might share in the extreme sufferings of his countrymen , and thus contribute to their deliverance from bondage . Aristides was an honor to human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflexible uprightness ; meekly yielding to a sentence of banishment from the ungrateful country , to which he had devoted the ardor of his affections , and the energy of his talents ; coming forth from exile to unite his exertions with those of his rival , for the defence of that country , in a season of extreme danger ; receiving the keys of the national treasury , and holding them kr years ; and , with all his frugality , // dying without property sufficient to defray the expenses of his funeral ; we are proud even of the remote kindred we may claim with him . Socrates had such a regard for those interests of his country , which he supposed to be involved in the punctual execution of its laws , that he would not avail hiinselfof an opportunity for escaping from prison while under sentence of death , to which he had been subjected by the iniquity of his judges and accusers . The history of our own nation , from its infancy to the present time , has produced among those who have been conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of real patriots , we believe , as that of any other people ; and the discerning eye may discover , in the common occupations of life , many a pure and faithful spirit , whose name is not unworthy of the same page , on which we have enrolled those of Washington , Warren , Quincy , and those , who participated most cordially in their labors and perils for the benefit of their country . Worth is every where entitled to honor . In all the varieties of outward condition , the man of plain common sense , who is too much enlightened to be deceived or cajoled hy the sophistry or falsehood of a party , and too inflexibly honest to prefer any personal advantage to the liberty and w*lfare of his country ; who discharges all his private and relative duties , without deviation or remissness ; has the grand essentials of nobility itself ; a dignity , a kind of majesty , in the presence of which the glare of office becomes dim , and mere political greatness utterly contemptible . The welfare of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free , requires a constant regard to the characters of those , whom the people endow with honor and power ; an invariahle distinction be .. tween the patriot and the party man ; between those who seek office as the means of aggrandizing themselves or their friends , and those who merely accept it in obedience to their country , and the paramount desire of promoting the general good . Those electors , who disregard this grand distinction , may possibly wish well ; but that wish must be so feeble , or so blindly exerted , that it would have been far better for their country , that they had never been born .
