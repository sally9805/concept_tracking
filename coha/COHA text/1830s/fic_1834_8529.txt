ARGUMENT . Corradino 's Palace presented nothing but extravagancies and horrors , which repelled from it all the curious , and particularly females , whom he implacably hated . War and duels were the only food of that ferocious soul . Eduardo , son of Raimondo Lopez , his enemy , was one of his victims , whom he kept shut up in a tower until he should submit and acknowledge to have been conquered . Matilde di Shabran dared to stamp the threshold of the palace , and entered it , accompanied by Aliprando , a physician and favorite of Corradino , who , on feeling the least pain was ever dejected . The Countess d ' Arco , the promised wife of Corradino , by virtue of a contract , was eager of its fulfilment . She saw Matilde , and immediately enraged by jealously , insulted and provoked her . Matilde pleased Corradino , and was well received by him . Corradino loved her passionately , and treated the Countess with contempt . The rage of the Countess knew no bounds , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish it , she bribed the gaoler and caused Eduardo to be set at liberty , in order that this crime should be attributed to Matilde . Eduardo presented himself free to Corradino , at a moment when he had obtained a victory over Raimondo 's forces , and was pursuing him in the woods to compel him to a duel . A letter from Eduardo to Matilde thanking her for his freedom , discovered to Corradino , according to the perfidions plans of the Countess , who was the suspected author . Matilde was condemned to be thrown into the river , and the poet Isidoro was charged with the execution of this order . This poet had shortly before arrived at the castle , and had been previously believed by Corradine to be a spy , then a conjurer , and the cause of his love ; he afterwards had remained for an agreeable passtime . The Poet was not hasty in the execution of his order . Eduardo , and Udolpho the gaoler , undeceived Corradino , who consequently repented , had not cause to mourn the irreparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHABRAN , Signa Cle . Fanti .
