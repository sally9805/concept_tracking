Acknowledgment Entered according to the Act of Congress , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields , Jr. , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the United States , for the Eastern District of Tennessee . PREFACE . The voluntary effusions of genius are often marked by a vigor and raciness that do not belong to more formal productions . It would be out of place here , to investigate the cause of this , which indeed is apparent on the slightest reflection . It has been our object , in this publication , to rescue from oblivion , or , at least , to embody in a form suitable for preservation , those gems of our occasional literature , which it seemed to us desirable should not be forgotten . Many of the pieces contained in these pages will be found to possess an historical interest that entitles them to a better fate than usually awaits the ephemeral channels through which their authors modestly thought fit to communicate them to the public . The great drama of human life is filled with scenes and with characters , which , though deemed too unimportant to figure in the grave pages of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never cease to command the sympathies of men , however remote in place or time . How many persons and events must be brought upon the theatre by the rude conflict of wars , that history does not , and can not preserve . Our two contests with Great Britain were as fertile in these as any of the unhappy disputes that have afflicted mankind . These form what is called the romance of history ; and when drawn by the actors themselves , are scarcely less valuable , certainly not less interesting than those affairs which have had appropriated to them the name of History . What can be more moving than to behold how the happiness of individuals and families , to preserve which is the business and end of government , is affected by the fierce collislons of masses ? Indeed , nothing serves so well to distinguish an age or a period , as pictures of private life , drawn as it is influenced by public affairs . Many of these are preserved in this volume ; and besides , here will be found several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by those to whom actors communicated the facts , with a force and animation that belong alone to the writings of participants in the scenes described . The pieces from Salathiel , tho ' fancy sketches , have nevertheless , a title to be considered as faithful historical pictures , such as a writer of vivid imagination might be supposed to conceive on beholding the canvass of a powerful painter . We have preserved many tales , several of which are of surpassing interest . That of Lafitte , the Pirate , may challenge comparison with any that this or any other country has produced . Its main incidents are believed to be facts ; and the kind of life and adventure it portrays , are by no means to be looked upon as the creations of fancy , but as consequences of the mad persecutions with which the ambition of great nations makes them afflict each other . Bands of pirates and robbers seldom make their appearance in peaceable times , but are necessarily produced by the unsettling of all the usual occupations of men , occasioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the happy union which binds Americans together as a family of brothers , our country is destined to witness fiercer depredations of this kind , than are unfolded in the pages of Mac Farlane . However dissimilar , then , the pieces may be , he who reads with an observing spirit , will suffer the vivid strokes in the picture of Lafitte , to heighten the value of the eloquent strains in favor of our Union , from the patriots whose speeches , on the late crisis in our pubic affairs , our pages contain . Such however , is the variety of our work , that it would be impossible to particularize all that it contains ; but we may be permitted to observe , that while we have endeavored to consult the prepossessions of every class of readers , we do not wish our work to be considered a vain attempt to please fastidious tastes , but as a monument that we have feebly attempted to erect to the memory of those American writers , who , though they have written little , have written that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our Miscellany should pass down the stream of time to a remote period , the historian of our Literature will acknowledge his obligations to us for the preservation of these first traces of its dawn . Main text EVERARD GRAHAM . BY WILLIS G. CLARK . " Take back the bowl  --  take back the bowl  --  Reserve it for polluted lips  --  I would not how a stainless soul , Beneath its foul and dark eclipse ! " JOHN GREENLEAP WHITTIER . There are evils in the world , upon which the eloquence of the orator , the lyre of the poet , and the deep and over-wrought touches of the pencil and the pen , have dwelt almost in vain . In their description , the wealth of language is turned into penury ;  --  the darkest dream of anguish and distress , but faintly shadows forth the stern and moving reality . The strong and emphatic language of Holy Writ ; the burning words of David and of Solomon , are almost impuissant when they are employed in painting the awful horror of infidel unbelief , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train of Protean drunkenness . They are more dire than the fabled Furies ; the abysses they open are fiercer than Cocytus or Plegathon ;  --  their grasp is more powerful than the serpents of Laocoon ;  --  the burthens which they impart are more wearisome than the stone of Sysiphus or the wheel of lxion ; and their ascendency is unbroken , until the understanding is bewildered , and the clouded eye becomes tearless ; until the heart becomes as adamant , and the spirit is goaded and restless beneath the dominions of remorse ; till the ear tingles with the adder-hisses of coward conscience , and the unnerved bosom writhes in the emotions of regret which pierce like a scorpion 's sting . Infidelity and intemperance go hand in hand . They bid the spirit of youth bow down at an unholy shrine ; and the sweetest affections , the dearest hopes and fondest visions of earth are offered up as incense to the mysterious divinity of unbelief . This is no ideal picture ; the wide world is full of the afflictions that are summoned up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunkard . The red wine brightens alluringly in the goblet ; the shadowy illusions of the sceptic come but for a litte season with a soothing unction to his mind ; but anon there steals to the one the wormwood dregs of bitter regret ; to the other the clouds which obscure the sun-shine of hope ; which spread a mournful curtain over the beautiful scenes of human existence , and create unutterable forebodings of that undiscovered country beyond the land of death . I have little hope that the tale which I am about to relate , will cause any to release the delusions which they have grasped ; but I am never without hope . I would that my pen were dipped in the empyreal fire of Heaven , that I might show the light which they reject who turn from the word of inspiration . I would I might gather upon canvass , the darkness of the midnight cloud , and the fierce lightning of the tempest ; I would form a panorama of terrors , which should shadow forth to the mad votary of Bacchus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are rushing ; which should say to them , " turn ye at my reproof , and heed not the song of the charmer , charm ye ever so wisely . " It was a stormy evening in January , 18  --  , when my friend Everard Graham and myself were seated by our comfortable grate , in the seminary of G  --  . The coal was reddening behind the bars of its prison ; and the cheerfulness of our little room was enhanced by the storm without . We had lately come up from recitations and prayers in the chapel ; and had for some time been seated in silence , each indulging in our respective thoughts .  --  The snow came pattering gently against the windows ; and by way of beguiling the time , I arose and breathed upon a pane , and wrote thereon my humble initials .  --  Without , the scene was troublous and uninviting . The wide-stretching inland was obscured by the thick wing of the wintry tempest ; the wild anthem of the night-wind was loud and dissonant ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were gathering over my mind . My thoughts went forth amidst the curtained skies of evening ; and mighty ideas of infinity and boundless space of the mystery of the air  --  the distance whence the little motes of snow had fallen ; and I was absorbed in meditation . I was roused from my reverie by the entrance of a lad bearing a letter . I stepped forward ; it was for my friend . His large hazle eye was lit up pleasantly , and a kindly smile of unwonted delight passed over his brow and cheek . He had for some days been moody and restless ;  --  and I marked his emotions of pleasure with a lively enjoyment , to which an instant before I was a stranger . " This is the most lucky moment to receive a letter that I ever experienced , " said Graham , indulging in that laugh which comes from the heart . " You see , " said he , " that it is from a woman ;  --  the prima mulieris of my affections . But I belie her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptation of the term  --  she is an angel . " I glanced at the letter as he extended it to me ,  --  and the direction was really most beautiful . The blue surface of the epistle seemed to have just passed from beneath the hands of the copperplate printer . " You see , " said Graham , " that it is beautiful ; now let me read it ; and as you are my confidant , I will show you the Alpha and the Omega of it . " He broke the seal ; it began with " Dearest Everard , " and closed with " forever your 's , Emile Barton . " " You are not entitled to further freedom , " said my friend : " now , go meditate , and let thy greedy eyes devour up her discourse ; ' or , seeing your curiosity is awakened , I will give you her picture , for you to look upon , ' as the primmer hath it . " He drew from his bosom a miniature , suspended by a golden chain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of my heart . It is the most beautiful half by far , and I dare be sworn , the most innocent . Now if you admire it , let your admiration be unspeakable ; for I shall not be at home , during the next half hour to any body . To save inquiries , however , I will say a word or two to you respecting her . She is my intended ; I first knew her at the Saratoga cotillions ;  --  her father is an Englishman ; but her mother is one of our cis-atlantic daughters of Eve . It is the long lapse of time since I have heard from the dear girl , that has given me the blues so of late . " I took the miniature ; and never shall I forget the unsullied and perfect beauty that then dawned upon me . The stainless brow was shaded with rich clusters and braids of hair , of the color of gold in shadow ; the eye was mild and blue ; but about the sweet lips , that seemed the balmy prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check , there played such a pure and sanctified smile , that the picture seemed to be instinct with the life of Heaven . I was dumb with exquisite admiration :  --  and I seemed to be surrounded by the perfect presence ef Venus . Little did I imagine , as I gazed upon that delicately moulded face , that the clouds of early sorrow would so soon overshadow the fair brow ; that the white-robed bosom would so soon yearn with the pangs of unrequited affection ; that the azure eye and matchless cheek would be dimmed and stained with tears shed in secret ;  --  that they would be deluged with the bitter waters of a bursting heart ! But let me not anticipate . Half an hour passed without a word having been spoken by either of us . The reflections which the picture had conjured up , kept me silent ; and Graham read and re-read his letter , without noticing my pleasurable reverie . At length he said  --  " well , you seem half intoxicated  --  are you dizzy with rapture ? I assure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how could you gaze on the original ? You would become an enthusiast and a worshipper at first sight , as I did . But I am too jocose for so sacred a theme ; and my pleasure is already damped by the reflection , that my spirituelic has , ere this , left America , in the packet of the 16th , for England . A vast estate has fallen to her father , there ; and be , with his whole family , have repaired from Barton Hill to Ludgate Hill , or some other hill in London . Cruel girl ! She was too affectionate to endure the emotions of a farewell , and wrote me late , in consequence . She had quoted scripture to me in her epistle ;  --  something odd for her ; but it is certainly expressive . She is not aware that I eschew the whole of that book which she holds so sacred . But we will not jar each other on that topic . I shall see her by June , in the British metropolis ! I might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain where she is not . " I returned to him the treasure he had shown me ; and if I indulged in unmingled encomium upon its pervading loveliness , I trust it was not undeserved or hypocritical . The eye of my friend glistened with gratification . " There is never a sweet without its bitter . " he said ; " often when that beloved girl and I have walked along the vernal shore of the lake which stretches along by the mansion of her father , as I gazed upon her speaking eye and sinless brow , I have thought myself utterly unworthy of her affection . She is too full of etherial purity for my guilt-stained soul . You know , what she does not , that I am a sceptic . Her ductile and elastic spirit is full of praise to God when she looks upon his works . Often has she spoke to me of the mercies of Heaven , in making us so supremely happy in our love ; and , like all her sex , her woman 's heart seems to forbode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . How many times , as we have reposed beneath the trellised vines of her father 's garden , have I pressed her to my throbbing bosom , and kissed away the tears which sensibility had drawn to her cheek ! But I am half-moralizing . It is a sombre theme , with all its delight ; and I 'll give it up for something more exhilerating . Do you love Burgundy ? " As he made this interrogation , he went to his closet , and drew forth a bottle of the material therefrom ; he cut the wax from its top , and drawing the long cork from a locum tenens which it had held while in the south of France , and while tilted upon the Atlantic , he filled a glass , and presenting it to me , filled another for himself . I refused his offer to renew my draught , and soon after retired . When I awoke in the morning , the room was full of the smoke of the lamp ; and Graham had not been in bed . The wine had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the miniature which he had laid upon the table , and it was broken . Graham was stupified with wine , and his face looked feverish and sick . The loss of his miniature was a source of deep regret ; and he lamented it as a fearful omen for the future . Three months from that morning Graham sailed for England . His education was by no means complete ; but he was the idol of an indulgent and wealthy father ; who had long favored his determination of making the tour of Europe . If I ever parted from a friend with regret , it was from Everard Graham . He had his faults ; but maugre them all , I loved him . We vowed mutual and abiding friendship , and a constant correspondence ; and as my design of visiting England was well known and approved of by my parents , I hesitated not to pledge myself to meet him in the British metropolis , as soon as my minority should have expired . Two years after , during which time I had not heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not attempt to describe my feelings as our majestic vessel glided up the Thames . It was a beautiful day in September , when I first saw at a distance the great cloud of smoke which overhung the British capital . Oddly enough , the weather was clear ; and the yellow sun lit up the countless sails that were passing to and fro , with singular beauty . In a short space , I found myself in Picket street , in the neighborhood of Waterloo Bridge and Temple Bar ; anon , I was mingling with the restless crowd that moved along Fleet street , to Ludgate Hill . I soon saw St. Paul 's  --  that mighty edifice , whose towering dome looks down upon the riches and poverty  --  the happiness and misery of nearly two millions of immortal souls . I pass over the pleasure and newness of enjoyment , with which I looked upon the wonders of London , after my letters of introduction had been delivered , and my check had been honored by my banker . It was to me a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regent street Quadrant , and when I walked Great Russell street to Drury Lane Theatre . The inquiries I had made among my friends for Graham , however , had all proved ineffectual . He had brought introductory letters to some of them , and was known as a lounger at the New England Coffee house , previous to his leaving London for the continent . I was one day returning to my hotel , after a visit to the famous Abbey of Westminster , when the thought struck me that I would return on the river . I accordingly chartered a small boat near Westminster stairs , requesting to be " set down " at Waterloo Bridge . Through the dulness of my gondolier , who seemed a half-intoxicated , song-singing varlet , I was taken even past Blackfriars , and left at the foot of an obscure lane , leading into Thames street , whose lamps , already lighted , were twinkling in the distance . The first large and heavy drops of an approaching thunder shower excited me to haste ; and the vivid flashes of lightning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurs to prick the sides of my intent . " I hurried on ; but the storm had already burst above me ; and in a moment of hesitation , I paused and knocked at the low door of an obscure and dingy dwelling , whence the only light issued that I had witnessed , since I left my tuneful Arion of the Thames . It was opened by a bloated , fierce looking female , who , in a gruff voice , asked me what I wanted ? A loud peal of thunder drowned my reply . I pointed without ; and the action seemed to content her . She marshalled me into a low back room , requesting me to step lightly as I entered . I followed her on tip-toe , and seated myself on a broken bench , by the dying embers of a flickering fire . The apartment presented a cheerless picture of poverty and desolation . One or two mutilated chairs stood near a scantily furnished table in the centre of the room . In one corner , on a low mat , lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I drew near , and as the woman re-entered with a lamp , I was struck with astonishment . The face was pale , but interesting ; the eye-lids were of a dark purple , and the cheek hollow . Pressing his lips as if to nerve him to some imaginary conflict , he opened his eyes full upon me , as the light shone over his lowly pallet . Never shall I forget that look ! The blood rushed rapidly to his high forehead  --  it retreated again to his heart , and left him deadly pale . He reached forth his hand , and in faltering accents , pronounced my name . I looked for a moment in doubtful recognition ; it was but for a moment : he pronounced the name of Everard Graham . My head grew dizzy  --  my sight failed me , and I was insensible . When I recovered , my once high-souled and honorable friend was a lifeless corpse before me . The struggle had been too powerful for him to endure , and life had ceased in its mighty influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had taken shelter ; and learned that he had for the past two months , been an inmate of her miserable dwelling . His last half crown had been paid her the day before ; and there remained no effects to compensate her for her attentions , if he had lived longer . There was only a packet in his hat , she said ; and that she had made him a solemn promise to take to the London Post Office . She took down the hat , and handed me the packet . It was sealed with black , and bore my direction , with a line to the overseer of the London Post Office , requesting it to be sent to America . Finding my efforts ineffectual to persuade the woman that the packet bore my name , I purchased it from her at the price of a guinea ; and leaving her a sufficient sum to defray the funeral obsequies of Graham , and promising to call early the next day , I departed on the cessation of the storm . On reaching my hotel , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sofa , I opened the packet and devoured its contents . It was smoky and mutilated ; but I overcame the interlineations , and read as follows : Letter - October , 18  --  . " To you , my dearly-cherished friend , now that all hope of seeing you has passed away forever , may I now confide the secrets of the last two years of my awful life . I shudder to look back upon them , but there is no alternative . If this faintly-written record should ever reach you , let it be to you the beacon of a mighty warning . I am dying in a foreign land , surrounded by many to whom I might apply for relief , were I not a midnight murderer , shunning the day , and an irreclaimable sot . The weight of my crimes has recoiled back upon my heart , with a keen and undying retribution . I have sown the winds of intemperance and unbelief  --  I am reaping the whirlwinds of unutterable monition . The fires of agonizing remorse are burning in my blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my ears , and I experience the enkindled pangs of a mental hell . Oh , God ! with what direful punishment have my iniquities overwhelmed me ! But I must on . You know the secret of my early love . You know the embarkation of Emile Barton for England , and that I followed her soon . Oh , that I could describe to you the Eden of happiness that dawned upon me the first summer I spent in England . We were married ; and time went by with his wings glittering in the pearls of hope , and his brow clothed in sunshine . We made a delightful tour on the continent , and refurned with joyful hearts to our metropolitan home ; and a lovely daughter was at last the pledge of our affection . But in an evil hour , I surrendered myself to the demon of drunkenness , and he bound my bosom in fetters of iron . I became the frequenter of the hell 's in St. James ' ; a tippler of Johnson 's spirits , at the Surry Theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patrimony , and the splendid estate of my kind Emile , in one short week , at the gaming-table . I reviled the Scriptures in her presence ; I neglected our darling child :  --  in short , I became a madman . I returned home one night , and found the bailiffs at my threshold . Our mansion in town was sold , and we rented a pleasant cottoge in Hampstead . Here , if I had not been more remorseless than the grave , I should have paused upon my dark career . But I was too much depraved . I became more and more estranged from the angel of my youth ; I repulsed her overflowing affection , and saw her fading away under the influence of my cruelty . She had renounced fashionable life for my sake , and it had been our intention to return to America , whither her parents had already gone expecting us soon to follow . Let me be brief . As I opened , one moonlit evening , the little gate that led up to our Hamstead residence , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man apparently weeping . A hellish suspicion that she had dishonored me , rushed upon my brain ; and stealthily approaching , I drew a stiletto from my bosom and stabbed her to the heart . She turned and fixed upon me a look of alternate surprise , reproach , and forgiveness  --  shrieked , and fell lifeless at my feet .  --  It was her brother . I can not long proceed . Since that fatal hour , I have been scorched with the lightnings of reproachful thought , I have been a scathed and skulking fugitive in the house of a miserable fish-woman . I have quaffed deeply of the delicious cup of intoxication ; I have found its dregs to be gall and worm-wood . My health is wasted  --  my hopes are dead :  --  and the earth seems yawning to clasp me to its icy bosom . Would that I were dead ! Would to God , that I could find that annihilation in which I once believed , but for which I have long ceased to hope ! Twice have I swallowed poison ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bids me live and suffer . My wife is buried in a quiet church-yard at Hamstead ; and my weakness has at last prevented me from indulging the mournful office of weeping at midnight over her peaceful grave . My child still lives ; and is the fair and sunny image of her sainted mother . If she ever visits America , and this should reach you , do not  --  oh ! do not acquaint her with the unhappy fate of her parents ; of that father who was a wretch ,  --  of that spotless mother who loved me not wisely , but too well . ' I can  --  " * * * Section Here the Mss. ended . I give it to the reader as I received it . The next day the remains of Graham were interred in the Potter 's Field of one of the Alms-houses in Kingsland road .
