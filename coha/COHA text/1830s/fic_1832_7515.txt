Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : Reflections of a Belle .  --  from Reflections of a Belle ( 1832 ) N. E. Weekly Review . I 'm weary of the crowded ball ; I 'm weary of the mirth , Which never lifts itself above the grosser things of earth ; I 'm weary of the flatterer 's tone : its music is no more , And eye and lip may answer not its meaning as before ; I 'm weary of the heartless throng  --  of being deemed as one , Whose spirit kindles only in the blaze of fashion 's sun . I speak in very bitterness , for I have deeply felt The mockery of the hollow shrine at which my spirit knelt ; Mine is the requiem of years , in reckless folly passed , The wail above departed hopes , on a frail venture cast , The vain regret , that steals above the wreck of squandered hours , Like the sighing of the autumn wind above the faded flowers . Oh ! it is worse than mockery to list the flatterer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek must blush to own ,  --  To hear the red lip whispered of , and the flowing curl and eye Made constant themes of eulogy , extravagant and high ,  --  And the charm of person worshipped , in a homage offered not To the perfect charm of virtue , and the majesty of thought . Away ! I will not fetter thus the spirit God hath given , Nor stoop the pinion back to earth that beareth up to heaven ; I will not bow a tameless heart to fashion 's iron rule , Nor welcome , with a smile , alike the gifted and the fool : No  --  let the throng pass coldly on ; a treasured few may find The charm of person doubly dear beneath the light of mind
