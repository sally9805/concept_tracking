txt The leaf that II now extract from the journal of my many wanderings and adventures , contains a brief , but to my memory , which recalls the parties of it in all the bright freshness of an occurrence of yesterday , deeply interesting story of a SPANISH DAUGHTER . On a splendid summer evening , in the year 1810 , I was floating gently , in a gallant ship , by the fair town , and fairer adjacent coast of Rio de Janeiro . Severe weather had forced us in closer to the shore than our proper course would have carried us , and we found ourselves almost in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro . The looks turned towards the beautiful shore , full of that intense insatiable longing , which baffles all description , and which none but the tenants of a ship 's cabin for weary months can feel , had , however , no effect on our captain ; who , intent only on the object of his voyage , did not drop his anchor even for an hour 's ramble through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we ourselves glided by them on our southward way . A breeze so faint and light , that it scarcely rippled the glassy surface of the water , played // fitfully about our loose hanging sails . The sun was just sinking over the land on our right , amid a splendor of which the inhabitant of the clime in which I now write , can not form an adequate conception ; and a fantastic company of clouds hovered , as if exultingly , over the setting of the great luminary , from whose departing rays they derived the light in which they robed themselves so gloriously. rji he rays glanced brightly on the white villas , embosomed amid verdure of the richest green , as if singling them out , along the line of that lovely shore scenery , as the most lovely spots on which their last light should rest ; and our imagination did not fail to invest them with a thousand associations , that seemed to cluster naturally around those beautiful dwellings ; and strangers as we were , from far lands , speeding on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies and kindly sympathies entered those fair homes of human hearts and human affections , and lingered pleasantly about them . Our attention , was , however , before the deepening shades veiled them from our sight , withdrawn from the shore , to an object of sti ! l greater interest to us . A small white sail was seen standing out towards us , gleaming brightly over the now darkening water . It had evidently caught the fresh land breeze , which had not yet reached us , and almost as soon as the latter began to fill our flapping sails , a graceful , swift , little felucca , had approached within hail of us , and asked where we were bound . On answering " the Rio de la Plata , " a tall , and fine looking young Spaniard arose from the bows of the little vessel , and politely requested a passage from us ; which was on the instant granted with unaffected pleasure . He sprang with graceful ease up the sides of our ship , and received a most cordial welcome ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially so open and handsome a face , and musical a voice , as those of our young guest , other than deeply interesting to those who have been many weeks at sea , in the monotony only broken by an insipid calm , or what our mate called a " Neptunes tea-party , " of both of which we had had our full share . Nor had we yet done with those rough visitations of the god ; for , ere we entered the broad mouth of the River of Plate , our once trim and stately vessel was almost a wreck , and our new companion a special favorite ; for his manly courage during our distresses and dangers , had won him the kindest regard of us all , *nd the warm friendship of the gallant man who commanded our vessel ; and when our anchor had moored us safely off the town of Monte Video , and our feet trod together the welcome pier , we all felt that two short weeks had done the work of years , to attach us to the noble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us little or nothing about himself ; and , strong as was our curiosity , we had not of course , attempted to penetrate an incognito , which our guest did not volunteer to reveal , so that we knew him only by name ; his fine education , and high-bred manners attested him a gentleman ; and the mantling blood that would suffuse his dark // Scenes and Stories of*Many Lands-No .

October , but clear forehead , when any of the tales , with which we sought to wile the tedium of our voyage , appealed to the nobler sympatbies , told from how generous a heart it mounted , and spoke the high toned soul of one of nature 's aristocracy , prompt to feel , and act nobly . In none of the European races , have I met with nobler specimens of humanity , than are frequent among the Spaniards . Our adieus were warm and cordial , though we expected to meet again , as he was going to pass some time in the town . When fellowvoyagers separate , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we felt it so . We were conducted to the place where our papers were examined by the master of the port who was gravely sucking through a silver tube , a beverage called Matti , from a long necked , small vessel of the same material ,  --  a general custom of that country , and considered a luxury . My husband 's letters were then forwarded to Don Juan Ferrer ; who soon was with us , and insisted upon our making his house our home , during our stay in Monte Video . lie was one of the wealthiest merchants of the place , with a princely spirit , and a warm and kind nature . Early in life , his domestic peace had been destroyed ; and he never afterward admitted a female resident in his family . His splendid establishment was supported , however , with all hospitality and elegance , and a lavish magnificence , that I have never seen surpassed ; and all who have had the good fortune to share it , must have a warm place in their hearts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only  --  a daughter ; who resided with a relation of amiable manners , by whom her education ( if I may so call it ) was superintended  --  but her father also devoted a portion of every day to her instruction , and her naturally fine intellect was , therefore , more highly improved than was generally the case with the ladies of that country . She lacked none of the fascinating graces of a high bred Spanish woman ; nor was she free from the coquetry that they so well know how to practice . She was of the highest order of Spanish beauty , and seemed a combination of the grave and gay  --  the truly feminine , with touches of a lofty and high souled character ; at one moment you would see her playing with almost infantine artlessness with a little pet negro child , a privileged visitant in any apartment that she might occupy , laughing as from a heart where care never entered-that jocund , thrilling laugh , that the soul rejoices inwhich speaks of innocence , of birth , of love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the world has tutored it , changes its cadences sadly ; at another moment striking the gay castanet to her own graceful movements , in that most beautiful of all dances , the bolera , and with languishing dignity holding her admiring partner in durance ,  - -  then with the witching fan , luring some sighing victim  --  or with an arch eye beaming mischief from beneath the closely drawn mantilla , which folded over a bust of exquisitely rounded loveliness ; but never was she half so attractive , as when seated listening to the conversation of her father , whose chivalrous character prompted to language of high // 331 deeds and stirring enterprise , her full eye dilating with enthusiasmher dimpling month firmly closed-her form raised to its utmost height , and her bosom swelling with the noble emotion which such language would excite . Dona Maria was a coquette , and a most lovely one ; but she had the full materi&amp;l for a heroine , if circumstances should try her . She was a constant guest , and the brighest ornament of the gay tertnhas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , very shortly after our arrival at Monte Video , at one of these charming parties , she had fled from the admiring throng that usually hovered round her presence , to listen in a retired corner of the rooms , to one of the tales of the ancient chivalry , that the old Castilian , her father , delighted to relate having found me a willing listener , when a light but firm touch on a guitar soundcd in the adjacent room . This was a very common sound , but I observed it to produce a very uncommon effect on the young beauty ; it sent the warm current mantling to her glowing cheek , and the tell-tale fan snapped more loudly , and glittered more rapidly , from the evident confusion which it was intended to hide . Presently a firm manly voice rose on our ears , singing one of the old Spanish ballads of the days of Spain 's knightly pride . This also aroused her father , Don Juan , and he led his daughter towards the group collected around the singer , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I recognised our gallant young friend of the felucca , whom I had not seen since we parted on the pier . When he had concluded the song , after a very friendly greeting interchanged with us , and a few words denoting a frank intimacy with Don Juan . the handsome young cavalier , with a look of entreaty that could not take a nay , and was seldom likely to experience one , took the hand of the Dona Maria , and led her forth to the middle of the floor ; and in another instant was heard the musical clicking of the castanets , and the firm placed step , that commenced that most beautiful of dances , the Spanish holera . I was well pleased to read the hearts of our two young favorites , a pair so noble , so fair , and so worthy of each other ; they spoke in their sunny eyes , and gave a language to every graceful motion . It is not , however , to be supposed , that the young Dona wholly forgot her double nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him , her chief employment , in his company , was to tantalize poor Don Francisco . Smiles and tears , sighs and frowns , were at all times equally at her comrnaad : and she would dispense them to him with the most promiscuous liberality , until she would entangle the heart of the fine gallant fellow in a perfect bewilderment of feelings , half rapture , half torture , and all love . He knew , however , that he possessed the heart of his mistress ; - they were , in fact , hetrothed ; but even that knowledge , however , he would strive to fortify himself with it , could never avail to protect him long from the artful power to torment , of a true Spanish girl ,  --  especially // such a one as Dona Maria . They were betrothed , though he was not a resident of Monte Video , and were to be wedded in a short time . More than a month passed delightfully in this gay and happy circle ; and the permitted time of our stay among our kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change came over the character of the place . A deep political agitation began to pervade the community . The news arrived of the imprisonment of the King of Spain , by Bonaparte . The revolutionary elements which were rife throughout all the Spanish colonies in South America , but in none more than in this quarter , began to stir deeply and strongly . The gaiety of the society almost ceased : it was blighted by general suspicion ,  --  darkened by the shadows of coming events . There were collections of knots of men in the streets ; fresh rumors of all kinds kept up a continual excitement ; the authorities were very vigilant ; the military force at Monte Video was increased ; houses were searched ; daily arrests filled the prisons ; and in several cases they were followed by prompt executions , in the hope of paralyzing with terror the efforts of the revolutionary spirits that were known to be actively at work throughout all orders of society . There is not , or was not at that day , any Almeida at Monte Video ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so agreeable in the climate , and so delightful to the Spanish Senoras , after the refreshing siesta has removed the languor of a listless morning , when the artful mantilla is witchingly adjusted , with the never failing fan ready to perform its graceful office of flirtation , and when tiny feet are encased in the most delicate satin slippers , to touch , with seemingly fairy lightness , the path beneath them . Other walks , therefore , were frequently resorted to , or excursions to short distances in the country , where many of the gentlemen of the town had beautiful country seats , with fine gardens , enclosed either by hedges of the defensive prickly pear , or fences formed of the whitened sculls of cattle , the horns of the lowest tier being securely fastened in the ground , and the other tiers being closely adjusted together , fastened by means of the curved horns , so as to form a perfectly strong and impenetrable wall , the horns of the uppermost tier pointing upwards . These fences afford a useful means of disposing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild cattle that are brought in here to be slaughtered for their hides . They are chiefly designed to keep off the herds which roam at will , over this level and rich country . We had returned one evening from a delightful excursion of this kind , in which Don Francisco had entertained us by an exhibition of his skill in throwing the lasso , chasing , on a wild horse , the wild herds of cattle , and entangling , with unerring certainty , in the noose of the lasso , any particular animal pointed out to him . lie had been amply rewarded for his daring and dexterity with the enthusiastic vivas of the whole company , and the unclouded smiles of the Signorita Maria . We returned in high spirits and merriment . Don Juan was not , accidentally , // of the party . We proceeded almost immediately to the Senora Maturana 's tertzdia , and a general flush of gaiety and excitement pervaded the whole party , which had scarcely been known of late . We had not been long there , when a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settee at which Dona Maria was seated in earnest conversation with her lover . The latter was disclosing to her , in a low whispering , the particulars of a republican conspiracy that was to explode on the morrow , of which himself and her father were the prominent chiefs , to prepare her for the tumult that was to succeed the smooth gayety of the evening . He knew her well , and he paid but a just tribute to her high energy and bravery of character in not fearing to entrust to her the secret which he would have striven to conceal from a woman of humbler mould . Every preparation was complete ; success was certain there was no fear of treachery . His countenance was lit up with a noble enthusiasm of patriotism and daring . Dona Maria sat fixed as a statue , that varying and animated countenance no longer pourtraying the fitful caprices of the coquette , but strongly marked by a decided and resolved expression , combined with a congenial enthusiasm caught from the pleasing eye of her lover . If her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her lips were bloodless , there was no quivering of fear , and no word of womanly terror fell from them . The stranger , a man of fine bearing , advanced as if to lead her to the dance , when , striking his castanets so loudly as to cover the sound of his voice , he addressed them in low and rapid words : " Dona Maria , command yourselg as a Castilian should . Give no sign of hearing any thing that should excite surprise or alarm . Your father is in prison ; a false friend , has betrayed him . There has heen foul treachery , " he repeated , fastening a keen glance on Don Francisco . A livid paleness for a moment crossed the brow and cheek of the latter : " Ha ! who was the traitor ? " he exclaimed . " I know not , " replied the stranger : " you also are suspected ; hostile eyes are upon you now ; the evidence of only a word , a look , a gesture , is required to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beware . Do not distrust me ; though a stranger , I am a friend . " With these words , he sauntered away , with apparent carelessness , and , after making the circuit of the rooms , addressing light gallantries to various ladies of his acquaintance , he disappeared , unobserved by any . The emotions of Dona Maria I need not attempt to describe . It is sufficient to say that she mastered all outward display of them . She went through the forms of the dance almost mechanically ; and , as soon as she could , without attracting the notice which it was her object to avoid , she hastened to depart , leaning , almost in a state of exhaustion , on the arm of her lover . The stranger who had addressed them was an enemy and spy . Don Juan had been arrested , but only on vague , suspicion . His object was to extort from Don Francisco 's first emotio*ns some exclamation which // might be evidence against both . His success has been seen . As Don Francisco crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arrested by a file of soldiers . The Dona Maria was borne home by her attendants , a seemingly lifeless burthen-her energy of mind , high and heroic as it was , having overstrained itself in the attempt to bear up against this double-stunning blow . These arrests prevented the explosion of the conspiracy on the following day . An attempt was made by the authorities to envelope the affair in mystery , though the disappearance of a person of such note as Don Yuan created a great excitement in the town . His house was closed and sealed , his property seized ; and both prisoners were kept in close confinement . Dona Maria was bestowed , with a faithful old attendant , who had been her nurse , in a neighboring convent . She had , however , assoon as the first overwhelming effect of such a dreadful calamity was over , formed a plan for herself . She began immediately to project the escape of her father arid lover . The only son of Margarita , her nurse , was an attendant in the prison in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers to engage in the project which she formed . An assistant being rendered necessary by the late great increase in the numbers of prisoners , to perform various subordinate offices in the prison , and chiefly to serve the prisoners with their food , he was able , by his earnest recommendations , to procure the appointment for a young cousin of his , an intelligent and willing lad , though rather femigine in appearance , and as yet unaccustomed to rough work . Margarita , knowing the energies of her young mistress ' character , coincided fully in the plan ; and , notwithstanding the attempts of the superior of the convent ( a relative and friend of Maria ) to dissuade her from so rash an enterprise , the lovely young Senorita presented herself at the prison , in so complete a disguise , as effectually to conceal her identity even from the most familiar eye . Her bold , frank manner pleased the keeperher remarkable beauty of feature , for a boy , pleased the keeper 's wife ; and she was forthwith installed in the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably . Her natural boldness of character , and love of enterprize , added to the high motives which prompted her course , enabled her to do so with a firmness of heart that buoyed her spirits up for the task ; and the Dona Maria , the beautiful mistress of a thousand hearts , the nursling of luxury and indulgent affection , cast no repining thoughts upon her former happiness , nor ever shrank from the performance of her hard tasks ; and , like all exalted minds , she bore the chain nobly when duty formed its links . Hers was not the puling sentiment which laments , but the genuine , heaven-born enthusiasm which dares , and acts . Perhaps it may be necessary for me to re-assure the reader that I am relating nothing but simple fact . Pepe , Margarita 's son , had n*ot , from his office , any means of commu // nication with the prisoners . The object of her entrance into the jail was , of course , to communicate with them , and arrange some means of escape , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , time , no such opportunity was afforded her . She was not trusted to carry food to the more important state prisoners , who were served by the jailer himself Poor Maria began almost to despair . At length , however , her good conduct was rewarded with such confidence , that the jailer , in his indolence , gave her the task of serving all the ranges of cells . On her first visit to her father , she was accompanied by the jailer . She was evidently not recognized by him , in the darkness of his cell , and in her disguise . With Don Francisco , she was equally fortunate ; he scarcely turned a look towards her , but sat with his eyes fixed on the ground , in a fierce gloom , with despair at his heart , at the thought of her , the very being who stood , trembling with mingled de* light and fear , before him . I need not dwell on what followed ; the success with which she discovered herself to both successively ; the rapture which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dark , and before hopeless , dungeons ; her own exultation ; the plan of escape arranged , in which no flaw appeared to dim the brightness of her hope and confidence . All was complete , and there could be no doubt of success ; it was on board of our gallant vessel that they were to be secretly received , to be borne immediately away to safety and happiness . A night was fixed for the escape . The two prisoners had in the mean time been tried ; but very unsatisfactory evidence was all that could be adduced against them . There was manifestly a strong disposition , on the part of the authorities , to make terrifying examples of them , but no sentence was pronounced upon them at the time of the trial . It was generally believed that they would not he condemned to death . The intense emotions of Dona Maria , as she rose , from a sleepless pallet , on the morning of the day that was to be the last of their imprisonment , immured from the light of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe . There was a buoyancy in her step , a brilliancy in her eye , and a flush on her cheek , that had never been there since the fatal night of the arrest . On her presenting herself at the usual hour , to receive from the jailer the keys of the cells , and the breakfast for the prisoners , she was ordered to omit the two cells in which the whole interest and her heart was concentrated ; and , in explanation of her anxious astonishment , he showed her a warrant from the Governor , and President of the Court , just received , ordering that the two prisoners be led out to the public square in front of the prison , immediately , for execution . " Behold the soldiers drawn out , " continued he , looking out upon the square , without observing the boy , " with one file drawn for the execuVOL . VI . NO. xXU. - OOT. 1839 . W // tion . This is much less troublesome than hanging ; an.d they are gentlemen , though they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood stunned . Her cheeks were bloodless , her lips parted with a certain ghostly smile , and there was a fearful wildness in her eye , which was fixed on the square beneath . The keeper told us of the scene . Who can imagine that moment ? She saw , but heeding the sight only as the sight of spectral monsters is felt in dreams , advancing across the square , bearing a tall black cross aloft in his right hand . He entered the prison , and passed into the cells of the prisoners , in each of which he remained a brief space . They were then led forth to the small court-yard , into which the gate of the prisons , in front of which they were to be shot , opened . rrhe countenances of both were deadly pale , hut with a firm and lofty expression As they met and grasped each other by the hand , a tear rose to the eye of Don Juan ; Francisco understood to whom it referred , and their hands pressed each other with a clasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fearless and haughty port , combined , , however , suitably with solemn resignation . Maria remained motionless in the spot in which she had received the awful announcement . The horror of the pretended boy was ascribed by the jailer to his youth ; but he told her she might stay , and see the execution from the window . She , without consciousness , obeyed , and stood rooted to the spot , until the heavy sound of the bell of an adjoining church struck upon her ear . Frantic , she rushed forth to seek the cells ; her way led her through the court-yard . She saw , ct one intense glance , the whole scene ; the procession forming ; a number of priests , with the priest with the black cross at the head ; the guard of soldiers ; the attendants of the jail ; and , in the midst of the group , the noble figures about whom all this preparation centered . One thrilling shriek , piercing to the brain of every hearer , and curdling the blood at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priests and soldiers , and , passing by the figure of Don Francisco , her lover , Maria was in the arms of her father . The sight was immediately understood by all . One heaving gasp , a convulsive throe , and blood was seen to gush profusely from her mouth , nostrils and ears ; her father 's bosom , on which she lay , already bared for the purpose for which he was led forth , was covered with the crimson tide , and several of the by-standers were stained with the blood . She was laid on the ground . Father and betrothed lover knelt over her . " Gracias a Dios ! " exclaimed the former , repeatedly . " Thank God ! thank God ! I am npw happy . " Poor Francisco spoke not , but knelt in a long , uninterrupted gaze upon that exquisite loveliness . There was no tear in his eye , though they streamed from those of the old man upon his daughter 's face . he little more than a minute , she was dead-suffocated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the crimson dye , as if or a mark for the bullets , and then raised it aloft , apparently in a silent Imprecation . He then sprang to his feet , and demanded , almost fiercely , to be led out . In five minutes , those two gallant and noble souls had followed that of her who was the object of 4ieir equal , mutual love . Vctims of treachery and suspicious tyranny , they died like brave men . Both fell dead at the first fire . From no great distance , I witnessed their fall , with a shuddering , but fascinated gaze , that I could not avert from the sight . The three were buried together in one wide grave , Maria lying in  --  the middle . Peace to them ; and gentle and tender memories , in the hearts of all who knew them and their sad story , linger around that grave ! On the following day , we left Monte Video , perfectly wretched , and *ick at heart . I have never seen it since ; and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which some of the brightest hears of my 4ife were passed , without a*sinking at the heart , at the remembrance of The fate of that fine old Castilian , Don Juan , and that noble and beautiful young pair , Don Francisco and the Senorita Maria.
