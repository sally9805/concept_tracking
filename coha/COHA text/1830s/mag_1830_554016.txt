txt BoTH the poetry and the prose of Mr Dana stand conspicuous for their beauty , amidst the various and growing , though still youthful , and rather crude literature of our country . He has gained the respect of that class of readers which he himself would most wish to attract , and he has risen above the censures of those who once altogether condemned him on account of his occasional peculiarities and waywardness of taste and style ; so that he is now sure of a favorable and very general attention , whenever he sees fit to request it , which is not so often as we could desire . If we should say that we were pleased with the poem now before us , w* should express but weakly and unworthily the // feelings with which some of its passages inspired us ; if we should say that we were satisfied with it , we should say too much consistently with the exceptions we have taken to what we have considered its faults . Its subject is , Thoughts on the Soul ; and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illustration of the fact , that the soul transfers its features , and lends its complexion , to all external things . The subject is thus announced in the commencement of the poem . It is the Soul 's prerogative , its fate , To change all outward things to its own state ; If right itself , then , all without is well If wrong , it makes of all around a hell . So multiplies the Soul its joy or pain , Gives out itself , itself takes back again . Transformed by thee , the world hath but one face. - Look there , my Soul ! there thine own features trace ! And all through time , and down eternity , Where'er thou goest , that face shall look on thee . ' p. 3 . This idea , so poetical and so true , is explained and enforced with great power and beauty as the poem l ) roceeds . There is an abruptness , however , in the manner of introducing some of the thoughts and illustrations , which is of serious injury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it requires a second reading to remove . We seem to he presented with several detached fragments , having a general relation to each other , rather than with a succession of regular steps which lead us on from a beginning to an end . The pearls do not appear to be strung . Doubtless there is a connexion , but our complaint is , that it is not sufficiently distinct and manifest . We could not help thinking , too , as we perused the poem , that some of its most delightful passages were hurt by feeble or colloquial turns of expression , which seemed to our taste to be quite foreign and adverse to the style and spirit and pur .. pose of the position which they occupy . After saying this , we are bound to produce examples of what we mean . Near the commencement of the poem , the speaker asserts that it is in vain to think of discovering and counting all the emotions of the soul , when we find it impossible to master the knowledge of the external world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and land , the living clouds that run Above , or stand before the setting sun , Taking and giving glory in his light , Live in a change too subtile for thy sight . The lot of human kind s more varied still By ceaseless acts of sense , and mind , and will . Yet could'st thou count up all material things , All outward difference each condition brings , Perhaps thou'd'st say , " Good Sir , lo , here , the whole ! " - The whole ? - One thing thou hast forgot-THE SOUL ! ' p.5 . Without presuming to make our own taste a standard for others , it strikes us that the two last lines are a blot on the rest of the paragraph . The little dialogue which is carried on , and the Good Sir , ' which commences it so politely , sound to our ears very much out of tune with the grave and somewhat majestic music of the preceding lines Another instance of the same kind of defect , as it appears to us to be , occurs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , that the world without is a reflection of the world within us , the following comparison is introduced . Yes , man reduplicates himself . You see , In yonder lake , reflected rock and tree . Each leaf at rest , or quivering in the air , Now rests , now stirs as if a breeze were there Sweeping the crystal depths . How perfect all ! And see those slender top-boughs rise and fall ; The double strips of silvery sand unite Above , below , each grain distinct and bright . - Thou bird , that seek'st thy food upon that bough , Peck not alone ; that bird below , as thou , Is busy after food , and happy , too . - They re gone ! Both , pleased , away together flew . ' pp. 5 , 6 . In our view , the beauty of the above comparison is marred , if not destroyed , by the abrupt change which is made from the style of description to that of address . The call upon the bird not to peck alone , sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupts the continuity of the comparison , and leads our attention away from the subject which it was intended to illustrate . Our thoughts are diverted from the soul , and fixed upon that bird and its image in the water ; and after we have been finally informed , in the narrative manner , to which the // 277 poet returns , that both flew away , pleased , together , we are somewhat surprised at finding ourselves with the soul again in the next verse . In short , the whole comparison is made too prominent and too independent . Every reader must feel that it is . But there is more than excellence enough in the poem to redeem greater defects than those we have noticed . And it is not merely poetical excellence ; not merely harmony of numbers , just selection of words , and vividness of imagination ; it is something better and brighter superadded to these ; it is the excellence of truth , of purity , of moral elevation and moral purpose . The poet 's thoughts on the soul are evidently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out warmly from his own heart . There is a serious and earnest individuality about Mr Dana 's muse , which forbids the suspicion , that she can be playing a part , or that she is in any degree otherwise than what she seems . The love which she demands is respectful love , the homage which is rendered to the beauty of holiness . We should be unjust to this poem , should we select no other portions from it than those which have already been given . There is a simple majesty , a gentle , persuasive authority in the following sentences , the effect of which is delightful , and so permanent , that it can not be diminished by repetition . Comc , listen to His voice who died to save Lost man , and raise him from his moral grave ; From darkness showed a path of light to heaven ; Cried , " Rise and walk ; thy sins are all forgiven . " Blest are the pure in heart . Would'st thou be blest ' ? He 11 cleanse thy spotted soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 11 breathe a calm , And to thy wounded spirit lay a balm , From fear draw love ; and teach thee where to seek Lost strength and grandeur-with the bowed and meek . Come lowly ; He will help thee . Lay aside That subtile , first of evils-human pride . Know God , and , so , thyself ; and be afraid To call aught poor or low that He has made . Fear nought but sin ; love all but sin ; and learn How that in all things else thou may'st discern His forming , his creating power-how bind Earth , self and brother to th ' Eternal Mind . // Linked with th ' Immortal , immortality Begins e'en here . For what is time to thee , To whose cleared sight the night is turned to day , And that but changing life , miscalled decay ? ' pp. 9 , 10 . The next and the last passage that we shall quote , is truly eloquent . In it the writer puts forth his best power , and in it the moral application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we refrain from expressing the opinion , that if the poem had ended with it , the effect would have been much better than with the present conclusion . Our sins our nobler faculties debase , And make the earth a spiritual waste Unto the Soul 's dimmed eye ; - tis man , not earthTis thou , poor , self-starved Soul , hast caused the dearth . The earth is full of life ; the living Hand Touched it with life ; and all its forms expand With principles of being made to suit Man 's varied powers , and raise him from the brute . And shall the earth of higher ends be full ? - Earth which thou tread'st !  --  and thy poor mind be dull ? Thou talk of life , with half thy soul asleep ! Thou " living dead man , " let thy spirits leap Forth to the ( lay ; and let the fresh air blow Through thy soul 's shut up mansion . Would'st thou know Something of what is life , shake off this death ; Have thy soul feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to be Sharer in all that thou dost touch or see . Break from thy body 's grasp , thy spirit 's trance ; Give thy Soul air , thy faculties expanse ; - Love , joy ,  --  e'en sorrow ,  --  yield thyself to all ! They 11 make thy freedom , man , and not thy thrall . Knock off the shackles which thy spirit bind To dust and sense , and set at large thy mind ! Then move in sympathy with God 's great whole ; And be , like man at first , " A LIVING SOUL ! " ' pp. 12 , 13 . And now , to leave the discussion of excellences and defects , let us advert for a moment to the fact , that this poem and that of Mr Sprague are the two longest of any considerable merit , which have , for we know not how many years , been given to the American public . Mr Dana 's consists of fifteen pages , and Mr Sprague 's of thirty . It is true that the occasions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but how is it , that limited as they are , of necessity , // they yet exceed in dimensions any others with ' which we have been treated for an age ? For lengthy poems , that is , poems which are long and dull too , we disclaim any particular affection . If they must be dull , let them be as short as the authors can possibly afford to make them . Neither are we so extravagant as to call for anything , for some time to come , quite so long and so good as Paradise Lost . But why can we not have a poetical essay , tale , romance , tragedy , or comedy , to which we can sit down , of a winter 's afternoon , before a comfortable fire , with the feeling that we hold something in our hands which is to interest and occupy us till bed-time , perchance enchain us beyond our sober bed-time , and find us burning the actual midnight oil ? Are we , as Americans , to own no poem , Barlow 's Columbiad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Alas ! that venerable production has stood alone too along . In solitude it waits for a companion . But we have nothing which can be married to that immortal verse . Oh , for a poem in ten books or cantos , or even in six ! Seriously and truly , we are longing for poetry which we can sit down to , and be said to read . We want some of our poets to show us , that their pinions are vigorous and broad enough for a sustained flight . Have we none such ; or is it that earthly necessities , and the present constitution of society with us , hold our strong ones down ? We are disposed to think , that , unpropitious as these influences are , they might be in some measure overcome by a tithe of the patience and perseverance which English bards have erst exhibited in their upward toilings after imnrnrtality ; and that even an American public would reward both with money and fame the devotion of a few years to the muse , and the temporary self-denial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven or eight editions which we have had of Pollok 's Course of Time , ' which surely is not a book of such excellence as to induce despair . The strain of its theology may indeed have been one principal source of its popularity , but its rapid sale is proof that we are not absolutely indisposed to buy long poems . We are very sure that an American l ) oern , even if it were not of first-rate material , would be bought and read for its rarity 's sake . We have had sonnets , madrigals , lines , stanzas , an ( l all that sort of magazine and souvenir poetry in abundance . Much of it is very sweet , we confess , but we are beginning to be cloyed with it , and want something more substantial.
