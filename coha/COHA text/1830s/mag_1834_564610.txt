txt " You may talk as much as you please about the march of mind , " said the old gentleman , strikinQ his cane against one of the logs , which had just begun to blaze in the lar e chimney , " but there are some things about it , which do n't suit my ideas of what should be , at all . Here you are , one reading a Waverley novel , another a French play . a third is probably writing Greek poetry , and the rest are all just about as profitably employed ; but , after all your learning , what do you know about your own country ? 1 want to know that . " This question we knew to be the signal for some long tale of the good old times ; and , with different degrees of patience , according to our love for the old white-headed chronicler , we prepared to listen and applaud . Now to my fancy , there 's nothing more delightful than to think and talk about the old sons of liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some passages in your *randmothers life , and I had rather see an account of her , any day , than all your r*mantic mushroom heroines ; so that , if any of you choose to write a novel about her , you shall have all I can tell you . " Her father was an Englishman : his name was Vaughan ; and he had come over to this country , to bury , in our lonely wilderness , the memory o1 a slighted love and mortified vanity . But he soon found that solitary woods and brooding melancholy were not such lasting pleasures , as the little poetry he knew had led him to suppose ; and that , unless he could see around him cheerful farm-houses and a cultivated country , he should soon lose his sentiment and misanthropy . So he changed his place ; and , as he thought he hated England too much to return there , he chose Boston for his residence , and soon after a clergyman 's daughteran American , and not of the Church of England-for his wife . The choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-spirited , noble woman , warm in her affections , gentle in her domestic relations , and devoted to her husband ; and , as he had many generous qualities , which his dogmatism and self-opinion could not conceal ; and as the excellencies of Old Eneland and the duty of implicit obedience on the part of the colonies afforded abundant room for animated conversation and independent argument , they were as happy a couple as are ordinarily seen in the marriage yoke . But their happiness was not of long continuance ; for , after the birth and subsequent death of a fine boy , in whom she had centred too much of her happiness , her health visibly declined , and though she received every attention his devotion could su*gest , so much so , that he even offered to carry her to England to receive better medical advice ,  --  yet sorrow had fallen upon her with too sure a blight , and , after giving birth to a daughter , your grandmother , she died in her husband 's arms . Mr. Vaughan had met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he felt it bitterly . The idea of resignation , he could not comprehend , and he scorned to be consoled . The world yet offered many sources of enjoyment , in the social intercourse or in the indulgence of his benevolent affections , and the political restlessness of the colony , under the restraints of the mother country , would , at any other time , have roused his energies , and kindled anew his love for his native land . But he rejected every alleviation of his grief ,  --  he was an unfortunate , a disappointed man ; the hand of God had smitten him severely ; and his mind brooded upon this idea , and his imagination so hung upon his sufferings , that happiness seemed a inoekery , and submission to his lot an insult to her lie had lost . He proposed to retire frorri scenes that reminded him continually of his lost happiness , and a am to seek in solitude , if not relief , at least freedom from interruption irs his so++ows . As this villa e off red many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain scenery , he had this house built , and soon removed here with his little daughter , whom lie called Lucy , after her mother , and a lady who would at the same time suhierintend her education and the domestic economy of his hone . Mrs. i/larston was an En*lish woman , of moderate intellect , ordinary acquisitions , and possessed of an ambition beyond that of preserving and renderin6 conspicuous her attachment to the royal family and to the Church of England . Unrler her , little Lucy was placed ; more as a matter of course , that the child should have a female superintendent , than with any regard to the development of her mind or the formation of her character ; and Mrs. Marston did not trans* re*.s the bounds of duty prescribed , both by her own ideas of education arid the tacit nl ) probation . of Mr. Vaughan . // 110 If Lucy 's birth had been marked by affliction and sorrow , fate seemed to have exhausted her malice in the blow ; and when the storm , which had darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long season of quiet and serenity followed . Her early years were as bright and happy as her sainted mother could have wished-full of gaiety and innocent enjoyment . Her companions were few , but they were of her own age , and as free and unrestrained as herself and willingly acknowledged Lucy Vaughan as their leader in their harmless frolics , and their queen in their more dignified amusements . Her heart was open to all , and she won and repaid the love of all who knew her  --  and to see was to know her ; her deep blue eve , with its long silken lashes , beamed with feeling and tenderness , and her bewitching smile spoke the innocence and simplicity of her heart ; while even Jiebe might have envied the golden tresses which , in her mirth , she shook over her chiseled neck and shoulders . But , though she was the gayest of the gay , and drank in happiness with every hreath of her pure mountain air , her heart often swelled with the deepest feeling , and the most delicate sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was seized with a violent fever , which threatened his life ; and though she was never admitted to his chamber , but was tempted by her friends into every kind of amusement calculated to cheer her and divert her attention , yet she too truly read the counteuances of the physicians and the servants , not to feel an apprehension of some evil , which , though she could not comprehend it , she could not shake off . And tbat child , whose laugh would usually be heard in noisy merriment through the whole house , and whose absence was , on ordinary occasions , divined by an unusual stillness , was now to be found , at all hours , watching in anxious silence at her father 's door , listening to catch the sound of his voice , or waiting to inquire of his attendants when he would be able to leave his room and resume his customary walks around the village ; and when at len th he began to recover , she was his constant nurse , and the anxious attendant of his feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivation of her mind demanded more of her attention , the simplicity of her heart was undiminished . She was indeed subjected to few restraints , and all her pure affections expanded freely and unbiased ; and while her benevolence was directed in the administration of her father 's charities to his poorer neighbors , the love she every where inspired , strengthened the interest she instinctively felt for all . It was only , however , in the delicacy and purity of her affections , that she was superior to her companions , who were confined to the children of the neighboring farmers ' families ; for the slight advantages of education she possessed at home did not separate her from them , who enjoyed only the opportunities of elementary instruction afforded by the village school . But it was in the softness , tenderness , and refinement of her feelings , with her frank , noble , disinterested principle of conduct , that made her the object of such general admiration and interest , and , in one case , of the most devoted , pure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , as you see me here , old and alone among you , like a withered tree in a green meadow , to realize that I have been through all the changes of infancy , boyhood , and youth , and that I have been liable to the same natural impulses as yourselves . But man is essentially the same , under all circumstances ,  --  for improvement is but addition of good , and not change . I was born , as you know , in this village , and suffered the never-ending loss of both my parents before I was five years old . But a maiden aunt , Miss Rebecca Foster , gave me home in her house and heart , and did every thing to supply her sister 's place . She was a good , kind woman , whom I shall never forget , though I should have to live as much longer as I have already domme . She lived in a small wooden house , near where the arsenal now stands , and supported herself by the prudent manaoement of her hereditary fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the comforts of single life when she undertook the care of me ; for I was a noisy , wild , ungovernable child , most persevering in mnischief , and inattentive to rebuke* and I never could brook control , and knew no other principle than that of gratitude and affection ; so that , though I was very much attached to mny aunt , I never could help suspecting that she sent me to school , rather to preserve order in her own house than with any view of doing me good . This vexed me extremely , and . as resemitmoent against her was out of the question . the whole tide of my youthful spirit was directed afaiost th' - chmI- moaster ; of course , my timmme was shameflilly wa4ed. and my advmna*es abused . I resume I was a boy of quick parts , fir I never fuud any dif*cultv in performing the treble tasks appointed me ; and the abuse of my talents , as well as of amy time , // was always impressed upon me , on every occasion , which was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-mates . I remained a school-boy , however , under a succession of teachers , picking up knowledge every where but at school , until I was thirteen years old ; and then 1 closed that sort of life by a quarrel , in the face of the whole school , with the teacher . Lie happened to be an Englishman , and on this occasion was attempting to explain to us boys the propriety of the massacre of the fifth of March , which , at that time , had spread great excitement over the colony . I contradicted his assertions flatly ; and I remember I called him some pretty hard names , among which was that of " blood-thirsty hireling . ' He , however , thought himself ; I dare say , amply repaid for the insult by getting rid , of me ; for when he approached with his apple switch to punish me , I deliberately walked out of the school-room , and , as I slammed the door violently behind me , and stepped out into the open air , I thought myself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neglect of regular study , had been to enter the profession of the law , I now sat myself to work with some energy to improve my mind , by studying some of the higher branches of learning , not taught in village-schools ; and for three years I continued to devote myself perseveringly to my studies , and succeeded in acquiring as much knowledge of Latin as I supposed I should want , beside a valuable stock of historical knowledge , and as much general information as I could gather from the books within my reach . Just as these were apparently exhausted , and I was in doubt whether to consider myself as having learnt out , or to despair of ever learning any thing , I obtained for myself great advantages , in the assistance and kindness of Mr. Vaughan . " You think , perhaps , that I have abandoned your grandmother too long , for the sake of telling my own story . But I am old , you know , and have an excuse for egotism ; besides , I wanted to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had never known much of Mr. Vaughan , though he had often spoken to me , as was his custom with the boys whom he met in his walks about the country . But Lucy Vaughan I had known better , having often been on little excursions with her , sometimes for berrying , sometimes for a walk to the top of one of these mountains ; and I remember I once received a sound thrashing from a farmer 's boy , because , at her suggestion , I insisted upon his throwing away the stick with which he was drivinr and beating one of his father 's cows . But since my exclusive devotion to study , we had seldom met ,  --  though when we did so , it was with a singular pleasure on my part ; and I know very well that I used to be half pleased to hear that any of the village were sick , because I knew I might visit them , when recovered , and hear Lucy 's praises sounded with the most enthusiastic gratitude . But my ideas of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anxiety , and subjected me to not the slightest disappointment . Our acquaintance , however , was destined to be renewed and established forever . " One summer afternoon I had taken my book and walked down to the edge of the lake to enjoy the cool breeze , and the murmuring of the little waves among the pebbles . I was lying on the bank just heyond Bloody Rock , half reading , half musing , when the sound of oars plying near , aroused me , and soon a boat appeared from behind the rock , which I immediately recognized as Mr. Vaughan 's . My old school-master was rowing Lucy round the lake . He probably did not know the shore , for he was rowing directly into the current , which sets there so swiftly , and where , though the water is deep enough , the sunken rocks are very dangerous . My first idea was to let him row omi and get a ducking ; but then the thought of . Lucy struck me , and I sprang up and halloed to them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved her handkerchief to me in salute . I tried to inform them of their danger , but they did not understand me till it was too late ; the current had caught the boat and was driving them fearfully akug . Lucy laughed merrily at the danger , and was again waving her handkerchief in triumph , as they had safely passed one of the rocks ,  - -  when they struck . The shock threw her overboard , while the boat began to sink . I immediately plunged from the bank , and swam towards her . Luckily , she was thrown inside of the eddy , where the current was not so strong ; but she had only time to call to me before she sank ; and , in my mind , an eternity passed before she rose again : when she did , I felt the strength of a giant in my arms , and , by some means or other , I caught her before she sank again . When I once had her in my arnas , it was easy enough to get back : had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , I think I could not but have saved her . // The Times of our Grandfathers . " When I reached the shore , and laid my l ) recious burden on the bank , I began to fear my labors had been in vain-for she was insensible ; but her bosom soon began to heave heavily , and 1 was encouraged . No help was at baud ; for the poor frightened school-master had been carried by the current far beyond where he found himself , more dead than alive , upon the shore . But my apprehension for Lucy 's life gave me strength as well as resolution , and , notwithstanding my fatigue , I took her up , and with her head resting on my bosom , and her curls dripping with water , covering my arms , I brought her from the bank up here to the house . I carried her up the steps , and laid her gently on the sofa in the hall , and then sank down by her side exhausted . But I was soon recovered by Lucy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to hear her speak ; but she only smiled , and , putting her arms round roy neck , as I had done for her when I caught her in the water , she closed her eyes again , the color began to return to her pale cheek , and she sank into a deep slumber . As her warm breath fell upon my cheek , and I watched that sweet smile of kindness that still hovered around her lips , I thought I had done more in that afternoon than ever man had done before . I disengaged myself from her , reluctantly , and summoned her father , whom I found asleep in the library , to her assistance ; at the same moment , Mrs. Marston descended the stairs . As oon as Mr. Vaughan discovered his daughter 's condition , all self-possession left him lie seemed uncertain of her being alive , hut was unwilling that any person shoukl touch her , for fear of waking her , and while he sobbed in agony , he instinctively avoided making any noise that might disturb her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants carry her to her bed , he sat in perfect stupefaction , unconscious , apparently , of thought or existence . I afterwards wondered at his being thus overcome , nor do I believe that he ever before knew how much he loved his daughter . Mrs. Marston began to wipe away the water upon the sofa , and said to me , as she stopped and saw Mr. Vaughan 's situation , Perhaps you had better call to-morrow ; Mr. Vaughan can not pay you now . " The insult made no impression upon me , for I turned unconsciously and left the house in a sta of unalloyed and tranquil happiness . It was one of the few instances in my early life , of my experiencing enjoyment distinct from excitement . The idea of having saved Lucy Vaughan 's life was absolutely incoinprehensible . I could not understand it . I did not doubt the truth of what had happened ; but I could not realize that I , as I then saw myselg who was yet to live in the same village with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I who had saved her ;  --  and then her smile , and the instinctive confidence with which she had encircled me with her arms , filled me with the purest delight , and I dwelt upon it , and imagined a thousand repetitions of it , and again and again went through the whole adventure in my mind ,  --  and was recalled to myself only by reaching my aunt 's door , and then nothing but my own dripping clothes could have convinced me , that the whole had not been one of those beautiful day-dreams in which I *o often indulged . " The next morning , Mr. Vaughan sent for me , and I attended him with an alacrity wWch somewhat surprised even myself . I found Lucy alone ; she received me with all the artlessness of fifteen , and with that soul-born grace and natural elegance so peculiar to herself . Tier expressions of gratitude were few , bat they flowed from the heart , and spoke volumes ; -. -  --  and I remember a thrill of joy passing over me , when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she hastily withdrew the hand she had given me , and blushed deeply as our eyes at that moment met . Mr. Vaughan received me with a profusion of thanks , though with much feeling ; and as he spoke of the importance of his daughter to his happiness , and of her danger , his eyes filled with tears . I should have been extremely embarrassed , had my imaeination been less strong ; but , at that moment , I was thinking of Lucy 's hand . He did not attempt to prove his gratitude by offers of money , but , after remarking how much inconvenience he had suffered from the want of a secretary , and of the great comfort it would give him if be could find any one who would take the place , he very delicately offered it to me . He had not much writing to be done , it was true , but then he was always in want of a secretary ,  - -  that in case of my accepting his offer , I must , of course , make one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much at my own disposal ,  --  his library would be at my service , and the small salary he was able to offer me , mi ht , perhaps , pay my expenses while preparing for my profession . He concluded by expressing his hopes that I would find it convenient to oblige him , and by desiring that , how- // 113 ever I might determine , he should always he happy to he of any service to me , if I were at any time in need of it . " I can not see now , why I ever hesitated as to his offer ; hut I know that I did so , and that a day or two passed before I came to a determination , and then , with the consent of my aunt , I accepted the place . He expressed himself very grateful : Mrs. Marston shook hands with me in a kind and condescending manner : Lucy did not express as much pleasure as I had expected . I prepared , with some diffidence , to perform the duties of my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was pleased not to be called upon for the two or three first days ; at the end of which , Mr. Vaughan gave me a letter to copy into the letter-book . It was to his hatter in London , and contained an order for a new hat . When I had copied this , he told me he should always call upon me when he needed me , and recommended my prosecuting my studies as I had been accustomed to do . Though my ideas of my duties as secretary were certainly much lessened by this conversation , I resolved to take his advice as to the use of his books . My studies were diligently pursued , and as my advantages multiplied , my views were enlarged ; and whatever success I may have had in my profession , I must attribute to these two years spent in his library . I then thought them the happiest of my life ,  --  they certainly were the first two of many happy ones . I do not think I ever wrote or copied six letters while 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my complaining that my office was a sinecure ; then I always received some order to the . banker , or some ministerial paper to copy . 1 grew , while I remained with them , very munch attached to the family . It was true , Mr. Vaughan and I used to argue somewhat violently on the right of England to tax the colonies , and when their insubordination would call forth his indignation , I was not behiudhand in defending their conduct ; but we never act&amp;ally quarreled , though my blood used to boil , at first , when I heard him speak of my country : yet I gradually overcame these feelings , and , as my principles became more firm , and my belief that a great struggle was approaching established , I cared less for defending in words a country I burned to serve by deeds . " But when I aid I became attached to the family , I did not refer to Mr. Vaughan alone , nor to Mrs. M* raton , with whom I used to quarrel constantly , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as constantly adopted and observed them . I loved Lucy-with a deep , pure , and devoted love . Our relative situations , her beauty , the purity , loveliness , and strength of her character , and the high order of her mind , all together , made it as impossible for me not to love her as it would be for the spring-flowers not to feel the influences of the returning sun , or the fruits to resist the ripening heat of summer . For two years I saw her daily , in the constant exercise of her kind affections , in the opening and growth of her pure and lofty principles , discharging with loveliness and simplicity the duties her x arm heart enjoined upon her . I read with her , and while I could often assist her , I joyfully admired the quickness , strength , and delicacy of her mind ; and while , through her simple and open character , I saw her faults more easily , I saw also more distinctly her efforts to overcome them . She was made to be loved-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted , with a joyful welcome , to the irresistible influence she was daily acquiring over me . I never was able to conceal what I felt ; and , from her , I never wished to do so . She must have known I loved her , though , how deeply she could not know ; for though she never shunned my society , nor attempted to conceal the pleasure our pursuits in common gave her , yet , when we were together , her gaiety lost its exuberance , arid her conversation was less animated , her laugh was not so free , and perhaps a tinge of sadness might be seen subduing her beautiful features . " I was just eighteen , and she a year younger : I was poor almost to dependence , and her father 's fortune was no more than his establishment required . But those days wer not as these . There was then less calculation , and fewer statutes of prudence and propriety-we then knew our own worth as men , better than is the case now ; and x-e knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond our own efforts , and that , if true to ourselves , fortune was within our reach , and success never unattainable . With this confidence in ourselves , notwithstanding the gloom of rebellion hung over the land , we thought and felt freely ; and when we asked the woman of our love to commit her happiness to us , and to love in return , we asked her to share the hardships as well as the pleasures of life , and ought her sympathy and encouragement as well as her exclusive affectio*m and society . // The Times of our Grandfathers . It was thus I spoke , as late one afternoon in April I stood with Lucy , at the edge of her father 's woods , where we had been watching the setting sun ; and when I knelt to her and confessed my love and poured forth my heart to her , I at the same time asked her to share with me the gloom as well as the sunshine of life . I spoke in agony , for never till that moment had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : hut I was frank with her , and did not conceal the extent of the sacrifice she would make . The last rays of the sun streamed through a break in the mountains and fell on her flushed features : her full blue eyes glistened with a tear as she turned her face from me , and her graceful figure shook with the conflict of emotions swelling in her breast . She did not speak , but pressed my hand a it gently held hers ; and , as I rose , she buried her burning blushes in my bosom . " I need not tell you all we said to each other , or whether we said any thing . We parted more happy than we had met ,  --  she to return to the house , and I to continue my walk , that I might tranquilize my feelings and lay my plan of communicating our mutual wishes to her father . As I jumped over the fence into the road , I came upon one of our young farmers , walking briskly , with a gnn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Au , Bronson , ' said I , gaily , farewell to the British possessions in America , when you come out in arms . What hen-roost has been robbed * " It s no joke now , ' answered he sturdily , since it s open war , I ye taken down my father 's gun , and till the colony has her rights , my hand shall never hang it up again ; and when I ye said a thing , I ye said it . ' " What , exclaimed I , have the colonies risen ? ' Have they risen ? why , do nt you hear the bells ? What s that beacon fire blazing for ? If you would watch more for your country , and think less of your tory friends up there , you would have been at your post by this time . Why , Harry Tilden has been up here from Concord-Major Henry Tilden , I should say  --  and as he passed through , he told us all about it . There s been a great battle ; all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand British regulars against three hundred provincials-they fought three days , and as soon as the battle was over , he came off to tell us-lie says we ye gained a most signal triumph , ten thousand English left dead on the field , and seventeen of our people killed . Hurrah for the Colony ! ' " This was the first account I received of the battle of Lexington , and no more definite information could I get from Bronson . But , as I approached the common , I found that his story had some fouiidation . Our two meeting-house hells were ringing the alarin ,  --  fires were kindled on the bills around , and the people in the greatest agitation-sum e carrying guns , others , swords ; a part in their working dress , as they had been summoned from their field-work , others in their huntingshirts . The women were running about , some in tears and carrying their infants , others calm and silent , washing their husbands or sons ' fowling-pieces , or carrying their pewter plates and spoons to the blacksmiths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were repeating the exaggerated statement they had just received . " There could be no doubt hut that there had been a battle , and all were in preparation to join the standard of rebellion , wherever it had been unfurled . That very evening the men of the village , as soon as they could be gathered , were to march towards Boston . All knew the side which I would take , and I was urged to get my gun with what ammunition 1 could find , and join them immediately . I shouted my huzza with the loudest , and promrised to do so . But I never was more calm  --  the hour I had expected had arrived , the first blow had been struck , and I felt that only a long conflict could reduce the British ministry to terms . But some glorious ideas of my country 's independence shone through the gloomy prospect I saw before us , and I gloried that a successful beginning had been made , thouah I did not expect the sword to be sheathed without a struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , and made an inward vow to spare no sacrifice to serve her . " I had run back from the common to the house , and had reached the piazza before I thought of Lucy . I stopped and rested my head against one of the pillars , and , in one minute , hours of thought and feeling flashed through my mind . I entered the door of the library with a firm step , and stood before Mr. Vaughan . The large silver lamp threw a bright light round the room , and showed his sword , pistols , and traveling equipments scattered in different directions . He received me in silence , though it was evident that a storm of passion had been raging // within him . Before he could speak , I addressed him calmly , though with a faltering voice . Sir , I love your daughter , and find that she returns my affection . I am now going away to serve my country ; may I hope that when I return you will consent to our union ? ' " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you not mean to serve your rightful sovereign , his blessed majesty ? Are you too going to join these rebel ranks , to rush on your death in this mad insurrection ? ' " I am going to serve in the armies of an nppressed people , goaded into resistance by tyranny . As a brave man you must - I tell you I hate you , he interrupted me in fury , I despise you , and hope that no false ideas of mercy may save you from the gallows . Does a low-bred rebel dare to love my daughter ? Young man , I swear to you , if I thought she felt any thing more than pity for you , I would cast her from my own door , and proclaim her mothers disgrace when I disowned her . ' " I turned from him and left the room-I passed through both parlors , hut Lucy was not there . No time was to be lost ; tbe drum was already beating for the march ; I therefore merely snatched my gunning accoutrements from my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crossing the garden , I caught a glimpse of a white dress moving among the trees , and in a moment I was at Lucy 's side . She had expected that I would take that path , and was waiting for me . She received me with a sad smile . I chose to see you again , ' she said , before you go ,  --  and it may be for the last time . ' " The moon shone brightly on her beautiful face , and I saw her pale features very different from what I had last beheld them , and her eyes wet with tears . I pressed her to my bosom , and , as she rested her head against my shoulders , said , Lucy , I am going ; but first I ask you to give me a proof that you love me . Your father has refused to hear me , spurned me from him , insulted me , and I have left his house in arms against his unholy cause . Now show your love for me , and consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me from your father 's house , arid seek security in that which sheltered my early years . What , Sir , ' she said , indignantly , bursting from me , dare you utter such a proposition to me ? ask me to leave my old , widowed father , and fly and hide myself in the arms of a rebel boy , his avowed enemy ? Is this the wisdom of your love ? It has not been so long accepted , that it need to have degenerated into familiarity . But no , ' she said , after a moment 's pause , putting her hand in mine , Henry , bear with me-l had forgotten that you were as young as I. Forgive my angry speed ; but your mad scheme frightened me-it may be your last . ' I folded her in my arms and wept bitterly , but it was soon over . Lucy , your father has threatened to drive you from his house if he finds you love me . " I will bear his anger , if needs be , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roe unkindly ; his heart would break sooner . But you must go ) the drum is sounding fainter  --  and I would not keep you from your duty-go , Henry , my love is yours , and my prayers are with you , though my father is armed for your death  --  and if you ever meet him , Henry , remember he is my father . ' " After one long and agonizing embrace , Itore myself from her in utter wretchedness of heart . " You have heard me tell my stories of the wars so often that I shall not now repeat my adventures in them . I was , to be sure , very fortunate , never having been wounded nor made prisoner , and yet my comrades used to say , Harry Bunker is a lucky dog , in every battle ; only get into his company , and we shall have fighting enough . ' But it was not to me a life of pleasure . I do not speak of our severe and constant duty , nor of our want of every comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , and if Lucy shomild meet with any difficulty I should not know it in time to assist her . I knew , to he sure , that her father had not put his angry threat in execution , and that , while he was in the English army , she was living here with Mrs. Marston . I had never met Vaughan in battle , though we were both of us at Br udywine and Cowpens . He was a brave oflicer. and in what he imagined a good cause , and he avoided no labor or fatigue to secure As success hot before the war was over his constitotien was throglily broken dowit by exposure , arid he was so far in a cnrisniiltion that his fellowoffleers endeuvored to persna ( le h*m to leave the cc uritre. as the ni , l* ' means of preserving his life ; amid though he always refused to leave the country till it // was subdued to obedience , yet every excuse was sought for to send him to England . " Though the resolution cost me much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till we could meet ou more equal terms than before when I should no more be considered a rebel against my king , but a successful soldier of my country . I knew I could not marry her iu the disordered state of the country , for I had devoted myself to the cause of American liberty , and could not leave her bannernor would she have cousented , under her father 's unwillingness . While affairs then were so uncertain , I resolved not to resume our interrupted intercourse . Year after year rolled away , each promising peace , but bringing disappointment ; and 1 had grown from the boy into the man , and had risen into esteem in the soldier 's profession . " At length , in 1781 , after I bad resisted many temptations to break my resolution , an opportunity offered which 1 could not withstand . General Washington wanted some despatches carried from Yorktown , where he was besieging Cornwallis , to Boston , and selected me , as well acquainted with the country , to bear them . This place , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I determined to take that , leaving it undecided whether I should attempt to see Lucy or not . I arrived here late in the evening of a hot September day , and , as I had ridden since morning without rest , I was obliged , as well as willing , to stop . It was a lovely night  --  the moon shone full upon the little plain , and lighted every spot familiar to my boyish days ; and , from the top of the mountain to the bosom of the lake , I thoubht I could distinguish every place marked by early association . I avoided the notice which the arrival of an officer in uniform would in time of war produce , even at that late hour , by leaving my horse in the first field I knew , and taking a foot-path to my aunt 's house . But roy feelings , at thus revisiting my native place , after so long an absence , were any thing but pleasant . Every thing remained as I had left it ; the houses had not even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same mountains , with their dark waving outlines , enclosed them from the world . The tavern was there , though its old sign-board had been taken down , and the voices that issued from it , as they fell upon my ear , were unknown to me . I still loved the place , but it did not seem to welcome me as it should have done , and in the scenes of my childhood I felt like a stranger and intruder . I entered the house where my aunt had always lived ; but a young farmer and his wife occupied the parlor . I asked for my aunt- ' Oh replied the man , she died three years ago , and I bought the house because it was sold low-should you like to see the deed , Sir ? I left the house in silence , though in my heart there was a question , Has six years , then , made such a change ? ' and , as I walked through the garden where I had so often worked under her directions , I sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child . But I soon recovered myself , and determined to come up here , and see what change time had wrought in my second borne . I could see no alterationthe wood was still here , and I stood again on the spot where I had first known the happiness of being loved  --  and the house threw its dark shadow in the moonlight the same as I had left it . It was partly shut up , but through some of the windows I could see lights moving quickly from room to room ; but I could not distinguish Lucy 's form , though I knew she still lived here . I determined , however , to approach and stand again upon the spot where I had left her . I leaped the garden wall , and moved towards the place ; the same mountain-ash shaded it , and the same path might be distinguished among the weeds , with which the garden was overgrown . As I approached nearer , a slight form started from under the tree into the moonlight , and looked towards me- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only words we spoke , and I again clasped her to my bosom . " It was she  --  the same beautiful creature I had left her ,  --  grown , it is true , into the woman , but retaining all the loveliness of the girl ; and though thought and care had chastened the luxuriant beauty of her youth , her eye was still as soft , and her mouth full of the same sweet expression . She was dressed for traveling , and her velvet riding-cap lay on the ground . After the first emotions of surprise had passed , the first inquiries made , and the first tears of joy mingled , she said , looking at me steadily , as if to detect the change from youth to manhood ,  --  " Any where else I should not have known you ; but meeting you here , I knew who only it could be . I had come to take a last look at the place where we parted , before I leave it forever . ' " And I came to find you here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad of it , for it is a melancholy place . ' // 117 C ' Yes , Henry , I am leaving my home , and my count My father has resolved to return to England . ' ry , and you-forever . " But , Lucy , beg him , intreat him , to leave you here . I am your natural protector ,  --  he can not be su unreasonable , so cruel , as to separate us ,  --  do but remain here till I can see hiisi , and I xx were his worst enemy . ' ill so persuade him that he shall consent , even if I No , Henry , no . He is not unreasonable or cruel-he gave me my choiceand his permission , if I preferred , to stay here , and marry you . " Here Iser voice choked  --  the tears rolled down her pale cheeks , and she must have fallen had I not supported her . My agony was too strong for tears . isaw too plainly the course she had taken ,  --  she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , to her father , now that he was old , sick , and broken down ; and yet I kriexv that I had her love , and that she would have sacrificed any thing to me except l* r duty . I could not speak ,  --  and we stood fsr some minutes in silence , when she said with more composure , Do not be so distressed-you could not have loved toe had I done otherwise . Tlark there are the isorses at the door ; this night I must be off ; Henry , farewell-think of me-love me ,  --  and be sure that at this moment I love you better than any thing upon this earth . ' Here , without daring to remain fur one parting kiss , she tore herself from me . " It was long before I arousd from the stupor in which she had left me , and then it was to the consciousness of utter wretchedness . I determined to prosecute my journey , and , having succeeded in getting a horse , I immediately set out for Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I. then returned by a different route to Yorktown . I had performed my business satisfactorily to the Commander in Chieg and received his thanks . " A few days bad passed , since my return , and but a short time since the surrender of the English army , when , as I was riding one morning in the country around , I met anEnglish officer-we both bowed , and passed , and stopped . I knew that face , emaciated as it was by neglected sickness ; and his smile , though one of common courtesy , reminded ' me of early kindness . Years had passed since we had met , yet we had . met when my heart was warm , and when impressions , if made at all , are made to last forever . I hesitated but one moment , and nothing but the sense of kindness remained . I immediately dismounted , and he , though with difficulty , did the samne . I took his hand and pressed it to my heart ; for I could not speak , and words could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , but , after arm instant , contmoled his feelings , and spoke first . Henry , I am rejoiced to meet you once more  --  and this is the last time we meet on earth . I am shortly to appear before my Maker , and I should die with more pleasure , if I could feel ' that I had here the for*iveness of all I have injured . Do n't interrupt me , for my time is short . I am sure that when you know that I repent my violent language when we last parted , your pardon will be freely given . I am to sail to-morrow for Europe ; but the seeds of death are in me , and I shall never see my native land a am . I had wished to see my child once more ; but , owing to some mistake , she can not reach here in time , and Godhas kindly meant to spare her pain . Do you still love her , as you once told me God , knows I do , ' was my answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her dying fathers . consent to marry her , and his prayers that God may bless you both-if blessings . can fall upon a rebellious people . Tell her that her father loved her , and ' that she has an unspotted name frnmm him . But now I must leave you-do not attempt to see me before I go ; for in the presence of my countrymen I might not be able to restrain the expression of my feeling against the enemies of roy king . ' " Here he returned to his horse , and was soon lost in a turn of the road . You may easily imagine m.y sensatiorms after he had left me , and the change in my feelings and prospect . Ihe rest of my story or of your grandmother 's has nothing that could interest you . Her father died before line reached England , so that the benevolent intentions of hiscommander in his mission were frustrated . Lucy had beerm prepared for his death , and bore it with her mismial fortitude .. You now know why I hailed the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little village to reside , and xlmy I was inso great haste as to be married the day L enteredt profession of the law .
