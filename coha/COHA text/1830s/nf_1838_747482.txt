txt Havre , June 29th , 1835 . We arrived here late on Saturday , so that Sunday and j a festival on Monday compel us to await the custom house till Tuesday evening . Do not detain your husband ; I expect him for the latest in October . You do n't know how much absence from home and loneliness in a foreign country try the consistency of one 's courage .  --  And tell him to listen to my advice in preparing his voyage . His first step is to obtain , by a few lines to the secretary of war , a passport describing his features , dimensions , titles , ( nose straight , eyes hazel , &c.,); and if he can add " Major , " or " Colonel , " or some cheap American dignity , he will have a great many bows in this country he otherwise can not aspire to . I was foolish enough to come over nothing but simple " John . " If he brings the wife along , tell him to include her in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ girl , four feet and something , having a sharp tongue , pretty enough mouth and teeth , and eyes too good for her nose . ) I do n't ask pardon ; a nose is only an important feature on a passport ; faces can be pretty in spite of their noses . You do n't kiss the book , so he may put down any age your ladyship pleases . It is important to choose a good ship . The " Sylvie de Grace " left eight clays after and arrived two days before us . The berth having least motion is nearest the middle of the vessel . Your fare to Havre is one hundred and forty dollars , with a guinea for services . If any lady of your village has a disobedient husband , or a son who has beaten his mother , bid her send him to sea .  --  But for particulars on this head I refer you to my letter of yesterday , in which I have given you all that Sebastian Cabot and other eminent navigators had left out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers . I love the clergyman who put us in with the ladies in the litany . Your consolation is that the evil endures but thirty days , often less , and it purifies the blood for the better enjoyments of land . Children , especially sucking babies , are rarely sick , and women bear the sea better than men . Some of your sex having been born from this element accounts for the partiality . Let us then skip over the sea . On touching land your passport is sent on immediately to Pa ris to tell them you have come , and is restored to you there in exchange for a ticket you must ask at the police office at Havre . In the mean time your two shirts and a half are paraded under military escort to the custom house , and , unless some saint is in the way , are forthwith examined . If you arrive the day before the Millenium you have to stay for your portmanteau until it is over . This exami- /z/ /q/ nation might be made on board , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs , and portage again to your lodgings , enable them to levy a contribution of five or six francs on each of your packages . All effects , except your wardrobe , are subject to duties and delays , and sealed letters to a fine . The passengers , too , are sometimes a little examined ; so beware of suspicious appearances . June 30th . I have half a mind to describe this town to you . It has twenty thousand inhabitants ; is at the mouth of the Seine , and twenty-four hours from Paris . The houses are high , mostly of black slate , and patched often till nothing is seen but the patches , and mushrooms and other vegetables grow through the cracks . Villages in America have an air of youth and freshness harmonizing with their dimensions . Small things should never look old . This town presents you with the ungracious image of a wrinkled and gray-headed baby . The streets , except one , have no sidewalks ; they are paved with rough stone , and are without gutters and common sewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuries . The exception is the " Rue de Paris ; " it has " trottoirs , " a theatre , a public square , a market house , a library with six thousand volumes , and a church very richly furnished : the organ presented by Cardinal Richelieu . I have been to this church this morning to pay the Virgin Mary the pound of candles I owed for my preservation at sea . The prettiest improvement I have seen ( and it is no miracle for a town of so much commercial importance ) is a dock , cut in from the bay along the channel of an old creek , which contains three or four hundred ships , a goodly number of which wear the American Hi T1IK SUBUKBS. flag ; it runs through the thick of the town and brings the vessels into a pleasant sociability with the houses . When the tide is high these vessels ride in their own clement ; when low , you see a whole fleet , wallowing in the mud ; and passengers , to get to sea , have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole week . A little to the north you will see a compensation for all this ugliness , in a hill , running boldly up to the water 's edge , whose south side , several hundred feet high , is smothered with houses . They seem to be scrambling up the acclivity to look at the town ; and the entire summit is covered with beautiful villas , and gardens rich with trees and shrubbery , and hedges , which at this season are a most luxurious ornament . Many American families , having grown rich here by commerce , are perched magnificently upon this hill . The view from the top is charming ! The old town , in its motley livery of houses , ships , and fortifications , spreads itself out at your feet ; on the west there is an open view of the channel , and all the pretty images of a commercial port , such as vessels in the near and distant prospect , coming into harbor and going out upon their voyages ; and on the south , and beyond the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , of field and woodland , which runs gradually up , undulating like the sea , till it meets the blue sky . It is charming , too , in the night ; for as soon as Mercury has hung out his lamps above , these Havrians light up theirs in the town , and set up a little opposition to the heavens ; and there you are between two firmaments ; which of a fine evening is a fantastic and gorgeous spectacle . This is the Havre . It is the first thing I ever described , and I am out of breath . And now the customs and manners . I have had dealings with hackney coachmen , porters , peddlers and pickpockets , /q/ and have found ( hem eminently qualified in their several departments . In strolling last evening through the streets  --  going only to frank a letter at the post-office , I remarked a person crying maps by a wall side . He walked up and down with arms folded , and had a grave and respectable face : " JL trente sous settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wished to look after a place in Normandy , called Helleville ; the very place where Guiscard , and that other choicest of all ladies ' heroes , Tancred , were born .  --  Only think of Tancred being born in the department of Coutance , and being nothing but a Frenchman ; and only think , too , of the possibility of taking a piece of gold out of a man 's waistcoat pocket at mid-day , the owner being wide awake , and in full enjoyment of his senses . I had no sooner made my wants known to this polite auctioneer than , with a civilite toute Fruncaise , he placed the map before my eyes  --  that is , between the eyes and the waistcoat pocket , and himself just behind the left shoulder , assisting me in the search  --  " Hell  --  Hell  --  Hell  --  Helleville / " He then resumed his walk and looked out for new customers ; and 1 with a return of his bow and smile , and a grateful sense of his politeness , took leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stolen , " to the post-office . Here I took out my letter , had it stamped , and put my hand complacently in my pocket  --  I went home very much disgusted with the French nation . To be robbed at the Havre brings no excuse for one 's wit or understanding ; in Paris it is what one expects from the civilization of the capital . The porters , coachmen , draymen , boatmen , and such like , about the Havre , are wrangling and noisy to excess . They burst into an idle fury every few minutes ; reminding one of our militia musketry ; there is a preliminary , /z/ // and then a general explosion , and then a few scattering cartridges , and all ends in smoke . They seldom resort to duelling , and boxing is considered vulgar ; and as for oaths , they make no sort of figure in French . In the article of swearing we are ahead of all other nations . In their common intercourse , however , these people are much more respectful than we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for no other reason than bringing your shoes in well polished , insists on your " pardon for having deranged you , " and the beggar takes leave of his fellow beggar with his " respects to madam . " But these respects I have heard do not bear the test of any twopenny interest . There is no civility that stands against sixpence . This common world is more social , and in appearance more joyous than with us . It huddles together in public places , with wonderful conversation and merriment till a late hour of the night . What a quantity of green old age ! grandmothers of sixty with their hair en jjapillotte , are playing hide and go-seek with twenty-five . After all , what signifies the degree of poverty or age , if one is happy ? Another thing remarkable , is the respect paid to property . Benches on the public squares are handed down to posterity with no other marks than the natural wear and tear of sitting on them ; vegetables grow by the wayside untrodden , and gardens and fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible protection . I have talked these matters with a Frenchman , who says , that it is the last generation only that lives at this rate , and that the present one dies off at a very reasonable age . The truth I believe is that we , in our country , keep old persons inside the house ; we wrap them up and lay them on the shelf , and ennui and neglect , no doubt , abridge a little their duration . As for the security of property he ascribes it /q/ entirely to a certain shepherdly swain , very common here , who wears red breeches , and is coiffed in a cocked hat , with one of the cocks exactly over his nose , called a Garde Champetre , who watches day and night over the safety of the fields . A curiosity of the place is the peasant women whom you will see mixed fantastically with the citizens in the market , and flocking in and out in great numbers at the town gate . Labor and the sun have worn all the feminine charms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over these ugly faces starched and white caps two stories high , in which they encounter all sorts of weather ; they are seated on little asses , a large basket at each side , in which they carry vegetables to market , and carry back manure for the crops of the next year . The antiquities . I visited this morning a trumpery old palace of Charles V. ; also a round tower built , they say , by that great tower builder , Julius Caesar ; and returning through a solitary alley I stumbled accidentally upon a monument of more precious memory , the birthplace of the author of Paul and Virginia . It is a scrubby old hut with a bit of marble in front containing his name and day of nativity . Genius seems to have but mean notions of the dignity of birth ; Pindar was born among the vapors of Boeotia , and St. Pierre in this filthy alley of the Havre . The politics . The children here are apportioned equally and can not be disinherited . All the father can dispose of by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate , according as he has one , two , or more heirs . This kind of succession cuts up the land into small patches , and thus brings poverty on both town and country ; all the families being without capital to improve their agricultural resources . They have but little to spare to the /z/ town , and can , therefore , buy but little of its stores and manufactures ; and from inability to supply the raw materials and provisions cheap , buy this little at an enhanced price . In this way the two parties mutually beggar each other . Besides , under this system of minute divisions , the farming population increases enormously , poverty increasing in the same ratio . Two-thirds of the French are already fanners ; and in England , where farming is in so much greater perfection , the ratio is one-third . This law , too , in rendering the children independent of the father , destroys his authority and check upon their conduct ; it weakens the motives to exertion , which arise from fear of want or prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and morals . The English system makes one son only a fool , the French besots the whole family . A redundant population is the great curse of all these old countries , and under this system of subdivision a nation , unless the blessings of war or the plague intervene , becomes as multitudinous as the Chinese , eating dogs and cats , and potatoes , and hunting with cows and pigs ; a plough as in Ireland , becoming a joint stock possession , and a horse belonging to a whole neighborhood . The French , in spite of the Moscows and Waterloos , have added between five and six millions to their population of 1789 . Agriculture , to be sure , was improved by the Revolution  --  by the divisions amongst the peasantry of the national domains , and confiscated property of the nobles  --  by the abolition of tithes and game laws , and by bringing the waste land into cultivation ; but this condition is or must soon be on the reverse . In America the abundance of idle and cheap land prevents this calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , and have squeezed what sense I could /q/ out of the peasants . I find that in all branches of husbandry , a laborer here performs a fourth less work daily than in America ; and in ploughing and reaping , nearly a third . The French implements , too , are clumsy and bungling ; oxen are yoked by the horns ; harrows have wooden teeth , and the plough , mostly of wood , scratches up the earth instead of turning a furrow . Another great evil in French politics is the centralization of everything in the metropolis . In our country each borough or township is an independent community , and manages its concerns with scarce a sense of any foreign superintendence . An individual recommends himself to favor first in his village , then in his county , next in his state , and finally in the United States ; and none glimmer in the last sphere who have not shone in the first . Here this condition is reversed  --  there is a converging of all the rays into one general focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but delegated authority anywhere else . So the French provinces are out at the heels and elbows , and Paris wears its elegant and fashionable wardrobe . Your Pottsville has a hundred miles of railroad , whilst the Havre transports the whole trade of the capital by a two wheeled operation she calls the " roulage , " and her boats upon the channel carrying on the intercourse between the two greatest ; cities of the world , are about ecmal to yours , in which you cross over into Jersey to eat creams with mother Heyle . A third reason of village and country poverty is the neglect of machinery by which production may be increased with a diminution of labor . Not a railroad has yet shown its nose in this place , though it is the outlet to the foreign trade of one-third of the French territory , including the " capital with its almost a million /z/ of inhabitants . They arc cleaning their great dock today with a hundred or two of men armed with spades , whilst a machine is doing the same work upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French school reason thus : if this clumsy apparatus is superseded , our workmen will be out of employ ; besides , it is known that the increase of consumers always keeps pace with the increase of production , and you end where you began .  --  But you increase also your strength . Yes , and the difficulties of government . You give life to a greater number of human beings , and little obligations have they for the gift if they are to run the risk of being corrupted in this world and punished in the next ; and the means of corruption are greater in a crowded than a sparse population ; greater amongst an idle and luxurious than a simple and laborious people . The American public was more happy and virtuous with its three millions than with its ten millions and its railroads . If this is all true , then the country which has least fertility of soil and least skill in the arts of agriculture is the most favored by Providence ; and the best system of economy is that which teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible labor . The best employment , too , for the laborers , would be to plant cucumbers in summer , and extract the sunbeams out of them to keep themselves warm in winter . I like the system which teaches us to increase the sum of human comforts . I think it is better to live in an improved country with clean streets and neat dwellings , than to have the same means of living witji a destitution of such conveniences . I like even to starve with decent accommodations . A fourth great cause of poverty is the restriction which these nations have imposed upon their mutual /q/ intercourse , and the produce of each other 's industry . There is a total disagreement between natural reason and the custom of all countries on this subject . Nature , by giving us a diversity of soils , climates and products , has pointed out the right objects of industry , and laid all nations under obligations of dependence and intimacy upon each other , and there is a general struggle amongst all to counteract this benevolent design . France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the land producing this wine is uusuited to any other culture , yet she has so managed as to keep her wine trade stationary for the last fifty years . England buys her wine , of inferior quality , from Portugal and Spain , and carries on a greater trade with the Chinese , her antipodes , than with France , her next door neighbor . All proclaim the benefits of foreign trade , and all legislate directly , to get rid of their foreign customers . In what more direct way could France prevent the sale of her wines to Russia , Sweden and England , than by refusing their coal , iron , woolen manufactures , and other products for which they have a natural advantage , in return ? But the great struggle of all is to become independent ; and yet the very word implies the extinction of all foreign commerce . The greatest of all national blessings is assuredly that very dependence we are so eager to avoid . We can not become dependent upon a foreign nation without laying it , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of a war ? This is the very way to make a war impossible . Men do not war against their own interests . We are dependent upon Lyons for her silks , and her petitions are now pouring in daily against the impending war with America ; and many think they will go nigh to prevent it . Would not this war be more remote if the dependence were /z/ increased ? If I wished to prevent all future wars with France and England , I would begin by building a railroad from Paris to London , and removing their commercial restrictions . Each country would then improve to the uttermost that industry to which it is most fitted . Intimacies , too , would be improved , prejudices effaced , and they would become , at length , so dependent upon each other , that even should a mad or silly government involve them in a war , their mutual interests would force them to discontinue it . Of all methods of gathering taxes that of the custom house seems to me the worst . What an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what an army of spies ! what courts of admiralty ; and what an array of new crimes upon the statute book ! A custom house is a school for perjury and other vices , and where the first lessons are made easy for beginners . There is nothing one robs with so little compunction as one 's country . It is at worst only robbing thirty millions of people . A sin loses its criminality by diffusion , and may be so expanded as to be no sin at all . All the functions of a custom house are in their nature odious and vexatious . The first injunction is to refuse the traveler , wearied of the sea , the common rites of hospitality on setting his foot upon the land ; to ransack even honest women by impudent police officers , and subject honorable men to a scrutiny practised elsewhere only upon thieves . I piqued a Frenchman on aboard our ship on the venality , which I had heard of , of the French ports . He replied that he had been in the American trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our ports for the express purpose of not paying the duties . Why nothing is more easy . " There is an officer who examines ; we know each other ; he knocks off the top /q/ of the boxes , rummages the calico with great fuss and ceremony , and the silks and jewelry sleep quiet at the bottom .  --  Whoever , he says , pays more than ten per cent , of his duties in any country , is unacquainted with his business . " There is another item in European policy , the requirement of passports  --  the cost , the delays and vexatious ceremony attending it  --  that has incurred abundant reprehension , especially from American travelers ; and there certainly is no other use in such a regulation than that a set of the most despicable creatures that creep upon the earth may get a living by it . But when one is used for a long time to see things done in a certain way , one does not conceive the possibility of their being done in any other way . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger did not carry a passport about with him in America , and that we dispensed with all this array of police officers and spies , and other such impediments to traveling and the intercourse of nations , he inferred that there could be no personal security . That alone , he said , would determine him from residing in the United States . When I cited against him the example of England , he remained incredulous : and required the confirmation of a better authority . Do n't you imagine that I am going to treat you hereafter to politics . Events have not yet thickened upon my observation , and I am obliged to make use of all my resources . If I could afford to send you blank paper all the way across the Atlantic , I would have omitted these last pages : hand them over to your husband . The living here is about equal in the quality of food and price to your ' best houses of Philadelphia . The hotels are shabby in comparison with ours ; the one I vol. i.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the world 1G5G ; but the cookery and service are altogether in favor of the French . A breakfast is two francs , a dinner three , and a chamber two . You may count your daily expenses at . a dollar and a half in the best houses . The Havre is our first acquaintance coming into the continent , and its history can not be without some interest , especially to ladies who are just sighing to go to Paris . Rouen , July 3d , 1835 . What a curiosity of ugliness is a French diligence . It exceeds in this quality even our American stages . But the sacrifice of beauty is to convenience : it carries three tons of passengers and baggage , with a speed of seven miles an hour . The covpe , in front , has three seats , the inth'ieur six , md the rolonde as many in the rear ; the price decreasing in the same direction from the whole to about the half of our American prices . There are , also , three seats aloft . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world outside , the rich , the middling , and the poor . If you feel very aristocratic , you take the whole coupe to yourself , or yourself and lady , and you can be as private as you please . Each seat is numbered , and the traveler has his number on the waybill and in his pocket . A conductenr superintends baggage , &c,; and is paid extra . The team has three horses abreast in front and two in their rear , and upon one of the latter is mounted a postillion . This personage deserves a particular notice . He is immersed to his middle in a huge pair of boots , making each leg the diameter of his body ; and his body , too , is squeezed into a narrow coat , which , being buttoned to the chin , props his woeful countenance towards the firmament , so that he corresponds exactly with Ovid 's description of a man , or /q/ rather he looks like the letter Y upside down . Cracking a whip he does not regard as an acquirement but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a calm night serenades a whole village . The road to Rouen , in the diligence , has nothing in it agreeable . The land has the ordinary crops , but it is a wide waste of cultivation , without hedges , or barns , or cottages . The only relief is now and then a comfortless village , or a solitary and neglected chateau . You swallow a mouthful of dust at each breath , and you are disgusted at all the stopping places by the wailing voices of beggars , old men and women recommending themselves by decrepitude , and children by rags and nakedness . The children often run down the diligence a quarter of a mile in quest of the charitable sou . I soon got out of change , and then reasoned myself into a fit of uncharitableness . They may be unworthy , and I shall encourage vice ; besides , charity only increases the breed . What I give to these vagabonds I take from somebody else ; I should otherwise lay it out in some article of trade , and , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of beggars by relieving the old  --  reduce the industrious to mendicity by encouraging the idlers . Moreover I ca n't help all , and I wo n't help any , or , if I do help any , I will give to my own countrymen , and not to these ragamuffin Frenchmen . In this way you get along without much affecting the tranquillity of your conscience . My advice is that you come by the Seine and the steamboat . It is a passage of only eight hours , and every one extols its beautiful and romantic scenery . Rouen is the birth-place of Racine , and Fontenelle , and of Boildieu . It deserves a passing notice on their account , as also on its own . The residence of those truculent old Norman dukes , who made the world shake /z/ with fear , and gave sovereigns to some of the best nations of Europe , can not be an indifferent spot upon the globe . Indeed , we may trace to it many of our own institutions , as well as a good part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of our courts in Schuylkill county , are imported from this Old Normandy , of which Rouen is the capital . It is a fantastic old town , with earthenware tiles , and enclosed between two mountains , having a mixture of art and nature , which bring each other out finely into relief . One is delighted to see town in the country , and country in the town . Here is a large factory or hotel , and there a set of gray and tawnylooking hovels , like a village of the Potawattomies . The peasants are seen amongst the tops and chimneys of the houses , cultivating their fields on the sides and upon the summits of the hills , which are arrayed in tufts of woodland , hedges and pasturage ; and all the avenues leading to the town are beautifully over-shaded with chestnuts and elms . The Seine , too , has its fairy islands and weeping willows on its banks , and winds along through the middle of the town ; and now and then a steamboat comes up the valleys with a puffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of old Rollo . One can see such a town but once , and no one can see it so well as he who has been used to the fresh and glaring villages of our country . Rouen has ninety thousand inhabitants , a library of four thousand volumes , a gallery of paintings , and manufactures of all sorts of calico and other cotton stuffs , also of linen , bombasins and velvet shawls . More than half the population is engaged directly in these manufactures . My advice is that you sleep here one night instead'of in the diligence in running post to Paris . In your evening 's /z/ walk I invite you to step out and see Napoleon 's bridge , which has in the centre of it a fine statue of Corneille . I went to see that famous piece of venerable antiquity , the Cathedral . You have its picture in all the " Penny Magazines . " Our guide , who knows it by heart , told us his tale as follows : " Gentlemen , this is the tomb of Rollo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; had to walk on foot ; died 917.  --  Gentlemen , this is William Longsword , his son and successor ; was on the point of taking the frock to be a monk , but was basely assassinated by Araund , Count of Flanders . " ( And the devil a monk was he. )  --  " Gentlemen , this is Pierre de Breze , Grand Seneschal of Anjou and Normandy ; fell in the battle of Montlherry , 1467 ; and this is John , Duke of Bedford , Viceroy of Normandy , who died in 1438 . In this tomb , gentlemen , ( come a little nearer , ) in this tomb is deposited the Heart of Richard Cosiir de Lion ! ( a tremor ran through our bones . ) His heart is in this tomb ; his brains are in Poictiers , and the other parts of him in Kent , in Great Britain . The man who took out his brains died of it . This is the last man Richard killed , and he had killed more than one . " Here our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so animated , were suddenly decomposed and collapsed , the natural effect of inspiration . We looked then at the great bell , and the organs , and the statues of saints , most of them mutilated in the Revolution . One , without a nose , they told us was St. Dunstan ; the devil and the Jacobins having retaliated . There is a headless trunk , too , they might very well pass for St. Denis . One of the remarkable features of this church is the painting on glass , representing scriptural scenes , of which the colors seem to have grown more vivid by time , though time has destroyed the secret of their compo-se /z/ sition . The architecture is Gothic , and the grandest specimen of this order in France . Its immense fluted columns , near a hundred feet high , and ten or twelve in diameter ; its images of Christ and the Virgin , and the pictures of the Apostles and Saints , are awful and beautiful . The lightning has thought it worthy of a visit , and has overturned one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is her monument in the midst of the market square , where she was burnt .  --  It is a pedestal of twenty feet surmounted by her statue . Alongside of this trophy of French and English barbarism , instead of blushing for shame , they show you for sixpence the room in which she was imprisoned . It is damp , and has only glimmerings of light , and is altogether a horrid remnant of antiquity . Farewell to Rouen . /z/ Paris  --  Street cries  --  St. Roch  --  The Boulevards  --  Parisian lodgings  --  Manner of living  --  The grand opera  --  Taglioni  --  The public gardens  --  The Guinguettes  --  Dancing , the characteristic amusement of the French  --  Sunday dances  --  Dancing defended , from classical authority . Paris , July 4th 1835 . When one has traveled all night in a French diligence in the dog-days , and is set down next morning in the " Place Notre Dame des Victoires , " three thousand miles from one 's home  --  oh dear ! one has much less pleasure in the aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! said the " conducteur , " announcing our approach ; each one half opening his eyes , and then closing them suddenly . Four gentlemen and two ladies in a diligence bobbing their heads at each other about six of the morning , the hour in which sleep creeps so agreeably upon one 's senses , is an interesting spectacle . It was cruel to be interrupted in so tender an interview . Voila Paris ! was echoed a second time , so we awoke and looked out , except a lady who reposed gently upon my left shoulder ; who had seen Paris a thousand times , and never slept with four gentlemen perhaps in her life ; she lay still , I attentive not to awake her , until the ill-omened raven croaked a third time Paris ! A French gentleman now did the honors of the city to us strangers . " That , sir , is the @#@ Invalides ; " see how the morning rays glitter from its gilded dome . And this , which peers so proudly over the Barriere de l'Etoile , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read over the trophies  --  Marengo ! Jena ! Austerlitz ! praised the sculpture and bas-reliefs , and burst out into a great many tropes about French victories . We now passed down through the Champs Elysees , rolled along the beautiful Rue Rivoli , and arrived fast asleep upon the " Place Notre Dame des Victoires . " I advise you to sleep at St. Germains , where the steamboat will leave you , and come to Paris next morning with the imagination fresh for the enjoyment . To be wide awake improves wonderfully one 's capacity for admiration . I stood and looked about , and I felt the spirit of manhood die away within me ; and every other spirit , even curiosity . I would rather have seen one of your haycocks than the Queen . But , fortunately , here is no time for reflection . You are immediately surrounded by a score of individuals , who greet you with hats in their /z/ hands and with great officiousness , offering you all at once their services . Some are exceeding anxious you should lodge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  des chambres de toute beauii ! and others are dying to carry your baggage ; others again are eager to sell you their wares , and thrust a bit of soap , or a cane , or a pair of spectacles in your face suddenly . I mistook this for an attempt at assassination . Next I had to bow to my toes for a lodging . With the address of three hotels a mile apart , I had to pick one out of the street . I advise you not to run about town till your porter 's charges are of greater amount than the value of your baggage , but to put yourself and your trunks in a hack , and you will have at least a ride for your money ; besides , the driver is limited in his charges , and the porter is a discretion , and discretion is one of the dearest of the French virtues . Who do you think I had for a fellow traveler ? Your old acquaintance , who has lost his wife and travels to dissipate his grief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked that it was a bad day to go into Paris  --  the 4th of July ; there would be such a crowd . Recollecting with what jubilee we celebrate this day at New York , he imagined how much greater must be the confusion in Paris . He feared we should have our brains knocked out by the mob . You ca n't think what advantage it is , for one having little of this commodity of brains , to travel into foreign countries ; one grows into the reputation of a wit by not being understood . I do not mean to be arrogant in saying I am better versed , at least in our foreign relations , than my companion , and yet I was noticed on the way only as being of his suite , which I ascribe entirely to my capacity to express myself in a known tongue . As he spoke /q/ no French , I was mistaken for the interpreter to some foreign ambassador . Paris is a wilderness of tall , scraggy , and dingy houses , of irregular heights and sizes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without symmetry : a palace often the counterpart of a pig-sty ; and a cathedral next neighbor to a henroost . The streets run zig-zag , and abut against each other as if they did not know which way to run . They are paved with cubical stones of eight and ten inches , convex on the upper surface like the shell of a terrapin ; few have room for sidewalks , and where not bounded by stores , they are dark as they were under King Pepin . Some of them seem to be water tight . St. Anne , my first acquaintance , is yet clammy with mud after a week 's drought , and early in the morning when she gets up she is filthy to a degree that is indecent . The etymology of Paris is mud ; the etymology of the Bourbons is mud , and mud to the last note of time will be Paris and the Bourbons . As for the noise of the streets , I need not attempt to describe it . What idea can ears , used only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket  --  this rattling of the cabs and other vehicles over the rough stones , this rumbling of the omnibuses . For the street cries  --  one might have relief from them by a file and handsaw .  --  First , the prima donna of the fish market opens the morning : Carpes toutes fraiches ; voilii des carpes ! And then stand out of the way for the glazier : Au vilriere ! quavering down the chromatic to the lowest flat upon the scale . Next the iron-monger with his rasps , and files and augurs , which no human ears could withstand , but that his notes are happily mellowed by the seller of old clothes : Marchand de drap ! in a monotone so low and spondaic , and so loud as to /z/ make Lab I ache die of envy .. About nine is full chorus , headed by the old women and their proclamations : Horrible attentat contre la vie clu roi Louis Philippe  --  at la petite chienne de Madame la Marquise  --  tgaree a dix heures  --  L ' JJrcht'veque de Paris  --  Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et tout cela pour quatre sous ! being set loose all at the same time , tuned to different keys . All things of this earth seek , at one time or another , repose  --  all but the noise of Paris . The waves of the sea are sometimes still , but the chaos of these streets is perpetual from generation to generation ; it is the noise that never dies . Many new comers have been its victims . In time , however  --  such is the complaisance of human nature  --  we become reconciled even to this never-ending hubbub . It becomes even necessary , it is said , to one 's comforts . There are persons here who get a night-mare in a place of tranquillity and can sleep only upon the Boulevards . Paris and I are yet on ceremonious terms . I venture upon her acquaintance as one who walks upon ice : it is the boy 's first lesson of skating . I am not much versed in towns any way , and this one is ahead of my experience . In my case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did venture this morning to ask what general that was  --  a fat , decent-looking gentleman , in silk stockings , and accoutred in regimentals . That general , sir , is Prince Talleyrand 's lacquey . Soon after I inquired what house was that barn of a place . That house , sir , is the Louvre . So I must feel the ground under me . Yesterday being Sunday , ( which I found out by the almanac , ) I went to St. Roch 's . I had the luck to hit upon the fashionable church ; but the preacher was the god of dulness . The world , he says , is growing worse and worse ; we being greater rogues than our /q/ ancestors , and about to produce a worse set of rogues than ourselves . " The antichrist is already come . " If he had said the antichrist of wit , anybody would have believed him  --  and yet this is the very pulpit from which the Bossuets and Bourdaloues used to preach . The house was filled almost entirely with women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country but the fair sex . The worshipers seem intent enough upon their devotions , but the wide avenues at the sides are filled with a crowd of idle , curious and disorderly spectators . Give me a French church ; one walks in here booted and spurred , looks at the pretty women and the pictures , whistles a tune , if one chooses , and then walks out again . They have not spoiled the architectural beauty of St. Roch 's by pews and galleries . The walls are adorned splendidly with paintings , and here and there are groups of statuary ; and the altar being finely gilt and illuminated looks , magnificently . When I build a church I will decorate it somewhat in this manner . It is good to imitate nature as much as one can in all things , and she has set us the example in this . She has adorned her great temple , the world , with green fields and fragrant flowers , and its superb dome , the firmament , with stars . I walked in the Tuileries after church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretty women . The pretty women were not naked . I sat down awhile by the goddess of wisdom : This is the sum of my adventures . Oh , no ! I ventured also a walk last night upon the Boulevards , about twilight . How adorable is the Madelaine ! While staring at this church , ( for staring is the only expression of countenance one pretends to the first week of Paris , ) a little girl , but not a little db SULTANAS OF THE BOULEVARDS. graceful and pretty , presented me a bouquet . But , my dear , I have no change . " Mais , qu'est ce que cela fait ? " and she turned it about with her taper fingers , and fixed it and unfixed it , though there were but two leaves and a rose bud , and then arranged it in a button hole , showing all the while her pearly teeth and laughing black eyes . She had the finesse to gain admiration for her charms without seeming to court it . We now walked on a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attire , and of very easy , unembarrassed manners , who also said very obliging things to us , walking along side . There is a kind of men in New England , who can not be beaten out of the dignity of a walk ; who would rather die than be seen running , which is perhaps the reason they won the battle of Bunker 's Hill . Nowjf you would represent to yourself something very comical , you must imagine my companion , straight-laced in his gravity , escorted by one of these Sultanas of the Boulevards , all betawdried and rustling in her silks  - -  Man petit coeur !  --  Mon petit ami !  --  Venez done ! At last turning suddenly upon her , with a look and air of menace and expostulation , he invoked her in a most solemn manner to depart ; though she understood not a word of the exorcism , she obeyed instantly ; the gesture and tone being significant enough ; and she went off , as evil spirits do usually in such cases , murmuring : " Pourquoi me tenir done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fait perdre au moins deux messieurs . " We now descended by the Rue St. Anne towards our lodgings , talking as we went to prevent thinking  --  for we are both very tender-hearted , so far from home  --  he of his Yankee wife , how industrious , how economical , and how she has resigned all the intercourse /z/ and pleasures of the world , to teach the little children their catechism and their astronomy ; and I of our dear little wives of Schuylkill , so amiable , so cheerful , tempering their duties with amusements , and not forgetting the claims of society  --  when suddenly we observed in a dark corner , reached only by a few rays of a distant lamp , a queer old woman , seated , her knees and chin together , and rocking herself on a chair . She rose up in the face of my companion , who knows no French , with an immense gabble : Des demoiselles Ires distinguees f  --  jolies comme des anges ! and instantly we were hemmed round with a fluttering troupe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jlmbassadeurs , and locked our doors for the night . Please direct your letters to this house , No. 64 Rue St. Jinne . Hotel des Ambassadeurs , July 6th , 1S35 . I must tell you how one lodges in Paris . A hotel is a huge edifice mostly in form of a parallelogram , and built around a paved court yard , which serves as a landing for carriages as well as for persons on foot , and leads up to the apartments by one or more staircases . In the centre of the front wall is a wide door ( a porte cochlre ) opening from the street ; and just inside a lodge ( a concierge ) and a porter , who wakes night and day over the concerns of the establishment . This porter is an important individual , holding about the same place in a Paris hotel that Cerberus holds  --  ( I leave you a place for the rhyme . ) He is usually a great rogue , a spy of the government , and a shoemaker ; cobbles the holes he makes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your stockings . He is always a bad enemy and a useful friend , and you purchase his good will by money and condescensions. vol. t.  --  4 /z/ as a first minister 's . He lets your rooms , he attends them , receives parcels , letters , messages , runs errands , answers your visits , and fines you a shilling if you stay out after twelve ; and his relation with many lodgers enables him to give you these services , I am ashamed to tell you how cheap . By proper attentions , also , to his wife , there will come to your bed every morning , at the hour you appoint , a cup of coffee or tea , and the entertainment of the lady 's conversation while you sip it . Each story of a hotel is divided into apartments and rooms ; that is , accommodation for whole families or individuals ; distinction , and of course price , decreasing upwards . For example , he who lives a story lower down thinks himself above you , and you in return consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rue Castiglione or Rivoli is equal in rank to a second story anywhere else . The porter 's Lodge is a little niche about eight feet square . It pays no rent , but receives a salary , usually of sixty dollars a year , from the proprietor . Our porter is a man of several talents . He tunes pianos for ten sous , and plays at the " Petit Lazari " of a night for two francs . Indeed his whole family plays ; his grandmother plays the " Mother of the Gracchi. - " He takes care , too , of his wife 's father , but he dresses him up as a Pair de France , or a Doge , and makes a good deal out of him also . Besides he has a dog , which he expects soon to play the " Chien de Montargis , " he is studying ; and a magpie which plays already in the " Pie Voleuse . " It is by these several industries that he is enabled to clean my boots once a day , take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bachelor , at six francs a month ; and he has grown into good circumstances . But , alas ! impartial fate , that /q/ knocks at the Porter 's Lodge , as at the gates of the Louvre !  --  His only son , in playing Collin last winter , a shepherd 's part in a vaudeville , had to wear a pair of white muslin breeches in the middle of the inclement season ; he took cold and died of a fluxion de poitrine ! ' The mother wept in telling this story , and . then , some one coming in , she smiled . One is usually a little shy of these hotels at first sight ; especially if one comes from the Broad Mountain . You take hold of an unwieldy knocker , you lift it up cautiously , and open flies the door six inches ; you then push yourself through , and look about with a kind of a suspicious and sheepish look , and you see no one . At length you discover an individual , who will not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather far ; then he will accost you : Que demandez-vous , Monsieur ?  --  I wish to see Mr. Smith . Monsieur ?  - -  Monsieur , il ne demure pas ici  --  Que tu es bete ! exclaims the wife , c'est Monsieur Smit . Qui , oui , out  --  au quatrieme , Monsieur , audessus de V entresol ; and with this information , of which you understand not a syllable , you proceed up stairs , and there you ring all the bells to the garret ; but . no one knows Mr. Smith . The houses here are by no means simple and uniform as with us . The American houses are built , as ladies are dressed , all one way . First , there is a pair of rival saloons , which give themselves the air of parlors ; and then there is a dining-room , and corresponding chambers above to the third or fourth story ; and an entry runs through the middle or alongside without stopping ; at the farthest end of which is the kitchen ; so that one always stands upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has traveled this distance to let one in . How many dinners frozen in their own /z/ sauces , how many lovers chilled , hy this refrigeratory process !  --  Here , if you just look at the knocker , the door , as if by some invisible hand , flies open ; and when you descend , if you say " Cordon " just as AH Baba said " Sesame , " the door opens and delivers you to the street . The houses , too , have private rooms and secret doors , and intricate passages ; and one can be said to be at home in one 's own house . A thief designing to rob has to study beforehand the topography of each one , without which he can no more unravel it than the Apocalypse . There are closets , too , and doors in many of the rooms unseen by the naked eye . Is a gentleman likely to be intruded on by the bailiff ' ? he sinks into the earth ; and a lady , if surprised in her dishabille or any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellings are known in Paris . A style which gives entire families and individuals , at a price that would procure them very mean separate lodgings , the air of living in a great castle ; and they escape by it , all that emulation about houses , and door servants , and street display , which brings so much fuss and expense in our cities . To climb up to the second or third story is , to be sure , inconvenient ; but once there your climbing ends . Parlors , bed-rooms , kitchen and all the rest are on the same level . Moreover , climbing is a disposition of our nature . " In our proper motion we ascend . " See with what avidity we climb when we are boys ; and we climb when we are old , because it reminds us of our boyhood . I have no doubt that the daily habit of climbing , too , has a good moral influence ; it gives one dispositions to rise in the world . I ought to remark here that persons in honest circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in favor of the French style not a little that it /q/ improves the quality at least of one class of lodgers . Mean houses degrade men 's habits , and lower their opinions of living . As for me , I like this Paris way , but I do n't know why . I like to see myself under the same roof with my neighbors . One of them is a pretty woman with the prettiest little foot imaginable ; and only think of meeting this little foot , with which one has no personal acquaintance , three or four times a day on the staircase ! Indeed , the solitude of a private dwelling begins to seem quite distressing . To be always with people one knows ! It paralyzes activity , breeds selfishness and other disagreeable qualities . Solitary life has its vices , too , as well as any other . On the other hand a comriiunity of living expands one 's benevolent affections , begets hospitality , mutual forbearance , politeness , respect for public opinion , and keeps cross husbands from beating their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French hotel , she would not have kept throwing things out of the window upon her husband 's head . The domestic virtues are , to be sure , well enough in their way ; but they are dull , and unless kept in countenance by good company , they go too soon to bed . Indeed , that word " home , " so sacred in the mouths of Englishmen , often means little else than dozing in an arm-chair , listening to the squeaking of children , or dying of the vapors ; at all events the English are the people of the world most inclined to leave these sanctities of home . Here they are by hundreds , running in quest of happiness all about Europe . But to return . My object , in setting out , was to show you as nearly as possible my manner of living in the street of St. Anne . I have a chambre de garqon au second ; this means a bachelor 's room in the third story . /z/ As companions I have General Kellerman , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little Bonaparte about three inches long ; and on a round table , with a marble cover , there are an old Rabelais and a Seneca 's Maxims , with manuscript notes on the margin , and a Bible open at Jeremiah . The floor is a kind of brick pavement , upon which a servant performs a series of rubbings , every morning with a brush attached to his right foot ; which gives it a slippery and mahogany surface . We have a livery stable also in the yard , and several persons lodge here for the benefit of the smell ; it being good against the consumption . Of the staircase I say nothing now , as I intend some day to write a treatise upon French Staircases . This one has not been washed ever , unless by some accident such as Noah 's flood . Indeed the less one says of French cleanliness in the way of houses , the better . Our landlady appears no more delighted with a clean floor , than an antiquary would be with a scoured shield ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumes to be better than this . I ought to remark here that servants do not run about from one garret to another as they do in America . A French servant is transmitted to posterity . Our coachman says he has been in this family several hundred years . When one can not travel in the highway of life with a fashionable equipage , it is pleasant to steal along its secret path unnoticed . A great man is so jostled by the throng that either he can not think at all , or in gathering its silly admiration , so occupied with intrigues and mere personal vanities , that the good qualities of his understanding are perverted , and he loses at length his taste for innocent enjoyments . But traveling in this sober unambitious way , one may gather /z/ flowers by the road side ; one has leisure for the contemplation of useful and agreeable things ; and is not obliged to follow absurd fashion , or keep up troublesome appearances ; and one can get into low company when one pleases , without being suspected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all over the country ; I can get sometimes into a coucou , and ride out to St. Germains , or stroll unconcerned through the markets and ask the price of fruits ; of cassolettes , muscats and jargonelles , and of grapes ; and I can eat a bunch or two upon the pavement , just fresh from Fontainbleau ; and do a great many innocent things which persons of distinction dare not do . This is the life of those who lodge at the " Hotel des Ambassadeurs . " Here are two sheets filled , with what meagre events ! and how much below the dignity of history ! But I console myself that trifles , like domestic anecdotes , are often the most characteristic . I will be your Boswell to the city of Paris . Who knows but I may fancy to make some sort of a book from these letters at my return home ? If you think such a design excusable , pray , save them from the flames . I write them as notes upon the field of battle . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 7th . I went with my Yankee companion last night to the Grand Opera ; and at the risk of being enormously long , I am going to add a postscript ; for it is a wet day , and I have no better way to beguile the lazy twenty-four hours . They admit the spectators to a French theatre in files of two between high railings , and under the grim and bearded authority of the police , which prevents crowding and disorder ; and whoever wishes to /z/ go in , not having a seat provided , " makes tail , " as they call it , by entering the file in the rear . A number of speculators also stand in the ranks at an early hour , and sell out their places at an advance to the more tardy , so that you have always this resort to obtain a good enough seat . In approaching the house persons will offer you tickets with great importunity in the streets . With one of these which , by cheapening a little , I got at double price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Piece ; voild le programme ! These are two phrases  --  meaning only the analysis and bill of the play , at two sous  --  which you will hear croaked with the most obstreperous discord through the house , in the intervals of the performance , to bring out Monsieur Auber and Scribe , and the Donnas . It is probably for the same reason the owls are permitted to sing in the night , to bring out the nightingales.  --  The opera last night was " Robert le Diable , "  --  void Panalise de la piece . There was the representation of a grave-yard and a resurrection ; and the ghosts , at least two hundred , flocked out of the ground in white frocks and silk stockings , and they squeaked and gibbered all over the stage . Then they asked one another out to dance , and performed the most fashionable ballets of their country , certainly , in a manner very creditable to the other world . And while these waltzed and quadrilled , another set were entertaining themselves with elegant and fashionable amusements ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing at whist upon a tombstone , and others again were jumping the rope over a winding sheet ; when suddenly they all gave a screech and skulked into their graves ; there was a flutter through the house , the music announcing some great event , and /q/ at length , amidst a burst of acclamations , Mademoiselle Taglioni stood upon the margin of the scene . She seemed to have alighted there from some other sphere . I expected to be little pleased with this lady , I had heard such frequent praises of her accomplishments , but was disappointed . Her exceeding beauty surpasses the most excessive eulogy . Her dance is the whole rhetoric of pantomime ; its movements , pauses and attitudes in their purest Attic simplicity , chastity and urbanity . She has a power over the feelings which you will be unwilling to concede to her art . She will make your heart beat with joy : she will make you weep by the sole eloquence of her limbs . What inimitable grace ! In all she attempts you will love her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands still you will wish her a statue , that she may stand still always ; or if she moves you will wish her a wave of the sea that she may do nothing but that  --  " move still , still so , and own no other function . "  --  To me she appeared last night to have filled up entirely the illusion of the play  --  to have shuffled off this gross and clumsy humanity , and to belong to some more airy and spiritual world . But my companion , who is a professor , and a little ecclesiastical , and bred in that most undancing country , New England , was scandalized at the whole performance . He is of the old school , and has ancient notions of the stage , and does not approve this modern way of " holding the mirror up to nature . " He was displeased especially at the scantiness of the lady 's wardrobe . I was born farther south , and could better bear it . The art of dressing has been carried often by the ladies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a great wit said in his day , a woman was " the least part of herself . " Taglioni 's sins , it is true , do not lie on this /z/ side of the category ; she produced last evening nothing but herself  --  Mademoiselle Taglioni in the abstract . Ovid would not have complained of her . Her lower limbs wore a light silk , imitating nature with undistinguishable nicety , and her bosom a thin gauze which just relieved the eye , as you have seen a fine fleecy cloud hang upon the dazzling sun . But . She did not , moreover , exceed what the courtesy of nations has permitted , and what is necessary to the proper exhibition of her art . They call this French opera the " Academie Royale de Musique " also the " Franc-ais " in contradistinction with the " Italien ; " finally the " Grand Opera ; " this latter name because it has a greater quantity of thunder and lightning , of pasteboard seas , of paper snow storms , and dragons that spit fire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any theatre of Europe . It is certain its " corps de ballet " can outdance all the world put together . Mercy ! how deficient we are in our country in these elegant accomplishments . In many things we are still in our infancy , in dancing we are not yet born . We have , it is true , our " balances , " and " chasses , " and back-tu-backs , and our women do throw a great deal of soul into their little feet  --  as on a " birth-night , " or an " Eighth of January , " or the like ;  --  but the Grand Opera , the Opera Franpais , the Academie Royale de Musique ! J2h , via foi , e'est lit tine autre affaire ! You have read , and so has everybody , of the " dancing Greeks ; " of Thespis , so described by Herodotus , who used to dance on his head , his feet all the while dangling in the air ; of the " Gaditanian girls , " so sung by /q/ Anacreon ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing Dervishes , " who danced their religion like our Shakers ; of the pantomimic dances , described by Raynal , and the Turkish Almas , by the " sweet Mary Montague ; " and finally , every one lias heard of the " Age of Voltaire , the King of Prussia and Vestris "  - -  well , all this is outdanced by Taglioni and the Grand Opera . This opera has seats for two thousand spectators , besides an immense saloon ( two hundred feet by fifty ) where a great number of fashionables , to relieve their ears from the noise of the singing , promenade themselves magnificently during the whole evening , under the light of brilliant lustres , and where the walls , wainscotled with mirrors , multiply their numbers and charms to infinity .  --  I may as well continue dancing through the rest of this page . Dancing , you know , is a characteristic amusement of the French , and you may suppose they have accommodations to gratify their taste to its fullest extent . There are elegant rotundas for dancing in nearly all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waxhal d'Ete , " and the " Chaumiere de Mont Parnasse . " Besides there are " Guinguettes " at every Barriere ; and in the " Village Fetes , " which endure the whole summer , dancing is the chief amusement ; and public ball-rooms are distributed through every quarter of Paris , suited to every one 's rank and fortune . The best society of Paris go to the balls of Uanelah , Auteuil and St. Cloud . The theatres , too , are converted into ball-rooms , especially for the masquerades , from the beginning to the end of the Carnival . I hired a cabriolet and driver the other night , and , went with a lady from New Orleans , to see the most /z/ famous of the " Guinguettes . " Here all the little world seemed to me completely and reasonably happy ; behaving with all the decency , and dancing with almost the grace of high life . We visited half a dozen , paying only ten sous at each for admission . I must not tell you it was Sunday night ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without any one to help you ; the clergy find a great deal of trouble to keep it themselves here , there is so little encouragement . On Sunday only these places are seen to advantage . I am very far from approving of dancing on this day , if one can help it ; but I have no doubt that in a city like Paris , the dancers are more taken from the tavern and ginshops than from the churches . I do not approve , either , of the absolute denunciation this elegant amusement incurs from many of our religious classes in America . If human virtues are put up at too high a price , no one will bid for them . Not a word is said against dancing in the Old or New Testament , and a great deal in favor . Miriam danced , you know how prettily ; and David danced " before the Lord with all his might ; " to be sure the manner of his dancing was not quite so commendable , according to the fashion of our climates . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedantry pardessus la tete . The Greeks ascribe to dancing a celestial origin , and they admitted it even amongst the accomplishments and amusements of their divinities . The graces are represented almost always , in the attitude of dancing ; and Apollo , the most amiable of the gods , and the god of wisdom , too , is called by Pindar the " dancer . " Indeed , I could show you , if I pleased , that Jupiter himself sometimes took part in a cotillon , and on one occasion danced a gavot. /q/ There it is proved to yon from an ancient Greek poet . 1 could show you , too , that Epaminondas , amongst his rare qualities , is praised by Cornelius Nepos for his skill in dancing ; and that Themistocles , in an evening party at Athens , passed for a clown for refusing to take a share in a dance . But it is so foppish to quote Greek and to be talking to women about the ancients .

And if you wo n't believe all this , I will take you to see a negro holiday on the Mississippi .  --  Now this is enough about dancing ; it is very late , and I must dance off to bed . It is necessary to be as much in love with dancing as I am to preach so pedantically about it as I have in this postscript .  --  Its enormous length , when you have seen Mademoiselle Taglioni , wants no apology . When you do see her , take care her legs do n't get into your head ; they kept capering in mine all last night . /z/ The Boulevards  --  Boulevard Madelaine  --  Boulevard des Capacities  - -  Boulevard Italien  --  Monsieur Careme  --  Splendid cafes  --  The baths  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratteur  --  The commissionnaire  --  Boulevard du Temple  --  Scene at the Ambigu Comique  --  Sir Sydney Smith  --  Monsieur de Paris  - -  The Cafe Turc  --  The fountains  --  Recollections of the Bastille  - -  The Halle aux Bles  --  The Bicetre  --  Boulevard du Mont Parnasse . Paris , July , 1835 . The main street of Paris , and one of the most remarkable streets of the whole world , is the Boulevard . It runs from near the centre towards the east , and coils around the circumference of the city . Its adjacent houses are large , black and irregular in height , resembling at a distance battlements or turreted castles . Its course is zig-zag , and each section has a different name and different pursuits ; so that it presents you a new face and character ; a new and picturesque scene , at every quarter of a mile . This does not please , at first sight , an eye formed upon our Quaker simplicity of Philadelphia , but it is approved by the general taste . Our Broadways and Chestnut streets and Regent streets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Its sidewalks are delightfully wide , and overshaded with elms . Before the visits of the allies it had eight miles of trees ; a kind of ornament that is held in better esteem in European than in American cities . Our ancestors took a dislike to trees , from having so much grubbing at their original forests , and their enmity has been infused /q/ into the blood . To cut down a tree is now a hereditarypassion ; I have often spent whole days in its gratuitous indulgence . A squatter of the back woods begins byfelling the trees indiscriminately ; and he is most honored , as those first Germans we read of in Ceesar , who has made the widest devastation around his dwelling . Your Pottsville , which ten years ago was a forest , has to-day not a fig leaf to cover its nakedness . Here is a gentleman just going to Philadelphia , who will hand you this letter ; I send also a map of Paris , that I may have your company on such rambles as 1 may chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk upon the Boulevards . On the west end is the Madelaine in full view of the street . While the other monuments of Paris are " dim with the mist of years , " this stands like a new dressed bride in white and glowing marble ; its architecture fresh from the age of Pericles . This church became pagan in the Revolution ; it was for a while the " Temple of Glory , " and has returned to the true Catholic faith . Three mornings of the week , you will find at its feet half an acre in urns , baskets and hedges , of all that nature has prettiest in her magazine of flowers ; delighting the eye by their tasteful combination of colors , and embalming the air with their fragrance . I am sorry you are not a gentleman , I could describe to you so feelingly the flower girl  --  her fichu too narrow by an inch ; her frock rumpled and disordered , and hung upon her as if by the graces . Her laughing eyes emulate the diamond ; and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the Boulevard Madelaine . On the south side a sad looking garden occupies its whole length . I asked of a Frenchman whose it was ; he says " it is the Minister of Strange /z/ Affairs . " It is the hotel of Monsieur Thiers , who wrote a book about the Revolution , and a " Treatise upon Wigs , " and is now Minister des affaires etrangtres . I do not like him , this Mr. Thiers. 1 experienced yesterday some impudence and pertness from one of the clerks of his office ; and these underlings , you know , represent usually the qualifications of their masters in such particulars . To leave Paris for London requires your passport to be signed at the Police Office , at the American and English Ambassadors , and at the French Minister 's . At the first office you are set down with a motley crew upon a bench , and there you sit , like one of those Virtues in front of the " Palais Bourbon , " often an hour or two , until your name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize it , and you keep sitting on unless provided with an interpreter . There is not anything in nature so unlike itself as one 's name Frenchified  - -  even a monosyllable . As for " John , " it changes genders altogether , and becomes " Jean " To the last three officers you pay the valedictory compliment of thirty francs , and get their impudence into the bargain . You will always find persons about your lodgings , called " fucteurs " ( they should be called benefactors , ) who will do all this for you , for a small consideration , much better than you can do it yourself . You are now on the Boulevard des Capucines . It is raised about thirty feet , and the houses on the left side for a quarter of a mile are left in the valley . All the high life here is below stairs . On the right side , you see apparently one of the happiest of human beings , the " marchand des chiens , " who sells little dogs and parrots . "  --  # six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs / "  --  with a gentle voice , half afraid some one /z/ might hear him ; he has become attached to his animals , and feels a sorrow to part with them . He feels as you for your chickens yon have fed every day , when you must kill them for dinner . Poor little Azor , and Zemire ! Only think of seeing them no more ! He sells them a few francs cheaper , when the purchaser is rich and likely to treat them well . The French , especially the women , dote upon dogs beyond the example of all other nations , and yet have the nastiest race of curs upon the earth . A dog , they say , loves his master the more he is a vagabond , and the French , in return , love their dogs the more they are shabby . What I would give for a few of those eloquent bow woivs , which resound in the night from an American barn-yard , and which protect so securely one 's little wife from the thieves and the lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your hat ; this is one of the choice and preeminent spots of the French capital ; the very seat almost of the pleasures and amusements of Europe ; it is the Boulevard Italian . It is here that gentlemen and ladies , when the labors of the day have closed , and not a care intrudes to distract the mind from the great business of deglutition and digestion , assemble of an evening to discuss the immense importance of a good dinner . Men make splendid reputations here which live after them by the invention of a single soup . It is here they make the sauces in which one might eat his own grandfather . This place was respected by the Holy Alliance ; and Lord Wellington , in 1815 , pitched his Marquee upon the Boulevard Italien . It is in vain to expect perfection in an art unless we honor those who exercise its functions . Monsieur Careme , ( whom I mention for the sake of honor , and /z/ who lives close by here in the Rue Lafitte , ) now cook to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most considerable persons of this age ; holding a high gentlemanly rank , and living in an enviable condition of opulence and splendor . He keeps his carriage , takes his airings of an evening , has his country seat , and his box at the opera ; and has , indeed , every attribute requisite to make a gentleman in almost any country . The number of officers attached to his staff is greater than of any general of the present regime ; his assistant roaster has a salary above our President of the United States . It is by this honorable recompense of merit that through all the vicissitudes of her various fortunes , France has still maintained unimpaired her great prerogative of teaching the nations how.to cook . Monsieur de Careme is worthy a particular notice . He had an ancestor who was  --  chef de cuisine " of the Vatican , and invented a soupe maigre for his Holiness ; and another , who was cook to the Autocratrixof all the Russias . How talents do run in some families ! Himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulevard Italien , he invented a sauce piquanle , when quite a young man ; and by a regular cultivation of his fine natural powers , he has reached a degree of perfection in his art , which has long since set envy and rivalship at defiance . The truth is that a great cook is as rare a miracle as a great poet . It is well known that Claude Lorraine could not succeed in pastry with all his genius . " Et Balzac et Malherbe , si savans en bon mots , En cuisine peut-etre n'aurait ete que des sots . " To whom , think you , does the British nation owe those Attic suppers , those feasts of the gods , which so /q/ surprised the allied monarchs , and brought so much glory upon his late majesty ? To Monsieur de Careme ; and to whom do you think the Baron Rothschild owes those clear and unclouded faculties with which he outfinanciers all Europe and America ? Certes , to Monsieur de Careme . All the Baron has to do is to dine ; digestion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly every European court ; and it was only upon the most urgent solicitations that he consented to reside eight months at Carlton House ; a portion of his life upon which he looks back with much displeasure and repentance , and the remnant of his dayt he designs to consecrate with the greater zeal on this account to the honor and interests of his native country . He is now preparing a digest of his art , after the manner of the Code Napoleon ; and eminent critics , to whom he has communicated his work , pronounce it excellent both for its literary and culinary merits . To this Boulevard , also , the sweetmeat part of the creation resort about twilight to their creams and lemonades and eau sucree . They seat themselves upon both margins of the trottoir upon chairs , leaving an interval between for the successive waves of pedestrians , who are also attracted hither by the fashion and elegance of the place . How charming , of a summer evening , to sit you down here upon one chair and put your feet upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; or to walk up and down and eye the double row of belles seated amidst the splendor of the gas-lamps , and who seem very sorry not to have lived at the Rape of the Sabines . In this group are examples of nearly all that is extant of the human species . I have seen a Bedouin of the Mer Rouge stumble upon a great ambassador from the Neva ; and a Mandarin of the // Loo-koo run foul of an ex-schoolmaster of the Mahantongo . If any one is missing from your mines of Shamoken , come hither , and you will find him seated on a straw-bottomed chair on the Boulevard Italien . These splendid cafes are multiplied by mirrors , and being open , or separated only by panels of glass , appear to form but a single tableau with the street , and those outside and in , seem parts of the same company . I recommend you the Cafe de Paris , the Cafe Hardi , the Cafe Veron , if you wish to mix with the fashionable and merry world . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millionaires , the noblesse de la Bourse , who smooth their cares with fat dinners and good wines , where else in the world should you go but to ToytonVs ? There are not two Tortonis upon the earth . A dinner you may get at the Rocher Cancale , but a breakfast !  --  it is to be had nowhere in all Europe out of Tortoni 's . The ladies of high and fashionable life stop here before the door , and are served with ices by liveried waiters elegantly in their barouches ; they can not think of venturing in , there are so many more gentlemen outside . You will see here , both in and out , the most egregious cockneys of Europe , the beaux Brummels and the beaux Nashes , the " Flashes , " and " Full-Swells " of London town , and in elegant apposition , the Parisian exquisites . Was there ever anything so beautiful !  --  No , d'Aonnewr . His boots are of Evrat , his coat Staub , vest Moreau , gloves and cravat Walker , and hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will please give the superiority to the French . To make an elegant fop is more than the barber 's business ; nature herself must have a finger in the composition . Besides , if a man is born a fool , he is /q/ a greater fool in Paris than elsewhere , there are such opportunities for acquirement . These are the French people . Do n't you hate to see so many ninnies in mustaches ? If I had not the great Marlborough , and Bonaparte , and Apollo , on my side , all three un whiskered , I would go home in the next packet . The moment one has made one 's debut here in the world of beards , one is a man , and there is no manhood , founded on any other pretensions , that can dispense with this main qualification . It is the one eminent criterion of all merit ; it is a diploma ; a bill of credit as current as in the days of Albuquerque ; it is promotion in the army , in the diplomacy , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grisly recommendation . One loves the women just because they have no beards on their faces . Otherwise  --  a la barbe prhs  --  the French are well enough . It is the same kind of population , nearly , that one meets by the gross in New York and everywhere else . I looked about for Monsieur Dablancour , but could see nothing of him . In a foreign country a man is always a caricature of himself . The French are here in their own element , and swim in it naturally . One is always awkward from the very sense of not knowing foreign customs ; and always ridiculous abroad because every thing is ridiculous which departs from common and inveterate habit , and nothing is ridiculous which conforms with it . In a nation of apes it is becoming to be an ape . If you place a man of sense in a company of fools , it is the man of sense who is embarrassed and looks foolish . If one traveled into Timbuctoo I presume one would feel very foolish for being white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Boulevard Italien . If you love baths of oriental luxury , /z/ here are the Bains Chinois just opposite . Personal cleanliness is the French virtue par excellence . Bathing in other countries is a luxury , in France a necessity . Hot baths as good as yours at Swaim 's are at fifteen sous . The Bains Vigiers , at twenty sous a bath , made their proprietor a count . You can have baths here simple and compound , inodorous and aromatic , with cold or warm , or clarified or Seine water ; and you have them with naked floors and ungarnished walls , and with all the luxury of tapestry and lounges ; baths double and single , with and without attendance , with a whole skin , or flayed alive with friction . And besides these baths ordinary and extraordinary  --  Russian , Turkish , and Chinese  --  you have baths specific against all human infirmities ; baths alcalic , sulphurous , fumigatory , oleaginous , and antiphlogistic . All the mineral waters of Europe pour themselves at your feet in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginsnack ; manufactured , every one of them , in the street of the University , Gros Caillou , No. 21 . And this is not all ; there is the " ambulatory bath , " which walks into your bedside , and embracing you , walks out again at thirty sous . C'est tin vraipays de Cocagne , que ce Paris . And if you love gewgaws , gingumbobs , and pretty shop girls , why , here they are at the Bazaar . The French take care , as no other people , to furnish such places with pretty women , and they turn their influence , as women , to the account of the shop . The English , I have heard , put all their deformities into their bazaars , that customers , they say , may attend to the other merchandise . The French way is the more sensible . I have been ruined already several times by the same shop girl  --  caressing and caressing each of one 's fingers , as she tries on a pair of gloves one do n't want . /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the printshops of Paris ? Why , here . You can buy here Calypsos and Cleopatras all naked , with little French faces ; and Scipios and Caesars , and other marshals of the Empire , from any price down to three sous a piece . Finally , if you love the best pates in this world , we will just step over into the Passage Panorama to Madame Felix 's  --  Sweet Passage Panorama ! How often have I walked up and down beneath the crystal roof as the dusky evening came on , with arms folded , and in the narcotic influence of a choice Havana , forgotten all  --  all but that a yawning gulf lies between me and my friends and native country . Give a sou to this little Savoyard with the smiling face , who sweeps the crossings . " Jlh , Madame , regardez dans votre petite poche si vons n'avez pas tin petit sou a me donner / " How can you refuse him ? If you do , he will make you just the same thankful bow in the best forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montmartre . Here are cashmeres and silks from Arabia ; merinos veritable barbe de Pacha , chalys , a mousseline Thibet , Pondicherry , unis et broche , and pocket handkerchiefs at two sous .  --  Ah , come along ! And here are six pairs of ladies ' legs , showing at the window the silk stocking . How gracefully gartered ! And from above how the white curtain falls down modestly in front almost to the knee . Do n't be in such a hurry !  --  they are twice as natural as living legs ! And here are dolls brevetted by the king , and milliners aprix fixe , at a fixed price , and here is M. J ) ulosq , fabricant de sac en papier , manufacturer of little **27;85;TOOLONG to his majesty ; and Madame Raggi , who lets out Venuses and other goddesses to the drawing-schools , at two sous an /z/ hour . And look at this shop of women 's ready-made articles . Here one can be dressed cap-a-pie for four francs and eleven centimes  --  ( three-quarters of a dollar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings and chemise !  --  I should like to see any woman go naked in Paris . A student , also , can buy here a library on the street.from a quarter of a mile of books , at six sous a volume . I have just bought Rousseau in calf , octavo , at ten sous ! Since the last Revolution commerce has taken a new spirit ; the bourgeois blood lias got uppermost . The greatest barons now are the Rothschilds , and the greatest ministers the Lafittes . The style , too , has risen to the level of the new bureaucratic nobility . The shopkeeper of these times is at your service , a commere , ant , his " boutique " is a magazin , his " contoir " his bureau , and his " pratique " his clientelle . Even the signs , as you see , speak a magnificent language . It is the " Magazin du Doge de Venise " or " Magazin du Zodiaque "  --  " des Vepres Siciliennes , " or " Grand Magazin de Nouveaute . " And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the language is of course worthy of a Doge ; it is u au rabais par cessation de commerce . " The Bourse is now a monument of the capital , and disputes rank with the Louvre . The " petit Marquis " is the banker 's son , and the marshals of the empire are sold " second hand ! " in the frippery market . I intended to write you in English ; but the French creeps in in spite of me ; I shall be as hermaphrodite as my Lady Morgan . This is one of the prettiest of the Boulevards , and you will see here a great many fine women en promenade of a morning , about twelve . When a French lady walks out , she always takes at one side her caniche by a string , and at the other , sometimes , a beau without a string . MORNING WALKS . Gl In either way she monopolizes the whole street , and you are continually getting between her and the pnppy very much to your inconvenience ; for if you offend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yon very likely have to meet her gallant in the Forest of Bondy , next morning . But you can turn this evil sometimes to advantage . If you see , for instance , a pretty woman alone , with her curry companion , you can just walk on , " commercing with the skies " till the lady gets one side of you and the dog the other ; this will give you the opportunity of begging her pardon , of patting and stroking the dog a little ; it may break the ice toward an acquaintance ; or , if the place be convenient to fall , you had better let her trip you up , and then she will be very sorry .  --  If you think it is a little thing to get a pretty woman 's pity on your side , you are very much mistaken . Let me introduce you to this shoe-black . He has , as you see , a little box , a brush or two in it , and blacking , and a fixture on top for a foot ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brushes off the mud to the soles of your feet , and shows you your own features in your boots for three sous . This one has - just dissolved an ancient firm , and his advertisement , which he calls a " prospectus , " standing here so prim upon a board , announces the event . The partnership is dissolved , but the whole " personnel , " he says , of the establishment remains with the present proprietor ; and M. Baradaque , ex-partner , has also the honor to inform us that he has transported the " appareil de son etablissenienV to the " Place de la Bourse , une desphtsjolies locations de la ville . " - The " Decrotteur en chef , " at the Palais Royal , and other places of fashion , has his assistants , and serves a dozen or two of customers at a time . He has a shop furnished with cloth-covered benches in amphitheatre , as vol. i.  --  6 /z/ at the Chamber of Deputies , with a long horizontal iron support for the foot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit , monsieur , que e'est d'aprcs Teniers  - -  celui , monsieur ? , c'esl aprhs Vandyke " and there are newspapers and reviews ; so that to polish a gentleman 's boots and his understanding are parts of the same process . There is a variety of other little trades , and industries , which derive their chief means of life from the wants and luxuries of this street ; which I may as well call to your notice en passant . I mean trades that are " lout Parisiennes , , , that is to say , unknown in any other country than Paris . You will see an individual moving about at all hours of the night , silent and active , and seeing the smallest bit of paper in the dark , where you can see nothing ; and with a hook in the end of a stick , picking it up , and pitching it with amazing dexterity into a basket tied to his left shoulder ; with a cat-like walk , being everywhere and nowhere at the same time , stirring up the rubbish of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose ;  --  this is the chiffonnier . He is a very important individual . He is in matter what Pythagoras was in mind ; and his transformations are scarcely less curious than those of the Samian sage . The beau , by his pains , peruses once again his dicky or cravat , of a morning , in the " Magazin des Modes , " whilst the politician has his breeches reproduced in the " Journal des Deliats ; " and many a fine lady pours out her soul upon a billet-doux that once was the dishclout . The chiffonnier stands at the head of the little trades , and is looked up to with envy by the others . He has two coats , and wears on holidays a chain and quizzing-glass , and washes his hands with pale d'amand . He rises , too , like the Paris gentry , when the chickens /q/ roost , and when the lark cjieers the morning , goes to bed . All the city is divided into districts and let out to these chifFonniers by the hour ; to one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and so on through the night ; so that several get a living and consideration from the same district . This individual does justice to the literary compositions of the day ; he crams into his cliiffonnerie indiscriminately the last Vaudeville , the last sermon of the Archbishop , and the last eloge of the Academy . Just below him is the Gratteur . This artist scratches the live long day between the stones of the pavement for old nails from horses ' shoes and other bits of iron  - -  always in hopes of a bit of silver , and even , perhaps , a bit of gold ; more happy in his hope than a hundred others in the possession . He has a store in the Faubourgs , where he deposits his ferruginous treasure ; his wife keeps this store , and is a " Marchande de Fer . " He maintains a family like another man ; one or two of his sons he brings up to scratch for a living , and the other he sends to a college ; and he has a lot " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank is , however , inferior to the Chiffonnier , who will not give him his daughter in marriage , and he do n't ask him to his soirees . In all places of much resort , you will see an individual , broad shouldered , and whiskered , looking very affable and officious , especially upon strangers , mostly about grocetvstores , and street corners . Let me introduce you to him , also . He wants to carry your letters , and run errands for you from one end of Paris to the other . He will carry also your wood to your room , a billet-doux to your mistress , and your boots to the cobbler 's , and , for a modest compensation , perform any service that one person may require of another  --  also , as you see , a very important individual . Indeed , he holds amongst men /z/ nearly the same place that Mercury holds amongst the gods . About his neck he wears a brass medal , polished bright as honor ; at once his badge of office , and pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he points to his medal , and holds up his head ; that 's enough .  --  If only the Peers could point to their decorations with the same confidence ! If you walk out in the bright day , not being a Parisian , you are of course overtaken by the rain : for a Paris sunshine and shower are as close together as a babe 's smiles and tears : and then you just step into a " Cabinet de lecture , " and you have not read the half worth of your sou , when your coat has embraced you , and your umbrella is between you and the merciless Heavens .  --  This is the commissionnaire . I should have noticed among the little industries the " Broker of theatrical pleasures ; " he sells the pass of A , who retires early , to B , who goes in late ; and the Clacqueur , who , for two or three francs a night , applauds or hisses the new plays . But we must get on with our journey . Here on the Boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey ; he has been sent over ( hapless errand ! ) to convert these French people to Christianity . He is a very clever man , and we will ask if he is yet alive ; the journals of this morning say three or four missionaries have been eaten up by the Sumatras . This is the famous Arch of Triumph of the Porte St. Denis . It compliments Louis XIV . on his passage of the Rhine in 1672 , and is the counterpart of the Napoleon Arch at the Barriere de l'Etoile . It is seventy-two feet high , and has at each side an obelisk supported by a lion , and decorated with trophies . That fat Dutch woman at the left base stands for Holland , and that vigorous , muscular-looking man on the right is deputy /q/ to the Rhine : and that overhead on horseback is great " baby Louis . " We have now left the fashionable world at our heels  --  this is the Boulevard du Temple . This Boulevard , a few years ago , was a delightful and romantic walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated all the secret retreats , one after another , of Paris , and there is no spot left of the great capital , in which you can hear your own voice . There were here , before the Revolution , five theatres , and the lists of fame are crowded with the theatrical celebrities which drew the homage of the whole city to this street . This is the only spot in the world that has furnished clowns for posterity ; Baron and Lekain are hardly more fresh in the memory of man than Galiraafre and Bobeche . This was the theatre of their triumphs . It was here , too , that the world came to see a living skeleton of eight pounds , and his wife of eight hundred ; that men , to the great astonishment of our ancestors , swallowed carving knives , and boiling oil , that turkeys danced quadrilles , and fleas drove their coaches and six ; and it was here that Mademoiselle Rose stood on her head on a candlestick . There are yet six theatres here , but the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an infinity of other attractions , is now , alas ! built up with gaunt houses , and differs scarcely from the other Boulevard . The simplicity of original manners is , however , wonderfully preserved in this district . The more fashionable parts are so filled with strangers  --  with parasite plants , that you can scarcely distinguish the indigenous population . This is the true classical and traditional district ; the only place you can find unadulterated Frenchmen . The inhabitant of this quarter has rather more than a French share of embonpoint , and aims at dignity , and his whis- /z/ till I NADULTKHMKI ) FRENCHMEN . kers leave a part of his chin uncovered ; his clothes are large and line in texture ; he carries an umbrella , and on fete days , a cane to give him an important air , and keep off the dogs .

He loves this wife by instinct ; she keeps his books , and he asks her advice in all his business ; she suckles his children and gives him tisane when he is sick . I saw this individual and his wife together a few evenings ago at the Ambigu Comique . I sometimes go to this theatre and the Gaite and the Cirque Olimpique . A vicious student was tempted every now and then to pinch Madame behind . She bore it impatiently , indeed , but silently for some time . " Qu'est-ce que iu as ?  --  t Qu'astu done , ma fern me . ? " At last she communicated to her husband the fact . He immediately grew a foot taller upon his seat ; and then he looked at the young man from head to foot with one of those looks which mean so much more than words . Not wishing , however , to disturb the play , he contained himself , onlyriggling on his seat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he got up . " Quoi , monsieur , " said he , " vous avez V impertinence de pincer lesf esses de Madame . ? " and then thrusting his tongue into the lower lip , he put on an expression such as you will never meet outside the Boulevard du Temple . You would go a mile any time barefooted to see it . " I would have you to know , sir , that I am a rentier , ( a freeholder , ) quejepaye rente h la ville de Paris ; that I am called Grigou , monsieur ; and that I live in the Rue d ' Angouleme , No. 22 : " and he sat down . The little wife now tried to appease /q/ him , which made him the more pugnacious ; she reminded him he was a father of a family , had children , and finally that he had a wife ; and then she sat close up by him , and then she came over to the other side , just front of me , for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger house than he could get for the same rent in any other part of Paris ; he is usually independent in his circumstances , and has a certain ti plomb , or confidence in himself , and a liberty in all his movements , which give a full relief to his natural feelings , and traits of character . Some distance towards the right you will find the great market of frippery  --  one of the curiosities of this district . Every old thing upon the earth is sold there for new . There are 1S00 shops . Nothing ever was so restored from raggedness to apparent green youth and integrity as an old coat in the hands of these Israelites , unless it be the conscience of those who sell . A garment that has served at least two generations , and been worn last by a beggar , you will buy in this market for new in spite of your teeth . It is a good study of human nature to see here how far the human face may be modified by its pursuits and meditations . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ionic columns , and two colossal statues in front , is one of great historical importance ; and ladies who love knights would not pardon me for passing it unnoticed . The ancient edifice was built seven hundred years ago , and was occupied by one of the most powerful orders of Christianity  --  the Knights Templars . Here it was that Philip le Bel tortured and burnt alive these soldier monks ; seizing their treasures , and bestowing their other possessions upon his new favorites , the Knights of Malta . Who has not heard of the war-cry /z/ of Beauceant , which chilled the blood of the Saracens on the plains of Syria , and has since made many a woman tremble in her slippers at midnight . This was his lodging . Lord ! how wide you open yonr eyes ! Yes , here lodged the Knights of the Red Cross ; and Richard Coeur de Lion used to put up in this temple in going to the Holy Land . It became national property in the Revolution , and was given at the Restoration ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present  --  Convent of the Temple . " The ladies who now occupy it are called the Dames Benedictines , and , like the other nuns , of whom there are at present more than twenty orders in France , they devote themselves to education and other benevolent employments . It was in this old building that Louis XVI . and his queen were imprisoned in 1792 . The king was taken out from here the 20th of January , 1793 , to the scaffold , the queen about eleven months after , and Madame Elizabeth , his sister , in the following year , leaving his daughter here alone at thirteen years of age . Sir Sydney Smith was confined in the same room in 179S . Bonaparte , in 1811 , demolished the old edifice to the last stone  --  from what motive ? and in 1812 , it was fenced round , and the grass grew upon the guilty place . The religious ladies who now reside here are purifying it by prayers and other acts of devotion . Apropos of Sydney Smith ; I met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the last half century . He is a venerable old man , and very sociable with the young girls , who were climbing his knees , and hanging about his neck , and getting his name albnmhxed in their little books to carry to America . I will now show you a house in this street , ( Rue des Marais du Temple , No. 31 , ) a house that , once seen , /q/ will never depart from your memory . Its closed door and windows , as if no one lived there ; its iron railing without entrance , and the interstices condemned with wood , in front ; and the slit in the centre of the door to receive the correspondence of its horrible master , who sits within as a spider in its web , you will , see all the rest of your life . It is the house of Monsieur de Paris . Oh dear ! and who is Monsieur de Paris ? He is a civil magistrate , and belongs to the executive department . No one living is , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur de Paris . " Monsieur , " you must recollect , has its particular , and its general meanings . Monsieur , means anybody ; un monsieur , is a gentleman of some breeding and education ; La maison de Monsieur , is the family of the king 's eldest son ; Monsieur de Meaux , means the Archbishop , and Monsieur de Paiis , means the Hangman ! He is also called the " Executeur de la haute justice , " or " Executeur des hautes ceuvres , " and vulgarly , the Boureau . This is his Hotel . The name of the present incumbent is Mr. Henry Sanson . His family consists of a son , a person of mild and gentle manners , who is now serving his apprenticeship to the business under his eminent parent ; and two daughters . The elder , about fifteen , is remarkable for beauty and accomplishment . The father is rich ; his salary being above that of the President of the Royal Court , and he has spared no expense in the education of the girls . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are affected sometimes in nearly the same way . A princess , being obliged to select her husband from her own rank and religion , runs the hazard of a perpetual virginity ; and Mademoiselle de Paris experiences exactly the same inconvenience ; /z/ she can marry but a hangman . There is no one of all Europe , who has performed the same eminent functions as Mr. Henry Sanson , or to whom , without loss of dignity , he can offer the hand of his fair daughter . Ye lords and gentlemen , if you think you have all the pride to yourselves , you are mistaken ; the hangman has his share like another man . Mr. Sanson has appropriated one or two rooms of this building to a Museum of ancient instruments , used in judicial torture  --  Luke 's iron bed , Ravaillac 's boots , and such like relics ; and is quite a dilettante in this department of science . We expect a course of gratuitous lectures , as at the " Musee des Artset Metiers , " when the season begins . Amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beheaded the Marquis de Laly . I am going to tell you an anecdote I have read of this too famous execution , which is curious . About the year 1750 , in the middle of the night , three young men of the high class of nobility , after breaking windows , and the heads of street passengers , and beating the guard , ( which was the privilege of the higher classes in those times , ) strolling down the Faubourg St. Martin , laughing and . talking , and well fuddled with champagne arrived at the door of this house . They heard the sound of instruments , and music so lively seemed to indicate a hearty bourgeois dance . How fortunate ! they could now pass the night pleasantly . One of them knocked , and a polite well-dressed person opened . A young lord explained the motive of their visit , and was refused . " You are wrong , " said the nobleman ; " we are of the court , and do you honor in sharing your amusements . " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger ; " neither of you know the person you are addressing , or you would be as anxious to withdraw , as /q/ now to be admitted . " " Excellent , upon honor ! and who the devil are you ? "  --  " The executioner of Paris . " " Ha , ha , ha , what you ? you the gentleman who breaks limbs , cuts off heads , and tortures poor devils so agreeably ? " " Such , indeed , are the duties of my office ; I leave , however , the details you speak of to my deputies , and it is only when a lord like either of you is subject to the penalties of the law , that I do execution on him with my own hands . " The individual who held this dialogue with the executioner was the Marquis de Laly . Twenty years after he died by the hands of this man , upon whose office he was now exercising his raillery . One of the ornaments of this Boulevard is the Cafe Tare , fitted up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do honor to the Italien . What a display of belles and beaux , about seven of an evening , through its spacious rooms , and gardens , and galleries !  --  one lends his ear to the concert , another , retired in a grotto at the side of his bonnie amie , drinks large draughts of love , and another drinks eau sveree . And here is the largest elephant upon the earth , which bears the same relation to all other elephants that the Trajan horse did to all other horses . This monster was to be cast in bronze , and surmounted by a tower , forming a figure of about eighty feet in height . That which you see here is only the model in plaster of Paris . The stairway leads up through one of the legs , six and a quarter feet in the ankle . There were to be twenty-four bas-reliefs in marble , representing the Arts and Sciences ; and the bronze was to be obtained from the fusion of the cannon , captured by the imperial army in Spain . Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bonaparte , will be puzzled to finish this elephant . /z/ Paris contains one hundred and eighty-nine great fountains , of which about twenty are of beautiful architecture , adorned with sculpture and statuary , and enlivened by jets d'eaux , and forma principal ornament of the city . This elephant was intended to add one to the number . That so imposing and picturesque , which we just now passed on the Boulevard du Temple , is called the Chateau . The building with the jet on the top forms a cone . The water falls from its summit into vases , which overflow in cascades that tumble down from story to story into a large basin at the base , where eight lions of bronze spout torrents in jets d'eaux from their mouths . Its cost was one hundred thousand francs . It would be too long to particularize the others . On one you will see Leda caressing her swan , Cupid lurking on the watch ; on another Tantalus gaping in vain for the liquid , which passes by his lips into the pail of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigued soldier ; and on another , Charity suckling one of her children , wrapping another from the cold in the folds of her frock , and quenching the parched lips of a third with the pure stream . I have just bought you a clock representing the " Fountain of the Innocents , " with all its waters in motion . It was the Duchess of Bern 's , and is of delicate workmanship . Please have the proper respect to its dignity , and indulgence for its frailty . I will send it by the next packet . The turning of wickets , the jingling of keys , and grating of bolts were the sounds heard here forty-six years ago . What recollections rise out of the ground to meet you at every step as you tread upon this unhallowed spot . One hears almost the chains clank , and the prisoner groan in his cell ! It was here , where the charcoal now floats so peacefully on the lake , and where /q/ the boatman sings his absent mistress so joyously , that stood , in horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed , " - the " high altar and castle of Despotism , " the Bastille ! Where are now the damp and secret cells , the sombre corridors , and the grim countenances of the jailers , and where the mob of ' 89 , and the mad passions that leveled its . towers and battlements ? Quiet as the Seine that sleeps upon its dungeons ! The present substitutes for the Bastille , are ' , the Depot at the Prefecture of Police ; St. Pelagie for state crimes , and La Force for civil ; the Conciergerie for those awaiting trial , and the Salpetriere for those awaiting the execution of their sentence . Bonaparte built here an immense granary , containing always corn enough for the consumption of the capital for two months . This , with the Halle aux bleds in the centre of the city , supplies the whole population . Paris has six hundred bakers , who are obliged to keep always in this granary , one hundred thousand sacks of flour , worth thirty shillings sterling per sack ; and therefore it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profligate Beaumarchais ; his castle is rased ; all but Figaro are dead . You have in sight the Hospital of the Quinze-vingts , which contains three hundred blind , who have twenty-four sous a day each for a living , with the produce of their industry , which is wonderfully ingenious . Now we have passed the Garden of Plants , and the Bridge of Austerlitz . For this latter favor we owe something to the Russians , who saved this bridge from its bad name , and Blucher 's gunpowder . That upon the hill is the Salpetriere , the Insane Hospital for women . What a huge pile ! One to put the sane ones in would not be half the size . This front on vol. i.  --  7 /z/ the Boulevard , is six hundred feet . The building in the rear is of similar dimensions , and the Rotonde between , with the octagon dome , is the chapel . It contains now four thousand live hundred poor aged above seventy ; one thousand five hundred crazy ; all women . I went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar institution for the other sex called Bicelre . Paris has twenty hospitals , affording thirty thousand beds , and classed by the several diseases and infirmities . It has no poor-houses , but each of its twelve arondissements , or municipal divisions , has a " Bureau de Bienfesance , " which distributes provisions to the indigent , and provides labor for the idle , and there is a plenty of benevolent societies with specific objects . Nor do they want customers , for the number of paupers is near fifty thousand . I forgot to tell you there is a hospital here ( the Hospice des Menages ) , for widowers . What an object of charity is a man without a wife ! They have made , however , the terms hard ; one has to stay married twenty years to be admitted . The institution is under the care of the Sisters of Charity . This of Val de Grace is for the military , and that of the Rue d'Enfer for the Foundlings ; not an unnatural association , but emblematic of the two chief concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and making up the loss by adultery . And this is the Rue St. Jaccpaes , one of the classical streets of the city . The great rogues pay their last visit to this end of it , and the great men to the other : if you kill ten thousand of your fellow-creatures , you go to the Pantheon at the west end ; if one only , you come here to the Place St. Jacques , now the seat of the Guillotine , and the public executions .  --  At length we are on the Boulevard du Mont Parnasse , at the end of our journey . Yet could you not get a drop of Helicon here , though perishing /q/ with thirst . All one can offer you is a little sour Burgundy , which is cheaper than inside the wall . This is the reason you see all this rabble , five hundred at a view , carousing and dancing in their sabots , drinking and caressing tour-a-tour , the necks of their bottles , and their belles ; it is the reason why , thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paris is losing daily her sober reputation , and learning to get drunk like her neighbors . The bad system of the ports in France is transferred to all the petty towns . A couple of sergeants , musketed and whiskered , walk with grim dignity at each side of the gates . They stop and examine all vehicles , public and private , and all such persons as carry in provisions to the market ; forcing them to pay an octroi or duty to the city of Paris ; which prevent those rogues , the poor people , from getting a dinner untaxed . They even stop sometimes the foot passengers ; especially those notorious smugglers , the women . If any one chance to be half gone , she is not allowed to go any farther , unless with the certificate of the parish priest , or some equally good authority . Quantities of lace and silks have passed in under such pretexts . The best commentary I know upon the wisdom of this policy , is the Boulevard du Mont Parnasse . When Paris was surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riot , and hung up several of the ringleaders , on those principles of law recently laid down by our chief justice Lynch . They entered suits too against the city  --  to put her in the Bastille ; but a compromise ended the strife , and the wall was built . Here is a line from an old book relating to these times : " Les murs murant Paris rendent Paris murmnrant. " /z/ I could not think of descending from Parnassus without a line of poetry . /z/ The Palais Royal  --  French courtesy  --  Rue Vivienne  --  Pleasures of walking in the streets  --  Cafes in the Palais Royal  --  Mille Colonnes  --  Very 's  --  French dinners  --  Past history of the Palais Royal  - -  Galerie d'Orleans  --  Gambling  --  The unhappy Colton  --  Hells of the Palais Royal  --  Prince Puckler Muskau  --  Lord Brougham  --  The king and queen . Paris , July , 1835 . You wish to see the Palais Royal ? Then you must step from the Boulevard Italien a quarter of a mile to the southwest . If you hate Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart 's content . In Paris there are ten hundred and eighty streets , besides lanes and alleys , all recommending themselves by the most charming irregularities . That which you will now pass through  --  the " Rue Vivienne , " is among the most bustling ; it is a leading avenue , is alive with business , and has pretensions far above its capacity . I must tell you a word about the etiquette of these streets before you set out . If a lady meets a gentleman upon the little side-walk , which French courtesy calls a " trottoir " it is the lady always who trols into the mud . The French women seem used to tlis submission and yield to it instinctively ; and indeed all who feel their weakness , as children and /q/ old men , being subject to the same necessity , show the same resignation . Also , if a number of gentlemen are coteried , even across the broad walk of the Boulevards , the lady walks round not to incommode them ; and it is not expected of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should give his seat to anyone , of whatever age , sex or condition , or that he should deviate from his straight line on the street for anything less than an omnibus . The French have been a polite people , and they continue to trade on the credit of their ancestors . What is curious to observe , is the complaisance with which human nature follows a general example . A Russian wife , when the husband neglects to beat her for a month or two , is alarmed at his indifference , and I have remarked that the French women are the warmest defenders of this French incivility . Recollect that as soon as you will put your little foot upon this Rue Vivienne , fifty wagons , a wedding coach , and three funerals , with I do n't know how many mallepostes , cabs , coucous , and bell-eared diligences  - -  all but the fiacres , with their gaunt and fleshless horses , which plead inability  --  will set themselves to run over yon , without the smallest respect for your Greek nose , your inky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it wo n't do to have your two feet in one sock . I have written home to your mother to have prayers performed in the churches for women 's husbands sojourning in Paris .  --  And by escaping from one danger , you are sure to run full butt against another ; Scylla and Charybdis , too , are so close together that the " prudent middle " is precisely the course that no prudent lady will think of pursuing . To make it worse , the natives will have not the least sympathy in your dangers ; they have been used to get run over themselves , from time /z/ immemorial , and when we staring Yankees come over to see the " Tooleries and the Penny Royal , " they are not aware that any allowance is to he made for our ignorance . Besides , the driver knows a stranger as far as he can see him , and takes aim accordingly ; he gets twenty-five francs for his body at the Morgue . It is known that secret companies for " running over people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers are the principal jobbers . The truth is that it is reckoned amongst the natural deaths of the place , and two hundred and fifty are marked upon the bills of the last year . Under the old regime , When the nobility put out a greater train of vehicles , and had a kind of monopoly of running over the common people , I have heard it was still worse . Then if any one walked about the streets unmashed for twenty years , he was entitled to the cross of St. Louis . I have escaped till now , but I set it down entirely to the efficacy of your innocent prayers , which have reversed the fates in my favor . Your best way is to watch and imitate the address of the native women . Here they are now , in front of my window , sprinkled over the whole street , in their white stockings and prunellas , and in the very filthiest of the French weather , without , a spot to their garters . The little things just pull up all the petticoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip-toe , they step from the convex surface of one paving stone to another , with a dexterity and grace that go to one 's heart . A lady must expect , also , other embarrassments here , to which the delicate pusillanimity of the sex is but slightly exposed yet in our country  --  besides the cat and nine kittens that she must jump over , and the defunct lap-dogs that lie putrid in the gutters . The truth is , that these streets are very often ( I say it with great respect /q/ for Madame de Rambouillet ) so in dishabille , they are not fit to be seen . A Parisian lady , therefore , ( and she is to be imitated also in this , ) when she ventures out afoot , is sharp-sighted as a lynx , and blind as an owl ; she has eyes to see and not to see , like those bad Christians in the Testament , and she runs the gauntlet through* the midst of all these slippery and perilous obstructions , in as careless a good humor as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true the ladies of the haut ton do not much exercise their ambulatory functions  --  their " vertu camirtante i  --  upon these unsavory promenades . A French gentleman , who has resided a week and a half at New York , ( just long enough to know the manners and customs of a country , ) told me this very morning that you American ladies stare upon the streets at the gentlemen  --  he ventured to say , " even to immodesty ; " and I have heard other foreigners make similar remarks , I presume without a proper attention to the peculiar circumstances of different countries .  - -  On a Philadelphia street a lady can give herself up to her thoughts ; her soul has the free use of its wings ; she can get into a romance , or a reverie ; she can study her lesson , or read a love-letter , and she can stare at a French gentleman without the least apprehension of danger . Our streets are clean and decent , and are excellent places of parade ; and gentlemen and ladies may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Indeed , Chestnut Street is so trim and neat that sometimes one is almost obliged , like Diogenes , to spit in somebody 's face not to soil its prettiness . Not so in Paris . You are here quite at your ease in all such matters . A French lady , therefore , and very properly , sees no one on the street  --  not even her husband . To /z/ get her to look at you , you are obliged to take hold of her , shake her , and turn her about three or four times ; but when once upon the Boulevard Italien of an evening , or upon the broad walk of the elegant Tuileries , when she has no longer need of her faculties of eyes and ears , and nose , too , to anticipate and obviate danger  - -  ah , mafoi ! her diamond eyes are no more chary of their amorous glances , than the ha ) and bugle eyes of Chestnut or Broadway of theirs . I tried to persuade this French gentleman , who is a baron , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to him ; I told him ( and it is true , too ) of others who could not get the dear little girls of New York to look at them sufficiently . But I must show you the Palais Royal . It is a third less than your Washington Square . Its trees are in two regular rows along each margin . In the centre is an enclosure , containing shrubbery and flowers ; and also an Apollo and a Diana , in bronze , and a jet d'eau that separates in the air , and falls in a " fleur de lys "  --  the only emblem of royalty that deceived the Revolution and the Jacobins ; and a lake , where the little fishes " wave their wings of gold . " There is no access to vehicles , or street noise to disturb the quiet of this fairy retreat . It is in the centre , too , of the city , in the vicinity of all the other chief places of diversion ; and here all the world meets after dinner to take coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening . You will see them creeping in from the neighboring streets as you have seen the ants into a sugarhouse . If you wish to know where is the centre of the earth , it is the Palais Royal . Ask a stranger , when he arrives , " whither will you go first ? " he will answer , " to the Palais Royal ; " or ask a Frenchman , on the top of /q/ Caucasus , " where shall I meet you again ? " he will give you rendezvous at the Palais Royal ; and no spot , they say , on the earth , has witnessed , so many tender recognitions . Just do you ask Mademoiselle Celeste , at New York ,  --  where did you get that superb robe de chambre ? " and , I will lay you six to one , she will say , " at the Palais Royal . " Let us sit down beneath these pretty elms . Those upper rooms , which you see so adorned with Ionic columns , with galleries , and . vases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  those are not his majesty 's apartments : not the salles des marichaux , nor the salle du trone , nor the chambre a coucher de la reine ; they are the cafes and restaurants of the Palais Royal . And those multitudes you see circulating about the galleries , and looking down from the windows  - -  those are not the royal family , nor the garde du corps , nor the " hundred Swiss , " nor the chambellans , the ecuyers , the aumoniers , the maitres de ciremonies , the introducteurs des ambassadeurs , nor the historiographers , nor even the chavf-cire , or the capitaines des levrettes  --  they are the cooks , and the garcons , in their white aprons , of the cafes and restaurants ; the only order that has suffered no loss of dignity or corruption of blood by the Revolution ; the veritable noblesse of these times , the " cordons bleus " of the order of the gridiron . Louis Philippe , our citizen king , and proprietor of this garden , gets thirty-two thousand francs , annually , of sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It being after dinner , I will treat you to a H ' gal ; which is a cup of pure coffee , with a small glass of liqueur , eau de vie , or rum , or qtweeh . You can take them separate or together ; in the latter case , it is called " gloria ; " or you /z/ may put your cognlac into a cup , with a largo , lump of sugar iu the middle , and set it on fire , to destroy the cli'ects of the alcohol #@# upon your nerves . See how the area of the garden is already covered with its smoking , drinking , and promenading community ; and how the smoke , as if loth to quit us , still lingers , until the whole atmosphere is narcotic with its incense . At a later hour , we shall find in the rotunda , at the north end , and upon tables under these trees , ices in pyramids , and orgeat and eau sucree , and all the other luxurious refreshments . Those two oriental pavilions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will distribute newspapers to the studious , and the whole garden will buzz with conversation and merriment , until the long twilight has faded into night . Of the inside of the cafes and restaurants I must give you a few particulars . In each , there is a woman of choice beauty , mounted on a kind of throne . She is present always , and may be considered as one of the fixtures of the shop . When you enter any of these cafes , you will see , standing here and there through the rooms , an individual in a white apron ; he has mustaches , he holds a coffee-pot in his left hand , and leaning gracefully over the right , reads his favorite journal  --  this is the waiter ! When you have cried three times " Garcon ! " the lady at the bureau will vibrate a little bell , and bring you instantly this waiter from his studies . If you are a very decent-looking man , she will let you cry only twice ; and if you have an embroidered waistcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she will not let you cry at all . The chair occupied by this she secretary , at the Milk Colonnes , cost ten thousand francs ; and she who sat , some years ago , upon that of the " cafe des Aveugles , " the " belle Limonadiere , " /q/ charmed all who had eyes , and amongst the rest , a brother of the greatest emperor of the world . There are above a thousand of these cafes in Paris , and several of the most sumptuous , overlook the gardens of the Palais Royal . Ceres has unlocked her richest treasures here , and has poured them out with a prodigality that is unknown elsewhere . Fish of fresh , and of salt water ; rare wines of home and foreign production ; and as for the confectionaries , sucreries , fruit* eries , charcuiteries , the senses are bewildered by the infinite variety . And the artists here have a higher niche in the temple of Fame , than even those of the Boulevard Italien . Monsieur Very supplied the allied monarchs , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish , " to his Majesty , who is of this school , is salaried a thousand dollars above our chief justice of the Union ; and Monsieur Dodat , who is immortal for making sausages and the " Passage Vero-Dodat , " has at Pere la Chaise a monument towering like that of Cheops . This is the true " Kitchen Cabinet , " to which ours is no more to be compared than the dish water to the dinner . Very is in the kitchen , what the Emperor was in the camp ; he is the Napoleon of gastronomy . All flesh is nothing in his sight . Why , he will transform you a rabbit to a harej or an eel to a lamprey , as easily as you a Jackson-man to a Whig ; and he turns cocks into capons , and vice versa , by the simple artifice of a sauce . You , indeed , condense the sense of a whole community into a single head of a senator , or a President ; and he just as easily a whole flock of geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possess the wonderful art , all know in what excellence , of puffing a man up beyond the natural measure of his merits , and just so Monsieur Very will puff you a /z/ goose 's liver , however unmathematical it may seem , beyond the size of the whole goose . Now in the midst of all this skill and profusion , " the devil 's in it if yon can not dine ; " yet have I perished myself several times of hunger in the very midst of this Palais Royal . It is not enough that a table be loaded with its dishes , there must be science to call them by their names , and taste to discriminate their uses . What can you do with an Iroquois from the " Sharp Mountain , " who does not know that sauce for a gander is not sauce for a goose . Unless you have studied the nomenclature , which is about equal to a first course of anatomy , you are no more fit to enjoy a dinner at Very 's than Tantalus in his lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of fare as big as your prayer-book ; you open it ; the first page presents you thirty soups , ( classically polages , ) and there you are to choose between a " pure ' , " a " consomme " " " a la Julicn , a la Beauvais , a la Bonne Femme " &c.; &c.; I prefer the " consomme , " and I will tell you how it is made . It is a piece of choice beef and capon boiled many hours Over a slow fire to a jelly , and the juices concentrated and served without any extraneous mixture . The " Julien " is a pot pourri of all that is edible or potable in the list of human aliments . It is a soup for which , if rightly made , an epicure would give away his birthright : it was invented , not by Julian the Apostate , but by Monsieur Julien of the Palais Royal . The fluids being settled , you will turn then to the following page for the solids : " Papillottes de Levreaud " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de saumon " " ozufau miroir " " riz saute a la glace " " pique aux truffles " &c.; &c.; Alas , my poor roasting , and frying countrymen ! There is not a day but I see some poor Yankee scratching his /q/ head in despair over this crabbed vocabulary of French dishes . Your best way in this emergency is to call the gargon ; and leave all to him , and sit still like a good child , and take what is given to you . I have known many a one to run all over Paris for a beaf-steak , and/ when he has got it , it was a horse 's rump . My advice ' is that no one come to Paris to dine in mean houses on cheap dinners ; to eat cats for hares , and have snails and chalk for his cream . You are no more sure of the ingredients of a dish under the disguises of k French cookery , than of men 's sentiments from their faces or professions . You can get , to begin with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remains of old simplicity ; if you know how to ask for them ; if not , carry the shells about with you in your pocket . We will dine to-morrow at the " Mille Co/on ? ies . " Ladies often step into this cafe to be reflected ; you can see here all your faces , and behind and before yon , as conveniently as Janus . One always enters this threshold with reverence . It has dined the Holy Alliance . Besides the usual officers and attendants , you will sometimes see here a little man , grave , distrait and meditative ; do not disturb him : he is , perhaps , busy about the projet of some new sauce . He will often start abruptly , and leave you in a phrase ; it is not incivility ; he has just conceived a dish , and is going out to execute it , or write it upon his tablets . You must not expect to see him before one ; for no one is allowed to intrude upon the freshness of his morning studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , inquiring of the waiter , who replied , with the air of one feeling the importance of his functions , " Monsieur , il ? i'est pas visible ; il compose . " The French are not copyists in cookery , no more than in fashions . They are inventvol. i.  --  8 /z/ ors , and this keeps the imagination on the rack . Yon will remark that people always excel in those things which they invent , and ate always mediocre in those things which they imitate . After yonr potnge , which yon must cat sparingly , and without bread , ( lor bread will satiate , and spoil the rest of your dinner , ) you will take a little " vin ordinaire , " or pure burgundy , waiting for your first course ; and you will just cast a look over the official part of the Moniteur , for there is no knowing when one may be made a peer of France ; and on receiving one dish , always command the next . After the dessert you will read the news all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ddbats , Quutidienne , National and the Charivari ; and after coffee you may amuse yourself at checkers ; improve your intellects at domino , or yonr morals by a game of chess . In looking about the room , you will see a great number of guests , perhaps a hundred , not in stalls , as in our eating-houses , and the stables , but seated at white marble tables , in an open and elegant saloon , the wall tapestried with mirrors . If it be a serious gentleman reading deliberately the newspaper over his dessert , careless or contemptuous of what is going on around him , and drinking his bottle of champagne alone , that is an Englishman . If a Parlie carrf , that is , a couple of ladies and their cavaliers , dining with much noise and claret , observing a succession and analogy of dishes , swallowing their wine drop by drop , as I read your letters , fearing lest it should come too soon to an end ; and prolonging expressly the enjoyments of the repast ; these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads , hurried and impatient , and rating the waiters in no gentle terms : " D n your eyes , why do n't you bring in the dinner ? and take away that broth ; and your black bottle : who the devil /q/ wants your vinegar , and your dishwater , and your bibs too ? And bring us , if you can , a whole chicken 's leg at once , and not at seven different times , "  --  these are from the " Far West , " and a week old in Paris . How should these little snacks of a French table not seem egre giously mean to an American , who is used to dine in fifteen minutes , even on a holiday , and to see a whole hog barbecued ? The French dine to gratify , we to appease appetite : we demolish a dinner ; they eat it . The guests who frequent these cafes are regular or flying visitors ; some are accidental , others occasional , dining by agreement to enjoy each other 's company ; others again are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a respite to their servants : and others live here , a kind of stereotype customers , altogether ; and these houses serve , in addition to their province of eating and drinking , as places of conference or clubs ; it is here that men communicate on political subjects ; that news is circulated ; and public opinion formed ; and that kings are expelled , and others are set up on their thrones . On a range with the restaurants , and over them , you will see lodged many of the fine arts ; painters , engravers , dentists , barbers ; and beautiful sultanas look out from the highest windows upon these fair dominions , to which the severity of French morals has forbidden them access . In the lower rooms , on a level with the area of the garden , and peeping through the colonnade , west and east , are riches almost immeasurable , in exquisite and fashionable apparel for both sexes , and in jewelry , trinkets and perfumery . This trade , which in other cities is peddling and huckstering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its productions are reckoned at upwards of a hundred millions of francs . The stores themselves are so little , and yet /z/ so pretty , that I have thoughts of sending you one of them over hy the packet . Their arrangements are changed every hour , so as to keep up a continuous emotion , and a scries of agreeable excitements , and so as to present yon a new set of temptations twelve times a day . Everything that human industry , sharpened by necessity , or competition can effect ; everything which can excite an appetite , can heighten a beauty , or hide a deformity , is here  --  I begin to love art almost as well as nature ; I begin to love mother Eve in her fig leaves , as well as in her unaproned innocence . After all what is nature to us without art ? Education is art . Indeed , rightly considered , art itself is nature ; she has but left a part of her work unfinished to urge the industry and whet the ingenuity of man . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no accommodation for the household gods . Persons with their families  --  indeed , I have heard that even persons in the family way , are not allowed to inhabit here . A man hoards space , as a miser hoards money . It is a qualification indispensable in a clerk , to be of a slender capacity . You would think you were in Lilliput , served by the fairies . The shop-girls , especially , are of such exquisite exility of figure , you can almost take one of them between your thumb and finger , and set her on the counter . In our country , we have nothing yet to show in the way of great works of art . We have nature , indeed wild and beautiful , but without historic associations ; tradition is dumb , and the " memory of man " runs back to the Eden of our race . It is a mighty advantage these old countries have over us ; their reminiscences , their traditions , and their antiquities . What would be the Tower , but for hump-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heath , but for the ghosts of those who have been murdered there ? and in these countries , which have no beginning , Ihey can supply the vacant space into which authentic history does not venture , by legends and romances ; and no matter how obscure may be one of their mountains and lakes , they can lie it into a reputation . Some things are beautiful from their accessories alone ; as lords are sometimes lords only from their equipages.  --  What is there beautiful in a ruin ? We have plains as desolate as Babylon , and no one looks at them . The Palais Royal , however magnificent as a bazaar , has still higher and better merits . It is the history of some of the most remarkable personages and events of the last two ages . Some day when we have a ticket from the " Intendant de sa Majest6 , " I will show you them all ; and first , that very celebrated old fop the Cardinal de Richelieu , who used to strut , with his train of a monarch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You shall see the very theatre upon which he represented his woful tragedies ; his flatterers crowding around with wonderful grimace , and Corneille 's Muse cowering her timid wings in silence . As you are a lady and love trinkets , I will show you , if it yet exists , that great miracle of massive gold and diamonds , the Cardinal 's Chapel ; the two candlesticks valued at a hundred thousand livres ; the cross , twenty-two inches high , and of pure gold ; the Christ of the same metal , and the crown and drapery all glittering in diamonds . - And you shall see the prayer-book , too , encased in laminae of gold ; in the centre , the cardinal holding up the globe ; and from the four corners , four angels placing a crown upon his head . If you like , I will show you , also , that other smooth-faced rogue , scarcely his /z/ inferior in political ability , the Cardinal Mazarin , who put the king 's money in his pocket , and stinted his little majesty in shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you yet another , more witty , and not less profligate and debauched than the other two , the Cardinal de Retz . When we read his memoirs together , little did we foresee that , one day , we should look into the very chambers in which he held his nightly councils , with his fellow conspirators , plotting his rabble Revolution of the Fronde . You shall see also Turenne and the great Conde . That gentleman gathering maxims  - -  maxims of life , at the court of Mazarin !  --  that is M. le due de Rochefaucauld : and I will introduce you to Madame de Motteville , and other famous wits and beauties of those times . In the room just opposite , where one dines upon soup , three courses and a dessert , at forty sous , I will show you the little " Grand Monarque " in his cradle . The dear little thing ! It was here the great man first began ; it was here he crept , I presume very unwillingly , to school ; here he began to seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy a better devotion ) of the " humble violet , " Madame la Valliere . Just over head , used to sup , with the Duke of Orleans and his family , Doctor Franklin ; and here Madame de Genlis gave lessons to the little Louis Philippe , causing his most Christian Majesty to walk fifteen miles a day , in shoes with leaden soles . The Spartans did better , who , to make their kings hardy and robust , had them flogged daily at the shrine of some pagan goddess . In one of these rooms , the mob Republic held , for awhile , its meetings ; and in this very garden , the tri-colored cockade was adopted , at a great meeting in ' 89 , as the Revolutionary emblem . On the south end , is a gallery of paintings , they say , very /z/ splendid . It was plundered hi the Revolution , and since restored by the present proprietor , the king . If any one steals a picture or a book in Paris , and can prove quiet possession for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner is obliged to buy back his goods from the thief . I sometimes walk in this garden with the scholars and the bonnes , of a morning , but it is disagreeable ; it is not yet aired , and has a stale stupefactive smell from the preceding night 's banquet . It is by degrees ventilated and life begins to flow into it about ten . Then the readers of news begin to gravitate around Monsieur Perussault 's pavilion . There is a dial here which announces , with a loud detonation , twelve ; and as the important hour approaches , every one having a watch takes it out , and looks up with compressed lips , and waits in uno oblntu until Apollo has fired off his cannon ; then quick he twirls about the hands , and replaces it complacently in his fob , and walks away very happy to have the official hour in his pocket . You will see , also , a few badeaitx , who always arrive just afterwards , and stand the same way looking up for half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone off . It is of a hot summer evening that this garden is unrivaled in beauty . You swim in a glare of light ; the gas flashes from under the arcades ; lamps innumerable shine through the interior , and look down from five hundred windows above . It is not night , it is " but the daylight sick . " It is haunted by its company , and is full of life to the latest hours , and revelry holds her gambols here , when Paris everywhere over the immense city is lulled into its midnight slumbers . When summer has turned round upon its axis and the first chills of autumn frighten joy from her court , she retires /z/ then tolier last hold , the " Galerie ( V Orleans . " This delightful promenade extends across the south end of the garden ; it is three hundred feet long by thirty wide ; its roof is of glass and its pavement of tesselated marble ; it is bounded on both sides by stores and cafes , and reading-rooms , eighteen feet square ; renting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm enough for its company in winter and is a fashionable resort during that season . It is a pleasant walk , also , in the twilight of a summer evening . I know an ex-professor , by dining with him at the same ordinary , and we walk often under the crystal vaults of this gallery , and reason whole evenings away  --  now we stop , and then walk on , and then take snuff , and then make a whole round arm in arm , in great gravity and silence ; at other times being seated at a marble table , we calmly unfold the intricate mazes of the human mind and systems of human policy ; and then we take coffee , with a little glass of cjuirsh . Last night we reasoned warmly upon the nature of slavery till I got mad , and while I sipped and read the newspaper , he amused himself with a drawing , ( for he is skilled in this art , ) which he presented me . It was a Liberty , of a healthy and robust complexion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have waxed very warm in this country . Four of the houses just over us are consecrated to gambling . They are frequented , however , by rather the lower class and rabble of the profession . They who have some regard to reputation go to Frascati 's , to the Rue Richelieu ; the more select to the " Ccrcle , " or to the " Club Anglais " upon the Boulevard and the Rue de Grammont ; and the " Jockey Club " receives the dandies and flash gentlemen of the turf . The three last are of English origin , and the " Club Anglais " is in the /q/ best English style . It receives only the high functionaries of the state , princes of the blood , ambassadors and other eminent persons , and even these are- not admitted to pick one another 's pockets here unless known to be of good moral character . Games of hazard are prohibited , and the bets correspondent to the dignity of the company . The " Cercle , " also , is frequented by the upper sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and service are of no common rate . The public gambling houses here are authorized by government , and pay for their charter annually six and a half millions of francs . The government has not thought it fit that the blacklegs and courtesans should worship in the same temple . The ladies have therefore been turned out , poor things ! to get a living as they can on the Boulevards and elsewhere , and the gamblers have the Palais Royal all to themselves . But why do not " the Chambers " extend this system of financial economy to other moral offences , as stealing , drunkenness , and adultery ? I would charter them every one , and enrich the state . If we can succeed in making a vice respectable , it is no vice at all ; and why should not a proper protection of government and general custom render gambling or any vice as respectable as thieving or infanticide was at Sparta , or as duelling and privateering are amongst the modern civilized nations ? The matter is now under discussion , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the government , by such license , becomes accessory to the crimes of its subjects , and that bad passions , already rank enough in human nature , should not be made a direct object of education ; moreover , they find it awkward that legislators , after having given the whole community a public license to pick one another 's pock- /z/ ets , should stand up in the national tribune and talk about honesty .  --  There are persons who have absurd prejudices . But to be serious ; indeed , I am very well disposed to such a feeling ; I have just fallen accidentally upon the story , * which every one knows , of the unhappy Colton . He wrote books in recommendation of virtue , and critiques in reprobation of vice , with admirable talent . He was a clergyman by profession , and yet became a victim to this detestable passion . He subsisted by play several years amongst these dens of the Palais Royal , and at length falling into irretrievable misery , ended his life here by suicide . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so horrible an occurrence ; one owes a tear to the errors of genius ; to the weakness of our common humanity . Gambling seems to be the universal passion ; the two extremes of human society are equally subject to it . The savage of Columbia river gambles his rifle , and his squaw , and like any gentleman of the " Cercle , " commits suicide in his despair . Billiards , cards , Pharo and other games of hazard , are to be found at every hundred steps , in every street and alley of Paris ; haunted by blacklegs in waiting for your purse ; and there is scarce a private ball or soiree , even to those of the court , in which immense sums are not lost and won , by gambling . The shuffling of cards or rattling of dice is a part of the music of every Parisian saloon , and many fathers of families of the first rank get a living by it . To know how much better it is in London , one has only to read the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To know this , you have only to visit our Virginia Springs and other places of fashionable resort . You will hear there the instruments of gambling at every /q/ hour of the night ; and yon will see tables , covered with the infamous gold , set out in the shade during the day ; and you will see sealed around these tables those who make the laws for " the only Republic upon the earth , " the members of the American Congress  --  with the same solemn gravity as if holding counsel upon the destinies of the nation . I have seen the highest officer of the House of Representatives step from the loo-table to the Speaker 's chair ! The vices of the higher orders have this to aggravate their enormity , that the lower world is formed and encouraged by their example . Gambling in Virginia is a penitentiary offence . I have visited these " Hells " of the Palais Royal . Their numbers are 113 , 129 , and 154 on the eastern gallery , and number 36 , on the western ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could get here very soon all the acquirements by which a man may be put in the way of being hanged . Bars are placed before the windows by the humanity of the government , to prevent his Majesty 's subjects and others from throwing away their precious lives in their fits of despair . That tall and robust , and stern-looking man between fifty and sixty , in an old tattered great coat , and walking in the gait of a conspirator , is Chodruc Duclos . He was once the friend of Count Peyronnet as they say : he lavished his fortune on him , and fought his duels . The Count became minister and Duclos poor ; he claimed his protection , and was rejected by the ungrateful minister . He now walks here daily at the same hour , like some mysterious , unearthly being . He never speaks ; and the last smile has died upon his lips . I have a mind to tell you a queer anecdote of myself , which will fill the rest of this page without much changing the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few evenings ago with a wag of an Englishman , a fellow-lodger , he proposed to gratify me with a peep into one of the evening rendezvous , as he said , of the nobility . I entered with becoming reverence through a hall , where servants in livery attended taking our hats and canes , with a princely ceremony , and bringing us refreshments . Tables in the several rooms were covered with gold , at which gentlemen and ladies were playing , and others were looking on intently and silently . Around about , some were coteried in corners , others were strolling in groups or pairs through the rooms ; and others again were rambling carelessly through the walks of an adjacent garden of flowers and shrubbery , illuminated , or were seated in secret conversation amongst its arbors . " That gentleman , " said my companion , " on the right , with the Adonis neck , with myrrhed and glossy ringlets , is the Prince Puckler Muskau . " And when I had looked at him sufficiently , " That gentleman on the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget his name  --  that is Prince Carrimanico , of Rome ; and that just in front is the Baron Blowminossoff , from Petersburg . " I stared particularly at my Lord Brougham , who had just come over to make a tour upon the continent for his health . He was attenuated by sickness and the cares of business , but I could discern distinctly the great traits of his character  --  the lowering indignation on his brow , the bitter curl and sarcasm on his lip , and the impetuous and overwhelming energy which distinguish this great statesman , upon his strongly marked features ; and if I had not been informed of his name , I should have marked him out at once as some eminent personage ; and from a certain abrupt and fidgety manner , " a hasty scratch at the back of his LADIES AT FRASCATl's. 97 head , accompanied with two or three twitches of the nose , " I should have suspected him for nobody else than the greatest statesman and orator of Europe , my Lord Brougham . Among the ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Contesse de Trotteville , and her beautiful cousin Mademoiselle Trottini , from Naples , with several of the French nobility ; and there was the Countess of Crumple , and a fat lady Madam Von Swellemburg , and others of the Dutch and English gentry . I fancied that a duchess on my left ( I forget her name ) had a haughty and supercilious air , as if she felt the dignity of her blood , and the length of her genealogy . She seemed as if not pleased that everybody should be introduced , and wished some place more exclusive . But there was one young and beautiful creature  --  but so beautiful that I could not with all my efforts keep my eyes off her  - -  who , I observed , more than once reciprocated my inquisitive looks . I felt flattered at being the object of her attention . The elegant creature ! thought I ; what a simplicity and sweetness of expression ! and how strange , that , brought up amidst the art and refinement of a court , she should retain all the innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this admiration , and when I had just got myself almost bowed to by another countess , my companion let in the light upon the magic lantern . " These , " said he , " are women of the town , and these are gamblers and pick pockets , who come hither to Monsieur Frascati 's to rob and ruin one another . " I give you this for your private ear ; if you tell it , mercy on me , I shall never hear the last of it . I shall be sung all over the village . There are persons there , of half my years , who would hove detected such company at once . As I was going /z/ away , Miss Emeline , Miss Adelaide , and Madame Rosalie , gave me their cards . I saw this morning the queen and the king 's most excellent majesty . They passed through the Champs Elysees to their country habitation at Neuilly . The equipage was a plain carriage with six horses ; a postillion on a front and one on a rear horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To see a king for the first . time is an event . A'm't you mad ?  --  you who never saw anything over there bigger than his most unchristian Majesty Black Hawk , and Higgle wiggin his squaw ? I have now come to the interesting part of this letter . I am yours . /z/ The Tuileries  --  The gardens  --  The statues  --  The Cabinets de lecture  --  The king 's band  --  Regulations of the gardens  --  Yankee modesty  --  ihe English parks  --  Proper estimate of riches  --  Policy of cultivating a taste for innocent pleasures  --  Advantages of gardens  --  Should be made ornamental  --  Cause of the French Revolution  --  Mr. Burke 's notion of the English parks  --  Climate of France . Paris , July 24th , 1835 . I am going now to escort you to the Tuileries , for which you must scramble through a few filthy lanes a quarter of a mile towards the southwest . Who would live in this rank old Paris if it was not for its gardens ? This garden is in the midst of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has the Seine on /q/ the south side , the Palace of the Tuileries on the east , and on the north the beautiful houses of the Rue Rivoli , the street intervening , and on the west the Place Louis XV . between it and the Champs Elysees . The whole is enclosed with an iron railing tipped with gold near the Palace , and terraces having a double row of tile trees are raised along the north and south sides . A beautiful parterre is spread out in front of the Palace , of oranges , red rosed laurels , and other shrubbery , with a reservoir , jets d'eaux , vases and statues . The chief walks also have orange trees on both margins during the summer , and one of these as wide as Chestnut street , - runs from the centre Pavilion of the Palace through the middle of the garden , and continuing up through the Champs Elysees to the Barriere de PEtoile , terminates in a full view of the great triumphal arch of Napoleon . In the interior are plots of woodland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting , you may repose or read in the shade , and little cabinets , which offer you for a sou your choice of the newspapers . The area is of hard earth and gravel , relieved here and there by enclosures of verdure , and on the west end an octagonal lake is inhabited by swans , and fishes and river gods , and a fountain is jetting its silvery streams in the air . This is the garden of the Tuileries.  --  The whole surface is sprinkled with heathen mythology . Hercules strangles the Hydra , Theseus deals blows to the Minotaur . Prometheus sits sullen on his rock , and Antinous is mad to see his own gardens outdone , and the Pius iEneas , little Jule by the hand , bears off his aged parent upon his shoulders . Venus too looks beautiful a straddle of a tortoise , and Ceres is beautiful , tier head coiffed in the latest fashion with sheaves of wheat . On the side next the Palace you will see a knife-grinder , whom every- // /z/ body admires , and statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pericles , Cincinnatus , Scipio , Ccesar and Spartacus . You may imagine what life these images , set out alone and in groups through the garden , give to the perspective .  --  The whole scene is as beautiful as my description of it is detestable . The French are justly proud of this garden and are every year increasing the quantity of its statuary ; it will become at length one of the splendid galleries of the capital ; its silent lessons improving the public taste in the arts and elegancies of life , how much better than the lessons of the schools ! I like to see , in spite of English authority , a good deal of art in a city garden ; a rude and uncivilized field seems to me no more appropriate there than a savage and unpolished community . In this garden there is no drinking , no smoking , no long faces waiting the preliminary soups , or turning up of noses over the relics of a departed dinner . It is -a spot sacred to the elegant and intellectual enjoyments . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of fashionable company , and that near the Rue Rivoli has always a hedge of ladies extending along each margin the third of a mile . In another section a thousand or two of children are engaged in their infantile sports , and their army of nurses are gathering also a share of the health and amusements . Here are the most graceful little mothers , and children and nurses of the world ; I will send you over one of each some of these days for a pattern . How delightful to walk of an early morning amidst the silent congregation of statues of eminent men , of heroes , and mythological deities . I often rise with the first dawn for the sole luxury of this enjoyment . Very early the Cabinet de lecture opens its treasures to the /z/ anxious politicians , who sit retired here and there through the shady elms . One with a doctrinal air spreads open the " Journal des Debate ; " he reads , ruminates , ponders , and now and then writes down an idea on his tablets ; another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grisly mustaches , devouring the " National ; " he rises sometimes , clenches his two fists , and sits down again ; and a third , in a neat and venerable garb , a snuff-colored coat and tie-wig , his handkerchief and snuff-box at his side ( from the Faubourg St. Germain ) , lays deliberately upon his lap the " Quotidienne . " And here and there you will see a diligent schoolboy preparing his college recitations ; perusing his Ovid at the side of a Daphne and Apollo , or by a group of Dryads skulking behind an oak , or of Naiads plunging into a fountain . You will see one individual upon the southern terrace , his hands clasped , walking lonely , or standing still , his eyes stretched towards the west , till a tear steals down his cheeks . He is a stranger , and a thousand leagues of ocean yawn between him and his native country ! 1 love this terrace of all things : it has a look towards home . When I receive your letters I come here to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty woman honors me with her company , why we come hither together , and in this shady hpwer , I tell her of our squaw wives and the little pappooses , until the sun fades away in the west . All day long this elegant saloon has its society , and a lady can walk in it , unaccompanied , when and whither she pleases . Every day is fashionable , but some more than others ; and from four till six , are the fashionable hours . The crowd by degrees thickens , the several groups are formed , and towards four , the panorama is complete . This is the time that one stands gaping at /z/ the long file of ladies upon each side of the wide walk , or that one strolls up and down eyeing them along the intervening avenue , or airs or fans one 's idle minutes upon the terrace overlooking this scene of enchantment . I never venture in here , without saying that part of the Lord 's prayer about temptation , which I used to leave out in the Coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long glimmering twilight , peculiar to these northern climates , wanes away gently into night . Then the king 's band strikes up its concert from the front of the palace , and then you ' will see the graveled walk leading to the steps of the royal residence , and the transversal alley , filled with ten thousand listeners , bound in the spell of Rosiui and Mozart for an hour ; an hour too , in which the air has a more balmy fragrance , and the music a more delicious harmony . Innumerable lights in the meantime shine out from the Palace windows and the Rue Rivoli , and glimmer through the tufted trees of the garden . The plantation of elms has also at this hour its little enchantments . Lovers using the sweet opportunities of the night , and seated apart from the crowd , breathe their soft whisperings into each other 's ears , in a better music than the king 's , and you can see visions of men and women , just flit by you now and then in the doubtful light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am venturing upon the poetical point of my description , which I had better leave to your fancy . Alas , I squandered away all my poetry last week upon the Palais Royal , and have left myself nothing but mere prose to describe to you the exquisite and incomparable Tuileries . The regulations of this garden are simple . The world is admitted , if trim and dressed decently , with the morning dawn , and is dispersed about nine in the evening /q/ by the beating of a drum . One is not permitted to enter with anything of a large bundle . The minister of finance was stopped the other day ; he was attempting to enter with the budget for this year ! The rules are enforced by an individual accoutred in a beard , mustaches , red breeches and a carbine , who walks gravely up and down at the entrance of each gate . The statues ( Lucretia and ail ) are exposed in a state of the most unsophisticated nakedness . If mother Eve should come back , she would find things here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aprons . This to us green Americans , at our arrival , is a subject of great scandal . 1 had with me a modest Yankee ( please excuse the tautology ) on my first visit here , and we stumbled first on a Venus de Medici , which was passable , for she apologized manibus passis for her deshabille as well as she could ; then a Hercules , and at length we fell in with a Venus just leaving her bath . " Come , " said he , interrupting my curiosity , and drawing me aside , " let us go out ; 1 do n't think this is a decent place . " You must not imagine , however , my dear , that you Americans are essentially more ******* . Things of every day 's occurrence are never a subject of remark ; and if our first mother had not begun these modesties of the toilette , the world might have gone on , as in her time , and no one would have taken notice of it . Americans ( I presume I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the customs of foreign nations than any other people ; they are more plastic and easily fitted to every condition of life . Talk to any one of your acquaintance , of a community of lodging in her mansion in Chestnut street , and she will have a fit of hysterics at least , and six months after , you will find her climbing up a long Parisian staircase as long as Jacob 's ladder , in /z/ common with half a dozen of families , and delighted with her apartments . An Englishman or Frenchman in foreign countries can no more change his habits than the /Ethiop his skin . I may as well go on gardening through the whole of this letter . Oar little squares and squaroids of Philadelphia have 4heir little advantages ; I do not mean to disparage them , but from want of extent they are not susceptible of any elegant improvement , nor do they furnish a promiscuous multitude with the necessary accommodations ; they lose , therefore , their rank in society , and become unfashionable . All your pretty squarettes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put into the Tuilerics alone . I have not yet seen the English parks , but report says they would swallow up our whole city . And I have known even these little spots of ours to be looked at with a suspicious eye . I have heard men calculate the value of the houses and other things which might be built upon them . The " Independence Square " is worth a thousand dollars a foot , every inch of it ; why do n't the New Yorkquois sell their Battery ? Oh , the magnificent wharves , and the warehouses and hotels that might grow upon it ! Besides , who but the caterpillars , and they half starved , venture into it ? With all its breezes from the sea , its port more beautiful than Naples , its fleets laden with India , Persia and Arabia , a fashionable woman will not look through the fence . Railroads and spinning-jennies , are to be sure excellent things , but they lead us too much to measure value by its capacity to supply some physical necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also its wants . If riches only were necessary to the prosperity of a nation , I should to-day perhaps , instead of the Boulevards , be strolling through the fashionable streets of Babylon. /q/ If a painting , or a statue , by perpetuating the memory of virtuous and religious men , and the glorious events of history , as the power of elevating the mind and inspiring it with emulous feelings , as Scipio Africanus and other great men used to testify ; if it has the power of improving taste , which is improving virtue , or affording pleasure , which is a part of our natural wants , or even of employing time innocently , which might be otherwise employed wickedly  --  perhaps in getting drunk at the tavern  --  why then a statue , or a painting , is not only more ornamental , but as useful as a steam-engine or a spinning-jenny . The Scythian who preferred the neighing of a horse to a fine air of Timotheus , no doubt was a good Scythian , but we are not , in our present relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scythian simplicity , but it is worth while to consider what is about to be the condition of a people , who have grown luxurious , consequently vicious , without the refinements and distractions of the fine arts and liberal amusements . Utility with all her arithmetic very often miscalculates . By keeping vacant spaces open in the midst of a town , an equivalent value is given to other localities . A garden would bring many , who now waste their time in traveling into airy situations , to the neighborhood of the Exchange and other places of business , and it would drive many out from such places who may as well be anywhere else  --  whose time at least is of less value . Since human nature will have her diversion , the business of the statesman is to amuse her innocently ; that is , to multiply pleasures which are cheap and accessible to all  --  pleasures which are healthy , and especially those which are public . Men never take bad habits under the eye of the world ; but secret amusements are sedentary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serous excesses . Every one knows the social disposition of our race ; it is a disposition founded upon both our good and bad passions  --  upon our love of kindred , and other loves  --  upon a sense of weakness and dependence ; and curiosity , vanity , and even malevolence find their gratification in social intercourse . It is , therefore , the duty of statesmen to study that our crowds and meetings of pleasure , which they can not prevent , should not be in gin-shops and taverns . Let us have gardens , then , and other public places where we may see our friends , and parade our vanities , if you will , before the eyes of the world .  --  Did you ever know any one who was not delighted with a garden ? What are the best descriptions of the best poets ? Their gardens . It is the original taste ; it is transmitted from Paradise ; and is almost the only gratification of the rich that does not cloy in the possession . I know an English gentleman here , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at twenty-eight ; he is peevish , ill-natured , and insupportable ; we sometimes walk together into the Luxembourg , where he suddenly brightens up , and is agreeable , and as happy for a while as if he was no lord . To know the advantages of these places to the poor , one must visit the close alleys , crowded courts , and overpeopled habitations of an overgrown city ; where vices and diseases are festering in secret in the heart Of the community . Why send missionaries to the South Seas , while these infected districts are unreclaimed ? or why talk of popular religion , and morals , and education ?  - -  the people who would employ about half the care and expense in preventing a disposition to vice , that they now employ in correcting it , would be the people the most happy and innocent of the earth . The best specifics , /q/ I can conceive , against the vagabond population of a city , are gardens , airy streets , and neat houses . Men 's habits of life are degraded always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars ' nests , " we must expect beggars to breed in them . Gardens give a taste for out-door exercises , and thereby promote health and physical development ; and they aid in keeping up the energy of a nation , which city life , in depriving the women and children of air and exercise , tends perpetually to destroy . To the children they give not only habits of health , cheerfulness and gracefulness , but an emulation of neatness and good manners , which they would surely not acquire under the sober stimulus of home and the nursery ; to the nurses , too , they impart a valuable share of the same benefits . Finally , by gardens and other embellishments of a city we induce strangers to reside there . About fifty thousand English are now residents in France , and their necessary expense is rated at half a million of pounds sterling annually . It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that no property pays so abundant a revenue to a city as its gardens . What is it that produces to # city the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of London without its parks ? And why should Paris be the choice residence of Europe , but for its galleries , and public gardens ; its Tuileries , its Palais Royal , its Luxembourg , Tivoli , its Champs Elysees and Bois de Boulogne ? But to make gardens is not enough ; you must cultivate the public taste for them . For this it is necessary , that they be made ornamental , kept by a vigilant police , and that fashionable women should frequent them . The French women have better sense of their advantages than to suffer their fine gardens to become /z/ vulgar . They have to be sure days and hours that are more genteel than others ; but they are to be seen there every day , and there is room for all classes without incommoding each other . Even the poorer classes will not frequent a garden that only poor devils visit . They are flattered to be seen within the sphere of good company , and are encouraged to appear there with becoming decency . It is not to be denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners and dress , and graceful beyond the example of all other nations . In what more serviceable manner can a lady of fortune benefit her country and humanity , than by improving the manners and elevating the character of the lower classes ? she is taking care of her own interest in taking care of the poor . If . was the pride of the French nobility , and not the Jacobins , that set loose the many-headed tyranny of the Revolution ; it was not Robespierre , but Louis XIV , and Louis XV , who put the axe to the throat of their unhappy successor . Much intercourse of mind or society is not indeed to be expected between two classes of a different education and fortune ; nor can it be desired by either ; but there is nothing in our code of morals or religion , which can justify either one in treating the other with unkindness or incivility . True dignity has no need to stand on the defensive . A lady who has little of this quality , will always be most afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be economical of what one has little . The contempt of the rabble , which we hear of so much , where not sheer ignorance , is three-fourths of it , parade and affectation . She , who abroad hangs the common world with so much scorn upon her nose , lives at home , under the same roof , almost at the same table , with the veriest rabble of the whole community , MR. burke 's opinion . 109 her own servants and slaves . Why should we abandon the Tuileries more than the Boulevards , and why the Washington Square more than Chestnut Street , because the common people walk in it ?  --  I have written upon this subject , more at length and more earnestly than perhaps I ought , from the mortification , the almost indignation I feel after witnessing the utility and ornament of gardens in other countries , at the immense defect occasioned by their stupid omission in the face of European experience , in the beauty and comfort of our American cities .

Paris , August 1st , 1835 . The Parisians have set apart three days annually , to commemorate their Revolution of 1S30  --  the 27th , 28th and 29th of July ; they call them the " Three Glorious Days . " On the 27th , are showers of sermons all over town in the churches , and fastings over good dinners in the cafes ; pious visits , too , are paid to the graves of those , who had the glory of being killed on the original " three days , " who are called " the martyrs , " and are buried on or near the spot upon which they were killed . The military parade is the 28th , and the gala or jubilee day is the 29th . LITTLE WIDOW . Ill As the time approaches , the town is big with visitors , and all is noise and preparation . Yew trees are planted by the graves of the " martyrs , " where the dogs and other obscene animals , the rest of the year , wallow ; and willows are set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , and orchestras , and platforms for the buffoons ; and the illuminations , which they keep ready made from year to year , are brought out upon the Champs Elysees . Every evening the whole of Paris comes out to see these works , and says : this is for the mourning of the 27th , and this is for the dancing of the 29th . On the present occasion , a rain had turned the streets into mud ; but the French turn out on their fete days , mud or no mud , and in numbers far exceeding our notions of arithmetic . The 27th arrived , and every street and avenue poured their waves into the Boulevards and Champs Elysees , as so many rivers their waters to the ocean . A plump little widow of our hotel offered to guide my inexperience in the crowd , which I accepted . I took her for her skill in the town , and she me for my manhood , as a blind person takes a lame one for the use of his eyes .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no sooner on the street , than she ran right off in a hurry , each of her little feet doing its uttermost to get before the other , and kept me running after her all day long ;  --  you have sometimes seen a colt running after its mother , now falling behind , and now catching up with her ; and there were just in front of me , I verily believe , five thousand French women , each exhibiting a pair of pretty ankles . A stranger has a great many things to see that are no curiosities to the natives . Never take a native with you as a guide , but always some one who knows no more than yourself . On these /z/ muddy occasions , a French woman just places her hand upon the right hip , gathering up her lower gear on the nether side to the level of the knee , and then whips along , totally regardless of that part of the world that is behind her ; as in a chariot race yon see the charioteer bending over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not caring a straw for those he has passed by .  --  You might have seen my guide and me , one while walking slowly and solemnly in a file of Sisters of Charity , and then looking down upon an awful procession from a gallery of the Boulevards ; next you might have seen us behind a bottle of u . vin ordinaire , " at the cafe Turc ; and then seated snugly together at the church of St. Roch . Here we witnessed an interesting ceremony  --  a marriage . Fifteen young girls , and the same number of young men , children of the martyrs , were intermarried . They are apportioned by the government ; and the marrying is to continue till the whole stock is married off as encouragement to new " martyrs . " We stayed one hour here , and had a great deal of innocent squeezing , with prayers and sacred music , and then we went home , and had capons for dinner . After this repast , I sallied out again , under the segis of my same guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through thickets of men and women , all getting along in the slime of each other 's tracks , towards the Hotel de Ville . Here , in the midst of an immense crowd , were the shrines of the martyrs , and over them a chapel of crape , with all the other mournful emblems . The relatives of the deceased were hanging up chaplets , and reverend men were saying prayers , and sprinkling holy water upon the graves . I thought , of the dog whose master lies buried here  --  the dog so pathetically sung by Beranger. /z/ By the Louvre gate Where buried lie the men of July , And flowers are flung by the passer-by , The dog howls desolate . Dreaming on the grave he hears his master 's whistle in the night . " II l'entend qui siffle dans l'ombre , Se leve et saute apres son ombre En gemissant . " July 28th . This day was given to the general parade . More than a hundred thousand of the National Guards were arrayed upon the Boulevards ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , which was pushed back now and then , in great fright and confusion , by the gens d'armes , and the tails of the horses ; and all the rest of Paris looked on from the windows , balconies , and roofs of the adjoining houses  --  I as much noticed as a leaf of the Alleghany , upon a verandah of the Boulevard du Temple . Great was the noise , and long and patient the expectation . At length there was a sudden flustering and bustle among the multitude , and I sat up closer to Madame Dodu  --  it was the king ! He was accompanied by the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Nemours , his sons , and passed along the line , followed by officers on horseback , very grim . He was received with not very ardent acclamations . Compared to " General Jackson 's visit , " it was a fifth rate thing . Not a bird , though many flew over us , fell dead . But how shall I describe to you the magnificence of the pomp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How should we  --  toe , who can hardly contain the Washington Greys , or Blues  --  which is it ? with John- /z/ son 's band , and twenty little boys who run after them  - -  how should we be able to conceive of a regular infantry of more than a hundred thousand men , with their ten thousand drums , and trumpets , and clarions , and accoutred in uniform , and trained to the last grace and dexterity of discipline ? But , alas ! what avails to individual power this exhibition of human strength , since we see its haughtiest pretensions , every day , the sport of some ignominious chance ? Achilles , they say , was killed by the most effeminate roui of all Troy ; and his great descendant , Pyrrhus , by an old woman , who lived  --  au troisilme , " and pitched , the Lord knows what , upon his head through her window . What signifies the strength of Hercules , if it may be outwrestled by a vapor ?  --  It is vexatious , too , to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little Providence seems to trouble itself about them ; and to think how vain a thing is that boast of the world  --  human wisdom ! I knew a man who missed his fortune , and was ruined by his prudence ; and another , who saved his house from being burnt by his foolishness ! Who has not heard of no less an emperor than Bonaparte being saved by some vanity of his wife ?  --  the Infernal Machine blowing up , she fixing her tournure , or something in her chamber ; and he fretting at the delay , and churning his spite through his teeth ? Why , I have read of a lady , who preserved her life by staying home at loo , on a Sunday , instead of going to prayers , where the church fell in , and killed the whole congregation . Yet , with all this experience , men still continue to be haughty of their strength , self-sufficient of their wisdom , and to throw Providence in each other 's teeth , when anything happens .  --  But this morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and his escort approached the east /q/ end of the Boulevards , a deadly machine , prepared by a man named Fieschi , ( Infernal Machine maker to his Majesty , ) was discharged from the window of a small wine store , and made havoc of the crowd ; the king , with his two sons , by a special Providence , standing unhurt amidst the slaughter ; not a hair was singed , not a garment was rent !  --  He continued to the end of the line , and returned over the scene of the murder . His cool and undaunted countenance gave a favorable opinion of his courage ; and his danger , accompanied by such cruel circumstances , has turned the sympathies of a great many in his favor , who cared not a straw for him yesterday . Of the twelve persons killed , Marshal Mortier , Duke of Treviso , is the most distinguished . Eighteen persons were wounded . I was so near as to smell the gunpowder ; which was quite near enough for a foreigner . I have since visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this murder is a Corsican who has served a long time his apprenticeship to villany in the French army . I have seen his machine ; it is composed of a series of gun-barrels , and is a bungling contrivance . The French , with all their experience , do n't shine in this kind of manufacture . It would seem a most contemptible thing in the eyes of a Kentucky rifleman . This fellow 's fame , however , is assured ; he will stand conspicuous in the catalogue of the regicide villains . The others have all aimed at a single bird , but he at the whole flock . One is almost tempted to regret that Ravaillac 's boots are out of fashion . He attempted to escape through a back window , but the bursting of one of his guns disabled him . His head is fractured and mangled ; they expect , however , that by the care of his physician he may get well enough to be hanged . /z/ The last scene , the dismissal of the troops , was in the Tlace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony .  --  I must not forget that in this place 1 lost my faithful guide , who had borne the fatigues and adventures of the day with me . Whether she had wandered from the way , or wearied had sat down , or had stopped to garter up her stockings , is uncertain  --  certain it is that she was lost here in the crowd , nee post oculis est reddita nostris . On the west of the great column , the statue of Bonaparte all the while peering over him , sat the king on horseback , saluting the brigades as they passed by . His three sons attended him , and some of his generals and foreign ambassadors ; and the queen and her daughters , and Madame Adelaide , the sister , and such like fine people , were on a gallery overhead , fanned by the national flags . As the queen descended there was a shout from the multitude more animated than any of the whole day . The king sat here several hours , and received the affection of his troops bare-headed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a smile  --  just such a smile as one is obliged to put on , when one meets an amiable and pretty woman whom one loves , in a fit of the colic . July 29th . All Paris was so overwhelmed with grief for the death of General Mortier , and the " narrow escape of the king , " that it blighted entirely the immense enjoyment we had expected for this day  --  the last and best of the  --  three glorious days . " Ball rooms and theatres were erected with extraordinary preparation all over the Champs Elysees , and the fire works were designed to be the most brilliant ever exhibited in Europe . Multitudes had come from distant countries to see them . I say nothing of the /z/ private losses and disappointments ; of the booths and fixtures put up and now to be removed , and the consequent ruin of individuals ; or of the sugar plums , candies , gingerbread nuts , barley sugar , and all the rancid butter of Paris bought up to make short cakes  --  all broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasure dashed from our very lips to the ground . We were to have such an infinite feast , too , furnished by the government . As for me , I was delighted a whole week in advance , and now  --  I am very sorry . Under the Empire , and before , and long after , it was a common part of a great festival here to have thrown to the people bread and meat , and wine , and to set them to scramble for the possession , as they do ravens , or hounds in a kennel , or the beasts at the Menagerie . To put the half starved population up as an amusement for their better fed neighbors ; to pelt them with pound loaves and little pies ; to set a hurricane of sausages to rain over their heads ; and to see the hungry clowns gape with enormous mouths , and scramble for these eatables ; and to see the officers , facetious fellows , employed to heave out these provisions , deceive the expectant mouths , by feints and tricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cork , to leap from one skull to another  --  what infinite amusement ! One of the benefits of the last Revolution was to put an end to this dishonor of the French nation . This is all I have to say of the " three glorious days . " I must trust to-morrow to furnish me something for this blank space . Goodnight . Rue St. Anne , August 2d . Louis Philippe has had nothing but trouble with these French people , ever since he undertook their govern- /z/ Blent . He has about the same enjoyment of his royally , as one sea-sick has of the majesty of the ocean . He is lampooned in the newspapers , caricatured in the printshops , hawked about town , placarded upon the walls of every street , and gibbeted upon every gateway and lamp-post of the city . In 1831 , a revolt was suppressed by Marshal Soult at Lyons ; another was got up in the same place in 1834 , in which there were six days ' fighting , six thousand slain , and eighteen hundred crammed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmishing at the Cloister St. Merri , in which were five hundred arrests in one night ; and one hundred and fifty are on trial ( the " Proces Monstre , " so much talked of ) , in the Chamber of Peers ; and now we have superadded this affair of Fieschi , with great expectations for the future . The foreigners here are full of ill-bodings , and I hear nothing but revolutions in every rustling leaf . We shall have our brains knocked out by the mob someone of these days . It rains nothing but Damiens and Ravaillacs , and Jacques Clements , all over town . Every one is prophetic ; and I am going after the general example to cast the king 's horoscope quietly in my corner , and calculate for you his chances . It will be a pretty thing if I ca n't eke out a letter from so important an event , and the only one of any kind that has happened since I have been in Paris . The main strength of the government is the Chamber of Deputies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It represents , then , not the mass of the people , who are thirty-two millions , but property* which has a natural interest in peace and quietude upon any reasonable terms . Besides , the voters being divided into small electoral colleges , are tangible , and easily /q/ bribed by offices , and local interests ; and the members of the chamber also are allowed to hold other offices , and are very eager to possess them ; and if the king does not bind both these parties about his neck , he has less policy than the world gives him credit for . He has with his ministry , one hundred and fifty thousand of these bribes at his disposal . So , also , has he a large majority of this chamber in his favor . Freeholders paying less than two hundred francs annual tax are not entitled to a vote . These are murmuring , and struggling for an extension of suffrage ; but this they do not expect from a change , and are therefore in favor of the present dynasty . This class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is by far the most numerous . Not more than fifteen hundred landed proprietors of the kingdom have a revenue above twelve thousand pounds . The king has also his means of popularity with the poorer classes ; amongst which I may mention the " Saving Banks , " established on the responsibility of the government ; one hundred of these are in Paris alone . They not only encourage the economy , industry , and orderly habits of the lower classes , but biud them by the strongest of all interests to the government . For the active support of this power , there is a national guard of eight hundred thousand men , all proprietors , and having interests to hazard in a revolution . There is an immense regular army of near five hundred thousand men , and disaffection in this body would indeed be dangerous ; but who is the master spirit , who can hope , of a force so dispersed , and with a continual change of position and officers , to concert a general plan of revolt ? Finally , the chief learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king . In his councils you find such men as Thiers , Guizot , Royer Collard , Villemain , Barrante , /z/ Keratry , and a number of others of the same caste , who were the main instruments in setting up the present government , and have of course a personal interest in its support . The elements of the opposition are the Liberals , in favor of a constitutional monarchy , with an extension of suffrage and other popular rights : unwilling to endure under the present rulers what they resisted under their predecessors ; secondly , the Republicans , downright enemies of all sorts of monarchy , and in favor of an elective government , as that of the United States . This party is numerous , but without any concentration of strength ; and finally , the Carlists , the partisans of the ancient monarchy , and its legitimate sovereigns . These parties all abut against each other , and have scarce a common interest ; and I do not see from what quarter any one of them can set up a rival dangerous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a high degree , and he exerts both diligently in improving the condition of the people . He favors agriculture , commerce and the arts of peace ; he thrives by his own wit , as well as by the silliness of his predecessors . New streets and houses are rising up to bless him all over Paris . The nation was dragooned into Louis XVIII . and Charles X. by foreign bayonets ; Louis Philippe is its own choice . He took part also in the Revolution , and can not be feared as the partisan of anti-revolutionary doctrines ; the peasants need not dread under his reign a restitution of the spoils of the nobility . He is also exemplary in private life ; he rises early and sees after his business ; knocks up his boys and packs them off to school with the other urchins of the city , and thinks there is no royal way to mathematics . For his /q/ pacific policy alone he deserves to go to heaven . It can not be doubtful that war is one of the most aggravating miseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the essential cause of their revolutions and national calamities the French need not reason beyond a simple statistical view of their wars for the last five centuries . They had in this period thirty-five years of civil , and forty of religious wars , and of foreign wars seventy-six on , and one hundred and seventy-six off the French territory ; and their great battles are one hundred and eighty-four . One does not comprehend why the judgments of heaven should not fall upon a nation , which consumes a half nearly of its existence in carrying on offensive wars . And moreover ( a new virtue in a French king ) , Louis Philippe keeps no left-handed wives  --  no " Belles Feronieres , " no " Gabrielle d'Estrees , " or " Madame Lavallieres ; " he sticks to his rib of Sicily , with whom he has nine children living all in a fresh and vigorous health . Why , then , seek to kill a king recommendable by so many excellent qualities ? Attempts at regicide are not always proofs of disloyalty in a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse of the army , have been turned loose upon the community , and these , in disposing of their own worthless lives , seek that of the king in order to die gloriously upon the Place St. Jacques . I have no doubt that the majority of the nation desire ardently his safety . France has tried alternately the two extremes of human government , or rather misgovernment . She has rushed from an unlimited monarchy to a crazy democracy , and back into a military despotism . She has tilted the vessel on one side , then run to the other , and at length is taking her station in the middle . The general temper of the public mind now favors a moderate government , and this vol. i.  --  11 /z/ is wisdom bought at so dear a rate that it would be underrating the common sense of the nation to suppose it will be lightly regarded . Here is a copy of each of the Paris newspapers . You will see something of the spirit in which they are conducted , and one of the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly no country in which a newspaper has so great an influence , and none in which the editor is so considerable a man as in Paris . The Constitution ? iel opposes and defends all parties , and is pleased and displeased with all systems of government . It courts the favor of the " Petite Bourgeoisie , " the shopkeepers , who are always restless and displeased , but their interests require a quiet pursuit of business . This is the most gossiping gazette of them all , and gossips very agreeably . The Journal des Debats represents the " haute Bourgeoisie , " the rich industrial classes , whose great interests are order and security of property , and the maintenance of peace with foreign countries . The " Partie Doctrinaire , " the chief supporters of this paper , are a kind of genteel liberals , holding the balance between confirmed royalists and democrats , and ultra liberals . They have supported their doctrines with a great display of scholastic learning , which has given them their appellation of " Doctrinaires . " Their leaders are mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Villemain , Keratry and Barrante . This paper has a leaning towards a vigorous monarchy and the Orleans dynasty ; it is now doing what it can , in its moderate way , to discredit the republicanism of the United States . The Gazette de France and the Quotidienne are opposed directly to the present government , and in favor of the legitimate monarchy in the person of Henry V. /q/ The former advocates royalty with extended suffrage , the increase of power in the provinces , and decrease of the influence of the capital ; the latter insists upon the re-establishment in its fullest extent , of the ancient monarchy . The National asserts republicanism outright , on the system of the United States . It is conducted with spirit and ability , at present , by M. Carel . In assuming his office he announced himself in his address as follows : " La responsibility du National ptee en entier des ce jour sur ma seule tele ; si quelqhin s'oublidt en invective an sujet de cettefeuille , il trouverait a quiparler . " With this the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , co-operates . The Moniteur reports the speeches of the Chambers , and official documents , and is the ostensible organ of the government . The Temps , the Courier , the Messager , and Journal du Commerce , all advocate reform on constitutional principles . There are smaller papers , too , conducted with ability . These , with Galignani , and some other English prints , make up the newsmongrie of Paris . The price of Galignani , and the principal French papers , is twenty dollars a year , and their number of regular subscribers about 20,000 . In Paris they are generally read by the hour , and transferred from one individual to another , and disposed of in the evening to the public establishments , or sent off to the country . In this manner they are read by an immense number of persons daily . The price of advertising in the best papers is about thirty sous per line . The first men of the nation are amongst the constant contributors to these papers , both as correspondents and editors . The editorial corps around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit or reject com- /z/ munications . These have their daily meetings with the functionaries of the state , and their correspondents in every foreign country . Argus , with his hundred eyes , and Briareus with lhs hundred hands , preside over the preparation of the daily meal . In our country , where the same man caters , cooks and does the honors , it would be unfair to make any comparison of ability . There is one point , however , in which there is no good reason why we should allow the French or any other people the superiority . It is the decency of language in which animated debates are conducted . To be eloquent , or even vituperative , it is not necessary to be abusive , or transgress the rules of good breeding ; polish neither dulls the edge nor enervates the vigor of the weapon . The existence of agencies between the owners and readers of newspapers is an immense gain to the liberty of the press . There can be very little freedom of opinion , where the editor and proprietor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation with their patrons . In speaking of the powers of the government , I have said nothing of the Chamber of Peers . It is but a feather in either scale . It wants the hereditary influence , and great estates necessary to command popular respect . The title of peer is for life only , and is the reward of prescribed services in all the chief employments of the state . It is a cheap dignity which pleases grown up children , and consists of a ribbon in the button-hole . I have said nothing either of Bonapartism , which has gasped its last . The most violent enmities against the emperor seem to have burnt out . No danger is now apprehended either from his family or his partisans , and the mind is open to a full sense of the glory he has conferred upon the nation ; and there is mixed up with admiration of his talents a sentiment of affection , from the recollection of /q/ his great reverses of fortune , and his patient sufferings . I have heard all parties speak of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the present government to have taken into favor all his plans for the improvement of the country , and to have placed him in his citizen 's coat , and cocked hat , stripped of its military plumes , upon his column .

" He is a kind of public informer , and does the honors of Paris to us raw Yankees , just come over . He has on his left arm a basket of provisions , a couple of claret-bottles exhibiting their slender necks over the margin of the basket : and on his right , a lady , his sister , who is to accompany us . She is exceeding pretty , with a complexion of drifted snow , and a rosiness of cheeks  - -  I have no comparison only strawberries and cream .

And there is now a botanic garden besides immense conservatories : also a splendid gallery of anatomy , of botany , and a menagerie ; a library , too , of natural history , and laboratories , and an amphitheatre , in which there are annually thirteen courses of lectures . And then there is the School of Drawing and Painting , of Natural History , all gratuitous . We will just step into an omnibus on the Boulevards , and for six sous we shall be set down at the very gate . Oh , it is quite near , only two steps . " I resign myself to the lady .

The French women , if the place should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little souls tell you . It is always " two steps , " and under this temptation of " two steps , " you are often induced into a walk of several miles .

A French lady asked me the way to-day on the street , and though I did not know it , I ran all about showing her , out of gratitude .

He gives you back your purse if you drop it in his coach : he is the type of the omnibus driver . You have your choice of the " .

It sets off always at the minute , not waiting for a load ; and then you have a " correspondence ; " that is , you have a ticket from the conducteur at the end of one course , which gives you a passage without additional charge for the next . You go all around the world for six sous . You change your omnibus three times from the Barriere du Trone , to the Barriere de I'Etoile , which are at the east and west extremities of the city . In Paris everybody rides in an omnibus . The Chamber of Peers rides in an omnibus . I often go out in the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to ride in . I rode this morning between a grisette with a bandbox , and a knight with a decoration . Some of /z/ the plcasantest evenings I have spent here were in an omnibus , wedged in between the easy embonpoint of a healthy pair of Frenchwomen . If yon get into melancholy , an omnibus is the best remedy you can imagine . Whether it is the queer shaking over the rough pavement , I can not say , but you have always an irresistible inclination to laugh . It is so laughable to see your face bobbing into the face of somebody else ; it is so interesting , too , to know that one 's neighbors may be thinking about one ; and then the strange people , and the strange rencontres . I often give six sous just for the comic effect of an omnibus . Precipitate jolts against a neighbor one never saw , as the ponderous vehicle rolls over the stones , gives agitation to the blood and brains , and sets one a-thinking . And not the least part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places but the back seat are filled . This back seat is always the last to have a tenant . It is a circular board of about six inches in diameter at the very farthest end , and to reach it , you have to run the gauntlet between two rows of knees almost in contact ;  --  you set out , the omnibus setting out at the same time , and you get along sitting on a lady 's lap , now on this side , and now on that , until you arrive at your destination ; and there you are set up on a kind of pivot to be stared at by seventeen pair of black eyes , ranged along the two sides of the omnibus . The only evil I know of these vehicles is , that the seat being occupied by seven fat gentlemen , it may leave only six inches of space to a lady of two feet in diameter , so that she comes out compressed to such a degree , as to require a whole day of the enlarging and tightening capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes : a worse evil is that you often take /q/ an interest in a fellow traveler , from whom you are in a few minutes to be separated , perhaps forever ! We arrived at the garden just time enough before our repast to expatiate lightly upon its beauties . We visited first the Museum of Natural History , which occupies two stories of a building three hundred feet long . On the first floor are six rooms of geological and mineralogical collections ; on the second are quadrupeds , birds , insects , and all the family of the apes  --  two hundred specimens  --  and groups of crystals , porphyry , native gold and silver , rough and cut diamonds . Overlooking this whole animal creation is a beautiful statue of Venus Urania  --  hominum diviimque voluptas ! In one apartment is a group of six thousand birds in all their gay and glittering plumage ; and there are busts about the room in bronze , of Linnams , Foureroy , Petit , Winslow , Tournfort and Daubenton . Our American birds here have all got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their feathers . There would be no objection to call our noisy and stupid whip-poorwill , " caprimulgus vociferus , " but what do you think of calling our plain and simple Carolina wren " troglodytus ludovicianus ? " The insects have a room also to themselves , very snug and beautiful in cases , and sparkling like gems in all their variety of vivid and fantastic colors . We met here a naturalist , an acquaintance , who has lived the chief part of his life among spiders ' legs , and he explained to us the properties of the insects . He conversed upon their tenacity of life . He showed us a mite that had lived three months glazed to a bit of glass , and a beetle which had been above three years without eating , and seemed not particular how long it lived ; a spider also which had been kept one year on the same abstemious /z/ regimen , and yet was going on living as usual . Are you not ashamed , you miserable mortals , to be outlived by a beetle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps since the days of Ninus  --  how much better preserved than the mummied ladies and gentlemen who have been handed down to us from the same antiquity . And " Cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea , Dried butterflies , and tomes of casuistry . " This professor has been so long in the world of insects that he has taken a distaste to big things . I baited him with a whale and an elephant , but he would not bite . I knew once a botanist in America , who had turned entirely into a flower , and I accompanied an entomologist of this kind to the brow of one of those cliffs , which frown over the floods of the Susquehanna , where one could not read Milton , and there he turned up rotten logs for grubs and snails for his museum . It seems that even the study of nature , when confined to its minute particles , does not tend to enlarge or elevate the mind . I have observed that the practice even of hunting little birds , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to harpoon whales , chase deer , bears , wolves and panthers , give a disdain of what is trifling , and raise the mind to vast and perilous enterprises . The study of entomology , I mean the exclusive study , leaves , 1 presume , to the artist about as big a soul as the beetle , " or the wood-louse That folds itself in itself for a house . " There is a building apart also for the " Botanic Garden . " It has an herbal of twenty-five thousand species of plants . You will see here a very pretty collection /q/ of the mushrooms in wax  --  it is delightful to see the whole family together . The Cabinet of " Comparative Anatomy " has also separate lodgings . It contains skeletons of all animals compared with man and with one another , about twelve thousand preparations . It is a population of anatomies ; it looks like nature 's laboratory , or like the beginnings of creation , about the second or third day . Here are all the races which claim kindred with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hottentot , and several of our Indian tribes . Here is a lady wrapped in perpetual virginity and handed down to us from Sesostris and the mummy of somebody 's majesty , that , divested of its wrappings , weighs eight pounds , that used to " walk about in Thebes ' streets three thousand years ago . " We descanted much upon this wonderful school of nature  - -  upon the varieties , analogies , and differences of the animal creation . " How strange that the Chinese should wear their cues on the top in that way ! " said the lady . " How differently from us Europeans , " said the gentleman . " Only look at this dear little fish ! " " Sister , do n't you think it is time to dine ? "  --  And so we left the anatomical preparations for this more grateful preparation , the dinner . The great genius of this place , the Baron Cuvier , is defunct . He has now a place , for aught I know , among his own collections . Alas , the skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comparative Anatomy ! In roaming about we examined superficially the garden ; the largest part of which is occupied by the menagerie  --  This is not the reason it is called the " Garden of Plants . " There are seventeen different inclosures , and in each a committee of the several races of animals ; in one are the huge and pacific , as the /z/ elephants and bisons , in another the domestic , as goats , sheep , and deer . The camels are turning a machine to supply water  --  they who were bom to dispense with this element . In one you will see the wild and ferocious beasts and their dens ; as bears , tigars , hyenas , and wolves ; and there is a volery containing the vultures , and eagles , &c.; The monkeys are a beautiful family , about two hundred in number  --  their expression such as becomes sisters . The remainder of the garden , also , is divided into various apartments ; one is a botanic garden , with six thousand five hundred species of plants ; another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another contains a specimen of every kind of hedge , fence or ditch ; another every culinary vegetable used for the food of man ; and another is a piece of water appropriated to aquatic plants . The whole establishment contains five hundred and twenty-six thousand species of plants , minerals and animals . In the hot-houses and conservatories are ten thousand different species of vegetables . In the midst of the birds you see the eagle ; of the quadrupeds , his shaggy majesty the king of the beasts , and I observed that sober cacique the lama reclining amongst his native trees . The most extraordinary of these animals ( though nothing is extraordinary in Paris for a long time ) is the giraffe . On her arrival the professors and high dignitaries of the state went out to meet her at many days ' journey from the capital , and deputations from all the departments . She was attended by grooms and footmen , and " gentlemen of the bed chamber , " from her native country , and an African cow supplied her with African milk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was formally invited to visit the Archbishop at his country seat near /z/ Lyons , but refused ; whereupon his eminence , yielding to her claims of respect , went out to meet her , and was upset , his coach taking fright at the strange animal , et voilh son arislocratie par terre ! A military escort also proceeded from Paris , with members of the Institute and other learned bodies , which met her at Fontainbleau , and her entrance to the g*arden was a triumphal procession . The curiosity of the public had now risen to its height ( and there is no place where it can rise higher than in Paris ) . From ten to twenty thousand persons poured into this garden daily . Fresh portraits , by eminent artists , and bulletins of everything she did remarkable , were published weekly . All the bonnets and shoes and gloves and gowns  --  every species of apparel was made a la giraffe ; quadrilles were danced " a la giraffe . " She has large black eyes and pretty eyelashes , and the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eats maize and barley , and is very fond of roses ; in religion she is a St. Simonian . She takes an airing every morning in the park , in fine weather , and wears flannel next her skin in winter . Our guide now mounted up , we following , by a spiral walk to the summit of a hill , where there is a fine panoramic view of the city . In the centre of the spire is a little open kiosque , where we found seats , and a girl entertained us with choice sights through a telescope , at two sous a look . At length , after several little searches for a convenient place , we sat ourselves down underneath a hospitable tree , which , from its solemn and venerable aspect , and from my biblical recollections alone , I knew to be the cedar of Lebanon . Here our dinner was spread upon the earth . At the bottom of a hill is a dairy , which supplied milk , honey , eggs , fruit , and cofvol. i.  --  12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , like our great ancestor , being seated amidst creation , we partook with grateful hearts , our excellent repast  --  the enjoyment being enhanced by occasional conversation . " How I should like to pay a visit to your country ! " " It would give us great pleasure , madam , if you would come over . " " And I also ; the truth is I have a hearty contempt for these d  --  d monkey French people ; I ca n't tell why I ever came amongst them . " " How long have you been here , sir ? " " Twenty years  --  But what terrible accounts are coming over about your riots !  --  why you hang people up there , I see , without a trial ! "  --  No ; we try them after they are hung . " " Oh dear ! I should never be able to sleep quiet in my bed ! " " The fact is a republic wo n't do . " " Oh dear , no ; why cousin writes us from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if things go on so , Europeans will leave off emigrating ; that will be bad , wo n't it ? ( Do let me help you to a little tongue . ) But perhaps things will get better , America 's so young yet ; is n't she ? And then your Temperate Societies are doing a deal of good ; I read about them this morning . 1 am very particular about temperance ; ( You have nothing in your glass )  --  and then what Fanny Kemble says about the bugs  --  " " Yes ; and the fleas and mosquitoes too ; why it seems to me you ca n't have need of any other kind of ea-bottomy . " " Oh fie , brother !  --  I declare I like the Americans very much ; they are so good-natured .  --  Only look at that dear little hen !  --  Have you any muffled hens in your /z/ country  --  any bantams ? "  --  Thus a whole hour rolled by , unheeded in this delightful interchange of sentiment ; and the universe was created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the end of the dinner . I now turned up my eyes upon the hospitable branches , which had afforded us protection during this repast . The verdure of this tree is perpetual , and its branches , which are fashioned like the goose-quill , are spread out horizontally to cover an immense space . It pushes them from the trunk gradually upwards , and their outward extremity is bent gently towards the earth , so that the shelter is complete ; the rain running down the trunk or from the tip of these branches . You would easily know it was intended as a shelter for some chosen creatures of God . From its connection with sacred history , its venerable appearance , and extraordinary qualities , it is the most remarkable tree that grows upon the earth , and there is scarce any relic of the Holy Land more sacred . It is sung by Isaiah and Solomon ;  --  Justus florebit sicut cedrus Liba ? ii . "  --  " The glory of Lebanon , the beauty of Carmel , and the abundance of Sarron . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor does the smallest blade of grass presume to vegetate in its presence . It served to build the splendid temples of David and Solomon , also Diana 's Temple at Ephesus , Apollo 's at Utica , and the rich citizens of Babylon employed it in the construction of their private dwellings . Its wood is the least corruptible substance of the vegetable world . In the temple at Utica , it has been found pure and sound , after two thousand years . Its sawdust was one of the ingredients used to embalm the dead in Egypt , and an oil was extracted from it for the preservation of books . Its gum , too , is a specific for several diseases .  --  Since this cedar lives in cold climates , as all the cedar breed , and /z/ in unholy as well as holy lands , why does not some one induce it to come and live amongst us ? This one was brought to this garden by Jussieu in 1734 . It is a pity such gardens as this are not the growth of republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time what a sublime and pathetic lesson of religious and virtuous sentiment ! What more can all the records , and commentaries , and polemics of theology teach us than this ?  --  My next visit here shall be alone . Alone , I could have fancied myself a patriarch reclining under this tree . These camels , on their tread-mill , I could have turned into caravans , rich with spices of Araby ; 1 could have seen Laban 's flock in these buffaloes of the Missouri , and Rachel herself in the dairy-maid . If you take a woman with you , you must neglect the whole three kingdoms for her , and she will awake you in your most agreeable dreams ; whilst you are admiring the order and beauty which reign throughout creation , she will stick you down to a muffled hen , or a johnny-jumpup ; and while you are seated at the side of Jacob , or of some winged angel , she will make you admire the " goldfinches , the chaffinches , the bulfinches and the greenfinches " * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to my apartments in the Rue St. Anne , where I must leave you , you know how reluctantly , till to-morrow . I am invited out by Mr. P , one of the bravest men of the world from the Mississippi , who is just going home , and in the grief of separation , has called his friends around him at the " Hotel des Princes , " to dine . I must trust to the events of a new day to fill this remaining sheet . a traveler 's dinner . 137 Rue St. Anne , August 15th . I have not the courage to describe our gorgeous banquet ; I have an excessive headache . Though I ate of nothing but the soup and the fish , and game , and of the roasts and ragouts and side dishes , and then the dessert , drank scarcely anything but burgundy , medoc and champagne , and some coffee , and liqueur , yet I feel quite ill this morning . If one should die of the stomach-ache by eating a gooseberry pie , I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat the best dinners in the world , I recommend you to the Hotel des Princes , and the acquaintance of Mr. P. of the Mississippi . It is very much to be feared that in cookery , especially the transcendent branches , we shall long remain inferior to these refined French people . We have no class of persons who devote their whole minds to the art , and there is nothing to bring talents out into exercise and improvement . If any one does by force of nature get " out of the frying pan , " who is there to appreciate his genius ? He lives like Bacon , in advance of his age , and even runs the risk of dying of hunger in the midst of his own dishes . Besides , in America , in cooking , as all things else , we weaken our skill by expansion . The chief cook in this " Hotel of the Princes , " has spent a long life upon a single dish , and by this speciality , has not only ripened his talent into perfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as you have seen persons , by practicing a single virtue , get up a name for all the rest .  --  The English , too , are mere dabblers in this science . A French artist , to prepare and improve his palate , takes physic every morning , whereas an Englishman never sees the necessity of taking medicine unless he is sick ( " que lorsqu ' il est malade / " ) and his palate becomes indurated . In this country if a dish miss , or is /z/ underdone , do you believe that the cook survives it ? No , he despises the ignominious boon of life without reputation  --  he dies !  --  The death of Vatel is certainlyone of the most pathetic , as well as most heroic events , recorded in history . No epicure can read it without tears .  --  " Voire bonte " he said to the prince , who sought to console him , " Votre bonte " m'acheve !  --  je sais . . je sais que le roti a manque " a deux tables ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not go on . Madame Sevigne has given a full account of the tragical man 's end . I do not , however , approve of French gastronomy in everything . The cruelty exercised upon the goose is most barbarous . They recollect that a goose once brought ruin upon their ancestors in the Capitol , and they have no humanity for geese ever since . They formerly nailed the wretch by the feet to a plank , then crammed it , and deprived it of water , and exposed it to a hot fire ou elle passait tine vie assez malheureuse ) , until the liver became nearly as large as the goose ; which , being larded with truffles , and covered with a broad paste , bore the name of the inventor with distinction through the whole earth . A " Pate de foil gras " used to be a monopoly of diplomatic dinners , and it is known that a great national congress always assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle , on account of the number of geese resident in that city ; but they have now spread everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alleghany . I saw the whole village of Pottsville having an indigestion of one that was brought in there last year . Pray do not touch them unless with the veritable brand upon the crust ; some make them of gum elastic . When genuine they are wholesome , they are intelligential ; the ancients used to say proverbially , alienojecore sapit . I am glad to see that humanity , in the general /q/ march of civilization , has interfered in behalf of the goose . It is now enclosed immovably in a box , where it is crammed with maize and poppy oil , and other succulent food , and its eyes put out , so that it may give the whole of its powers to digestion  --  as that old Greek philosopher , who put out his eyes to give the whole mind to reflection  --  and a dropsical repletion of the liver being produced by the atony of the absorbents , the liver ( the only part of a goose that is now of any account in Europe ) is ready for the market . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , from our host , and 1 was anxious to write it down , while yet fresh in memory .  --  A single idea , you see , may be inflated , by nearly the same process as one of these livers , and made to cover a whole page ; I have room only to say , I am entirely yours . /z/ Burial of the victims  --  St. Cloud  --  The chateau  --  The cicerone  --  The Chevalier-d'Industrie  --  Grave of Mrs. Jordan  --  The Bois de Boulogne  --  Amusements on days  --  Place Louis XV .  --  The king at the Tuileries  --  The American address  --  His majesty 's reply  --  The Princess Amelia  --  The queen and her daughters  --  The Dukes of Orleans and Nemours  --  Madame Adelaide  --  Splendor of ancient courts  --  Manner of governing the French  --  William the Fourth  - -  Exhibition of the students at the University . Paris , August 24th , 1835. 1 believe I have not described to you the burial of the " victims , " which is no great matter , since you will /z/ see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day , with an immense crowd passing in a long file through the door of a church , and became one of its number . Here was a furnace , or chambre ardente , as they call it , into which a concealed flame threw a red and lurid light , and exhibited the corpses of those who were murdered . From this place they were brought out , and carried about the streets , in the most gorgeous of all funeral processions . It would have done credit to the best times of Babylon . No people of the world can get up a theatrical display of this kind so prettily as the French ; and on this occasion they outdid themselves . The day was appointed , four days ahead , when the general grief was to explode , and it did explode exactly as the Prefecture of Police had predicted .  --  We all ran about the streets the whole day , and cried , " long live " Louis Philippe , and General Mortier , who was killed ! The duke 's coffin was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnity of crape . The spokes of the wheels were silvered , and the rims glittered with a more precious metal . Over head were flags , I presume , taken from the enemy , and groups of emblematical figures . France with her tresses loose and streaming , and the departments all dressed in black frocks , mopping their eyes , and pouring out their little souls over the coffin . The others of the train , seven or eight , followed at long intervals , arrayed in nearly the same style , more or less elegant , according to the dignity of the corpses carried in them . In the midst was a chariot , as rich as the others in decoration , and forming a splendid contrast , of dazzling white , and young girls in raiment whiter than the snow , following in a long train , chanted hymns to their departed sister .  --  This procession had everything but funeral solemnity . I had expected muffled drums /q/ and dead marches ; and all , but the bell-clappers , silent over the face of Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military ; and all the emblems , but the crape and coffin , would have served as well for an elegant jubilee . The last scene  --  the entrance into the Chapel of the Invalids , and the ceremony there  --  was the most solemn . The church was hung in its blackest mourning weeds , and priests , in a long row , said masses upon the dead , holding black torches in their hands . The floor opened , and the deceased were laid by the side of each other in a vault , which closed its marble jaws . All Paris spent the day in the procession , and in the evening went to the Opera Comique . But I do n't like funerals : I will write of something else . I will tell you of my first excursion to the country . Every one who loves eating and drinking and dancing , went out yesterday to the fete at St. Cloud  --  c'est sijolie une fete de village ! and 1 went along . The situation of this village is very picturesque on the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and environs of Paris . If St. Cloud would not take it ill , I should like to stay here a month .  --  There are the sweetest little hills , and glades , and cascades imaginable ; not , indeed , beautiful and poetical as your wild and native scenery of Pottsville  --  one does not wander by the mountain torrent , or by the clear stream , such as gushes from the flanks of your craggy hills ; nor by the " Tumbling Run " that winds its course through the intricate valley till it mingles , and murmurs no more , in the wizard Schuylkill ; nor does one stray through forests of fragrant honeysuckles , or gather the wild flower from the solitary rock ; but it is sweet , also , to see the little fishes cut with their golden oars the silvery lake , and to walk upon the fresh-mown turf , and scent /z/ the edor from the neighboring hedge ; the rose and / woodbine , too , are sweet , when nourished by the ag*i- . * cultural ingenuity and care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fertile earth can receive from the hand of a skillful cultivator , is possessed by these little hills of St. Cloud , in its most adorable perfection . I have listened here to the music of the bees , and in the calm and balmy evening , to the last serenade of the thrush retiring to its rest . One forgets , in hearing this language of his native country , that he is wandering in a foreign land ! St. Cloud has , also , an interest in its historical recollections . It was burnt once by the English ; it was besieged and taken by Conde , in the religious wars ; and Henry III . was assassinated here by Jacques Clement . It was the favorite of Bonaparte . If he resided anywhere , ( for ambition has no home , ) it was at St. Cloud . It was here he put himself at the head of the government , overthrowing the Directory , in 1799.  --  The neighborhood is adorned with magnificent villas . The French do not , like the English , plunge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude ; or carry a multitude of guests with them to their country seats , to eat them out of house and home , as an antidote to the vapors . They select the vicinity of some frequented spot , as St. Cloud or Versailles , and secure the pleasures of society to their summer residences . I believe it is well for one , who wishes to make the best of life in all its circumstances , to study the French . I am glad that in imitating England in many things , ( as we ought , ) we have not copied her absurd whim of living in the country at Christmas . The chateau at St. Cloud is an irregular building ; it has on its principal front four Corinthian columns , and Justice and Prudence and a naked Truth , and some other /q/ hieroglyphic ladies are looking down from the balustrade . I had myself conducted through its apartments : the salle de compagnie  --  d ' audience  --  de toilet , and the queen 's bed-chamber . Only to think , here she used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed just two feet high , lest she might fall out and break her majesty 's neck in the night . The king 's apartments are in a similar range . The salon de Diane is fine with the tapestry of the gobelins , and the grand salon with Sevres ' China vases . Its crimson velvet hangings cost twenty thousand dollars , and its four candelabra six thousand . The galerie d'Jipollon has paintings by the best masters . I admired all these things excessively . Every one knows the genealogy of admiration . They certainly exceed very far our usual republican notions of magnificence.  --  Thou most unclassical Blucher ! Why the fellow slept here , booted and spurred , in the Emperor 's bed , and kenneled his hounds upon the sofa  - -  both with an equal sense , I presume , of the sumptuousness of their lodgings . If , at least , he had put his hounds into Diana 's saloon , the stupid Goth , he might have had some credit for his wit  --  he can have none for his brutality . I was puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To have all this service for nothing was unreasonable ; and how to offer money to a man with a cocked hat , and black velvet breeches  --  I was in a situation exactly the reverse of Alexander the Great towards his schoolmaster . What was enough for such a respectable gentleman to receive , was foo much for me to give . I consulted a French lady ; for French ladies know everything , and they do n't knock you down when you ask them a question .  --  She told me a franc would be as much as he would expect . Think of giving a franc for // an hour 's service , to as good a looking gentleman as General Washington ! Coming out from the castle , I wandered through the park , which contains some hundred acres , diversified with hills and valleys , and presenting from an eminence , a delightful view of the surrounding country , including Paris . On this spot is a " Lantern of Demosthenes , " copied from the monument of that name at Athens . A great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly remarkable for its jets d'eaux , which , on a fete day , throw up the water sportively in the air , and for its numerous cascades , one of which is one hundred and twenty-five feet above the level of the basin . I next went with a guide into the " Petit Pare , " made for Marie Antoinette . She bought this chateau ( one of her sins ) just before the Revolution . This park is beautiful with bowers , groves , pieces of water , statuary , and every imaginable embellishment . In wandering about here , 1 got acquainted with a nobleman . He is of that order of knighthood , which the French call " Chevaliers dTndustrie. "  --  " This , sir , I think , is by Pigale , and this Cupid by Depautre . Look especially at this Venus by Coustan. "  --  " Point du tout , Monsieur , I make it a duty , as you are a stranger . " He liked the Americans excessively .  --  " To be the countryman of Franklin , e'est un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplished gentleman , and fashionable . I had a purse containing in silver twenty francs , which , being incommodious to a waistcoat , I had put into an outside coat pocket .  --  Late in the evening , you might have seen me returning homewards on foot , ( the distance two leagues , ) not having wherewith to hire a coach , and no money at my lodgings . If the devil had not been invented , I should have found him out on this occasion . /q/ The verdure of this country is more fresh than ours under the dog star . There is a hazy atmosphere , which intercepts the rays of the sun and mitigates the heat . I do n't say a word here in favor of our summer climate from conscientious scruples . Indeed 1 have gained such a victory over my patriotism that I never find fault with these foreigners for having anything better than we have it ourselves ; nor do I take any merit to myself because the Mississippi is two miles wide , or because the Niagara falls with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere accident to a Scotch lady of this village , who prevailed on my modesty to dine with her . She is a lady of experience and great affability who has resided here and in Paris eleven years . She is on a furlough from her husband , an Englishman She showed me the cathedral , the cemetery , and the grave of one , who won princes by her smile , Mrs. Jordan . She asks a repetition of the visit , and is too amiable and accomplished to be refused . She is at least forty-five ; in the " ambush of her younger days " the invitation would not have been safe for the visitor . On my return I walked through the Bois de Boulogne , where you and romantic Mary have so often assisted at a duel . It was in the glimmerings of the twilight , and now and then looking through a vista of the tangled forest , I could see distinctly a ghost pulling a trigger at another ghost , or pushing carte and tierce at his ribs . This forest flanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains seventeen hundred acres of ground ; in some parts an open wood , in others an intricate and impenetrable thicket . It is the fashionable drive for those who have coaches in the morning , and a solitary enough walk for one who has no coach of an evening . Young girls always find saddled at the east vol. i.  --  13 /z/ end a number of donkeys , upon which they take a wholesome exercise , and acquire the elements of equitation at three sous a ride . Some who have " witched the world with noble horsemanship , " have begun upon these little asses . I had the light only of the gentle moonbeam to direct my footsteps through the latter part of this forest ; and I walked speedily , recollecting I should not be the first man who was murdered here , by a great many . I feared to meet some rogue ignorant that I was robbed already , so 1 went whistling along , ( for men who have money do n't whistle , ) till I arrived at the Champs Elysees  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner I should have found it alive with all sorts of equipages ; with all the landaus , tilburys , and bogueys , and other private vehicles , and footmen glittering in golden coats , with feathers waving on their empty heads , whilst the edges of the road would have been fringed with ten thousand pedestrians on their evening walks . Now there were a few only in attendance upon Franconi 's , or the concert . In the former of these places they exhibit melo-dramas , and equestrian feats , in which the riding ladies only outstrip what we see in our own country . In the latter there is a band of near a hundred musicians , who charm all the world at twenty sous a piece , playing the fashionable airs from six till nine every evening . Innumerable cafes around pour out the fragrant nectar to their guests . For an image of this place you need not read Virgil 's sixth book , or refer to any of your classical associations . Fancy only , without a single inequality , a horizontal plain of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ball-alley , a baked and turfless common , or any most trodden spot upon the earth , and that is the French /q/ Elysium . Not a blade of grass , or shrub or flower dares grow upon its surface . The trees are straining and trying to grow , but can not . Yet it is precisely to this barren field that all the world comes , especially on fete days , to be perfectly delighted . It is surrounded by the city and has an air of country in town . It is a kind of republican turn-out , where one may go as one pleases , without toilet or any troublesome respect to etiquette . It is a refuge always at hand from an uncomfortable home  --  from a scold or a creditor ; it cures husbands of their wives , old bachelors of the vapors , and sometimes lovers of their sweethearts . On Sundays and holidays you will find here , of foolishness , all that you have ever seen , all that you have ever fancied , and if there is anything of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here . Besides the concert and the circus , and fresco dances , here are all the jugglers and their tricks , mountebanks and their medicines , clowns and their fooleries , all the family of the Punches , and all the apes in regimentals ; not counting the voltigeurs without legs , and the blind girls , who see to walk over eggs without breaking them . You may have a stage if you love to play harlequin , or a greasy pole if you wish to climb for a prize at the top of it . You may sit down on a swing like a water-wheel , which will toss you fifty feet in the air , where you may run from yourself and after yourself by the hour ; or on another which will whirl you about horizontally on hobby horses till you become invisible . If thirsty you may have an ice cream , if studious a chair and a newspaper , and if nervous a shock of electricity worth two sous . Moreover , you can buy cakes reeking hot that were baked a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sucked by the woman 's baby , at half its value . /z/ On the outskirts towards night yoa may find also an opportunity of exercising your charity and other benevolent affections . One poor woman is getting a living here by the dropsy , and another by nine orphan children and such like advantages ; one has lost the use of her limbs and is running about with a certificate ; and there is one , who has been eight months gone since eleven years . In coming out by the side next the city you are at once upon the Place Louis XV. , where you will see on their pedestals two superb and restive coursers , which tread on air held in with difficulty by their two marble grooms . We are again upon St. Anne 's street , and under the protection of her sainted wings I repose till to-morrow , bidding you an affectionate good night . August 25th . I called a few days ago upon the king . We Yankees went to congratulate his majesty for not being killed on the 2Sth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which leads up to the royal apartments , is very beautiful , and has two Ionic columns just on the summit . You first enter through a room of white and plain ground , then through a second hung round with awful field marshals , and then you go through a room very large , and splendid with lustres , and other elegant furniture , which conducts into a fourth with a throne and velvet canopy . The king was very grateful , at least he made a great many bows , and we too were very grateful to Providence for more than a couple of hours .  - -  There was the queen , and the two little princesses  --  but I will write this so that by embroidering it a little you may put it in the newspapers . The chamber of Peers and Deputies and other functionaries of the State were pouring in to place , at the /q/ foot of the throne , the expression of their loyalty . This killing of the king has turned out very much to his advantage . There was nothing anywhere but laudatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countries of Europe uniting in sympathy with the natives . So we got ashamed of ourselves , we Americans , and held a meeting in the Rue Rivoli , where we got up a procession , too , and waited upon his majesty for the purpose above stated , and were received into the presence  --  the royal family being ranged around the room to get a sight of us . Modesty forbids me to speak of the very eloquent manner in which we pronounced our address ; to which the king made a very appropriate reply . " Gentlemen , you can better guess , " said he , " than I can express to you the gratification , " &c;  --  I missed all the rest by looking at the Princess Caroline 's most beautiful of all faces , except the conclusion , which was as follows : " And I am happy to embrace this occasion of expressing to you ail , and through you , to your countrymen , the deep gratitude I have ever felt for the kindness and hospitality I experienced in America during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with an affectionate and animated expression , and we were pleased  --  /q/ to pieces . So was Louis Philippe , and so was Marie Jlmelie , princess of the two Sicilies , his wife ; and so was **53;114;TOOLONG ? ie , and **46;169;TOOLONG her two daughters , and the rest of the family . A note from the king 's aid-de-camp required the presence of our consul at the head of the deputation , which our consul refused . He did not choose , he said , to see the Republic make a fool of herself , running about town , and tossing up her cap because the king /z/ was not killed , and he would not go . " Then , " said the king ( a demur being made by his officers ) , " I will receive the Americans , as they received me , without fuss or ceremony . " So we got in without any head , but not without a long attendance in the ante-chamber , very inconvenient to our legs . How we strolled about during this time , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our handkerchiefs , and knocked the dust off our boots in the salle dcs marechcntx , and how we reclined upon the royal cushions , and set one leg to ride impatiently on the other , I leave to be described by Major Downing , who was one of our party . I will bring up the rear of this paragraph with an anecdote , which will make you laugh . One of our deputation had brought along a chubby little son of his , about sixteen . He returned , ( for he had gone ahead to explore , ) and said in a soft voice , " Tommy , you can go in to the throne , but do n't go too near . " And then Tommy set off with velvet steps , and approached , as you have seen timid old ladies to a blunderbuss ;  --  he feared it might go off . The king is a bluff old man with more firmness of character , sense and activity , than is indicated by his plump and rubicund features . The queen has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensible , benevolent expression  --  a face not of the French cut , but such as you often meet amongst the best New England faces . Any gentleman would like to have such a woman for his mother . The eldest daughter is married to the King of Belgium ; the second and third are grown up to manhood , but not yet married . They would be thought pretty girls even by your village beaux , and with you ladies , except two or three , ( how many are you ? ) they would be " stuck up things , no prettier than their neighbors . " The Duke of Orleans /q/ is a handsome young man , and so spare and delicate as almost to call into question his mother 's reputation . He assumes more dignity of manner than is natural to a Frenchman at his age ; he is not awkward , but a little stiff ; his smile seems compulsory and more akin to the lips than to the heart . Anybody else would have laughed out on this occasion . He has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered , with laurels . The Duke of Nemours is just struggling into manhood , and is shaving to get a beard as assiduously as his father to get rid of it . He also has fought valiantly somewhere  --  I believe in Holland . Among the ladies there is one who pleases me exceedingly ; it is Madame Adelaide , the king 's sister . She has little txauty , but a most affable and happy expression of countenance . She was a pupil of Madame Genlis , who used to call her " celte belle el bonne Princesses She was married secretly to General Athelin , her brother 's secretary , during their residence in England . She revealed this marriage , with great fear of his displeasure , to her brother , after his accession to the throne , throwing herself on her knees .  --  After some pause he said , embracing her tenderly : " Domestic happiness is the main thing after all ; and now that he is the king 's brother-in-law we must make him a duke . " Madame Adelaide is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from the old books , necessarily looks about for that motley gentleman the king 's fool . The city of Troyes used to have a monopoly of supplying this article , but the other towns , I have heard , grew jealous of the privilege , and they have them now from all parts of the kingdom . Seriously the splendor of ancient courts has faded away wonderfully in every respect . When Sully went to Eng'and , says /z/ the history , he was attended by two hundred gentlemen , and three hundred guns saluted him at the Tower . The pomp and luxury of drawing rooms , and levees , were then most gorgeous . The eye was dazzled with the glittering display , nothing but yeomen of the guards with halberds , and wearing hats of rich velvet , plumed like the peacock , with wreaths and rosettes in their shoes ; and functionaries of the law , iu black gowns and full wigs , and bishops , and other church dignitaries , in aprons of black silk ; and there were knights of the garter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord knows who . And the same grandeur and brilliancy in the French courts  --  chambellans , and ecuyers , and aumoniers , all the way down to the chauf-cire , and keeper of the royal hounds ; and one swam in a sea of gems and plumes , and sweet and honeyed ladies . Republicanism has set her irreverent foot upon all this regal splendor . I wish I had come over a hundred years ago . The king 's salary before the Revolution , though provisions were at half their present rate , was thirty millions , that of Charles X. was twenty-five ; and the present king 's is only twelve millions , with one million to the Duke of Orleans . / and Louis Philippe do not agree altogether about the manner in which the French people ought to be governed . The censorship of the press , the espionage , the violation of private correspondence , the jail and the gibbet , will not arrest the hand of the regicide . I have read in a journal to day , that 2746 persons have already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the person of the king . The devil will get his Most Christian Majesty if he goes on at this rate . Why do n't he learn that the strength of kings , in these days , is in their weakness ? Why do n't /q/ he set np Mr. Thiers , and then Mr. Guizot , and then Mr. Thiers again , as they do in England ? Look at King William  --  does anybody shoot him ? and yet he rides out with four cream-colored horses , with blue eyes , every day , and sometimes he walks into the Hungerford Market , and asks the price of shrimps . Louis plays a principal part in all his measures , even his high-handed measures . If he makes himself a target , he must expect to be shot at . In the beginning of his reign , he played the liberal too loosely . " Why talk of censorship ? " said he  --  " il tfy aura plus de deli ts de la presse. "  --  " I am but a bridge to arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in almost ludicrous contrast . He is a Jacobin turned king , say his enemies ; and we must expect he will run the career of all renegades . I have not described his disasters and dangers in a lamentable tone , because I do n't choose to affect a sympathy I do not feel . He had a quiet and delightful habitation at Neuilly ; and since he has not preferred it to this " bare picket bone of majesty " at the Tuileries , let him abide the conse-* consequences . However , I shall be one of those who will deplore his loss , from the good will I bear the French people , for I have not the least doubt that , with twenty years ' possession of the throne , he will bring them , in all that constitutes real comfort and rational liberty , to a degree of prosperity unknown to their history .  --  Remember lam talking French , not American politics . To infer from the example of America , that the institutions of a Republic may be introduced into these old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another century . If we can retain our democracy when our back woodlands are filled up , when New York and Philadelphia have become a London and Paris ; when /z/ the land shall be covered with its multitudes , struggling for a scanty living , with passions excited by luxurious habits and appetites ; if we can then maintain our universal suffrage , and our liberty , it will be fair and reasonable enough in us to set ourselves up for the imitation of others , Liberty , as far as we yet know her , is not fitted to the condition of these populous and luxurious countries . Her household gods are of clay , and her dwelling where the icy gales of Alleghany sing through the crevices of her hut . I have spent a day at the exhibition of the students of the University , which was conducted with great pomp . There was a concour for prizes , and speeches in the learned languages  --  nothing but clarissimi and eruditissimi Thiers and Guizots . Do n't you love modern Latin ? I read , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I intend to write one , some of these days , to Miss Kittne and Nellae , of Pine Hill .

September 14th , 1835 . After the nonsense of my last letter I almost despair of putting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he contained in this . I have just returned from an excursion on foot from the one end to the other of Paris ; making , as a sensible traveler ought to do , remarks upon the customs , institutions , and monuments of the place ; and here I am with a sheet of double post to write you down these remarks . I would call it a classical tour , but I have some doubts whether walking in a straight line is a tour , and therefore I have called it simply a journal . I had for my companion the Seine  --  he was going for sea-bathing to the Havre . His destination thence no more known than ours , when we float into eternity . Some little wave may , however , roll till it reach the banks of the Delaware , and who knows , that lifted into vapor by the sun , it may not spread in rains upon the Broad Mountain , and at last del'ght your tea tables at /z/ Pine Hill . I send yon a kiss ; and in recommending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his history . Most rivers except the Seine , and perhaps the Nile , have a high and noble descent  --  this , as 1 have read in a French author , runs out of a hole in the ground in the flat and dirty country of the C6te d'Or ; it was contained once in a monk 's kitchen near Dijon , and began the world like Russian Kate , by washing the dishes . At Paris it is called by the polite French the Fleuve royale . Any stream in this country which is able to run down a hill is called a river  --  this , of course , is a royal river . It receives a pretty large share of its bigness from the Marne and Yonne , and some other streams , ( for rivers , like great men , are not only great of their own merits , but by appropriating that of others , ) and is itself again lost in the great ocean . It is the most beneficent river on the Continent  --  it distributes water , one of the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it gives some to the milk-woman , who furnishes me with cafe au lait No. , in the Faubourg St. Germain , ( where you will direct your letters from this date . ) It is received in its debut into Paris magnificently  --  the Garden of Plants being on the left , and the great avenue of the Bastille and the elephant on its right , and overhead , five triumphal arches , which were erected for its reception by Bonaparte , sustaining the superb bridge of Austerlitz . And here commences my journal . At twelve I left the Garden of Plants , with only a peep through the railings . One can not go inside here without stumbling against all creation . The whole of the three kingdoms  --  animal , vegetable , and mineral  - -  are gathered into this garden from the four corners of the earth , as they were when Adam baptized them . I /q/ observed a great number of plants growing out of the ground as fast as they could , and little posts standing prim and stiff along side of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean their modern names  - -  those they got at the great christening have been entirely lost , and Monsieur de Buffon and some others have been obliged to hunt them new ones out of the dictionary . I did go in a little and stood along side of an American acacia  --  conceiting , for a moment , I was on my native earth again , and so I was  --  for the tree was transplanted from the Susquehanna , and the soil was brought with it . It would not otherwise grow out of its native country .  --  Alas , do you expect that one 's affections , so much more delicate , will not pine and wither away , where there is not a particle of their native aliments to support them ! I looked a long time upon a cedar of Lebanon  --  it stands like a patriarch in the midst of his family , its broad branches expanded hospitably , inviting the traveler to repose . Along the skirts of the garden , one sees lions , and tigers , and jackals , and an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Army . Several elephants fought and bled for their country on that occasion , and this is one of them . And finally , I saw what you have never seen in America , a giraffe , a sort of quadruped imitation of an ostrich , its head twenty feet in the air ; and there were a great number of children and their dear little mammas giving it gingerbread . Deer/q/ were also stalking through the park  --  but in gracility and sleekness how inferior to ours of the Mahonoy ! and several bears were chained to posts , but not a whit less bearish , nor better licked , though brought up in Paris , than ours of the Sharp Mountain . I could not help looking compassionately at ' a buffalo , who stood thoughtful and melancholy under an American poplar ; vol. i.  --  14 /z/ his head hanging down , and gazing upon the earth . He had perhaps left a wife and children , and the rest of the family on the hanks of the Missouri ! Wherever the eye strayed , new objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon cliffs , as high as a man 's head ; and sheep from foreign countries ( poor things ! ) were bleating through valleys  --  six feet wide ! All the parrots in the world were here prating ; and nations of monkeys , imitating the spectators . Nothing in all this Academy of Nature , seemed to draw such general admiration as these monkeys , and these parrots . What a concourse of observers ! It is so strange in Paris to hear words articulated without meaning , and see grimaces that have no communication with the heart . Just in leaving the Garden , the Seine has lent some of its water to St. Martin , to make an island  --  saints not being able to make islands without this accommodation . This island of St. Martin is covered , during summer , with huge piles of wood , ingeniously arranged into pyramids and conic sections . Some of the piles are built into dwellings , and let out for the warm season ; so you can procure here a very snug little summer retreat , and burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to tell you , ( for acute travelers never let anything of this kind slip , ) that wood is here two sous a pound . That old woman , the government , is very expensive in her way of living , and the moment she finds any article of first necessity , as salt or fuel , &c,; she claps a tax upon it . Besides , all that money , which your rail-road fanatics about Schuylkill , lay out in contrivances to carry your coal to market , she lays out in new frocks  --  and this is the reason wood is two cents a pound . A little onward I stepped upon the quiet and peaceful island of St. Louis  --  quiet ! and yet it is inhabited by l'isle de la cite . 159 nearly all the lawyers of Paris . St. Louis is the only saint that has not left off doing miracles . The noisy arts will not venture on it , though four bridges have been made for their accommodation . It reminds one of that world of Ovid 's where everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like all other places of Paris this island has its curiosities and monuments . You will find here the ancient Hotel de Mimes , its ceilings painted by Lebrun and Lesueur , now a lumber-house for soldiers and their iron beds , and if you give a franc to the cicerone ( the porter and his wife ) you can get him to tell you that Bonaparte was hid here for two days after the battle of Waterloo . He will show you , if you seem to doubt , the very paillasse , upon which the Emperor , whilst the allies were marching into Paris , slept . You will find here also some imperishable ruins of Lebrun and Lesueur , in the once famous Hotel de Bretonvilliers , now venerable for its dirt , as well as its antiquity . I admired awhile the " Halle aux Vins , " one of the curiosities of the left bank , enclosed on three sides by a wall , and on the side of the Seine , by an iron railing 889 yards . It contains 800,000 casks of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Paris , twenty millions of gallons . France , by a cunning legislation , prevents this natural produce of her soil escaping from the country , by laying a prohibitory duty upon the industry of other nations , which would enable them to purchase it ; so we have the whole drinking of it to ourselves , and we oblige John Bull to stick to his inflammatory Port and Madeira . L'isle de la Cite* comes next ; the last but not the least remarkable of the three sister islands , called the Island of the Cite , because once all Paris was here , and there /z/ was no Paris anywhere else . Antony used to quaff old Palernian on this island with Caesar , and run after the grisettc girls and milliners , whilst they sent Labienus to look after Dumnorix ; and here in a later age came the gay and gartered earls ; knights in full panoply ; fashionable belles - in rustling silks , and the winds brought delicate perfumes on their wings . At present no Arabic incense is wasted upon the air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keeps the dirtiest house of all Paris . But in the midst of this beggary of comfort and decency , are glorious monuments which the rust of ages has not yet consumed ; the Hotel Diea , Palais de Justice , and Prefect urate of Police ; and I had like to have forgotten that majestic old pile with fretted roofs and towers pinnacled in the clouds , with Gothic windows , and grizzly saints painted on them , " So old , as if she had forever stood , So strong as if she would forever stand , " whose bells at this moment are tolling over the dead , the venerable , the time-honored Notre Dame de Paris . This old lady is the queen of the cite . Her corner-stone was laid by Pope Alexander III. , upon the ruins of an old Roman temple of Jupiter , in 1 163 . So you see she is a very reverend old lady . Her bell is eight feet in diameter , and requires sixteen men to set its clapper in motion . On entering this church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its size , the immense height of its dome and roofs , and the huge pillars which sustain them , with the happy disposition and harmony of all these masses , one is seized with a very sudden reverence , and a very modest sense of one 's own littleness ; and yet a minute before one looked upon the glorious sun , and walked under " this most excellent canopy " almost /q/ without astonishment . You will see here , at all hours o the day , persons devoutly at their beads , intent on their prayer-books , or kneeling at the cross . Except on days of parade , you will see almost six women to one man ; and these rather old . Women must love something . When the day of their terrestrial affections has faded , their loves become celestial . When they ca n't love anything else , why they love God . " Aime Dieu , Sainte Thertse , c'est toujour aimer . " The Emperor Julian stayed a winter on this island , at which time the river washed ( not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city ; and Paris was accessible only by two wooden bridges . He called it his Lutetia , iv atjv Aevxsttav , his beloved city of mud . The Palais de Justice , or Lit de Justice , as the French appropriately call it , ( for the old lady does sometimes take a nap , ) is a next door neighbor . This palace lodged , long ago , the old Roman Prsefects ; the kings of the first race , the counts of Paris under the second , and twelve kings of the third . The great Hotel Dieu , or Hospital , counts all the years between us and King Pepin , about twelve hundred . It is a manly , solid and majestic building ; its facade is adorned with Doric columns , and beneath the entablature , are Force , Prudence and Justice , and several other virtues " stupe- - We learn from tradition that Julian never washed hands or face , or suffered any kind of ablution , unless , perhaps , at his christening . In a word he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Baths " should be the only monument remaining of him in Paris 1 I presume they are named ironically , or from the old rule of non lavando . The following anecdote is apropos to this subject . " His steward one day brought him a beautiful maid , lathed and richly perfumed , and his majesty , having discovered , quando tetigisaet , et digitos suos odoralus essel , he exclaimed : " Diabli . ' Us m'ontgate cetlefemme Id ! " You will find this in the French notes to Julian 's Misopogon. /z/ fied in stone . " But I will give you a more particular account of it , as well as of the right worshipful Notre Dame , and the Palace , when I write my book about Churches , Hospitals , and the Courts of Justice . I will only remark now that I visited this great hospital a few days ago , and that I saw in it a thousand beds , and a poor devil stretched out on each bed , waiting his turn to be dispatched ; that the doctor came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavement to them all round ; a hundred or two of students following after , of whom about a dozen could approach the beds , and when symptoms were examined , and legs cut off , or some surgical operation performed , the others listened . But it would be ungrateful in me to pass without a special notice , the Prsefecturate of Police . If I now lodge in the Rue D'Enfer , No. , looking down upon the garden of Luxembourg , and having my conduct registered once a week in the king 's books ; if I have permission to abide in Paris ; and above all , if ever I shall have the permission to go out of it ; whither am I to refer these inestimable privileges , but to the never-sleeping eye of the Prssfecturate of Police ? But the merits of this institution are founded upon a much wider scheme of benefits ; for which I am going to look into my Guide de Paris . It " discourages pauperism " by sending most of the beggars out of Paris , to besiege the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people by fishing them out of the Seine at 25 francs a piece into the Morgue . It protects personal safety by entering private houses in the night , and commits all persons taken in the fact ( flagrant delit ) ; it preserves public decency by removing courtesans from the Palais Royal to the Boulevards , and other convenient places ; and protects his most Christian Majesty by seizing upon " Infernal Machines , " /q/ just after the explosion . In a word , this Pra fecturate of Police , with only 500,000 troops of the line and the National Guard , encourages all sorts of public morals at the rate of seven hundred million francs per annum , besides protecting commerce by taking gentlemen 's cigars out of their pockets at Havre . Towards the south and west of the island you will see a little building distinguished from its dingy neighbors by its gentility and freshness . It stands retired by the river side modestly , giving a picturesque appearance to the whole prospect , and a relief to the giant monuments which I have just described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having lost his money at Frascati 's  --  or his health and his money too at the pretty Flora 's  --  or if any melancholy stranger lodging in the Rue D'Enfer , absent from his native home and the sweet affections of his friends , should find life insupportable , ( there are no disappointed loves in this country , ) he will lie in state next morning at the Morgue . Upon a black marble table he will be stretched out , and his clothes , bloody or wet , will be hung over him , and there he will be kept ( except in August , when he wo n't keep ) for three whole days and as many nights ; and if no one claims him , why then the King of the French sells him for ten francs to the doctors ; and his clothes , after six months , belong to Francois the steward , who has them altered for his dear little children , or sells them for second hand finery in the market . One of these suicides , as I have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by his affectionate uncle , as follows . A youth wrote to his uncle that he had lost at gambling certain sums entrusted to him , in his province , to pay a debt in Paris , and that he was unwilling to survive the disgrace . The uncle recognized /z/ him , and buried him with becoming ceremony at Pere la Chaise . In returning home from this solemn duly , the youth rushed into his uncle 's arms , and they hugged and kissed , and hugged each other to the astonishment of tho spectators . It is so agreeable to see one 's nephews after one has buried them , jump about one 's neck ! The annual number of persons who commit suicide in all France I have seen stated at two thousand . Those who came to the Morgue in 1822 , were 2G0 . Is it not strange that the French character , so flexible and fruitful of resources in all circumstances of fortune , should be subject to this excess ? And that they should kill themselves , too , for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have read in the journals , from disgust at putting on his breeches in the cold winter mornings  --  and two lately ( Ecousse and Lebrun ) because a farce they had written did not succeed at the play house . The authors chose to incur the same penalty in the other world that was inflicted on their vaudeville in this . And these Catos of Utica are brought here to the Morgue . The greater part are caught in the Seine , by a net stretched across the river at St. Cloud . Formerly twenty-five francs were given for a man saved , and twenty if drowned ; and the rogues cheated the government of its humanity by getting up a company , who saved each other time about by collusion . The sum is now reversed , so that they always allow one time , and even assist one a little sometimes , for the additional five francs . The building , by the advance of civilization , has required , this season , to be repaired , and a new story is added . Multitudes , male and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of the day . You can stop in on your way as you go to the flower market , which is just opposite . There is a lady at the bureau /z/ who attends in her father 's absence the sale and recognition of the corpses , and who plays the piano and excels in several of the ornamental branches . She was crowned at the last distribution of prizes , and is the daughter of the keeper , Mr. Perrin . He has four other daughters , who also give the same promise of accomplishment . Their morals do not run the same risk as most other children 's , of being spoilt by a bad intercourse from without . Indeed they are so little used to associate abroad , that , getting into a neighbor 's the other day , they asked their playmates , running about through the house , " Where does your papa keep his dead people ? " Innocent little creatures ! Mr. Perrin is a man of excellent instruction himself , and entertains his visitors with conversations literary and scientific , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse arrives he puts himself at his desk , and with a graceful flourish enters it on the book ; and when not claimed at the end of three days , he writes down in German text , " mconnu ; " if known , " conna . " The exhibition room is , since its enlargement , sufficient for the ordinary wants of society ; but on emergencies , as on the " three glorious days , " and the like , they are obliged to accommodate a part of the corpses elsewhere . They have been strewed , on these occasions , over the garden ; and Miss Perrin has to take some in her room .  --  Alas , that no state of life should be exempt from its miseries ! You who think to have propitiated fortune by the humility of your condition , come hither and contemplate Mr. Perrin . Only a few years ago , when quietly engaged in his official duties , his own wife came in with the other customers . He was struck with horror ; and he went to his bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Ville is well placed in a /z/ group with these obscene images . It is the seat of the administration of justice for all Paris , a gray and griefworn-castle ; with the Place de Greve by the side of it . There it stands by the great thermometer of Monsieur Chevalier , where the French people come twice a day to see if they ought to shiver or sweat . There is not a more abominable place in all Paris than this Place de Grhve . It holds about the same rank in the city that the hangman does in the community . There flowed the blood of the ferocious Republic , of the grim Empire , and the avenging Restoration . Lally 's ghost haunts the guilty place . Cartouche was burnt there , and the horrible Marchioness Brinvilliers ; Damiens and Ravaillac were tortured there ; the beautiful Princess de Lamballe assassinated there , and the martyrs of 1830 buried there . To complete your horror , there is yet the lamppost  --  the Revolutionary gibbet , and the window through which Robespierre leaped out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would say  --  his damned neck ! No accusing spirit would fly to Heaven 's chancery with the oath . I began to breathe as I stepped upon the Pont Nenf.  --  The atmosphere brightened , the prospect suddenly opened , and the noble river exhibited its twenty bridges , and its banks , turreted , towered and castellated , as far as the eye could pierce . There is a romantic interest in the very name of this bridge , as in the " Bridge of Sighs , " though not a great deal richer in architecture than yours of Fair Mount . And what is the reason ? Why is the Rialto more noble than your Exchange of Dock Street ? You see Pierre and Jaffier , and the Jew , standing on it . The Pont Nenf has arched the Seine since 200 years and more . It was once the centre of gayety and fashion , and business . Here was displayed /q/ the barbaric luxury of Marie de Medicis , and the pompous Richelieu ; glittering equipages paraded here in their evening airings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces  --  crowded here to the midnight routs of the Carnival . A company in 1709 had an exclusive privilege of a depot of umbrellas at each end , that ladies and gentlemen paying a sous might cross without injury to their complexions . The fine arts , formerly natives of this place , have since emigrated to the Palais Royal  --  ripse ulterior is amentes  --  and despair now comes hither at midnight  --  and the horrid suicide , by the silent statue of the great Henry , plunges into eternity . On the left is the Quai des Augustins , where the patient bibliopolist sits over his odd volumes , and where the cheapest of all human commodities is human wit . A black and ancient building gives an imposing front to the Quai Conti ; it is the Hotel des Monnaies . Commerce , Prudence , and several other allegorical grandmothers are looking down from the balustrade . Next to it , ( for the Muses , too , love the mint , ) with a horse-shoe kind of face , is the Royal " Institute de France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of letters ; it regulates the public judgment in matters of science , fine arts , language , and literary composition : it proposes questions , and rewards the least stupid , if discovered , with a premium , and gives its approbation of ingenious inventors , who , like Fulton , do not die of hunger in waiting for it . You may attend the sittings of the Jlcademie des Sciences , which are public , on Mondays . You will meet Pascal and Moliere in the antechamber  --  as far as they dared venture in their lives . The members you will see in front of broad tables in the interior , and the President eminent above /z/ the rest , who ever and anon will ring a little bell by way of keeping less noise 1 : the spectators , with busts of Sully , Bossnet , Fenelon , and Descartes , sitting gravely tier over tier , around the extremities of the room . The Secretary will then run over a programme of the subjects , not without frequent tinklings of the admonitory bell ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general subjects or matters of form . For example , Mr. Arago will call in question the veracity of that eminent man , Mr. , Herschel , of New York , and his selenelogical discoveries ; which have a great credit here ; no one sees the moon for the fogs , and you may tell as many lies about her as you please . Afterwards a little man of solemn mien , being seated upon a chair , will read you , alas , one of his own compositions . He will talk of nothing but the geognosie des couches atmospheriqucs ; the isomorphism of the mineralogical substances , and the " Myfitotes of the Parabola , " for an hour . You will then have an episode from Baron Lary ( no one listening ) upon a bag of dry bones , displayed h la Johassaphat , upon a wide table , followed by another reader , and then by another to the end of the sitting  --  You will think the empire of dnlness has come upon the earth . The Institute was once the College des Quatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the famous Tour de Nesle . I need not tell you the history of this Tour . Who does not know all about Qneen Isabeau de Baviere ? Of her window from the heights of the Tour , from which she overlooked the Seine , before the baths of Count Vigier ( what made him a count ? ) were invented ? She was a great admirer of the fine forms of the human figure ; and she was the first woman in Europe , as I have read in the old chronicles , who had two chemises . The French have always /q/ been fond of much linen . I have no wish to find fault with her for this latter piece of extravagance ; but I can not speak with the same indulgence of other particulars of her history . Her ill treatment of her lovers  - -  her sewing them up , to prevent their telling tales , in sacks , and then tossing them before daylight into the river , was , to say the least of it  --  very wrong ! In crossing the Pont des Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices of lamentation and violence . Sometimes I thought I could hear distinctly Isabeau ! in the murmuring of the waters . All the world runs to the Bains Vigiers , which are - anchored along this Quai , to bathe at four sous ; but the water is exceedingly foul . It is here the Seine , " With disemboguing streams , Rolls the large tribute of its dead dogs . " And what is worst , when done bathing here , you have no place to go to wash yourself . The Pont des Arts is a light and airy bridge from the door of the Institute to the Quai dn Louvre ; upon which no equipages are admitted . The Arts use their legs  --  cruribus non curribus utuntur . Between this and the " Pont Royal , " ( a bridge of solid iron , ) the antiquarians have got together for sale all the curious remains of the last century , Chineseries , Sevreries , and chimney pieces of Madame Pompadour . Next is the Quai Voltaire , in the east corner of which is the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The apartment in which he died has been kept shut for the last forty years , and has been lately thrown open . On the opposite side you see stretched out huge in length , the heavy and monotonous Louvre , which , with the Tuileries adjoining , is , they vol. i.  --  15 /z/ say , the most spacious and beautiful palace in the world . I have not experienced what the artists call a perception of its beauties . There is a little pet corner , the eastern colonnade raised by Louis XIV. , which is called the great ' triumph of French architecture . It consists of a long series of apartments decorated with superb columns , with sculpture and mosaics , and a profusion of gilding , and fanciful ornaments. * From the middle gallery it was that Charles IX. , one summer 's evening , amused himself shooting Huguenots , flying the St. Bartholomew , with his arquebuss . Nero was a mere fiddler to this fellow . This is the gallery of Philip Augustus , so full of romance . It was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Louis Philippe quietly sat down on his stool . See how the Palais des Beaux Arts is peppered with the Swiss bullets ! The edge of the river , for half a mile , is embroidered with washerwomen ; and baths , and boats of charcoal cover its whole surface . One can not drown himself here , but at the risk of knocking out his brains . One of the curiosities of this place , is the/e/e des Blanchissevses , celebrated a few days ago . The whole surface of the river was covered with dances ; floors being strewed upon the boats ; and the boats adorned with flags and streamers , rowing about , and filled with elegant washerwomen , just from the froth , like so many Venuses  - -  now dissolving in a waltz , now fluttering in a quadrille . You ought to have seen how they chose out the most beautiful of these washerwomen  --  the Queen of the * Louis , by a royal edict , ordered that no other building should be constructed in Paris until this work was complete , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was something in those days to be a king . One has now to ask the Deputies every thing , even to gilding the ceilings of the Madelaine. /q/ Suds  --  and rowed her in a triumphal gondola through the stream , with music that untwisted all the chains of harmony . " Not Cleopatra , on her galley 's deck , Displayed so much of leg , or more of neck . " This array of washing-boats relieves the French from that confusion , and misery of the American kitchen , the " washing-day ; " but to give us the water to drink , after all this scouring of foul linen , is not so polite . I have bought a filter of charcoal , which , they say , will intercept , at least , the petticoats and other such articles , as I might have swallowed . The Seine here suffers the same want as one of his brother rivers , sung by the poets : " The river Rhine , it is well known , Doth wash the city of Cologne , But tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river Rhine . " Just opposite the Quai , I observed " Schools of Natation , " for both sexes , kept entirely separate . An admonition is placed over the ladies ' school to this effect , in large letters ; besides it is hermetically secured against any impertinent intrusion , by a piece of linen . The ladies , however , were put to their last shifts , last summer , in maintaining this establishment . Such rigid notions do some persons here entertain of feminine decorum ! But opposition has now died away ; and the reports about gentlemen of the " other house " becoming lovesick , from swimming in the waters from the ladies ' bath , have been proved malicious : for the gentlemen 's house is further up the stream , " et par consequence . ' ' ' '  --  The truth is , that a lady has as much right , and , unfor- ' tunately , in these shipwrecking times , as much neces- /z/ sity often , lo swim as a gentleman ; and it is ascertained that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer of the two . ( I have this from the lady who keeps the bureau . ) Her head is always above the water . All of them , and especially those who have the vapors , can swim without cork . The process of instruction is easy . All that the swimming master has to do , is just to thrust the little creatures into a pair of gum-elastic trousers , and a cravat , inflated , and then pitch them in , one after another  --  only taking care not to put on the trousers without the cravat.  --  I will finish this paragraph , already too long , by an anecdote . I will show you that ladies , who swim , can not use too much circumspection . I mean , by circumspection , looking up , as well as round about them . The ever vigilant police about the Tuileries , had observed a young gentleman very busy with tools , at an opposite garret window , for whole weeks together . Sometimes , till the latest hour of the night , his lamp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dint of looking , and looking they discovered something like an " Infernal Machine , " placed directly towards the apartment of the king and queen , and the bedchamber of the dear little princesses and Madame Adelaide . It was just after the July review , and General Mortier 's disaster ; and suspicion lay all night wide awake . What needs many words ? They burst into the room  --  the " Garde Municipale " and the " police centrale " the " pompiers , " and the " sapeurs " and the Serjeants clad in blue , with buttons to their arms , and swords to their sides , and coifed in chapeaux , three feet in diameter  --  breaking down all opposition of doors , and dragged forth the terrified young man . The tongues of all Paris were now set loose , as usual , and proclamations were read through the streets , /q/ de V horrible assassinal tente contre la vie du roi , et de la famille royale , &c.; &c,; and all that for four sous ! It was even said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Interior ; and that some of the most distinguished Carlists were implicated in his guilt . At length , he was brought up before the Chamber of Peers , with his machine ; where it was examined , and discovered to be  --  what do you think ?  --  a telescope ! The young man alleged that he was getting it up for astronomical purposes ; but the president , a shrewd man about machines , observed that its obliquity was in an opposite direction to the stars . The Seine flows gently by the side of the Tuileries , both from the pleasure it has had in bathing the royal family , and the delight of listening to the king 's band , which plays here every evening , and from this onwards , the right bank is occupied by the gardens of the Tuileries and Champs Elysees . If you wish to know how more beautiful than the gardens of Armida is this garden of the Tuileries , I refer you to my former letters ; especially to that one which I wrote you when I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything with sensibility , and a good many things with ecstacy . Somebody has said , that every one who is born , is as much a first man as Adam , which I do not quite believe . Adam came straight into the world , " all made up . " He came into the midst of a creation , which rushed , with the freshness of novelty upon his senses , and was not introduced to him by gradual acquaintance . How many things did this first man see in Eden , which you and I could never have seen in it ; and which he himself had never seen in it , if he had been put out to nurse or had been brought up at the " College Rolein . " I wish it had . pleased Providence to people this world with men and /z/ women of his own making , and not left us to be made by bungling nurses , and still more bungling schoolmasters . How often have I since wandered through this garden , without even glancing at the white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked upon this goodly terrace , strolling all the while , the pretty Miss Smith at one arm , and thy incomparable self at the other , by the wizard Schuylkill , or the silent woods of the Mahontongo . Opposite this garden , on the Quai d'Orsay , is the Hotel , not finished , of the Minister of the Interieur ; the most enormous building of all Paris . It has turned all the houses near it into huts . That , just under its huge flanks , with a meek and prostrate aspect , as if making an apology , for intruding into the presence of its prodigious neighbor , that is the Hotel of the Legion of Honor . Alas , what signifies it to have bullied all Europe for half a century ! Close by is a little chateau , formerly of the Marquis de Meilleraye , which I notice only to tell you an anecdote of his wife . The prince Philip came to Paris , and died very suddenly  --  under Louis XIV . He was a great roue and libertine , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his salvation . " Je vons assure , " said she , very seriously , " qu ' ct des gens de cette quallte la Dieu y regarde , bien a deux fois pour les damner . " Ladies bred in high life do n't think that kings may be damned like thee and me . The next object of importance , and the object of most importance of all Paris , is the Chamber of Deputies . I wished to go in , but four churlish and bearded men disputed me this privilege . I sat down , therefore , upon the steps , having Justice , Temperance , and Prudence , and anotherelderly lady , on each side of me ; and I consoled /q/ myself and said : In this House the Virtues arc shut out of doors . 1 had also in the same group , Sully , Hopital , D'Aguesseau , and Colbert . What superhuman figures ! And I had in front the Bridge of Concord , upon which are placed twelve statues in marble , also of the Colossal breed . A deputy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bigger than Lemuel Gulliver , just arrived at Brobdignag . Four are of men distinguished in war ; Cond6 , who looks ridiculously grim , and Turenne , Duguesclin , and Bayard ; and four eminent statesmen , Suger , Richelieu , Sully , Colbert ; and four of men famous on the sea , Tourville , Suffren , Duquesne , and who was the other ?  --  He whose name would shame an epic poem , or the Paris Directory , Duguay-Trouin . I took off my hat to Suffren , for he helped us with our Independence . On the back ground of this Palace , is a delightful woodland , where the members often seek refreshment from the fatigues of business in the open air . Here you will see a Lycurgus seated apart , and ruminating upon the fate of empires ; and there a pair of Solons , unfolding the mazes of human policy , straying arm in arm through its solitary gravel walks . M. Q , a member of this chamber and sometimes minister , was seen walking here assiduously during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded into night , a beautiful female figure was seen walking with him . It did not seem to be of mortal race , but a spirit of some brighter sphere , which had consented awhile to walk upon this earth with Monsieur Q . It was , however , the wife of Monsieur , another member of this chamber .  --  One essential difference , you may remark between Numa Pompilius and Deputy Q is , that the one met ladies in the woods , for the making of /z/ laws  --  and the other for the breaking of them . Monsieur , informed of the fact , took a signal revenge upon the seducer of his wife . And what do you think it was ?  --  lie called him out , to be sure , and blew out his brains . Not a bit of it .  --  He waylaid him then , and dispatched him secretly ? Much less . I will tell you what he did . He took Monsieur Q ' s wife in exchange .  --  In telling this tale , which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say  --  Heaven preserve me  - -  that there are not honest wives in Paris . " II en est jusqu'a trois que je pourrais nommer . " I have now before me one of the most execrable spots upon this earth ;  --  a " damned spot , " which all the perfumes of Arabia can not sweeten  --  the " Place de la Revolution " *  --  where the Queen of France suffered death with her husband , to propitiate the horrible Republic . I saw once my mother in agitation , upon reading a newspaper  --  sobbing , and even weeping aloud ;  - -  she read , ( and set me to weeping too , ) the account of the execution of this queen . It is the farthest remembrance of my life , and I am now standing on the spot  - -  on the very spot on which this deed was perpetrated  --  - which made women weep in their huts beyond the Alleghany ! With the manifold faults of this queen , one can not , at the age of sober reason , look upon the place of her execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that one has of human nature melting into compassion . She was a woman whom anything of a gentleman would love with all her faults . Moreover , no one expects queens , in the intoxication of their fortunes , to behave like sober people . Not even the sound * II is called also the Place de la Concord , and the Place Louis XV . /q/ and temperate head of Csesar preserved its prudence in this kind of prosperity . The Guillotine was erected permanently on the centre of this Place , and was fed with cart loads at a time . The most illustrious of its victims , were the queen , Louis XVI. , his sister Mademoiselle Elizabeth , and the father of the present king . The grass does not grow upon the guilty place , and the Seine flows quickly by it . If you wish to have the finest view of all Paris  --  the finest , perhaps , of all Europe , of a similar kind  --  you must stand upon the centre of this place ; and you must hurry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will occupy it shortly . Towards the east , you have spread out before you the gardens of the Tuileries , bordered by the noble colonnade of the Rue Rivoli and the Seine ;  --  towards the west the Champs Elysees , and the broad walk leading gently up to Napoleon 's arch , which stands proudly on the summit , and  --  helps the ambitious hills the heavens to scale . " On the north , you have in full view , through the Rue Royale , the superb Madelaine , on the side of its most brilliant sculpture ; and in symmetry with it , the noble front of the Palais Bourbon on the south . On fine evenings , and days of parade , you will see from the Arch to the Palace , about two miles , a moving column of human beings upon the side- walks ; and innumerable equipages , with horses proud of their trappings , and lacqueys of their feathers , meeting and crossing each other upon the intervening roads ; and upon the area of the Tuileries , all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see , amidst the parterres of flowers , and groups of oranges , and its marble divinities , swans swimming upon the silvery lakes ; multitudes of children at their sports , and everywhere ladies and their cavaliers , 178 OliKLISK OF LUXOU. in all the colors of the toilette , sitting or standing , or sauntering about , and appearing through the trees , upon the distant terraces , as if walking upon the air . All this will present you a rich and variegated tableau , of which prose like mine can give you no reasonable perception . The great obelisk , which is to stand here , is now lying upon the adjacent wharf . It is 72 feet high , and is to be raised higher , by a pedestal of 20 feet . It is a single block of granite , with four faces , and each face has almost an equal share of the magnificent prospect I have just tried to describe . It tapers towards the top , and its sides , older than the alphabet , are embossed with a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or playing on their pipes , sheep are bleating , and lambs skipping . A slave is on his knees , and a Theban gentleman recumbent in his fauteuil ; and one is at his wine  --  he who " hob-a-nobbed with Pharaoh , glass to glass , 3000 years ago . "  --  The men are in caps , a third their size ; and the women in low hoods , like a chancellor 's wig . Little did the miner think , who dug it from the quarry , little did the sculptor think , as he carved these images on it , and how little did Sesostris think , in reading over his history of Paris , that it would , one day , make the tour of Europe , and establish itself here in the Place de la Concorde . An expensive and wearisome journey it has had of it . It is nine years since it stepped from its pedestal at Luxor . It was a good notion of Charles X. , but not original . The Emperor Constantius brought one , the largest ever known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two magnificent ones , set up by the Doge Ziana , adorn the Piazelta of St. Mark 's , brought from some island of the Archipelago . The French army , captured at Alexandria in 1801 , had two young ones on their way to Paris , which fell , poor things ! into the rapacious /q/ hands of the British Museum . And now the English , jealous of this Luxoriqne magnificence , are going to bring over Cleopatra 's needle , to be up with them ; and we are going to put something in our Washington Square ; and then the French , some of these days , will bring over the Pyramids . At the corner of the Rue Royale you will see two palaces , one the depot of fine furniture and jewels , the other of the armor of the crown . Here are shields that were burnished for Cressy and Agincourt . Here is the armor of Francis when made prisoner at Pavia , of Henry mortally wounded by Montgomery ; complete sets of armor of Godfrey de Bouillon and Joan of Arc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy father Paul V. Spiders are now weaving their webs in casques that went to Jerusalem . The diamonds of the crown deposited here before the Revolution in rubies , topaz , emeralds , sapphires , amethysts , &c,; were 7432 in number , amongst which were the famous jewels called the Sanci and the Regent , so notorious in the history of jewels ; the latter has figured about the world in the king 's hats , and Napoleon 's sword . An antiquarian would find extreme delight in this room ; as for me I scarce know which is Mambrino 's helmet , and which the barber 's basin . I had no sooner quit the deputies than I found myself under the great Hospital of the Invalids , whose lofty and gilded dome was blazing in the setting sun . Napoleon put up this gilding to amuse gossiping Paris in his Russian defeats , as Alcibiades to divert Athens from his worse tricks cut off his dog 's tail ; and as Miss Kitty to withdraw a more dangerous weapon from her baby 's hand , gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital , or rather pieces of soldiers ; for one has an /z/ arm at Moscow , another a leg at Algiers , needing no nourishment from the state . Here is one whose lower limbs were both lost at the taking of Paris . He seems very happy . He saves the shoemaker 's , hosier 's , and half the tailor 's bill . He is fat , too , and healthy , for he has the same rations as if he were all there . If I ' were expert at logic , I would prove to yon that this piece of an individual might partly eat himself up ; his legs being buried in the suburbs , and he dining on the potatoes which grow there ; and I could prove , if I was put to it , that with a proper assistance from cork , he might be running about town with his legs in his cheeks . There are two sorts of historians , one confining themselves to a simple narrative of facts and descriptions ; the other searching after causes and effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latter class . This hospital was planned by the great Henry ; the great Louis built it , and it was furnished with lodgers by the great Napoleon . It has all the air of a hospital ; long ranges of rooms and chilling corridors ; and this reunion of mutilated beings is a horrid spectacle ! They lead a kind of inactive , lounging , alms-house existence . How much better had the munificence of government given to each his allowance , with the privilege of remaining with his friends and relations , than to be thus cut off from all the charities and consolations of domestic life , and without the last , best consolation of afflicted humanity , a woman . The dome is magnificent with paintings , gildings , carvings , and such like decorations . The chapel , the most splendid part , is tapestried with flags taken in war from the enemy . What an emblem in a Christian church ! There are several hundreds yet remaining , notwithstanding the great numbers burnt , to save them from their owners , the allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said my guide , growing a foot taller . " Those are from Africa ; those from Belgium ; and those three from England . " When I asked him to show me those from America , he replied with a shrug  --  " cela viendra , monsieur " The immense plain to the west of the Invalids and in front of the Ecole Militaire , is the Champ de Mars , the rendezvous of horses fleet in the race , and cavalry to be trained for the battle . I am quite vexed that I have not space to tell you of the great Revolutionary fete which was once celebrated in this very place ; how the ladies of the first rank volunteered and worked with their own dear little hands to put up the scaffolding ; and how the king was brought out here with his white and venerable locks and air of a martyr , and the queen her eyes swollen with weeping ; their last appearance . but one ! before the people . And it would be very gratifying to take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officiated at the immense ceremony , at the head of two hundred priests , all habited in immaculate white surplices , and all adorned with tri-colored scarfs , and then how the holy man blessed the new standards of France , and consecrated the eighty-three banners of the Departments . I wish to write all this , but winged time will not wait upon my desires ; besides , this letter is already the longest that was ever written except Paul 's to the Romans ; it has as many curiosities , too , as the shield of Achilles . - The bridge just opposite is the Pont de Jena . The allies were about to destroy it on account of its name , and put gunpowder under it , but Louis XVII. would not allow it . Le jour oil vous fercz sauter le Pont de Jena , je me mctte dessus ! and Bluclier was moved . vol. i.  --  16 /z/ This bridge is the end of my letter and journey ; finis chartxquc viseque .

Paris , November 24th , 1835 . Nearly all who love to woo the silent muses are assembled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the libraries bending under their ponderous loads , and here are the schools and colleges , and all the /z/ establishments devoted to science and letters ; for which reason no doubt it is dignified by the name of the Quartier Latin . When the west of the river was yet overspread /q/ with its forests , this quarter was covered with houses and adorned with a palace and amphitheatre , baths , an aqueduct , and a " Field of Mars " for the parade of the Roman troops  --  where Julius Ceesar used to make them shoulder their firelocks . But now , though it contains a fourth of the population of the town , and retains its literary character , so far has luxury got ahead of Philosophy , it has no greater dignity of name than the " Faubourgs . " It stands apart as if the city of some other people . Some few , indeed , from the fashionable districts , in a desperate Captain Ross kind of expedition , do sometimes come over here , and have got back safe , but having found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it remains unexplored . The population has become new , by retaining its old customs . By standing still , it shows the " march of intellect " through the rest of the city . Here you see yet that venerable old man who wears a cue and powder , and buckles his shoes , and calls his shop a boutique ; who garters up his stockings over his knees , goes to bed at eight , and snuffs the candle with his fingers ; and you see everywhere the innumerable people , clattering through the muddy and narrow lanes in their sabots . Poverty , not being able to get lodgings in the Rue Rivoli , the Palais Royal , and , though she tried hard , in the Boulevards , has been obliged , on account of the cheap rents , to come over here and to strike up a sort of partnership with science , and they now carry on various kinds of industry , under the firm of Misere et Compagnie . In the central section of this Latin country , the staple is the bookshop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable volumes inside out , on the ceilings , on the floor , and on the screens throughout the room , leaving just a space for a little bookseller ; /z/ and stalls are covered with the same article in the open air , in all those positions , where , in other towns , yon find mutton and fat beef . When you see a long file of Institutes , and Bartholos , and Cnjasses , wrapped in their yellow parchment , you are near the Temple of Themis  - -  the Ecole des Lois . When you see , in descending St. Jacques , a morose , surly , bibliomaniacal little man , entrenched behind a Homer , a Horace , and a Euclid 's Elements , that is the College de France ; and when you stumble over a pile of the Martyrs , it is the Sorbonne ; as you approach the Ecole Medecine , five hundred Bichats and Richerands beckon you to its threshold .  - -  Besides , you will see ladies and gentlemen looking out from the neighboring windows , and recommending themselves in their various anatomical appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong side out . There is a shop , too , of phrenological skulls , and a lady who will explain you the bumps ; and if you like , you can get yourself felt for a franc or two , and she will tell you where is your P hi lo-pro  --  what do you call it ? She told me our intellectual qualities were placed in front , and the sensual in the back part of the skull , very happily , because the former could look out ahead , and keep the latter in order . And next door is a shop of all the wax preparations of human forms , and diseases , and here is another lady who will point you out their resemblances with originals , who will analyze you a man into all his component parts , and put him up again ; and she puts up , also , " magnificent skeletons , " and mannikins for foreign countries . Now and then you will see arrive a cart , which pours out a dozen or so of naked men and women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are distributed into the dissecting rooms , after the ladies and gentlemen standing about have sufficiently /q/ entertained themselves with the spectacle . And just step into " Dupuytren 's Room , " and you will see all the human diseases , arranged beautifully in families ; here is the plague , and there is the cholera morbus ; here is the gout , and there is the palsy staring you in the face ; and there are whole cabinets of sprained ankles , broken legs , dislocated shoulders , and cracked skulls . In a word , everything is literary in this quarter . One evening you are invited to a party for squaring the circle , another for finding out the longitude ; and another : " My dear sir , come this evening ; we have just got in a subject . The autopsis will begin at six . " The medical students are about four thousand ; those of law and theology about the same number ; and many a one of these students lodges , eats and clothes himself , and keeps his sweetheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last named article , I am living a kind of student 's life . I have a room twenty feet square , overlooking from the second story , the beautiful garden of Luxembourg , and the great gate opening from the Rue d'Enfer . This is my parlor during the day , and a cabinet having a bed , and opening into it , converts the two into a bed-chamber for the night ; and the price including services , is eight dollars per month . I find at ten a small table covered with white porcelain , and a very neat little Frenchwoman comes smiling in with a coffee-pot in one hand and a pitcher of boiling milk in the other , and pours me out with her rosy fingers a large cup of the best ca/6 an lait in the world , and sits down herself , and descants fluently on the manners and customs of the capital , and improves my facilities in French . If you wish bad coffee , it is not to be had in this country . The accompaniments are two eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter , and a /z/ small loaf of bread  --  all this for eighteen sous , ( a sous is a twentieth less than our cent. ) 1 dine out wherever I may chance to be , and according to the voracity or temperance of my appetites , from one and a half to five francs at six o'clock . A French dinner comes at the most sociable hour , when the cares and labors of the day are past , and the mind can give itself up entirely to its enjoyments , or its repose . I have dined sometimes at the illustrious Flicoteau 's , on the Place Sorbonne , with the medical students , and have looked upon the rooms once occupied by J. Jacques Rousseau , and upon the very dial on which he could not teach Therese , his grisette wife , to count the hours . I have dined , too , at Viot 's , with the law students , and have taken coffee , with Moliere , and Fontinelle , and Voltaire , at the Procope . The following is a bill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vegetables , /z/ Meat , /z/ Fish , /z/ Bread , /z/ You have , also , which serves at once for vinegar and wine , a half bottle of claret , at six sous ; and a dessert , a bunch of grapes or three cherries , for two ; or of sweetmeats , a most delicate portion  --  one of those infinitesimals of a dose , such as the Homceopathists administer in desperate cases . Yet this  --  if a dish were only what it professes to be on its face , the soup , not the rinsings of the dishcloth , the fricassee not poached upon the swilltub  --  this would still be supportable  --  if a macaroni were /q/ only a macaroni ; which , in a cheap Paris fare , I understand , is not to be presumed . In sober sadness , this is very bad . We have a right to expect that a thing which calls itself a hare , should not be a cat . But , alas ! it is the end of all human refinement , that hypocrisy should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better the component parts of a French dish , in a French cookery , than you can a virtue in a condiment of - French affability . But . It is an homage which a horse 's rump renders to a beefsteak . At my last dinner here I had two little ribs , held together in indissoluble matrimony , of mutton . I tried to divorce them , but to no purpose , till the perspiration began to flow abundantly . I called the " gargon , " and exhibited to him their toughness.  --  " Cependant , Monsieur , le mouton it ait vagniJique ! , , I offered him five francs if he would sit down and eat it ; he refused . He had , perhaps , a mother or some poor relation depending on him . I did not insist . M. Flicoteau belongs to the romantic school . I prefer the classical . I need hardly say , that the French students who dine here , have an unhealthy and shriveled appearance  --  you recollect thelast run of the shad on the Juniata . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its monks for the sake of the Lord , and M. Flicoteau , for his own sake , keeps starving people here ever since ? Sixteen sous is a student 's ordinary dinner . His common allowance for clothing , and other expenses by the year , is three hundred dollars . He eats for a hundred , lodges for fifty , and has the remainder for his wardrobe , and amusements . The students of medicine are mostly poor and laborious , and being obliged to follow their filthy occupation of dissecting , are negligent of dress and manners . The disciples of the law are more of the rich classes , have idle time , keep better company , and have /z/ an air plus distingue . The doctors of law in all countries take rank above medicine . The question of precedence , I recollect , was determined by the Dnke of Mantua 's fool , who observed that the " rogue always walks ahead of the executioner . "  --  Theology , alas ! hides her head in a peaceful corner of the Sorbonne , where once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble and abject fortunes . A student of Divinity eats a soup maigre , a riz-au-lait , flanked by a dessert of sour grapes . His meals would take him to Heaven if he had no other merits . The other resorts of eating , besides the restaurants , are as follows : the Gargotte , the Cuisine Bourgeoise , and , of a higher grade , the Pension Bourgeoise . In the Gargotte you do n't get partridges.  --  Your dinner costs seven sous . You have a little meat , dry and somewhat stringy , veal or mutton , whichever Monsieur pleases.  --  Whether it died the natural way , or a violent death by the hands of the butcher , it is impossible to know . You have , besides , a thick soup , a loaf of bread three feet long , standing in the corner by the broom , and fried potatoes ; also water and the servant girl h discretion . At seventeen sous , you have all the aforesaid delicacies , with a table cloth into the bargain ; and at twenty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algiers metal .  --  This is the Gargotte . When you have got to twenty-five sous , you are in the Cuisine Bourgeoise . Here your " convert " consists of a spoon , a fork , a knife , a napkin , a glass , and a small bottle , called a caraffon ; your plate is changed  --  already a step towards civilization ; and you have a cucumber a foot long , radishes a little withered , asparagus just getting to seed , and salt and pepper , artistically arranged ; and a horse 's rump cooked into a beefsteak , and washed /q/ clown with " veritable macon "  --  that is , the best sort of logwood alcoholized . You have , also , a little dessert here of sour grapes , wrinkled apricots , or green figs , which are exhibited for sale , at the window , between meals . The flaps of mutton and the drum-sticks of turkeys , which you get so tender , have been served up , once or twice , at the Hotel Ordinary ; , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better Ephraim 's gleanings , than Abiezer 's vintage . The French have a knack of letting nothing go to loss . Why they make more of a dead horse or cow than others of the living ones . They do not even waste the putrid offals of the butcheries ; they sell the maggots to feed chickens .  --  But when you pay forty sous , that 's quite another affair . You are now in the monde goarmande . Spinage has butter in it ; custards have sugar in them ; soup is called potage ;  --  everything now has an honest name ; bouilli is boenf a la mode ; fried potatoes , pomme de terre a la mentre d'hbtel ; and a baked cat is , lapin saute a Vestragon.  --  This is the gentleman 's boarding-house . I mean by gentleman , a youth , who has just come over from England or America , to the lectures , or a French clerk of the corps bureau-cratique , or an apprentice philosopher , who calls himself a " man of letters . " It is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not often oppressed by the intelligence and gravity of your convives , and have a chance of shining . It is in the power of any man to have wit , if he but knows how to select his company . In this pension the dishes succeed one another , and are not crammed , as in our tables roti fricandeau , salade , vol au vent  --  all into the same service , to distract and pall the appetite , or get cold waiting on each other . The coquetry of a French kitchen keeps alive expectation , /z/ and enhances enjoyment by surprise . You have here , too , the advantage of a male cook ; the kitchen prefers the masculine to the feminine , like the grammars ; and , besides , you have the tranquillity of a private house . If you ask a dish at Flicoteau 's , the waiter balls it down to the kitchen , and as they are continually asking , he is continually bawling . At the end of the feast , you will see , standing before you , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep fumbling in your mouth , the whole afternoon , as an evidence you have dined , and especially if you have not dined  --  for then you must keep up appearances ;  --  some grease their mouths with a candle , and then you think they have been eating pate defoie gras . I am sorry to have forgotten the locomotive cook ; I mean a woman with an appareil de cuisine about her neck , having meat and fish hung , by hooks , on both her haunches , and sausages , or fish , or potatoes hissing in a frying-pan ; and diffusing , for twenty yards around , a most appetizing flavor.  --  She haunts usually the Pont Neuf , and its vicinity , and looks like gastronomy personified . She will give you for four sous , of potatoes , with yesterday 's gazette , and reclining under the parapet of the Quai  --  the king , perhaps , all the while , envying you from the heights of the Louvre  --  you eat a wholesomer dinner , at ten sous , than the Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys its provisions second handed . The farmer arrives about two in the morning  --  he sells out to the hucksters , and these latter to the public : mixing in the leavings of the preceding day , a rotten egg with a fresh one , &c.; A patient old woman , having nothing else to do , speculates over a bushel of potatoes , or a botte of onions , twice twenty-four hours ; /q/ and your milk woman , perhaps , never saw a cow ; cows are expensive in slops and provender ; and snails and plaster of Paris are to be had almost for nothing . The French eat greater quantities of bread than their neighbors  --  and why at a cheaper rate ?  --  The price is fixed , by police , every fortnight , and its average is two and a half cents  --  sixty per cent , lower than in London ; and how much lower than with us ? 450 millions of lbs . are consumed in Paris annually ; each man eating twelve dollars worth . If you establish a Frenchman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 22 for meat , 27 for wine and spirits . Peaches and apples , and melons are not to be spoken of , in comparison with ours : but cherries , plums , and especially pears , are in great variety and abundance ; and the fine grapes of Fontainbleau are eight cents per pound . In England , they have all the fruits of the Indies in the nobleman 's hot houses ; but who can buy them ? There are men there who have the conscience to pay for the fruits of a breakfast . " The strawberries at my Lady Stormont 's , last Saturday , cost says Hannah More . But I must bridle in my muse ; she is getting a fit of statistics . If a gentleman comes to Paris in the dog days , when his countrymen are spread over Europe , at watering places , and elsewhere , and when every soul of a Frenchman is out of town  --  if he is used to love his friends at home , and be loved by them , and to see them gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot in that unnatural thing , a bachelor 's apartment in a furnished hotel , to live alone , to eat alone , and to sleep alone ! If he does , let him take leave of his wife and children and settle up his affairs . Nor let him seek company at the Tavern Ordinary ; here the guest arrives just at the hour , hangs up his hat , sits down in his usual /z/ place , crosses his legs , runs his fingers through his hair , dines , and then disappears , all the year round , without farther acquaintance . But let him look out a " Pension , " having an amiable landlady , or , which is the same , amiable lodgers . He will become domiciliated here after some time , and find some relief from one of the trying situations of life . You know nothing yet , happily , of the solitude , the desolation of a populous city to a stranger . How often did I wish , during the first three months , for a cot by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a " Pension , " especially if you are a sucking child , like me , in the ways of the world ; and the lady of the house , usually a pretty woman , will feel it enjoined upon her humanity to counsel and protect you , and comfort you , or she will manage an acquaintance between you and some countess or baroness , who lodges with her , or at some neighbor 's . I live now with a most spiritual little creature ; she tells me so many obliging lies , and no offensive truths , which I take to be the perfection of politeness in a landlady ; and she admits me'to her private parties  --  little family " reunions "  --  where I play at loto with Madame Thomas , and her three amiable daughters , just for a little cider , cakes , or chestnuts , to keep up the spirit of the play ; and then we have a song , a solo on the violin , or harp , and then a dance ; and finally , we play at little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such penalties . French people are always so merry , whatever be the amusement ; they never let conversation flag , and I do n't see any reason it should . One , for example , begins to talk of Paris , then the Passage Panorama , then of Mrs. Alexander 's fine cakes , and then the pretty girl that sits behind the counter , and then of pretty girls that sit anywhere ; and so one , just lets one 's self run with /q/ the association of ideas , or one makes a digression from the main story , and returns or not , just as one pleases . A Frenchman is always a mimic , an actor ; and all that nonsense which we suffer to go to waste in our country , he economizes for the enjoyment of society . I am settled down in the family ; I am adopted ; the lady gives me , to he sure , now and then " a chance , " as she calls it , of a ticket in a lottery ( " the only one left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lady who has had three children , and is likely for the fourth , where one never draws anything ; or " a chance " of conducting her and a pretty cousin of hers , who has taken a fancy to me , who adores the innocency of American manners , and hates the dissipation of the French , to the play . Have you never felt the pleasure of letting yourself be duped ? Have you never felt the pleasure of letting your little bark float clown the stream when you knew the port lay the other way ? 1 look upon all this as a cheap return for the kindnesses I have so much need off ; I am anxious to be cheated , and the truth is , if you do not let a French landlady cheat you now and then , she will drop your acquaintance . Never dispute any small items overcharged in her monthly bill ; or she that was smooth as the ermine will be suddenly bristled as the porcupine ; and why , for the sake of limiting some petty encroachment upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pretty face into a hurricane ? Your actions should always leave a suspicion you are rich , and then you are sure she will anticipate every want and wish you may have with the liveliest affection ; she will be all ravishment at your successes ; she will be in an abyss of chagrin at your disappointments . " Helas ! oh , mon Dieu ! " and if you cry , she will cry with you ! We love money well enough in Amevol. i.  --  17 /z/ rica , but we do not feel such touches of human kindness , and can not work ourselves up into such fits of amiableness , for those who have it . I do not say it is hypocrisy ; a French woman really does love you if you have a long purse ; and if you have not , ( I do not say it is hypocrisy neither , ) she really does hate you . A great advantage to a French landlady is the sweetness and variety of her smile ; a quality in which French women excel universally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of the dinner time , and has brought her smile under such a discipline as to suit it exactly to the passion to be represented , or the dignity of the person with whom she exchanges looks . You can tell any one who is in arrears as if you were her private secretary , or the wealth and liberality of a guest better than his banker , by her smile . If it be a surly knave , who counts the pennies with her , the little thing is strangled in its birth , and if one who owes his meals , it miscarries altogether ; and for a mere visitor she lets off one worth only three francs and a half ; but if a favorite , who never looks into the particulars of her bill and takes her lottery tickets , then you will see the whole heaven of her face in a blaze , and it does not expire suddenly , but like the fine twilight of a summer evening , dies away gently on her lips . Sometimes I have seen one flash out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark ; it had lit on the wrong person ; and at other times I have seen one struggling long for its life ; I have watched it while it was gasping its last ; she has a way too of knocking a smile on the head ; I observed one at dinner to-day , from the very height and bloom of health fall down and die without a kick . It is strange ( that I may praise myself )  --  but I have a share of attention in this little circle even greater than /q/ they who are amiable . If 1 say not a word , I am witty , and I am excessively agreeable by sitting still . " The silence often of pure innocence persuades when speaking fails . " My acquaintance with life and wickedness puts me in immediate rapport with women , and removes many of the little obstacles which suspicious etiquette has set up between the sexes . Ladies , they say , never blush when talking to a blind man . While a man of address is sailing about and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passage , I am looked upon either as a ship in distress and claiming a generous sympathy and protection , or a prize which belongs to the wreckers , and am towed at once into harbor . Sometimes , indeed , my ignorance of Paris and its ways , is taken for affectation , and they suspect me for behaving as great ambassadors , who affect simplicity to hide their diplomatic rogueries ; but he can not long pass himself for a rogue , who is really honest . It is perhaps mere complexion or physiognomy . I see , every day , faces which remind one of those doors which have written on them " No Admission , " and others , " Walk in without knocking . " It is certain that what we call dignity , however admired on parade , is not a good social quality . " Dignitas et amor "  --  I forget what Ovid says about it . And women too are more familiar and easy of access to modesty of rank . Jupiter , you know , when he made love to Antiope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he succeeded afterwards as a satyr . I knew a pretty American woman once , who , gartering up her stockings in the garden , was reminded that the gardener was looking : " Well ! he is only a working man , " she replied , and went on with the exhibition ; she would have been frightened to death had it been a lord . I make these remarks because other travelers would be /z/ likely to leave them out , and because it is good to know how to live to advantage in all the various circumstances of life . In recommending you a French boarding-house , it is my duty at the same time to warn you of some of its dangers , which are as follows : Your landlady will be in arrears for her rent 200 francs , and will confide to you her embarrassment . Having a rigid , inexorable proprietaire , and getting into an emergency , she will at length ask you with many blushes and amiable scruples the loan of the said money ; and her gratitude , poor thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome her so  --  she will offer you , her arms about your neck , her pretty self , as security for the debt . This is not all ; the baroness ( her husband being absent at Moscow or anywhere else ) will invite you to a supper . She will live in a fine parlor , chambers adjoining , and will entertain you with sprightly and sensible conversation and all the delicacies of the table until the stars have climbed halfway up the heavens ; and you will find yourself tete-h-tele with the lady at midnight , the third bottle of champagne sparkling on the board . I am glad 1 did not leave my virtue in America ; I should have had such need of it in this country ! Indeed if it had been anybody else , not softened by the experience of nine lustrums ;  --  not fortified , like me , by other affections  --  if it had been anybody else in the world , he would have been ruined by Madame la Bardnne . Nor when you have resisted Russia , have you won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all joyous and goodhumored , your landlady will present you the following cards , with notes and explanations . " This is from the belle Gabrielle . She assists her uncle in the store , and is quite disheartened with her business . Uncles are such /q/ cross things !  --  This is from one of my acquaintances , Flora  --  oh , beautiful au possible ! She paints birds and other objects for the print shops , but she finds the confinement injurious to her health . Both these young ladies have signified in great confidence  --  I never would have guessed it !  --  that they would be willing to form an intimacy ( a liaison ) with some American gentleman , whom I might recommend . Here are their cards . You must call and see them , especially Flora ; she has such a variety of talents besides painting ; and she will give you the most convincing proofs of good character and connections . Gabrielle also is very pretty , but she is a young and innocent creature , and her education , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden of the Luxembourg comes next . It contains near a hundred acres , and lies in the midst of this classical district . It is not so gayly ornamented as the Tuileries , but is rich in picturesque and rural scenery . It has , indeed , two very beautiful ornaments . At the north end the noble edifice constructed by Marie de Medicis , the palace of Luxembourg , which contains a gallery of paintings , the chamber of Peers , and other curiosities ; and the Observatory , a stately builing , is in symmetry with this palace on the south . In the interior there are groves of trees and grass plots surrounded by flower beds ; and numerous statues , most of which have seen better days ; ranges of trees , and an octagonal piece of water inhabited by two swans , which are now swimming about in graceful solemnity , adorn the parterre in front of the palace . All these objects I have in view from my windows . The garden has altogether an air of philosophy very grateful to men of studious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , or strolling with books through its groves , and /z/ squads of students arc now and then traversing it to their college recitations . On benches overlooking the parterre is seated all day long , the veteran of the war , the old soldier , in his regimentals , his sword as a companion laid beside him on the bench ; he finds a repose here for his old age amidst the recreations of childhood ; and five or six hundred little men in red breeches , whose profession it is to have their brains knocked out for their country at sixpence a day , are drilled here every morning early , to keep step and to handle their firelocks . There is one corner in which there is a fountain surmounted by a nymph , and which has a gloomy and tufted wood , and an appearance of sanctity which makes it respected by the common world , and by the sun . One man only is seen walking there at a time , the rest retiring out of respect for his devotions . Since a week it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate action his verses , heedless of the profane crowd . He appears pleased with his compositions , and smiles often , no doubt , in anticipation of their immortality . I often sit an hour of an evening at my window , and look down upon the stream of people which flows in and out , and the sentinel who walks up and down by the gate ridiculously grim . 1 love to read the views and dispositions of men in their faces . I witness some pleasant flirtations , too , under the adjacent lime trees , and many gratified and disappointed assignations . Now a lady wrapped in her cloak walks up and down the most secret avenue , upon the anxious watch ; the lover comes at length and she hastens to his embraces , and they vanish ; and next in his turn a gentleman walks sentinel , until his lady comes , or impatient and disappointed , goes off in a rage , or night covers him with her hoary mantle .  --  Were I not bound by so many endearing /z/ affections of kindred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one spot upon the earth I would prefer to the sweet tranquillity of this delicious retirement . When you visit the Luxembourg , you will see multitudes everywhere of bouncing demoiselles , with nymphlooking faces , caps without bonnets , and baskets in their hands , traversing the garden from all quarters , running briskly to their work in the morning , and strolling slowly homewards towards evening .  --  These are the grisettes . They are very pretty , and have the laudable little custom of falling deeply in love with one for five or six francs a piece . They are common enough all over Paris , but in this classical region they are as the leaves in Valambrosa . They are in the train of the muses , and love the groves of the Academy . A grisette , in this Latin Quarter , is a branch of education . If a student is ill , his faithful grisette nurses him and cures him ; if he is destitute , she works for him ; and if he falls into irretrievable misfortune , she dies with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he defends her with his life , and sure of his protection , she feels her consequence , and struts in her new starched cap the reigning monarch of the Luxembourg . A grisette never obtrudes her acquaintance , but question her and you will find her circumstantially communicative . Such information as she possesses , and a great deal more , she will retail to you with a naivete and simplicity , you would swear she was brought up amongst your innocent lambs and turtle doves of the Shamoken . She is the most ingenious imitation of an innocent woman that is in the world ; and never was language employed more happily for the concealment of thought ( I ask pardon of Prince Talleyrand ) than in the mouth of a grisette . The devil is called the father /z/ of lies ( I ask pardon again of the Prince ) , but there is not one of these little imps but can outdo her papa in this particular . When sent with goods from shop-keepers to their customers  --  the common practice of this place  --  she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Greek ; when accused , she will listen to reproaches , insults , even abuse , as long as there is any point of defence , with the resignation of Saint Michael ; and there is no trick of the stage , no artifice of rhetoric recommended by Cicero that she leaves out in her pleadings ; if at last overcome  --  why , she surrenders . She remains awhile mute , and then sets herself to look sorry with all her might ; at last she bursts into tears , with sobs and sighs , until she disarms yon . " Well , let me see what you have got . " She will now wipe away gracefully the briny drops with the corner of her apron ; brighten up again , show you her goods again , and cheat you once more by way of reparation for her former rogueries . There is a modiste , lodged in the adjoining room , of New Orleans , who entertains about twenty of these every morning at her levee . I make sometimes one of the group , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am thus learned about grisettes . Let us moralize a little on this subject . Paris is six times more populous than Philadelphia , and , for the same reason that the black sheep eat less than the white ones , we are six times less vicious than the Parisians . Again , circumstances make the same things less criminal at one time , and in one country , than another . We are not censorious of the Turk who has three wives ; we say it is the religion of his country ; when we would disown any one of our own citizens for half that number ; nor do we blame very heartily Solomon for his excess /q/ of concubines , for we say it was the fashion of the times ; nor even Adam that his daughters married with their brothers ; we say it was a case of necessity . In Philadelphia , every woman has before her the prospect of a marriage , and she would be not only vicious , but very imprudent to forfeit her advantages ; necessity will not stand up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , of the sex , who have not the faintest hope or opportunity of marriage ; and if they , sometimes , make the next good bargain they can , and vindicate the rights of nature over imperious circumstances , upon what propriety is their offence to be weighed in our American scale of religion and morals ? It is to be remarked , too , that the debasement of mind , produced by any vice , is influenced materially by the degree of odium and censure attached to it by the public opinion . Concubinage , so intolerable in our communities in both sexes , is here scarce a subject of remark in either . It prejudices no reputation ; it does not throw a woman out of society ; she , therefore , cultivates agreeable talents , and preserves many of the excellent qualities of a matron . In many instances , indeed , a Parisian woman is less corrupted , and much less exposed to corruption by being a mistress , than being a wife . The ancient Athenian society had partly the same character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this the Ninon de l'Enclos . If you will but bear in mind that I am not defending the state of Paris society , but showing only how far the faults of individuals , who do not create but are subject to its laws , may be extenuated , I will venture to say also , that the gallantries of married women are much less pernicious , and much less wicked in Paris , than they would be in our American cities . You make your own /z/ marriages , which are generally well enough assorted ; and your husbands , for several obvious reasons , are rather faithful ; but in Paris , where eighteen is tied to fifty , ( the common condition , ) and fifty too , worn out with libertinism and debauch , and where the husband keeps his mistress under the very nose of his wife , are you allowed injustice to exact the same conjugal faith from wives , or measure an act of infidelity , which produces no scandal or ruin of families , by the same standard of criminality as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by all this , that ladies faithful to their lords are not very common in this city ; they are certainly not the less entitled to praise for being honest in a place where public opinion does not deter them from being the contrary . There are some French husbands so amiable , that even their wives can not help loving them . It is important for one 's mamma to know whether it is a good or bad fashion , that so common now-a-days , of sending a young gentleman , just stepping from youth into manhood , to Europe , especially to Paris . I will venture some remarks , for your information , though I have no very settled opinion on the subject . I know several Americans here , some engaged in medical and scientific schools , and some in painting and other arts , who appear to me to be exceedingly diligent , and to make as profitable a use of their time , as they would anywhere else . I know some who mix pleasure with business , and a little folly with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it i this class ) who do not taste dissipation with their " extremest lips . " But I know some also , who , under pretext of law and medicines , study mischief only , and return home worse , if possible , than when they came out . I know one now , who , having too much health , overruns his revenues occasionally , /q/ and draws upon home for a doctor 's and apothecary 's bill ; and another poor devil , who has gone to Mount Piete with his last trinket . There came one from the Mississippi lately , who , being very young , and rich and unmarried , set up a kind of seraglio , and died of love , yesterday ; they are burying him to-day , at Pere la Chaise . I know one , also , who has lived here nine years , who reads Voltaire , keeps a French cook , and his principles are as French as his stomach ; and another , who entertains the French noblesse with fetes and soirees , to the tune of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-six horses , full bred , better than many of his majesty 's subjects , come prancing out on days of jubilee upon the Boulevards . If a young man 's morals should get out of order at home , Paris is not exactly the place to which I would send him to be cured . It is true , if drunkenness be the com plaint , it is not a vice of the place ; and , if curable at all , which I do not believe , Paris , from its common use of light wines , and variety of amusements , is perhaps the best place to make the attempt . It is certainly not the most dangerous place of falling into this vice . If he be fond of gambling , here it is a genteel accomplishment , and brought out under the patronage of the government . And to keep a mistress is not only not disgraceful in French society , but is always mentioned to one 's credit . It is a part of a gentleman 's equipage , and adds to his gentility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a gentleman can aspire to in this country , and most others  --  money . " 11 a la plus jolie maitresse cle Paris/ " you can not say anything more complimentary , if it were of the prime minister ; and it would scarce be an injurious imputation if said of one 's father confessor . If you send , then , your son to /z/ Paris , am I uncharitable in surmising that he may , sometimes , use the privilege . of the place ? It is , indeed , a question for philosophy to determine , ( and not for me , ) which of the two may be the less injurious to his health and morals , the gross intercourse he is exposed to in some other towns , or the more refined gallantries of the French capital . If you can preserve him , by religious and other influences from either , as well as from the dangers of an ascetic and solitary abstinence  --  for solitude has its vices as well as dissipation  --  so much the better . He will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better man . But let me tell you that to educate a young man of fortune and leisure to live through a youth of honesty , has become excessively difficult even in any country ; and to expect that , with money and address , he will live entirely honest in Paris , where women of a good quality are thrown in his face  - -  women of art , of beauty , and refined education  --  it is to attribute virtues to human nature she is no way entitled to . The Greeks used to indulge their sons , waiting a fit marriage , with mistresses of " decent and respectable character ; " and entertained them , even , sometimes , under the paternal roof ; this they thought necessary to the preservation of their morals and health . If you love the Greeks , then , send your son over by the next packet . He may have some trouble with his conscience , perhaps , the first month or two , but , by degrees , he will become reconciled , and get along well enough . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral inclinations and habits , or only on a transient visit , or without French , he will be secure from all the dangers ( except , perhaps , gambling ) to which I have alluded ; he will live only in American society , which is quite as good and pure here as at home ; he will have no acquaintance /q/ with the natives , but of that class in which a gentleman 's morals run less risk of temptation than even from the vulgar intercourse of American towns . All that part of a city like Paris , that comes into relation with strangers , and lives by deceiving and plundering them , is of course gross and corrupt ; and as the best things are the worst when spoilt , the women are detestable ; even when there is youth or beauty , its natural feelings are perverted and worn out by use ; it is flat beer , stale without being ripe . I do not know any community in which the honesty of a gentleman is so safe from contamination . It is certainly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit these old countries ; if it were only to form a just estimate of his own , which he is continually liable to mistake , and always to overrate without objects of comparison ; " nimium se ass timet necesse est , qui se nemini compared . " He will always think himself wise , who sees nobody wiser ; and to know the customs and institutions of foreign countries , which one can not know well without residing there , is certainly the complement of a good education . The American society at Paris , taken altogether , is of a good composition . It consists of several hundred persons , of families of fortune , and young men of liberal instruction . Here are lords of cotton from Carolina , and of sugar-cane from the Mississippi , millionaires from all the Canadas , and pursers from all the navies ; and their social qualities , from a sense of mutual dependence or partnership in absence , or some such causes , are more active abroad than at home . The benevolent affections act in a contrary way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the centre . The plain fact is , that Americans at Paris are hospitable in a very vol. i.  --  18 /z/ high degree ; they have no fear of being dogged with company , and have leisure here which they have nowhere else , to be amiable ; the new comer , too , is more tender and thankful , and has a higher relish of hospitality and kindness ; and the general example of the place lias its effect on their animal spirits . They form a little republic apart , and when a stranger arrives , he finds himself at home ; he finds himself also under the censorial inspection of a public opinion , a salutary restraint not always the luck of those who travel into foreign countries . One thing only is to be blamed . It becomes every day more the fashion for the Mite of our cities to settle themselves here permanently . We can not but deplore this exportation of the precious metals , since our country is drained of what the supply is not too abundant . They who have resided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not choose , as I perceive , to reside anywhere else . It is now midnight and more . I have said so much in this letter about grisettes , that I shall have a nightmare of them before morning . This " Latin Quarter " is one of the most instructing volumes of Paris , but all 1 can do is just open you here and there some of its pages and show you the pictures  --  pictures in this country , recollect , are more cl decouvert than in America . Please make the allowance . Good night . /q/ /z/ The Observatory  --  The astronomers  --  Val de Grace Anne of Austria  --  Hospice des Enfans Trouves  --  Rows of cradles - Sisters of Charity  --  Vincent de Paul  --  Maisons d'Accouchement  --  Place St. Jacques  --  The Catacombs  --  Skull of Ninon de 1'Enclos  --  The poet Gilbert  --  Julian 's Bath  --  Hotel de Cluny  --  Ancient furniture  - -  Francis the First 's bed  --  Charlotte Corday  --  Danton  --  Marat  - -  Robespierre  --  Rue des Postes  --  Convents of former times  --  Faubourg St. Marceau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed myself from the repose of the night , by running boyishly up the broad and elegant walk which leads to the south end of the garden , to the Observatory ; the place where they make almanacks ; I went and saw great piles of astronomical books and instruments , an anemometer to measure the winds , and another affair baptized also in Greek , to measure the rain ; also a thing in the cellar , which in this Latin Quarter , they call an " acoustic phenomenon " By this you can talk aloud all day to any individual standing in a particular place , and not another of the company will be any the wiser for it . There are a number of men here whom they call Astronomers , who , while we are asleep , look after the stars , and observe what is going on in the moon ; and who go to bed with Venus and the heavenly bodies towards morning . I must tell you what 1 saw in coming out . I saw a woman , and a very decent woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in East , and the other all /z/ the way in West longitude . This was her way of straddling a pole . There was an old woman here in a little stall , upon a broad and paved place in front of the Observatory , who sells tobacco and butter , belly-guts and epic poems , who showed me the very stone upon which Marshal Ney stood to be shot . " There stood the wretches that shot him . Yes , sir , I saw him murdered , and I never wish to see the like again . " Just east I visited another remarkable building , which young girls read about in their romances , called Val de Grace . Anne of Austria had been married twenty-two years , without having , as they say in London , any hair to her crown , and she did not know what to do about it . She first prayed to the Lord as Rachel had done in a similar torment , and the Lord was deaf unto her prayers . She then applied to certain Benedictine monks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they interceded for her , and she had a fine son ; you have perhaps heard of Louis XIV . Now this church which she built , was Val de Grace . If you wish to see the prettiest fresco paintings of all Paris , you must go in here and look up at the dome ; the chapels , too , are full of virgins and musty little angels . She came here in 1624 , and laid the corner stone with , her own little hands  --  Anne of Austria did . And she bestowed some special privileges upon the monastery ; amongst others , the right of burying in this church the hearts of all the defunct princesses , beginning with herself ; and at the Revolution " one counted even to twenty-six royal hearts . " The convent of Val de Grace is now turned into a military hospital , and greasy soldiers are stabled where once lived and breathed the pretty nuns you read of in your novels . /q/ Just in the neighborhood is the Hospice des Enfans Trouvh , to which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its head to be born out of lawful wedlock , which now and then occurs , it is carried to this hospital for nourishment and education . The average number admitted here , is 6000 annually ; 161 per day . They are received day and night , and no questions asked . All you have to do is , place the little human being in a box com municating with an apartment in the interior , which on ringing a bell , is taken in , and gets on afterwards well enough , often better than we who think ourselves legitimate . It sucks no diseases from its mother 's milk ; and from its father 's example no vices ; and it has a good many virtues incident to its condition . It has amongst these a great reverence for old age , not knowing but that every old gentleman it meets might be a little its papa . On entering this hospital you will see two long rows of cradles running over with babies , and a group of sisters in gowns of black serge , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little destitute creatures the offices of maternity ; and indeed they take such care of them as almost to discourage poor people from having legitimate children altogether . I have no doubt that many an excellent mother in passing by repents sincerely that her poor children are not misbegotten ; and that the little rogues too themselves , as they toddle along outside in their sabots , to their day 's work , without their breakfast , wish to the Lord such , things had never been born as honest mammies to forestall their advantages . But what praise can be equal to the merits of these Sisters of Charity ? You see them everywhere that suffering humanity needs their assistance ; their devotion has no parallel in the history of the world . They /z/ are very often , too , of rich and distinguished families , women who leave all enjoyments of gay society , to pursue these humble and laborious duties , to practice in these silent walls , prudence , patience , fortitude , and all those domestic virtues and peaceful moralities , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction . Think only of relinquishing fashion , and rank , and pleasure to be granny to an almshouse ! This hospital was founded by one of the most respectable saints of all Paris , Vincent de Paul . His statue is placed in the vestibule . It would do your heart good to see the babies go down on their bits of knees every evening and bless the memory of this Saint . A cradle used to be hung up as a sign to draw customers here , but the reputation of the house is now made , and it is taken down . Formerly the ringing of a bell , too , or the wailings of the infant , the mother giving it a pinch , was enough to announce a new comer , but lately so many dead children have been put in the box to avoid the expense of burying them , that they have been obliged to stop up the hole . I am sorry for this ; it was so convenient . You just put in a baby as you put in a letter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a room inside , where the names , dress , the words and behavior of those who bring it , as also its death , are entered in a register ; this register is kept a profound secret ; never revealed to any one , unless one pays twenty francs . I visited the school-rooms , where those of proper age are taught to read and write . They seem very merry and happy , and , having no communication with the world , are unconscious of any inferiority of birth ; they think we all come the same way . When very young or sickly , they are put out to nurse through the country , /q/ and at twelve are apprenticed to a trade . The sisters will point you out a mother who has placed her infant here and got herself employed as child 's nurse to the hospital to give it nourishment and care . I forgot to mention that mothers are not allowed to see their babies , or receive their bodies if they die ; they are reserved for the improvement of anatomical science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maisons d ? Accouchement , distributed everywhere over the city , in which persons find accommodations , as secretly as they please , and at all prices to suit their circumstances . The evils of all these establishments are manifest ; the good is , the prevention of infanticide , often of suicide , and of the perjuries innumerable , and impositions practised in some other countries . I doubt whether a city like Paris could safely adopt any other system . The tables of the last year 's birth stand thus : seventeen thousand one hundred and twenty-nine legitimate ; nine thousand seven hundred and Iwentyone illegitimate . So you see that every second man you meet in Paris wants but a trifle of being no bastard . Expense above a million and a half of francs . Here is the Place St. Jacques ; the place of public execution . It is the present station of the Guillotine , which has already made several spots of the city classical . And here is appropriately the Barriere d'Enfer . These barriers are found at all the great issues from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris ; often beautiful with sculpture , and other ornaments . Whilst I was surveying this district , in my usual solitary way , I met two gentlemen and a lady , acquaintances , who were descending into the Catacombs , whose opening is just here ; and I went down with // them . This nether world bears upon its vaults three fourths of the Quarter St. Germain , with its superincumbent mass of churches and palaces . The light of Heaven is shut out , and so deep a silence reigns in its recesses , that one hears his own footsteps walking after him , and is so vast that several visitors , ' straying away a i'ew years ago , have not yet returned . The bones of fifty generations are emptied here from ancient graveyards of Paris , now only known to history . What a hideous deformity of skulls ! After entering half a mile we saw various constructions , all made out of these remnants of mortality ; sepulchral monuments , an entire church , with its pulpit , confessional , altars , tombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacres are laid out here chronologically . How unjacobinical they look ! On entering you are confronted with the following inscription : " Jirrete , c'e.st ici V empire de la Mort / " and various other inscriptions are put up in the dead languages , and names often written upon skulls , to designate their owners . " Fix your eyes here , " said our lady ; " this is the skull of Ninon de l'Euclos , " with verses . " L'indulgente et sage Nature A forme 1'ame de Ninon De la volupte d'Epicure , Et de la vertu de Canton . " And this is her skull ! Every one knows her history , but I will tell a little of it over again . I will give you a list of her court . Moliere , Corneille , Scarron , St. Evermond , Chapelle , Desmarets , Mignard , Chateauneuf , Chaulieu , Conde , Vendome , Villeroi , Villars , D'Estrees , La Rochefoucauld , Choiseuil , Sevigne and Fontenelle . She was honored with the confidence of Madame Scarron , /q/ and the homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made conquests at sixty , one at seventy , , and died at ninety . Her own son , the Chevalier de Villiers , fell in love with her at fifty , and fell upon his sword , when she revealed to him the secret of his birth . The Chevalier de Gourville confided to her twenty thousand crowns , when driven to exile , and a like sum to the Grand Penitencier ; the priest denied the deposit , and the courtezan restored it , unasked . I visited , a month ago , her chateau , and saw the rooms in which she used to give her famous supper lous les Despreaux , et tons les JRacines . " And this is her skull ! While my doctor companions were turning it about , and explaining the bumps  --  how big was her ideality , how developed her amativeness , I turned her about in my mind , until I had turned her into shapes again  --  into that incomparable beauty and grace , which no rival was able to equal , and which sensuality itself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon those grinning teeth , I gave her her smile again , her wit , and her eloquence . I assisted at her little court of Cyprus , in the Rue de Tournelle , where philosophers came to gather wisdom , and courtiers grace from her conversation ; I assisted at her toilet , and witnessed the hopes , the jealousies , the agonies , and ecstacies of her lovers . And so we took leave of the exquisite Ninon 's skull  --  if it was hers . The poet Gilbert , who died of want , has here an apartment to himself , which he had not above ground . It is inscribed with his own mournful epitaph : " Au banquet de la vie , infortune convive , J'apparus un jour , et je meurs . Je meurs , et sur ma tombe , oh lentement j'arrive , Nul ne viendra verser des pleurs ! " I could not help contradicting him for the life of me. /z/ In the very interior of the cavern are collections of water which have classical names . Herer is the Styx just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard hy the Institute . We came at length to the cabinet of skulls , arranged upon shelves , some for phrenology , and some for pathology , exhibiting in classes the several diseases ; which our doctors explained with nice circumstantiality , to their Sibyl conductor ; rows of toes , of fingers , and jaws , and legs which used to cut pigeon-wings , and pirouettes , alas ! how gracefully . In the mean time I saw a couple of ghosts , ( I supposed them to be Cuvier , and Dr. Gall , ) skulking away as soon as they caught a glimpse of our tapers , and -I saw a great many other things , not interesting to people above ground . We began now to be apprehensive of taking cold , and being sent hither to enrich these cabinets ; and so we deposited at the door our golden branch , and having mounted a strait stairway one hundred feet were purified in open air . The two doctors now left me their Eurydice , and she and I , being inspired alike with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw Julian 's Baths . Though he is said to have been little addicted to bathing , here are his baths , the only relic of his sojourn in Paris . This old building is an oblong with very thick walls , which are crumbling to decay . One of them is entirely dilapidated . The vaults , rising forty-two feet above the soil , and furnaces under ground , and parts of the bathing-rooms , are exposed to view , in all the naked majesty of a ruin ; a ruin , too , of fifteen centuries . This is but a single hall of an immense palace  --  the Palais des Thermes  --  which once covered the present site of the University . It was the scene of licentious revelings and crime , " latebra scele- /z/ rum , Venerisque accommoda furtis , " afterwards of the theological disputes of the Sorborme , and now of the quiet lectures of the University ; and Virgin Maries are now made out of the old Venuses . I am a goose of an antiquary , all I could see was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ; but my companion was very different . She had a taste for putting her nose in every musty corner , and cracking off pieces of a bath , and the Roman mortar , of which posterity has lost the secret , to put in her cabinet . She has overrun all Europe , and has now got , she says , near a ton of antiquities . She has a stone from Kenilworth , and a birch from Virgil 's tomb , plenty of mosaics from the Coliseum , and of  --  auld nick-nackets , " from Stirling castle . She has promised me a leaf from Tasso 's lemon tree , and one from Rousseau 's rose bush , also a twig of William Tell 's tree of liberty , and Shakspeare 's mulberry , and a little chip of Doctor Johnson 's cedar at Streatham . And nearly all our traveling Yankee ladies are bringing over a similar collection ; after a while the commonest thing in the world will be a curiosity . Close in this neighborhood is the Hotel de Cluny , to which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sommerand , the proprietor . In this hotel used to lodge Roman generals and emperors , and the first French kings . A suit of seven or eight rooms are crammed with furniture , the remains of the last age ; some of it magnificently decayed ; commodes , chests , boxes , second-hand tootn-brushes , pots de chambre as good as new , and other national relics . Nothing cotemporary enters here ; there was nothing , but the lady who accompanied me , under a hundred years old . First , we /z/ entered the dining-room , and saw a knight in full armor placed by a table ; and the ghost of a mahogany sideboard at the opposite end  --  without date , and there is no knowing whether it was made before or since the flood  - -  with its knives and spoons and earthenware tea-cups of the same antiquity ; next a bed-chamber , hung in gilt leather  --  whose , do you think ? Why Francis the First 's , with all the implements thereunto belonging . An entire suit of steel armor , cap-a-pie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight 's , which had gained victories in jousts and tournaments ; also an old coat out at the elbows , worn last , 1 presume , by his footman . Every little rag of his is preserved here . Here , too , are girdles and bracelets , caskets , and other valuables " , and a necklace with its pedigree labeled on a bit of parchment ; the Belle Feroniere 's , I suppose . Here is the very glass he looked into , with a Venus holding a garland in front , and a cross and altar behind , by way of symmetry ; and here are the very spurs ( I held them in my hand ) which he wore at Pavia ; finally , the very bed , the very sheets his Majesty slept in . This bed was hawked about all Paris in the Revolution  --  Mrs. Griggou had twins on it  --  at last it was sold at auction in the public streets , a dix francs settlement , and was knocked down to Monsieur Sommerand  - -  bed , comfortable , and the little pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified with this collection , which is certainly unique in the world ; and you are not hurried through by a Cicerone , but by the complaisance of M. Sommerand , you can rummage and ransack things at your leisure . In the other rooms are vases and caskets , and precious cabinets , a spinette of Marie de Medicis , and other furniture of noble dames ; one gets tired looking at their trinkets ; and in other /q/ iroDms ate castings , and inlayings , and carvings , and so forth . I now took madam under my arm , and descending through one of the thousand and eighty streets of Paris into the Rue de VEcole Medecine , deposited her at her home . You should never pass into this street without stopping awhile to contemplate a very memorable dwelling in it  --  that in which Charlotte Corday assassinated Marat . One owes to this generous maid and disinterested martyr to humanity , a tribute in approaching its threshold . The house is also otherwise remarkable . Danton used to call here of a morning from the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm in arm to the Convention ; and Collet d'Herbois , the actor  --  what memorable names ! and Chabot the Capuchin , Legendre the butcher , Chaumette the Atheist , and St. Just and Robespierre  --  used to hold here their nightly councils . It would puz2le Beelzebub to get up such another club . Under the outer doorway are remaining the letters * * or D * * , a part of the inscription effaced , " Liberty , Indivisibility , or Death ! " I now dined and traversed leisurely the Place du Panthion homewards , passing through the Rue de V Estrapade into the Rue des Posies , once famous for its convents . This is to a pious man , and one who lives a little back into the past , a holy region ; it is consecrated by religious recollections beyond all the other spots of Paris . Here , in this single " Rue des Posies , " was the old " Convent des Dames de St. Jlugustin "  --  " des Dames St. Thomas , "  --  " des Dames Ursulines , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " de V Adoration Perpetuelle , "  --   --  du St. Sacrament . "  --  Alas ! how many pretty women , born to fulfil a better destiny , mewed up vol . I.  --  19 /z/ in perpetual youth , within those dismal cloisters ! Here , too , were the convents of the " Filles de / ' Immaculie Conception "  --  de la St. Providence " and finally ,  --  les Filles de Bonne VolontL " It is the very region of repentant lovers , of heart-sick maids , and of all the friars and holy nuns of the romances . Towards the close of a summer 's evening , one 's fancy sees nothing here but visions and spectres . You will descend , in spite of your reason , with Madam Radcliff , into the subterranean chambers of the convent , and into the solitary prisons , where you will see poor Ellena and her iron table , her dead lantern , her black bread , her cruche of water , and her crucifix ; and you will see the wretch Schedoni bare the bosom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is his own miniature !  --  his own daughter ! And then you will walk through the long row of silent monks , and smoky tapers in the funeral of a broken-hearted sister , the sullen bell of the chapel giving news that a soul has fled . The evening was still and solemn ; and the sun just descending on your side of the globe ; and lured by the novelty of the place , I traveled slowly onwards through a narrow lane to the Faubourg St. Marceau . This street is different from all that I had seen in Paris ; it is perhaps different from anything that is to be seen upon the earth . The houses are so immensely high that not a ray even in the brightest mid-day reaches the pavement , which is covered with a slimy mud . The darkened and grated windows give to the houses the look of so many prisons . A chilling damp , and horrid gloom invest you around ; you feel stifled for want of air . Now and then the whine of a dog , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes a Sister of
