txt The writer was invited one morning during the session of Congress in September , 1837 , by a friend , to accompany him to the Senate chamber . The Vice President had not yet taken the Chair . A large number of the members , however , had assembled , some of whom were busily employed at their desks-others were look .. ing leisurely over the newspapers  --  and others again were collected into groups , and engaged in familiar conversation . The attention of the writer was soon attracted to an individual rather retiring in his manner-plainly but neatly dressed-of a stout muscular frame-whose countenance , as he spoke to those about him , was lighted up with a peculiarly pleasing and sunshiny smile . His open and serene forehead , and gentle but penetrating blue eye , seemed to mark their possessor as no ordinary man . On inquiring the name of this person , the reply was , " That is no other than Mr. Wright , of New York . " Having read the speeches of this gentleman , when at our home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never having seen him before , we therefore scanned him the more narrowly . His features , when at rest , shadowed forth a mind full of benignity and power-that was rent by no stormy passions-that cherished no embittered or permanent feeling of enmity towards any living mortal  --  and that looked at all times and under all circumstances on the bright side of the picture of human life . It was readily evident , even to the casual observer , that Mr. Wright was on the best footing of personal relations with his political opponents as well as his political friends . Silas Wright , Jr . was born in the town of Amherst , Massachusetts , on the 24th of May , 1795 . Both his parents were natives of the county of Hampshire . They had nine children-five sons and four daughters-two of whom died in infancy ; the rest , together with the father and mother , are now living . The elder Mr. Wright was by trade a tanner , currier , and shoemaker ; which occupation he followed until March , 1796 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county , Vermont , where he purchased a farm , and where he has ever since devoted himself exclusively to its cultivation . All the family , except Silas and his youngest sister , still reside in Vermont . The brothers , one only // of whom is a graduate of a college , are all likewise farmers . The sisters married farmers , and one of them , a widow , now carries on a farm with the assistance of her sons ; so that the whole family may most emphatically be regarded as the children of the ploughthan which we know no more honorable designation that wealth or rank could bestow . Mr. Wright , the father , was indentured as an apprentice to his tra ( e at an early age , and never*was at school a day in his life . When he had " served out his time , " he could neither read nor write ; but with the assistance of his fellow journeymen , he soon qualified himself both to read and to write , as well as to keep accounts and transact business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became his instructress  --  a service which she performed with all a woman 's devotion and alacrity , and with a success proportionate to her own interest in the labor of love , and to the willing docility of her pupil . Silas , like most of the rising youth of New England , attended the common schools in winter , and worked on the farm in summer , until he had passed his fourteenth year , when he was placed at an academy , that he might be prepared to enter college . The father perceived that his son was rarely endowed by nature , and was therefore the more anxious that he should enjoy the benefits of education denied by circumstances to himself . The tradition is , that he always regarded him with peculiar pride and delight , as destined to be the chief hope and ornament of the family . In August , 1811 , Mr. Wright became a student of the college at Middlebury , Vermont , where he remained until the summer of 1815 , when he received his first degree of Bachelor of Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determined Democrat . He became such during the first contest for the Presidency , in 1796 , between Adams and Jefferson . On that occasion he supported the latter zealously , and has ever since cherished for his name and principles a veneration which time has rather increased than diminished . Even now he is a warm and active politician , within the limited sphere in which he moves . Between 1800 and 1810 , he was repeatedly elected a member of the Legislature , and has ever been an ardent and firm Republican . He and his oldest son were in the battle of Plattsburg , under Macomb , in September , 1814 , when the British fleet was captured on Lake Champlain , by McDonough , and Sir George Prevost with his forces defeated and driven back into Canada . The husbands of two sisters of Mr. Wright were also in that battle as volunteers from the " Green Mountains , " although the Federal Governor of Vermont , following the treacherous and cowardly example of Governors Strong of Massachusetts , Jones of Rhode Island , and Griswokl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single man to defend the invaded territory and habita .. tions of an adjoining State ,  --  on the unworthy position that the militia could not be required to pass beyond the boundary lines of those States of which they were citizens . During the four years passed by Mr. Wright in college , the number of the class to which he belonged averaged about thirty . Then , as now , every student was a *olitician , and called himself either a Federalist or Democrat . 0 the latter there were in this class only four , of whom it will readily be conceived that young Wright was one of the most ardent . His politics were never better known than at this period of his life . In October , 1815 , he commenced the study of the law with Mr. Martindale , who resided at Sandy Hill , Washington county , New York , where he remained about eighteen months ; when he removed to the office of Roger Skinner , Esq. , which presented superior opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the details of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States for the northern district of that State . In January , 1819 , Mr. Wright completed his preparatory legal studies , and was licensed to practice as an attorney of the Supreme Court of New York . His health being impaired by intense application to his books and at his desk , he spent the ensuing summer in travelling on horseback for its restoration , and with the view of selecting a place where he might settle himself permanently . In October , 1819 , he removed to Canton , in the county of St. Lawrence , and opened an office . The village was new , and the business in the courts both limited and unprofitable , so that the young lawyer made but little by his practice . His father was able to advance him only two hundred dollars to " start with , " with one half of which he purchased a few books , while the other half served for a time to assist him to meet his immediate necessities . We can easily imagine how forlorn must have been the situation of young Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any relatives or friends near him , and surrounded by strangers  --  and when he saw that he must rely solely on his own efforts and merits to sustain himself . Yet we do not doubt , could the truth be known , that in this trying crisis he found precious consolation in the conviction that he must rise by the force of his abilities to distinction . It is this early suffering and training that prepare men of great talents to make their way good up the steep and rugged ascents of fame . Finding that his small means were rapidly wasting away , Mr. Wright consented to accept the office of village postmaster , the emoluments being equal perhaps to one or two dollars a week . Here he had full opportunity to manifest that naturally kind and obliging disposition , of which , wherever his subsequent course of // life has led him7 he appears to have equally every where left the most pleasing impression . After some time Mr. Wright was appointed the captain of a militia company ; and the memory of the village chroniclers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most indulgent and popular of militia captains , and that " the boys " soon became warmly attached to l*iim . The next public office which he held was that of a justice of i4ie peace , the duties of which he discharged entirely to the satisfaction of the people , and thereby extended his acquaintance with them . He was not long afterwards commissioned as the Surrogate of the county of St. Lawrence , a situation rather more important and profitable than those which he had previously held . But the public soon appreciated justly the abilities7 studious habits , attainments and integrity of the young barrister . In the fall of the year 1823 , without the slightest expectation of such an event on his part , Mr. Wright was nominated by his Democratic friends as a candidate for the office of Senator in the State Legislature . There was an overwhelming Federal majority in the eounty of St. Lawrcnce when Mr. Wright first settled in it ; yet he had taken especial care to express , in the most public manner , his devotion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the term of four years , and took his seat on the first Tuesday of January , 1824 . During this winter the contest for the Presidency was waged in New York , as well as in other States of the Union , with the utmost violence . It resulted in the election of Mr. John 44 . Adams by the House of Representatives , in February , 1825 . The individuals voted for were Crawford , Jackson , Adams , and Clay . A caucus , composed of a portion of the membcrs of Congress , had been held at Washington , which had nominated Mr. Crawford as the candidate of the old Republican party . At one time Mr. Calhoun 's claims had been earnestly pressed in Pennsylvania , by many leading politicians who were devoted to his interests , but the great mass of the people there had espoused the cause of General Jackson . The friends of Jackson , Clay and Adams had refused peremptorily to submit their claims to the arbitrament of a caucus , which caused the division , distraction and defeat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to the principles of his party , advocated Mr. Crawford 's election . In order to defeat this wise , honest and fearless man , in New York and the contiguous States , a large number of politicians exhausted all their ingenuity and skill , secretly and assiduously , in exciting prejudices against the South . Appeals were made in behalf of Mr. Adams to the pride of the people , and it was urged // that all the other candidates were southern men . By these means large numbers were decoyed from the Democratic into the Federal ranks . From thc time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution , up to the period of which we are now speaking , the electors of Presi* dent and Vice President in the State of New York had been chosen by the Legislatnre . The Federal party which supported Mr. Adams , having ascertained that the R4nblicans had elected a large majority of their friends to the Legislature , in order that they might have another chance , raised the cry that the electors ought to be chosen by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few , aided in this movement . As matters then stood , it was certain that Mr. Crawford would receive the undivided vote of the state . The conductors of the Federal presses joined in with this cry , and every where proclaimed that those members of the Assembly who should refuse to repeal the law which had been so long in force , without complaint from any quarter , were enemies to liberty , to the Constitution , and to the rights of the sovereign people ! It was insisted by the Republicans that there was much danger that the election of the President might be referred to the House of Representatives-that there bargain , intrigue , and management might be practised-that so great a State as New York should neither divide her vote in the electoral college , and thereby impair her strength , nor aid in any way in taking the election to a body where her political weight could not be an atom greater than that of Rhode Island or Delaware . But the timid in the more popular branch of the Legislature became alarmed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . A bill was passed in the lower House , giving the choice of Presidential electors to the people , which was thrown upon the Senate for its action . This body contains thirty-two members , of which seventeen were a bare majority . Every member , except one , was a Democrat on paper , and had been returned as such ; and yet , when this bill was called up for discussion , only seventeen had the courage to oppose it , and denounce the views and schemes of those who had concocted and passed it . They stood to their posts unterrified , and rejected the bill . Immediately , every where throughout the State , they were assailed by the Federal opposition , and branded as " usurpers and tyrants " - as the " infamous seventeen " - as the " immortally infamous seventeen ; " and so great was the height to which the popular fury was excited by the assiduous arts of the agitators , that they were burned and hanged in effigy in many parts of the country . At the general election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The candidate of the Opposition for the Executive chair received a majority of seventeen thousand votes . General // James Talimadge , who had belonged to , and been a leader in , the Republican ranks , went over to the enemy . He was elected Lieutenant-Governor by a majority of thirty-four thousand . A large number of the seventeen remained in the Senate during the session of 1825 . The " victors " quarrelled , and fell into dis. - traction . In this condition of affairs , these seventeen exercised a controlling power over the acts of the Legislature . A vacancy was about to occur in the Senate*of the United States . An individual who had belonged to the Democratic party , but who had deserted and gone over to the Federalists , was presented to th' Senate , a majority of whom declared that they would not vote for this individual , nor would they accept of his nomination .. The House refused to ( lesignate any one else , and there was , precisely as has been again recently witnessed , no election . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust will again be witnessed-carried the State , and one of their friends was chosen the Senator . It was at this election that Mr. Wright was nominated to repre* sent the district in which he resided , in the Congress of the United States . He had acquired a high reputation for ability and independence in the dischartre of his official duty . This was the first occasion on which any one of the seventeen had come before the people , since the memorable events already detailed had occurred The contest was bitter heyond all former example , yet Mr. Wright beat his competitor by five hundred votes . In December , 1827 , he took his seat . This was the year before the second contest between Jackson and Adams . The Republican party in New York had rallied , and espoused the cause of the former . At the election of 1828 , Mr. Wright was again a candidate for Congress , in what was called a double district ; and notwithstanding that there was much foul play and treachery practised against him , he was successful His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to contend for his seat before the House of Representatives , where a decision was made in his favor . Early in February , 1829 , whilst Mr. Wright was employed in the discharge of his duties at Washington , he received from the Legislature of New York the appointment of Comptroller , . whose setvices , with regard to the financial affairs of that State , correspond precisely with those of the Secretary of the Treasury , with regard to the financial concerns of the Union . This office is held for three years . Mr. Wright served out his first term to the entire satisfaction of the public , and was re-elected in 1832 . In this year , William L. Marcy , who was a Senator in Congress from New York . was chosen Governor , and was sworn into office on the first day of January , 1833 . Mr. Wright was elected to succeed him , and forthwith took his seat . His first term expired on the third . of // March , 1837 , but on the first Tuesday o.f the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Opportunity to display his eminent abilities was all that Mr. Wright required to secure his rapid advancement . Within twelve years the " village justice " had become one of the Representatives of the sovereignty , of the " Empire State , " containing nearly two millions of people . In October , 1833 , occurred the famous removal of the deposits . Th* Opposition , who held the majority in the Senate , determined to attack this bold measure there , and to pass a direct and disgraceful censure upon the Executive . It is unnecessary here to advert to the extensive preparations that were made to render this premeditated assault fatal to the Administra .. tion ,  --  the history of that stormy and eventful period being doubtless still fresh in the memory of most of our readers . When Congress assembled in December , the galleries of the Senate chamber were enlarged , that a greater number of the crowd might find admission . The leaders in that body declaimed loudly , and were even cheered by the clamorous plaudits of the auditors . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution , " bloodless as yet ; " and another , who addressed a multitude that had assembled in a neighbouring city to welcome his arrival on the Sabbath day , declared that " in times of revolution there were no Sabbaths . " Committees , comprehending large numbers , were raised in the cities , and deputed to wait on the President and demand the restoration of the public monies to the custody of the Bank . The parent institution , as well as some of its branches , made heavy and rapid curtailments of their discounts . Efforts were used to spread the panic from the towns into the country , and amongst all classes , as if the existence and prosperity of a great people depended upon the will and policy of a single corporation . Those who were assodated in this conspiracy predicted universal ruin , and distributed in every direction inflammatory and abusive publications against the Administration . Those men , however , who viewed these scenes through the medium of an unclouded reason , thought that if an institution chartered by Congress could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no national debt-no calamity resting upon the country - cause such deep and extensive excitement , it must be clothed with a power which would under different circumstances be dangerous to the liberties of the people , and enable it to become in effect the government . Week after week rolled away , and the orators poured forth their thundering philippics , and essayed innumerable arts to drive the Executive  --  a man distinguished above any other man of the nation for the fixedness of his purposes and the intensity of his will-'from the bold and perilous position which he had assumed . // It was at this point of this remarkable discussion that it became the duty of Mr. Wright , Mr. Forsyth and others , to repel the charges which had been thus preferred against the administration which they supported , and to defend the course which had been pursued towards the Bank . This was the first occasion on which Mr. Wright had enjoyed an opportunity to act a distinguished part in the deliberations of the Senate , since he had become a member of it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his friends . There is in all the movements of Mr. Wright an air of quietness and resolution , of modesty and mildness , which is generally found in a public speaker who feels an unshaken confidence in his intellectual strength and in the justice of his cause . When he rose , the Opposition became profoundly attentive , because they knew that he possessed the entire confidence of the Executive , and therefore that whatever revelations he might make were to be regarded as authentic and conclusive . It was evident , in a few moments after he had risen , that he had prepared himself fully , and that he would be able to present the truth with simplicity-without hesitation or the least affectation . During the two hours that he occupied the floor , he invoked the aid of no rhetorical figures , nor was there in a single sentence that fell from him the slightest tinge of passion or prejudice , or embittered feeling . Whilst his adversaries had spoken to the throng within and without the Senate , the young Senator spoke to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to observe with what coolness , energy and effect , combined with the most unruffled courtesy , the orator dispelled , one after another , the delusions under which the Opposition had been laboring ; and when he at last announced that the Executive was content to appeal from any sentence which they might pronounce , back to the people from whom he and they alike derived their respective powers , the effect was wholly irresistible . It forewarned the Federal members , and truly too , that the tempestuous passions of the Senate chamber would soon be quelled by the solemn judgments of their constituents . Mr. Wright passed through this memorable contest as became one of his rare gifts . Even his opponents confessed with admiration the skill and ingenuity of the speaker 's logic , and placed him at once in the very front rank of the friends of the Administration , side by side with the best and foremost ; while many have been accustomed to assign him the first place , as the Administration " leader " in the Senate , for weight , soundness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased  --  the people in the towns returned to their usual avocations , and those in the country to their ploug*hs . And now , when we can look calmly on the transactions of that period , we are astonished that the leaders of the Opposition should have committed such gross errors in judgment , and em // 1839 . Silas Wright , Jr . barked in a controversy which they ought to have foreseen , from the nature of the principles involved in it , to be so utterly hopeless . It will be asked if Mr. Wright is an orator . In the common sense of the term , he is not . We have never known him excited beyond his usual level of cool equanimity . He never ( leclaitns , he never addresses the passions , nor attempts to charm the imagination with the figures or eml*tellishments of rhetoric . His voice is not melodious , though afte* listening to it for a short time it becomes not unpleasing . His enunciation is slow , but distinct and fluent . The same accurate logical precision characterizes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most perfectly calm , methodical and logical speaker that we have ever listened to . his opinions are habitually marked by moderation-by a constant regard to the results of actual experience , as well as the dictates of an enlarged reason-by a fixed determination to be practical , at the same time that he is giving scope to the broadest general views . In his speeches there is nothing of the never-ceasing labors of Benton : nothing of the abstractions  --  the rapid and grand generalizationthe intellectual exuberance  --  the eagerness and fiery breath , of Calhoun ; nothing of the silver tones , the splendid amplification , of Clay ; nor the rapid thoughts , the wit and pleasantry , of Crittenden . The eloquence of Mr. Wright bears the stamp of deep reflection , of firm counsels ; and over every sentence which he utters there breathes a profound knowledge of the principles which he maintains . He states the question to be examined , as well as the positions which he assumes , with a clearness and force which gain the admiration of his adversaries ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillerist , who covers himself by a parapet or a case-mate when he is about to demolish the fortress of the enemy . Mr. Wright is now , and has been for several of the last sessions of Congress , at the head of the Committee of Finance of the Senate ; and never did any man discharge the duties of that elevated position with more indefatigable industry or greater ability . It may gratify the curious to know the pursuits of Mr Wright , when at his own home and fireside . The writer is able to speak on this subject from the best authority . An officer of the highest command in our army , on being asked by the writer if he had seen Mr. Wright whilst on the northern frontier during the last summer and autumn , replied in the following short narrative : - " I had occasion to visit Canton in October , and as soon as I arrived I enquired for the residence of Mr. Wright . I was directed to a small neat cottage , whither I made my way ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wheeling a wheelbarrow along one of the walks of a very large garden which was attached to the house . As I came near , I discovered that the laborer was my friend // Wright . Lie received me with great cordiality ; said that his gar den was cultivated mainly by his own hands , and that he was putting away his winter vegetables , and preparing to depart for Washington towards the last of the coming month . He Curther said , with the greatest apparent satisfaction , that he had recently purchased a farm , and intended to extend his agricultural operations . He was asked how large the farm was th*at he had purchased ,  --  to which he said , twenty acres ! - that eithe* from natural inclination , or the effect of early habits , he was much devoted to the pure and simple pursuits and pleasures of the country . " Mr. Wright is hardly as yet in the flower of his age . From the foregoing details , it is more than probable that he has reached in the Senate only another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
