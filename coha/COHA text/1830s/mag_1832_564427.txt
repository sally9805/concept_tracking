txt No species of composition is more attractive or more useful than contemporary biography . The account of the lives and fortunes of the eminent men , who are acting their part in our presence , upon the great stage of life , possesses that peculiar interest , which the hearing of the ear and the seeing of the eye impart to every thing within their reach . We , ourselves , from personal observation , know something of the men . We have seen them , we have heard them , we have acted with them . What we know of them , of our own knowledge , produces a conception of their characters , which is the work of our own minds ; and we feel a pleasure in carrying on and adorning this , our own work , with the additional facts and illustrations , furnished to us by the biographer , and relating to matters before unknown to us . Where all our information of a character is derived from history , ( as in the case of all who have gone before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge resolves itself merely into this , that somebody did something . For instance , all we know of Julius C*esar is reduced to facts like these , that a certain Roman , who conquered Gaul and invaded Britain , &amp;c. defeated Pompey and overthrew the republic ; and this , in the end , amounts to saying , that the conqueror of Pompey defeated Pompey ; and , finally , that somebody did something . The case is different with contemporary biography . There our own senses furnish us a basis of actual knowledge . The personal identity of the man is certified to us , by their testimony ; and , if he is our fellow-citizen , our townsman , our neighbor , so much the more full is the stock of personal observations , which we shall have made with respect to him ; so much the more of that which constitutes the image of him in our minds will be the work of our own perception ; and so much the greater relish shall we have for every new , important , and curious fact , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vov. mim. // In this way , in the biographies of our contemporaries , what we know of them , by our own observation , and what we le* rn of them , ( which was before uniulown , ) from written accounts , mutually illustrate cad other . The narrative of the rise and formation of a distinguished character , us up , explains , and gives historical unity to what we have witncssed ourselves ; and personal acquaintance , on the other hand , imparts a charm to the most trifling details of earlier life . There is , nevertheless , an embarrassment attending contemporary biography , which sometimes narrows its province . Delicacy forbids us to speak too freely of those , with whom we live and associate . The sanctuary of private life is not to be invaded , even by the voice of friendship arid praise . Neither is it proper , in reference even to public acts and merits , to give the full measure of deserved applause to contemporary worth . Unsparing panegyric seems to transg ess almost a. decidedly , ( although in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy , which men , living together , owe to each other . As there are kind things , which you would not say of a man to his face , there are others , which you would not xvrite of him , till that event has taken place which not only authorizes but requires the survivors to give free utterance to the voice of deserved eulogy . We make these observations , as an apology for some of the imperfections of the following brief account of our disinguished fellowcitizen , JOSEPH STORY , Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of the United States ,  --  one of those sons of New-England , whose reputation and character have long since become a part of the public treasure of his native land . JOSEPH STORY was born in the year 1179 , in the town of Marblehead , in this state . His father , Elisha Story , *n eminent physician , wa a native of Boston , a pupil at Master Lovell 's school , and subsequently a student of medicine under Dr. Sprague , of Boston . Although th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Admiralty , his son took the side of liberty , in the great struggle of the day , and was on of the Mohawks , who destroyed the Tea . He engaged in the publi service , as a surgeon , in the revolutionary war , and went through the memorable campaign in the Jersies , in the army commanded by Geir . Washington . After retiring from the service he established himself in Marblehead , where he continued , in a very extensive circle of practice , for the remainder of his life . Without the advantage of a college education , he rose to great consideration in his professioni* He was a man ot excellent character and feeling , greatly beloved for his domestic and social virtues , and the object of the highest attachment and veneration of his children . lie died in 1805 . He was twice married , and the subject of the present Memoir was the oldest child of the second marriage . His early education was obtained exclusively in his native town of Marblehead , and at a period in which schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were greatly beneath their present standard of excellence . Marblehead was , at that time , ( though , as now , the residence of many most estimable and intelligent persons , ) con * It is probable that , in one branch of his profession , his practice was more extensive , than that of any other individual of the faculty , for the same period of time . In the eonrse of twenty-eight years , he was present at the birth of frur thousaod two hundred children , an average of on modred and fifty ach year // siderably more out of the circle of active intercourse with the rest of the world , than it is at the present day . It was rarely visited by strangers , and enjoyed even the advantages of the mail , but once or twice a week . The Marblehead Academy was then under the superintendence of the Rev. Dr. Harris , afterwards President of Columbia College , JNew-York . In this academy , and principally under the care of Mr. Michael Walsh , an usher in the institution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story received his school education . He entered the University , at Cambridge , in 179 , ayear in *dvance , and , consequently , took his first degree in 1793 . At college , a new field in the intellectual world was opened b fore him . He developed untiring ardor of acquisition , and an inexti iguishable love of learning ; bringing to the successive branches of literature and science the united force of first-rate talent and unsurpassed industry . He was a classmate of the Rev. Dr. Channing , and , like him , took rank among the most distinguished of their academic associates . In the joyous season of youth , like almost all persons of warm feelings and lively imaginations , he was a votary of the muse , and was called upon for poetical performances , at seveial of the public exhibitions of the University . A year or two later , he published a poetical work , of considerable compass , under the name of The Power of Solitude ; the effusion of a youthful fancy , surveying , as yet , in vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mo e congenial world of imagination , feeling , and thought . his early partiality for poetry adds another , to points of resemblance , of much greater moment , between his favorite tastes and those of his illustrious associate , the venerable Chief Justice of the United States . lie , too , from the earliest youth , was an enthusiastic admirer - of the divine art ; and one may s* fely venture the conjecture , that as sweet an Ovid was lost in Marshall or in Story , as in Murray . On leaving college L 1793 , young Story made choice of the profession of the law , and commenced its study in the office of the late Chief Justice Samuel Sexvall , of Marblehead . On his appointment to the bench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , his pupil transferred himself to Salem , and completed his legal studies , under the present Judge Putnam , of that place . He was admitted to the bar , in Essex county , in July , 1801 . This , as our readers well know , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff rson 's election had t*ken place , at the preceding session of Congress , and the country vas agitated in every quarter , by the excitements of the contest . No where was this excitement *reatc* , ( probably no where so great , ) as in the county of Essex ; and , at the time of his admission to the bar , Mr. Story was the only lawyer within its pale , known or suspected to be a democ* at . This position was , no doubt , attended with difficulties and discouragem ents ; for no despotism equals that of an organized party . But he brought to his profession qualifications , before which no obstacle can long stand-talent , industry , enthusiasm , and an exclusive devotion to his pursuit . Men bestow honors and public trusts on party favorites ; they sound the praises of those who belong to their side they sometimes even try a while to bolster up , with a little worthless l ) atrona*e , which bring : a world of labor and no 1 ) roflt , sonic hopeful // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ,  --  work of their own ,  --  work which comes home to the business and pockets of men ,  --  ( as Lord Bacon and Pope after him meant to say , ) then they are greatly apt to go to the man , who will do their work well . And this man , if he is true to himself , is sure to be found out . Poverty can not keep him out of sight ; thread-bare clothes can not disguise him ; dark staircases and hack garrets are but a temporary hiding-place. the witch-hazel of interest , in the hand of those who need his talent , will point unerringly to his lair ; and then if he walks forth , not bitter and morose at the momentary neglect , but cheerful , conscious , and resolved ,  --  rejoicing , like a giant , to run a race ,  --  the entire interests , passions , and relations of society , become to him one great harvest of business , yellow , and nodding to his sickle . And it is really pleasant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not mean to say , that Mr. Story had any particular obstacles to struggle against , but that of part.y prejudice . This soon yielded to the evidence daily given by him of professional attainments and talent for business . The people in Essex county are tolerably skilful7 in forming a rough guess , as to the way , in which their neighbors pass their time , and do their work ; and clients soon began to frequent Mr. Story 's office , because they always found him there , ready to do their business , and able to do it well . In times like those in question , it was not easy for any one to avoid being swept , by the excitements of the day , into the vortex of politics . In 1805 , Mr. Story was chosen a representative of th town of Salem , in the legislature of the Commonwealth ; and , from that period , till his appointment to the beech of the Supreme Court of the United States , he was annually re-elected . it was a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should stand in the first rank of the political phalanx . To these general qualifications , he added one not necessarily connected with them , and possessed by very few persons , in the s-me degree as by himself . We mean the talent of a vigorous extempore speaker . It is unnecessary to say to a considerable portion of our reade*s , that , in this point , perhaps the most important among the qualifications of a public man , he had few equals , and no superior . It may be added , at this day , without offence , that on his entrance into the legislature , the preponderance of debating talent was on the opposite side ; and Mr. Story was placed , not less by necessity , than by qualification , in the position of a leader ; a position which he supported with distinguished success , during the entire period f his legislative career . The time was one of intense party excitement . It was the period of the restrictive system of Mr. Jefferson . Mr. Story was an ardent and staunch member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , gave those measures his zealous support . In 1808 , on occasion of the resolutions moved by Mr. Gore , ( then at the zenith of his popularity , influence , and power , ) against the embargo , it devolved on Mr. Story , young as he was , to lead and to close the debate , in support of the policy of the administration of the General Government . While this fact sufficiently illustrates the character which he had so promptly acquired to himself , as a politician , it should be remembered to his credit , that he did not . at any period , permit himself to become the slave of // party . his principles were always liberal , and his manner of asserting them , such as self-respect inspires in a high-minded man . He was avowedly a disciple of the Washington school , on all the great questions of national politics . It was the misfortune of the day , that our divisions turned so exclusively on questions connected with the foreign relations of the country . This association gave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they never could have attained in any other way . We believe that few , if any , of the democratic party in New-England , in adhering to the principles of that party , on questions connected with our foreign affairs , allowed themselves to be less entangled than Mr. Story , in the sophistries of the Virginian school . It is not among the least of his titles to the respect and gratitude of the people , that , at all times , and under the most critical circumstances , Mr. Story stood by the law , and gave its institutions his firm , undeviating , and generous support . There were particularly two occasions , during his legislative career in Massachusetts ,  --  fresh in the recollection of those then upon the stage , and , which ought not to be allowed to pass into oblivion ,  --  on which he stood by his principles , on this subject , at a temporary sacrifice of popularity . Let the young man , who is , at any time , tempted , for the sake of momentary favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesson of a purer policy , in the rich reward of public approbation , with which these earlier s*crifices have been indemnified . At the period to which we allude , the Judiciary of the Commonwealth could not boast of great popularity . Permanent salaried officers and boards of officers , can not ever be very popular , in frugal republics . The topic is too tempting for the demagogue , who annually importunes the people , at the hustings , to believe themselves the most enlightened of people , and him the most disinterested of candidates . The judiciary is , perhaps , from the nature of its functions , less likely to be popular , than any other part of the public system . In 1788 , the whole brunt of popular disaffection fell upon the Courts ; and by a very natural association , the Bench is , at all times , obliged to take its full share in the odium , that may exist against the bar and the subordinate ministers of justice . But above all these general causes of unpopularity , we are perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the period in question , permitted itself to be seen too visibly on one side of the political divisions of the day . In this state of things , came on the question of the establishment , on a permanent foundation. , of the salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts . Before the year 1806 , the salaries of the Judges were about twelve hundred dollars per annum , and an annual grant of five or six hundred more was usually made , on their a nual ) etition . The Constitution , it is well known , provides , " that the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court , should hold their offices as long as they behave themselves well ; and that they should have honorable salaries , ascertained and established by standing laws . " With this express provision of the Constitution , an annual grant , to eke out an inadequate salary , was doubly inconsistent . It proved , in the necessity of its passage , that without it , the salary was riot honorable ,  --  that is , adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice Parson*. // then enjoying the most lucrative practice in the Commonwealth , and with a professional income of nine or ten thousand dollars , received his appointment about this time . It was known to his friends , though not to the public , that he had refused to accept the appointment , except on condition , that the salary should be placed upon a constitutional footing , and be made not merely honorable , but permanent . It is unnecessary to say , that at this period , the political influence of Chief Justice Parsons was as well ascertained as his legal eminence , and that the Associate Judges were of the same school of politics . As it would have been impossible to carry any measure of this kind , if taken up on party grounds , ( to say nothing of the pernicious consequences of giving to such questions a party character , ) the friends of the Judiciary , relying upon the liberality and soundness of Mr. Story 's vie *s , placed in his hands the initiative and direction of the proposed measure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed at its head , and reported a bill giving to the Chief Justice twenty-five hundred dollars per annum , and to the Ksociate Judges twenty-four hundred dollars each . A most animated and vehement debate arose , on the passage of the bill . The management of the discussion , by the general consent of the friends of the measure , devolved on Mr. Story . Although , for the reasons stated above , it had to contend with a viole t political prejudice , it was by no means unopposed upon other grounds . A considerable portion of the member s from the interior , federalists as well as democrats , were opposed to the bill . A moment 's consideration of the state of parties , as at that time existing in the Commonwealth , will prove , that under these circumstances , the fate of the measure was in Mr. Story 's hands . It is but bare justice to accord to him the merit of its passage . However wise in itself and however ably supported by its other friends , nothing but the vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the weight of his personal and political influence , would have carried it through . It is unnecessary to say , that this step was attended with a temporary sacrifice of popularity . Chief Justice Parsons was , perhaps , as obnoxious to the democratic party generally , as any individual in the Commonwealth , and peculiarly so to the leading Press of that party , and its principal writer . But Mr. Story 's efforts , in this honorable and patriotic cause , did not stop here . Two or three ye ( rs of experience satisfied Chief Justice Parsons , that , even with the increase which had been made in the salary , the sacrifice , which he had made in coming upon the bench , was not merely one of affluence , but of the competence required for the support of a family ; and he came to the determination to return to the bar , unless a further addition to the salary should be made . The subject was again ( 1809 ) brought forward , under the auspices of Mr. Story , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed at the head of the committee . The bill , however , which was reported , was , we believe , drafted by him ; at any rate , it was matured by his aid , and under his influence . It proposed to give the Chief Justice thirty-five hundred dollars , and the Associate Judges three thousand dollars each per annum . At this period the coniplexion of the General Court was different from what it had been on the former occasion . The repub*ican party was now triumphant in both houses . The Court had not // drown in favor , and many members of either branch were politically opposed to all the Judges , and very willing to starve them out of office . On the other hand , a portion of the federal party , particularly some of those from the interior of the Commonwealth , and all who make a principle of opposing grants of money and increase of salaries , were cold , if not hostile to the measure , and unwilling to lend any aid to its passage . The debate was protracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the column , and bore the brunt of the battle ; and in that position was obliged to take upon his shield , more than one shaft from political friends , somewhat dipped in personality . But the friends of the Judiciary again and almost as by miracle triumphed , and the salaries of the Judges have ever since remained , as then fixed by law . We think it not too much to say , that it is owing to Mr. Story 's efforts , at these two critical periods , that Massachusetts was secured in the possession of such an administration of justice , as she has enjoyed for the last twenty-five years . Few men , if indeed another individual , could have been found , able , if willing , to make the same efforts . It is highly gratifying to reflect , that whatever temporary sacrifice of favor was involved in them , has long since been overbalanced by the well-merited trust and confideiice , which are sure to be earned , by a bold and upright adherence to principle , however ungracious at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Story , hile a member of the General Court , was another intimately connected , though in a different way , with the legal institutions of the State , viz : the introduction of an Equity jurisdiction and of a separate Court of Chancery , in the Commonwealth . A committee was raised on this subject , in 1808 , on his motion , and the well-digested , learned , and powerful report , which proceeded from that body , was no doubt the production of Mr. Story 's pen . It was printed at the time , and we wish we had it in our power to refer the reader to the volume and page of the legislative documents of the General Court , where it could be found . But no such published series exists for the period when this report was made . The substantial parts of it , however , may be found extracted into a most luminous article on Chancery jurisdiction , in the eleventh volume of the North-American Review , ( page 161 , ) which we shall presently have occasion to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemporary literature of his profession . On the death of the Hon. Jacob Crowninshield , Mr. Story was elected , without opposition , to Congress . He served but for the session , which remained of the term for which he was chosen , and declined a re-election . During this brief parliamentary career , his active participation was confined to two measures , in which New-England felt a peculiar , and , as one may say , an innate interest . He moved for a committee to inquire into the expediency of gradually augmenting the NAvy of the United States . This measure was supported by him , in an elaborate speech , of which , we regret to say , that we find no report in the contemporary newspapers . We can scarce imagine a finer theme , for the parliamentary coup d ' essai of a young New-England statesman ; nor an individual better qualified to treat it with success . Nothing but the historical notoriety of the fact , would , at the present day , gain credence for the statement , that the measure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . It was put down , not after a calm and deliberate examination of the measure , as one deserving thorough consideration , in the peculiar condition of the country ; but it was met by a party rally ; rejected , and thrown out ; not merely as an extravagant and unprofitable suggestion , but as a heresy . on the part of a member of the republican party . What melancholy cases of infatuation the history of parties presents ! Here was the great republican party of the country , comprehending the majority of the people , and pursuing ,  --  as the prominent measure of its policy ,  --  the vindication of the honor and rights of the country , against the greatest maritime power on earth . At a seasonable period in advance of the last appeal to arms ,  --  the inevitable resort to which had become but too apparent ,  --  a prominent member of that party , second to no other in zeal , talent , and patriotism , proposes an inquiry into the expediency of strengthening the Navy of the country ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself viewed with jealousy as a partizan of doubtful fidelity ! To make the mortifying lesson complete , we must give yet a glance backward , and another forward . The construction of two or three frigates , and a few smaller vessels , under the first administrations of the General Go*vernment , was by no means among the least prominent topics of denunciation against those administrations . No one , who has not read.the documents , can form an idea of the jealousy , with which every bolt was watched , that was driven into the Constitution and the President ; and if party could have had its way , every bolt would have been drawn out and sold for old copper . Even as it was , so intense was the clamor , that President Adams , before the close of his administration , in 1801 ,  --  although a Navy was stamped as deeply on his heart , as the city of Calais was on Queen Mary 's ,  --  recommended the sale of the smaller vessels in the public service . In 1809 , the time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wanted . A proposition , to put it on a footing for the approaching crisis , made by a distinguished republican , is rejected , because a Navy was a federal measure . War at length is declared by the republican party , and , for a long time , the country is indebted for all its glory to the achievements of the few frigates , which had escaped the hammer in 1801 , and the construction of which was one of the highest of federal misdemeanors . It was the good fortune , or to he more just , the good sense of Mr. Story , in his short congressional career , to emancipate himself on this subject from the trammels of party , not less signally than he had done in the Legislature of Massachusetts , where he lent his aid , against the strong current of political prejudice , to establish the judiciary of the state upon a firm and permanent foundation . The other measure , in which Mr. Story interested himself , during the session of Congress for which he was a member , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents of all parties had greatly at heart , and relied on their representative to use his best efforts to effect . It is apparent from the printed letters of Mr. Jefferson , as it had indeed been admitted before , that this great measure was designed by him , not as preparatory to war , but as a standing permanent policy of coercion toward Great-Britain . Regarded in that light , it was of course not only destructive of the interests , in which three quarters of the // capital of New-England and New-York , at that time were involved , but was undoubtedly a violation of the Constitution . These opinions may now be the more fearlessly expressed , as they are frequently advanced by some of those , who were at the time , the most strenuous champions of the * ) olicy of the Administration . Mr. Jefferson , in a letter contained in his printed works , * in terms intended by himself as opprobrious , alludes to Mr. Story 's connexion with the repeal of the embargo , in a manner , which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Federalists , " says he in a letter to General Dearborn , " during their short-lived ascendancy , have , nevertheless , by forcing us from the embargo , inflicted a wound on our interests , which can never be cured , and on our affections which will require time to cicatrize . I ascribe all this to one pseudo-republican , Story . He came on , ( in place of Crowninshield , I believe , ) and staid only a few days ; long enough , however , to get complete hold of Bacon , who , giving into his representations , became panic-struck , and communicated his panic to his colleagues , and they to a majority of the sound members of Congress . " It is undoubtedly true , that the repeal of the embargo was effected by the joint efforts of Joseph Story and Ezekiel Bacon , not pseudo-republicans , but staunch and patriotic republicans , determined to rescue their party from the reproach of destroying the country . From the moment they became satisfied , that the embargo was resolved upon , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . The whole strength of the Administration , and of its leading friends , was put forth to divert and deter them from the pursuit of their patriotic course . They perceived in it the ruin of the interests it was designed to protect ; an illimitable growth of fraud , and every species of commercial immorality ; and in the end the total alienation of the affections of the people . They were fortunate in communicating their own just views of this policy to members of Congress , not of New-England , and particularly to those of Pennsylvania , and steps were eventually concerted and taken , which compelled the abandonment of the measure . It did not take place till after Mr. Story had been obliged to leave Washington , by which the responsibility of the course which they had jointly pursued , was more directly devolved upon Mr. Bacon . But the passage we have cited from Mr. Jefferson 's correspondence is sufficient to shew the credit , which he was disposed to ascribe to Mr. Story , as the author of the repeal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was again elected to the state legislature ; and on the convening of that body in January , 1811 , he was called to the speaker 's chair , in the house of representatives . On the organization of the new house , in May 1811 , he was re-elected to the same station . His promptness , decision , and business talent , peculiarly fitted him to preside over the deliberations of a large body ; and enabled him to discharge the duties of the chair , always laborious , and in times of party dissention , arduous and delicate , to the universal acceptance of the House . On his retiring from the station , in consequence of his appointment to the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States , a resolution was moved by his competitor for the chair , Mr. Timothy Bigelow of Medford , " that the thanks of the House be * Vd. iv . page 148 . VOL. iii . // presented to him for his able , faithful , and impartial discharge of the duties of the chair , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1512 . No mean tribute in times like those . In November 1811 , the place of an Associate Judge of the Supreme Judicial Court of the United States , became vacant , by the decease of Judge Cushin* , of Scituate who had filled it from the organization of the government . It was tendered to Mr. Johii Quincy Adams , then in Russia , and by him declined ,  --  whereupon , Mr. Story was appointed to the place . We are not aware that the history of America , or of England , presents another case of a judge called to the highest tribunal of the country , at the age of thirty-two . In most cases , it would have been deetued a hazardous experiment , to take from the front ranks of a political party , a youthful and a zealous champion , and to clothe him with the ermine of the highest judicial tribunal . That President Madison should have done it , in favor of an individual , with whom he had no personal acquaintance , except that which he had formed with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsels of his party , places in. still bolder relief the discrimination of that patriotic chief magistrate . But he knew his man ; and he knew that he was placing upon the bench of the Supreme Court , a mind stored with sound legal learning , trained in a good professional school , endowed with the precious gift of a passionate love of truth , and bent on obtaining it at whatever hazard . Never was a measure more amply justified in the event . On his elevation to the bench , Judge Story withdrew himself entirely from the political arena , and with the robes of office put on the chaste reserve of the Judge . Taken from the party , opposed to that to which the Chief Justice and his associates belonged , it is equally to the credit of all the members of this exalted tribunal , that on this , as on every other occasion , their seat of justice has been the unsuspected abode of official harmony , impartiality , and judicial purity . So far from being thrown from his balance , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of his course , Judge Story announced himself , from his entrance vpon his new functions , as a patient , modest , studious , learned magistrate ; seeking the lights of his course in the repositories of the science , and his guide in the constitution and the law . If there were those in the community , ( as there may well have been , ) who had their apprehensions excited by the transfer of the ardent and youthful champion from the arena of party politics , to the bench ; their fears were soon turned into congratulations , at finding the country had gained a new judge of the Washington school . It is not our province , nor within our competence , to discuss the merits of Judge Story 's judicial labors . In this high sphere of duty , he is still before the public , in the full exercise of his powers , and the unblemished discharge of his all-important trust . It is certainly no undeserved tribute to his merit , to say thus much , that in the learning of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior , among the judges of the highest tribunal of his country . And that in all the endowments , befitting this exalted station , he commands the respect of the American people , as a worthy associate , of the great and honored magistrate at its head . // Judge Story came to the Supreme Court of the United States , with tastes and studies , better fitting him than many of the most eminent of his profession , for the duties of its various and comprehensive jurisdiction . He was less exclusively a student of the common law . His classical taste had early led him to the fountains of the Roman jurisprudence , and the comparison of the continental civilians of a later date . These preparatory studies were perhaps less frequently pursued thirty years ago , than they are at the present day . We are informed that when , on some occasion , James Otis had quoted Domat , before Barnard , the latter asked who the author quoLd was ? Otis replied , a very distinguished civilian , and not the less an authority for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so great a stranger to the profession thirty years agQ , as this anecdote would make him to have been in the mid He of the &gt;st century ; but at the period when Judge Story was acquiring his knowledge of the law , Pothier perhaps was as little known in our Courts , as Domat had been fifty years before . But a brighter era was opening on the commercial and admiralty law , both of England and Anv*rica . Sir William Scott was at the zenith of his reputation , elevating many of the ddctrines of public law , which had been scarcely cultivated before in England , to the dignity of science and to the elegance of classical literature , by his happy study of the civilians . Under his auspices , a school of jurisprudence , novel in some of * features , was formed in England arid America ; and we shall not , perhaps , be though to detract from the just reputation of its other disoiples , if we give to Chancellor Kent of New-York and to Judge Story of Massachusetts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of Judge Story have extended over the states of Massachus tts , New-Hampshire , Rhode-Island , and Maine . In each of these states , he holds by law , two terms in the year ; and although the Courts may be lawfully bolden by the District Judge alone we believe Judge Story has never failed in personal attendance unless prevented by sickness . His opinions , delivered in the Circuit Court , are contained in the two volumes of Gallison 's Reports , and the five volumes of Mr. MasGn , the present reporter . If we mistake not , all the opinions in these volumes were delivered by Judge Story . His opinions in the Supreme Court of the United States , are , of course , to be found in the reports of that tribunal , since his accession to the bench , viz , the three last volumes of Cranch , the twelve volumes of Wheaton , and the six of Peters . We are neither competent , nor should we be at liberty , to characterize these opinions en masse , farther than to echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whom , we know , they are held in the most honorable estimation . Th* reputation of Judbe Story in the black-letter learning of his profession , on every topic to which it applies , and in the more recently developed branches of Prize law , Admiralty law , and Commercial law , is too well established in the country , to be advanced by any individual attestation . Not , however , to dwell wholly in generalities , we may safely ref r to the following opinions , as sufficient to form a solid basis for the reputation of a learned , acute , profound , and wise lawyer and judge ; viz. De Lovio vs . Boit , in 2 Gallison R. 398 ; Harvey vs . Richards , 1 Mason R. 381 ; La Jeuiie Eugenie , 2 Mason R. 409 ; Harden vs. // Gordon , 2 Mason R. 541 ; Peele vs. the Merchants ' Insurance Cornpany , 3 Mason R. 27 ; Tyler vs .

In 1820 , in consequence of the separation of Maine from Massachusetts , it was deemed necessary , that a convention of the state should be called , to make the changes in the Constitution , rendered necessary by that event . The occasion was deemed a proper one , for a general revision of the Constitution . The convention , elected for this purpose , was of the highest respectability , and comprised as much of the talent , character , iiftelligence , and worth , of the state , as were ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Story was one of the delegates from Salem , and was among those whose influence was most decisively and beneficially felt in the body . The Judiciary branch of the Constitution was submitted directly to his revision , as chairman *of the committee , to whom that subject was given in trust ; and on all the other important questions , which were considered and debated , his voice was heard with that respect , which belonged equally to his station in the country , his familiarity with all its great interests , the soundness of his principles , and his rare powers of impressing the mind of a deliberative assembly . The reported debates of the Convention contain one admirable specimen of his eloquence ,  --  his speech on the basis of the senatorial representation . It may be observed of this as , we believe , of all the speeches contained in the printed volume of the debates of that Convention , that it is , what it purports to be , a bona fide report of the speech , written out from the stenographer 's notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rare are the men , whose style of debate will stand this test ; and rarer those whose speeches , thus reported , will compare with Judge Story 's . Passages of the speech , to which we have alluded , have already incorporated themselves into the contemporary eloquence of the country , as some of its happiest specimens . Nothing but the conviction , that this , our feeble commemoration , can add nothing to their notoriety , prevents us from citing one or two of the splendid paragraphs of this fine speech . We pay this cordial tribute to its merit , with the greater emphasis , as we are inclined to doubt the soundness and expediency of the plan of senatorial representation , existing in our present Constitution , and defended by Judge Story in this speech , and by others of the most eminent members of the Convention . But this is no place to engage in the controversy . A part of the labors of Judge Story , in this convention , lay in the same field , in which he had , at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , exerted himself with so much advantage to the Commonwealth ,  --  we mean the permanency and respectability of the j*idicial establishment . A motion was made and carried by a large // majority , to give to the legislature authority to diminish , as well as to increase , the salaries of the judges . It is unnecessary to state , that such a principle aimed a fatal blow at the independence of the court . That a principle , expressly proscribed by the Constitution of the United States , for the federal courts , should have found favor , even for the moment , with a body like the Massachusetts Convention , can only be explained , upon the general principles , to which we have alluded , in the earlier part of this Memoir . The proposition , however , was met by such of the friends of the Judiciary , as had their eyes open from the first , to its dangerous tendency ; and by their united , animated , and persevering efforts , the majority of the convention was eventually brought to behold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story , on this subject , does not appear in the volume of the reported debates . The discussion was brought on , unexpectedly , and the speech of the Judge was evidently an effort altogether unpremeditated . We may appeal to the recollection of many who heard it , that it was surpassed by nothing , which fell from him during the session of the Convention , and deserves to be reckoned , for power and efficiency , among the very ablest efforts , that were made in that body . In the year 18528 it was made known to the public , that the Hon. Nathan Dane , of Beverley , had determined , during his life time , to appropriate to the dotation of the law school , in Cambridge University , a portion of the fortune , which he had acquired in a long life , laboriously and honorably devoted to the the practice of the profession . The wisdom and patriotism of this measure were unanimously hailed by the public , as appropriate to the character of this most eminent and amiable citizen , the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North-western territory of the United States was organized . Among the objects , to which his bounty was to be applied , was a professorship of law , and having retained to himself the nomination of the first professor , Mr. Dane did all that could be further done , to enhance the usefulness of his foundation , by naming Judge Story to that place . In his acceptance of this professorship , and in the contemporaneous appointment , by the corporation , of Mr. John Hooker Ashmun , to the other professorship in the law school of the University , a new era in that institution was created . It henceforth held forth advantages to the student at law , which we firmly think it is not too much to say are unequalled at the other institutions of this kind in the county , however respectable they may be . The resort to the school , from all parts of the United States , has justified the sanguine expectations that were entertained at the period of its re*organization. * To this new field of usefulness , Judge Story has brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affluence of his professional learning . On his designation to the office , he removed his residence from Salem to Cambridge , and has devoted himself , in the intervals of his official duties , as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States , to the superintendence of the school in conjunction with Mr. Ashmun ; to an oral and expository course of instruction on the elementary books , which form the prescribed course ; and to the deli * By a recent act of additional munificence , Mr. Dane has cositribnted the fundM for the erection of the New L w College at Cambridge ; a commodions edifice dedicated to the use of e Law School . // very of a written course of lectures upon constitutional law . Three years have scarcely elapsed , since his entrance upon this new course of duty , and while we are writing these paragraphs , we perceive the annunciation of his " Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States , with a preliminary view of the Constitutional history of the Colonies and States , before the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes octavo , " as being already in the press . These commentaries , of course , consist oi the substance of Judge Story 's lectures , delivered in the law *i*ool , on this subject . This course we have not been in a situation to hear ; but what it must have been from such a source , is matter of easy conjecture , not less than of unanimous attestation on the part of those who have enjoyed that privilege . We venture , in anticipation , to pronounce , that in Judge Story 's commentaries , the student of American law will find a chasm in the list of his elementary guides supplied ; the general reader , a lucid and instructive treatise , on that subject which , next to his peculiar professional topics , be they what they will , demands the attention of every cultivated mind ; and the patriot an eloquent and persuasive vindication of those great principles , on which the corner stone of the Union was laid . It could not come before the public , at a more seasonable , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was more wanted to rally the judgements and affections of some portions of our country , to the sacred banner of the Constitution . When we reflect , that it has been the product of three short years , and of the intervals of leisure in the laborious and most exemplary discharge of the duties of the judicial station of its author , we can not but hold him up as a fitting model , to shame the desponding indolence of common minds , and to teach the youthful aspirant to professional renown , how high the standard of excellence has been raised . But we have not even yet exhausted the long catalogue of Judge Story 's professional labors . As early as 1804 , he published his well known large work on Pleadings , which still retains its place in the profession . His work on bailments , appeared at a later period ; and two successive editions of Lord Tenterden 's treatise on shipping , with copious notes , attest his inexhaustible learning and untiring diligence . The collection of the charters and laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superintendence , in conjunction with Mr. Dane and Mr. William Prescott ; and a recent edition of the laws of the United States has enjoyed the benefit of his revision . The volumes of the North-American Review have been enriched , by several most excellent articles , from the pen of Judge Story . The sixteenth number of that journal contains his review of Professor Hoffman 's course of legal study . In the twenty-first number , under the head of Jacobsen 's sea laws , may he found an essay on the history of Commercial law in general ; a beautiful compend of all the learning on this subject . We have already alluded to the article in the twenty-eighth number , which , taking Johnson 's Reports as a text , embraces an admirable discourse upon the subject of Chancery Jurisdiction . This article contains a just and eloquent tribute to the eminent magistrate , who presided so long and with such distinction in the New-York Court of Chancery . The forty-sixth number of the North-American Review , contains an // article by Judge Story , on Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is fresh in the recollection of our professional readers , as another most elaborate and instructive article on the general subject of Commercial law , and particularly that branch of it treated in the work under review . In the fifty-second number will be found a review of Dane 's Abridgement of the American law , presenting , after a learned and luminous history of the former works of the same general character , an analysis and estimate of this stupendous digest . The last contribution of Judge Story , to this department of professional literature , is his article in the fifty-eighth number of the Review , on the public life and services of Chief Justice Marshall ,  --  a precious record , worthy of the author and its subject . Besides these elaborate articles , Judge Story has made many valuable contributions to the law department of the Encyclopmdia Ameri*. cana . Among them may be enumerated , the articles on The Congress of the United States-Contract-Courts of the United States-the American part of the article on Criminal Law-Punishment by Death - Domicil- Equity  --  the American part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second volume of the American Jurist contains Judge Story 's discourse before the Suffolk Bar , delivered in 18S20 . The public has also been favored with his Inaugural Address , delivered on his induction into the Dane Professorship ; and with an address delivered to the Grand Jury , in 18 ' 26 , at Portland , on occasion of the opening of the first Circuit Court held in that place . An Eulogy , on the late Hon. Samuel Dexter , from the same source , is contained in the second volume of Mason 's Reports ; and short biographical sketches of several distinguished law characters , such as William Pinkney , Mr. Justice Washington , Mr. Justice Trimble , and Chief Justice Parker , have appeared in the contemporaneous prints . Among the labors of Judge Story of a political cast , may be mentioned the memorial of the inhabitants of Salem , against the orders in c1ouncil in 1807 , and the memorial of the merchants of Salem , on the subject of the tariff , in lS*20 . In the midst of public and professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judge Story has found time to approve himself an active and useful private citizen ,  --  a promoter of all public spirited objects ,  --  a supporter of good institutions ,  --  and a vigilant guardian of the cause of public improvement . The interests of education have received his particular care , and especially has the University of Cambridge enjoyed the benefit of his participation in its government , He was chosen a member of the corporation in l85*5 , and to his counsels in the directory of the Institution , a fair proportion of its prosperity is to be ascribed . His eloquent discourse , at the anniversary of the Phi Beta Kappa Society , ( over which he presided for several years , ) was published in l8*25 . His Centennial Address at Salem , in 1828 , commemorating the expiration of the two hundredth year from the settlement of the colony of Massachusetts , is among the happiest of the numerous historical discourses , which have appeared of late years . The first volume of the publication , commenced under the patronage of the Society for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Address before the Mechanics ' Institution of that // place . His last publication of a literary character is , ( we believe , ) the Address delivered by him , at the Consecration of the rural Cemetery at Mount Auburn . We can not refrain , in closing the catalogue of the miscellaneous writings of Judge Story , to say , that a more grateful contribution to the stores of American literature , could scarcely be made , than a collection of them into a volume . And here we are compelled by delicacy to stop , where an intimate friend of Judge Story would most willingly begin , the attractions of his social intercourse , and the virtues of his private life . We have sketched his public life and services , it is true , with a friendly pen . We could do it with no other . But when our memoir is read over , we are greatly in error , if the panegyric be not found to resolve itself into a rehearsal of facts . It is the work of a friend . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an eulogy , an enemy can write nothing but a libel . We know not , we believe not , that there exists a man , who could write a libel on such a theme . But if there be , who would wish to read it ? As for an impartial biographer ,  --  a person neither friend nor foe ,  --  for ourselves , we have but little affection for impartial writers ,  --  so called , on any subject . We neither expect , nor wish to see a man , who can hold himself indifferent , in the contemplation of distinguished contemporary merit . We wish to read nothing , written by a person , who can trace an active , honorable , generous and successful course , without kindling with his theme . And , throwing our eyes back over these pages , we regret nothing in them so much as that they are not animated with more of the warm and living enthusiasm , which forms so much of the charm of the character , we have attempted to delineate.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
