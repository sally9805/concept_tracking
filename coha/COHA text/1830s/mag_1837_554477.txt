txt WHEN we last took occasion to discuss a subject having relation to rail-roads , we labored to convince the public , that there were adequate motives for undertaking one of these great works of improvement , between the cities of Boston and Albany . The splendid results , which might be anticipated from such an undertaking , appeared worthy of exciting the efforts of the rich commonwealth of Massachusetts . But we felt then , that we were arguing to the deaf . Projects of this sort were , without ceremony , denounced as visionary ; and those who urged them with any degree of confidence were regarded , by that class of men , who place the highest estimate on their own superior judgment and prudence , not merely with distrust , but literally as persons of unsound mind . There were , it is true , many individuals , who had calmly examined the subject , and who clearly foresaw , that this great improvement was destined to produce a revolution in the habits of society . There were also great numbers , who readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictions which were daily published , of the future success of this improvemeat . But the great mass of sober men , - those who mutually look to one another for lessons of prudence , who filly understand the mystery of making profitable investments , and who lead the counsels of legislative bodies , in all matters relating to public revenue and expenditures , - were as incredulous of any practical benefit to result from the introduction of rail-roads , as they still are of the utility of the aeronautic labors of Mr. Durant or Mr. Lauriat . The futility of the projects which were urged upon them , by those who had taken a different view of these subjects , was so self-evident to their minds , that they deemed all demonstration , argument , or examination altogether superfluous . They boldly shut their minds against conviction , with the intrepidity of men who believe that an appeal to their understandings is but a prelude to an attack upon their pockets . // This prejudice did not prevail with equal force throughout the country . Its influence was strongest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought its way , in opposition to the determined incredulity and apparent hostility of a great majority of that class of men , who , by the share which they hold in the wealth of the country , are most interested in its success , and who , from their general intelligence and foresight , might have been expected to be its earliest patrons . In Massachusetts , particularly , rail-roads have been successfully introduced in spite of the opposition of many who will he most benefited by them , and without the aid of such as alone could have given it without personal sacrifice . It is now proved by actual experience , that these works , when introduced with judgment , may become a source of reasonable profit to those who invest their property in them , and that their influence in promotin0 the public welfare is even more extensive and more striking , than the most sanguine of their advocates had ventured to predict . Throughout the country , there is now no want of confidence in the efficacy of this improvement on the public prosperity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , there is in almost every part of the country , too much ardor in pushing forward projects for these works , without sufficient consideration , and in undertaking enterprises beyond the means which can be brought to their support . The danger is that the country will suffer rather from the undertaking of too many , than too few works of this description . We can not admit , however , that the most ardent have formed an over-estimate of the benefits , which are to result from this new instrument of social and commercial intercourse . It will make a new era in the history of civilization . It multiplies the resources of society , by facilitating the intercourse between distant places , and still more , by enlarging the circle in which the members of the same community may act together with a concentrated effort . The distance by which towns and States are separated , is reduced by it , for all practical purposes , more than one half . The circle , within which the whole population may have a daily or hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the practical effect of this change is to leave to the population , scattered throughout this enlarged area , the advantages of their respective local positions , and to secure to them at the same time all the benefits // of a frequent and easy communication with one another , which before could have been obtained only by means of actual juxtaposition . The city of Boston , for example , possessing within her own limits about eighty thousand souls , is surrounded , within a little more than forty miles , by a population of four hundred thousand persons , engaged in various occupations for which their respective situations are adapted , with the advantages of soil , ample space , water power , and many other privileges , which could he enjoyed by them , only in their respective dispersed places of residence . By means of the four rail-roads stretching towards the four points of the compass , with their respective branches diverging in all directions , the most remote of this population , instead of being distant a day 's jourliey , will he placed within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and many of them within the limits of a single hour . In other words , the advantages of vicinage to the metropolis are extended to twice the distance , and of course embrace four times the area , over which the same advantages extended , before this improvement was known . What will he the ultimate effects of this concentration , it is impossible to foresee ; but it is evident that it will give an impulse to the movements of society , which no other known cause could produce . It having been at length demonstrated , beyond the power of contradiction , hy the actual success of rail-roads already in operation , that they are destined to have an important influence on the welfare of communities , it is natural that each portion of the country should exhibit an eagerness to secure its share in the benefit . All men have discernment enough to perceive , that while the public at large aie about to derive a benefit from the general introduction of this improvement , its most striking advantages are of a local character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the respective improvements . They perceive also , that there must be a limit to the number and extent of these improvements , and that in many cases , to secure the benefit to a particular tract of country , it is necessary to seize the occasion of appropriating it , before it is appropriated by more active competitors in some neighbouring region . The improvement consists in the introduction of new and improved channels for the intercourse of society . When it was first discovered that rivers were not the only channels for this intercourse , the whole country // was open for a new competition . There was a wide field for selection , in the choice of these channels . But when the selection is once made and the ground occupied , it will be obviously much more difficult to change the direction of these channels , or to introduce substitutes for them , than it would have been in the first instance , by a prudent foresight , to have given them a different direction . For this reason , a much greater degree of eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in situations in which the immediate prospects of business seem hardly to justify it , than would otherwise be thought judicious . The great channels of business have been often formed by the mere force of a current , which was produced at first by slight and perhaps accidental causes . Cities continue to grow , not because their situation is intrinsically the most advantageous , but because they have already acquired a certain growth , which of itself contains within it the elements of further increase . The commercial advantages of the city of New York secure to her a decided pre&amp;minence over the other ports of the Union . Her unrivalled inland navigation , - her steamboats stretching their regular and rapid voyages to Albany , to Hartford , to Providence , and even to Charleston , - her lines of packets , to Liverpool , to London , to Havre , and to many other ports , - her canals , extending the line of navigation to Lake Champlain and Lower Canada , to Lakes Ontario and Erie , and to the whole western country , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her citizens , seemed destined to give her , at no remote period , a monopoly of the great foreign trade of the country . The towns of a secondary class , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Boston , and Charleston , were approaching daily the condition of provincial towns , dependent for all the principal operations of commerce on the port of New York . A great l ) art of the domestic trade of Massachusetts had by degrees formed a direct connexion with that city . Canals were dug leading in that direction , from the counties of Hampden , and Hampshire , and even from Worcester , the very centre of the State . Boston , the metropolis formerly of New England , had almost ceased to be the commercial metropolis of her own State . The other cities of the Union were suffering under a similar influence . The whole trade of the country seemed destined to be re // stricted to those channels , which were adapted to either steam or canal navigation . In this state of things , rail-roads were introduced on public routes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident from the first proofs of their efficacy , as a method of travelling , that they were capable of producing a great change in the face of things ; that the currents of traffic and of personal intercourse , instead of passing only through channels where water could be made to flow , might be led across mountains , and through every region enlivened by human industry ; and that the prosperity of cities , instead of depending on the accident of being placed on a navigable stream , which can float its commerce to a vast interior , would hereafter depend upon the foresight and energy of their inhabitants , in forming for themselves the channels of intercourse , and in supplying them with the fruits of their industry . These considerations serve to account for the earnestness of the early friends of rail-roads , in endeavouring to impress on the public mind a conviction of their utility and importance ; and for the eagerness of the public , in undertaking these improvements , as soon as they become convinced of their utility . Under these circumstances it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those* who undertake these works , should far outstrip their ability to carry them into execution ; or that among the many judicious projects , which promise successful results , there should be also many , which are likely to disappoint the expectations of their projectors , and still more which are impracticable and visionary . The volume of M. Poussin , the title of which is placed at the head of this article , consists of a classification and general description of all the rail-roads which are completed , and which are in the process of construction in the United States . Had it embraced also but a brief notice of the rail-roads projected , the volume would have been swollen to a much larger size . On the list of those which are yet but projects , there are many which are destined to form an important part of the system of internal communication in the United States . But those which are completed , with those which are in rapid progress , form an ample subject for an important and interesting work . M. Poussin classifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under two heads ; 1st , those // which form the line of the Atlantic , and 2d , those which lead from places on the Atlantic to the interior . The works of the first of these classes are destined to form , with the addition of a few connecting links of steam navigation , a line of communication from Portland in Maine , to Wilmington in North Carolina , a distance of nine hundred miles . Over eight hundred miles of this distance , viz , from Boston to Wilmington , as soon as the works now commenced shall he completed , the ordinary passage will probably be performed in four days , without night travelling . The works of the second class , some of which are projected on a most magnificent scale , besides a great number of rail-roads leading from towns on the sea-hoard to places in the interior of the same State , or an adjoining State , embrace not less than six or seven lines of communication , from cities on the Atlantic to the navigable waters of the Western States . M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of those portions of these grand lines of communication , which are either finished or are actually commenced . To form an idea , however , of the true character of these works , and of the bearing which they are destined to have on the future prosperity of the country , it is necessary to look at them as parts of the grand system of improvement , to which they respectively belong , and to take notice of some of the parts of the system , which are not yet completed , or even in the actual process of execution . We shall , therefore , take a hasty review of the principal projected systems of improvement , taking care to distinguish those which are completed , and in actual operation , from those which are in progress , and these again , from such as are merely projected . This review , we think , will strike with some surprise those who have not carefully watched the progress of these improvements , and will show , that the country is in the way to he supplied , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication which will rival those of any other country . In New England , the line of the Atlantic will begin at Portland or perhaps at Bangor , and , proceeding near the seacoast , through Saco , Portsmouth , Newburyport , and Salem to Boston , will continue its course through Providence to Stonington , and after crossing Long Island Sound , where it is. twenty-five miles in width , it is proposed to carry it along nearly the whole length of Long Island , through Jamaica to // Brooklyn , near the city of New York . This will constitute the immediate sea-coast line . But there will be others through a great part and perhaps the whole of the distance , a little farther inland , viz , from Portland through Dover , Exeter , and Haverhill to Boston , thence through Worcester to Norwich or New London , and thence by steam navigation to New York ; and also from Boston through Worcester , Springfield , Hartford , and New Haven , by a connected series of rail-roads to New York . Of the series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication , along the coast of the New England States , four are already completed , viz , from Boston to Providence , from Boston to Worcester , from Boston to Andover , including a part of the Lowell rail-road , and from Brooklyn to Jamaica , making an extent of an hundred and twenty miles ; and six others are commenced and in active progress , by organized joint stock companies ; viz , from Providence to Stonington , from Boston to Newburyport , from Andover to Haverhill , from Worcester to Norwich , from Worcester to Springfield , and from Hartford to New Haven , making a farther extent of two hundred and twenty miles . The series will thus far be finished in the course of two or three years , and the other portions of the lines described there is reason to believe will , in great part at least , be completed at no remote period thereafter . When these lines of rail-road are completed , the ordinary passage from Portland to Boston will be performed in about six hours , and that from Boston to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and New York , will present to the traveller a choice among three routes ; one by way of Providence , Stonington , and Long Island , which will give about a hundred and ninety miles of land travel , and twenty-five of steam navigation ; one by way of Worcester , Norwich , and Long Island Sound , which will give a hundred and three miles of land travel , and a hundred and twenty-five of steam navigation ; and the third by way of Worcester , Springfield , and New Haven , with two hundred and twentyfive miles of land and steam , or continued land travel . The difference of time required for the three routes will not be sufficient to give either a decided precedence over the other two , to those who may take an interest in viewing the country passed through . Any one of the routes will reduce the passage // from Boston to New York , to an easy day 's journey , the whole of which may be usually performed by daylight . In proceeding southwardly from New York , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia . The first of these is the Camden and Amboy rail-road , constructed with a double track , and leading from the port of South Amboy , in a southwesterly direction across the State of NexV Jersey , a distance of sixty miles , to Camden , on the easterly banks of the Delaware , opposite to the city of Philadelphia . The passage from New York to Amboy is made by steamboat navigation , a distance of twenty-five miles through an inland passage , which separates Staten Island from the shore of New Jersey . The passage from New York to Philadelphia is made in five and a half hours . The other line is entirely distinct from that just described . It is of about the same length , and leads from the ferry , opposite to the city of New York , through the city of Newark , and the towns of Brunswick and Trenton , directly to the city of Philadelphia . This line consists of three distinct rail-roads united in one line ; one extending from the ferry to New Brunswick , the second from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Philadelphia . The second of these roads is not yet finished ; the other two are in full operation . This route will have the advantage of passing through the principal towns of New Jersey , while the other passes directly through a very barren and desolate region . In continuing the Atlantic line from Philadelphia to Baltimore , there will also soon be a choice of several routes . That which has been hitherto chiefly travelled , is the New Castle and Frenchtown rail-road , which extends only across the peninsula from the Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay , a distance of sixteen miles , and serves as the connecting link of a chain of steamboat navigation , by which the rest of the passage is made , from Philadelphia to Baltimore . The distance by the course of the steamboat from Philadelphia to New Castle is thirty-five miles , and that from Frenchtown to Baltimore nearly double , making the whole distance from Philadelphia to Baltimore a hundred and twenty miles . The time usually occupied in making the passage is from ten to eleven hours , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another distinct route , from Philadelphia to Baltimore , yet // unfinished , but a great part of it nearly ready to be put in operation , consists of three rail-roads ; the first leading from Philadelphia to Wilmington in Delaware ; the second leading from Wilmington by way of Elkton , to the Susquehannab River ; and the third from Port Deposit , on this river , to Baltimore ; the whole distance being one hundred miles . A part of this road , extending from Wilmington to Elkton , a distance of seventeen miles , has been quite recently opened . The work on the other portions of the road is far advanced , and it is anticipated that it will be opened early in the present summer . When the whole is completed , the passage upon it , between the two cities , will be performed in about six hours . Still another route has been projected , pursuing the Columbia road from Philadelphia , a distance of forty-five miles , and diverging thence by a new rail-road from Coatsville , by Oxford , to Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above mentioned . This route is less direct than that last described , and the distance thereon will be a hundred and twenty miles . From Baltimore , the Atlantic line extends to Washington , a distance of thirty-eight miles . This road consists of a double track , and is identical for a distance of eight miles with the Baltimore and Ohio rail-road . It is usually travelled in about two hours and a half . Thus the whole distance from Boston to Washington is travelled , nearly in a direct course , either by rail-road cars or by steam navigation ; and before the end of the present year , it is probable that the whole distance from New York to Washington , may be travelled by railroads , and in the space of fourteen hours . From Washington , the Atlantic line of rail-road extends in a southerly direction , through the State of Virginia . From the city of Washington , the Potomac runs for about forty-five miles , in nearly a direct southerly course , to Potomac Creek . This part of the river is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line no rail-road has yet been commenced . A charter has been granted for a rail-road from the city of Washington , passing through Alexandria to Fredericksburgh , with the right of making a branch to Warrenton . Books have been opened for subscriptions to the stock , but the company is not yet organized . From Fredericksbnrgh to Richmond , the rail-road is already built and in successful operation . It is sixty-one miles in length , and it is traversed // daily by passenger cars , carrying the mail , in something less than four hours . It is proposed to extend this road from Fredericksburgh to Potomac Creek , a distance of seven miles , unless the Fredericksburgh and Washington road is irnmediately prosecuted , in which case the extension will be rendered unnecessary . In proceeding southwardly from Richmond to Petersburg , the rail-road line is not yet completed . A company is formed for the construction of a road , the distance being about twenty miles , and the work is considerably advanced . The want of this part of the line is the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two places , by the circuitous channel of the James and Appomatox rivers . The completion of the rail-road on this part of the route will materially shorten the line of travel . Between Petersburg and the Roanoke , the rail-road is already completed . This was one of the first , and it is one of the finest railroads in the country . It is fifty-nine miles in length , and it forms a channel for the transport of the produce of the rich valley of the Roanoke to a market at Petersburg . It is regularly traversed by locomotive engines , and the mail is daily transported upon it . Besides the route just described , passing through Baltimore , Washington , and Richmond , to the Roanoke , and terminating near the northern border of North Carolina , there is another , called the Eastern Shore and Norfolk route . It is proposed to construct a rail-road which shall diverge from the Wilmington and Susquehannab road , near Elkton , and after proceeding in a southerly course , and nearly in a right line , over a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Ann , terminate at Tangier Sound , near the southern border of the state . The length of this rail-road will be a hundred and eighteen miles . To continue the line of communication from Tangier Sound , to Norfolk and Portsmouth , it is proposed to establish a line of steamboats , to run daily , a distance of eighty-five miles . At Portsmouth , a rail-road is already constructed , leading thence westwardly to Weldon , on the Roanoke River , near the termination of the Petersburg road , a distance of seventy-five miles . On this road a train of cars runs daily , receiving passengers who leave Halifax by stage coaches in the morning , and conveying them to Portsmouth before dinner , where they embark in the steamboats , which now run to Baltimore and Washington . By means of this // route , Norfolk shares with Petersburg in the trade of the Roanoke valley ; and , should the project of the Eastern Shore rail-road be carried into effect , this city will be placed on the shortest line of communication along the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic line now in operation ; but it is in a fair way to he soon extended from this point , in one direction to the centre , and in another to the southern extremity , of the State of North Carolina . A company is formed for constructing a rail-road from the termination of the Petersburg and Roanoke Rail-road , at Weldon , in a southwesterly direction through Halifax to Raleigh , a dis tance of eighty miles . The road is laid out , and the work upon it is in active progress . Another company is formed , called the Wilmington and Raleigh Rail-road Company , hy whom a rail-road is laid out , and the work upon it begun , leading from Halifax on the Roanoke , in a southerly direction , a hundred and sixty miles , through the whole width of the State , to Wilmington . It is proposed to construct branches leading from this road to Raleigh and Fayetteville , and also a branch to Newbern and Beaufort . From Wilmington , it is proposed to continue the line of travel by steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty miles . There are also projects for extending the line of rail-road from Ra* leigh to Charleston , a distance of two hundred and fifty miles , or to Columbia , a hundred and eighty miles , and thence to Augusta in Georgia ; but they have not yet assumed such a shape , as to authorize any confident expectation that they will be soon carried into execution . We proceed to notice the principal rail*roads included in the second class , the most important of which are such as form lines of communication , from the shore of the Atlantic , to the navigable waters of the Western States . The first , and one of the most important of these lines , begins at the city of Boston , passes westerly through the whole length of the State of Massachusetts , to West Stockbridge , and thence through the greatest length of the State of New York , by the way of Albany and Utica , to Buffalo , the principal port on Lake Erie , and thence by the southeasterly shore of the lake , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being about six hundred miles . This extensive line will consist of no less than eleven distinct works , constructed by that number of independent com // panies , each with the right of entire control over its own portion of the line , but so connected with one another , that the same engines and cars may run , if occasion should require it , from one extremity of the line to the other , with the single interruption of a ferry at Albany . Of the eleven portions of the line , three are already completed , and in full operation , embracing some of the most difficult and expensive parts of the route . Three others , embracing the remainder of the difficult parts of the work , a:e in progress , the whole capital deemed necessary being secured , and portions of the work under contract . The five remaining companies , having in charge parts of the line between Utica and Erie , are either recently organized , or are now engaged in completing the subscriptions to their stock . The comparatively small expense at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the entire success of the Utica road , leave no doubt that this remaining portion , at least as far as Buffalo , will be completed at no remote period . The several works which compose this line are , 1st . The Boston and Worcester Rail-road , which leads from a convenient point on the harbour of Boston , to the centre of the town of Worcester , a distance of forty-four miles . It consists at present , of a single track , but it is of sufficient width for another track , whenever it shall be found necessary . It is built of the edge rail , weighing forty pounds to a yard , supported by cast-iron chairs , on cross sleepers of cedar , which rest on a bed of stone rubble . Although it passes through a hilly country , crossing the principal streams between Boston and Worcester , with the heights of land which lie between them , and reaches an elevation , at Worcester , of four hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea , it has no ascent greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curvature , except in the city of Boston near its termination , of less radius than 2000 feet . The cost of this road , including the extensive buildings and depots in Boston and Worcester , and the intermediate towns , with a liberal supply of locomotive engines and cars , was a million and a half of dollars . The time usually occupied in making the passage from Boston to Worcester is three hours , including the time lost in stopping at ten intermediate places , for receiving and discharging passengers . It has been found by experiment , that the passage may be easily made in two and a half hours , by a slight // increase of speed , and by curtailing the periods of stopping ; but a regard for the convenience and comfort of the passengers has led to the adoption of the rate of travelling above mentioned , viz , fifteen miles an hour , including the time lost in stopping once in every four miles . It is also found by experience , on this road as well as on the Providence and Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops , is a safe rate of travelling , agreeable in its effect on the passengers , and easily maintained by the engines in use on all these roads . A much swifter rate is practicable , but it is hardly consistent with a regard for the safety of the passengers . From these facts it may be assumed , that on a long line of well-constructed rail-roads , on which the long travel is sufficient to justify the maintenance of passenger trains running through the line , without frequent stops for the accommodation of the way travel , the usual speed will be nearly equal to twenty miles an hour , or at least a hundred miles in six hours . At this rate , the passage will be made from Boston to Albany in twelve hours , and from Boston to Buffalo , or Niagara , in thirty hours , or in two days , in the summer season , travelling by daylight only . The second link in this chain of communication is the Western Rail-road , extending from Worcester through Springfield , to the line of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of this road , an incorporated company is formed , with a capital of three millions of dollars , of which one million is subscribed by the State of Massachusetts . The conditions of this subscription are , that assessments shall be paid on the stock belonging to the State , in the same proportion as they are levied on that belonging to individuals , and three of the nine directors are appointed by the legislature . Three assessments , amounting to $450,000 , have been paid . A part of the road , extending twenty miles west from Worcester across the highlands , which have been de* nominated the backbone of the State , has been put under contract for the grading and masonry . It is understood that some parts of the line , in crossing the highlands , will be formed with an inclination of forty feet in a mile . The rest of the line along the valley of the Chickopee River , to a point near Springfield , is comparatively easy of construction , and will be formed on a gradual and almost uniform descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put under contract , and it is // presumed the work will be in progress throughout the line , early in the present season . The length of the line from Worcester to Springfield is fifty-four miles , and from Boston to Springfield , ninety-eight miles . Investigations and surveys have been industriously prosecuted , on various routes from Springfield to West Stockhridge , preparatory to an early location of that part of the line . A considerable portion of the route being yet undetermined , it is not possible to say what will be the precise length of the line , hut it may he assumed at not far from sixty-two miles . For the same reason , no precise estimate of the cost of the whole road can yet be made ; hut as a great part of the line will follow the channels of the two principal streams , and as the whole line will probably conform more nearly with the natural surface of the ground , than the Boston and Worcester road , on which there is much deep excavation , frequently through rock , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion to its length , than that of the latter road . It will also he exempt from the high charges for land and which the latter was subjected in and near the metropolis . From these considerations it may he presumed , that the amount of capital already secured will be sufficient for the completion of the work . The third link in the chain consists of the Albany and West Stockbridge Rail-road . This is already in progress , hy a company formed at Albany , under a charter from the legislature of New York . It has a capital of $650,000 , of which $250,000 are subscribed by the City of Albany , in its corporate capacity . This fact shows the deep interest which the citizens of that town take in the opening of this new channel of communication with the county of Berkshire , and with the whole of Massachusetts and the other New England States . The business transactions now carried on between the county of Berkshire and the ports of the Hudson River , are very extensive ; and it is reasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this work will afford . In reliance upon the extent of this business , the people of the city of Hudson have also undertaken the construction of a railroad , leading directly from that city to West Stockbridge , and to be united with the Western Rail-road , near its junction with the Albany road . These two roads will thus give to the travel and trade from Massachusetts a double outlet to the Hudson River . The directors of the Albany road , after a // thorough examination of a number of routes , one of which followed for some miles the course of the Hudson road , finally selected one leading through New Lebanon , which reaches Greenbush , on the eastern bank of the Hudson , opposite to the city of Albany , in a distance of forty-one miles and three quarters . This route has no descent or ascent greater than forty feet in a mile , and no curve of less radius than a thousand feet . T his distance , added to the probable length of the two roads in Massachusetts , will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . The next section of the line , in proceeding westward from Albany , consists of the Hudson and Mohawk Rail-road , which terminates at Schenectady , a distance of sixteen miles . This road was built several years since , with two tracks , at a cost of $1,100,000 , amounting to nearly $70,000 a mile . The greater part of this road is made either level , or with planes of moderate inclination . It has , however , two planes , one near Albany of a thousand yards in length , and the other near Schenectady of near seven hundred yards , each of which inclines from a level , at the rate of one eighteenth , and each requiring a stationary steam-engine to enable the trains to traverse them . These two inclined planes subject the company to an extra expense of twelve thousand dollars a year . Notwithstanding the heavy expense of this road , and these disadvantages of location , it is a productive property to the proprietors , though , on account of its heavy cost , not equal in value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Schenectady to Utica , a distance of seventy-seven miles , was opened on the 1st of August last , under more flattering auspices . It was built , with a single track , in a comparatively short period of time , and at a cost , including eight locomotive engines , and embracing a heavy expenditure for the purchase of land , and for damages to a turnpike company , not exceeding a million and a half of dollars , or about $20,000 a mile . On the celebration of the opening above alluded to , four hundred gentlemen left Albany , in eighteen cars , drawn by two locomotive engines , and , after passing over the Mohawk road , and stopping occasionally along the Utica road to receive the congratulations of its friends , reached Utica for dinner . After dinner they returned to Schenectady in less than four hours , and , deducting the aggregate of the stops , in three hours and twenty-one minutes , being a // rate of twenty-three miles an hour . They then proceeded to Albany , where they arrived about sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles within the day , and devoted some hours to the festivities of the occasion . From the date of the opening , two trains of cars , drawn by locomotives , have left each end of the road daily , one in the morning and the other at noon . The receipts , within the two months from the opening , amounted to an average of near $1200 daily . This was from the fare of passengers only , the company being forbidden by their charter to carry freight , except in winter , lest it should detract from the income of the Erie Canal , which runs parallel to it , and is the property of the State . The next section of the line extends from Utica to Syracuse , a distance of fifty-four miles . A company has been formed for the construction of this road with a capital of $800,000 ; but we do not learn whether they have made any progress in the execution of the work . The route is entirely level , the canal between the two towns being constructed without a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $650,000 , to construct a rail-road from Utica to Oswego , a port from which steamboats regularly take their departure from the principal ports on the lake , and from which there is a continued navigation , through the Welland Canal , to Lake Erie and the upper lakes . The next succeeding section of the great western line extends from Syracuse to Auburn , a distance of twenty-six miles . The maximum of inclination is thirty feet in a mile , and there is no curvature of a less radius than fifteen hundred feet . The construction of this road was some time since commenced , by a company with a capital of $400,000 , more than half of which has been already expended on the work . The rails are contracted for , to be delivered in May next , by which time it is anticipated the grading and masonry of the road will be completed . The eighth section of the line extends from Auburn , by way of Geneva and Canandaigua , a circuitous course , to Rochester , a distance of seventy miles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $820,000 if built with a single track , and $1,013,000 if with a double track . The stock of the company is taken up , to the amount of $1,200,000 , and they have a right by their charter to increase it to $2,000,000 . The two next sections extend from Rochester to Attica , and from Attica to // Buffalo . Companies are organized for the construction of these two roads , hut their progress hitherto is limited to the making of the surveys . The route is not difficult or expensive . On the Attica and Buffalo section the greatest inclination will be thirty-five feet in a mile . A company is formed for the construction of the rail-road from Buffalo to Erie , with a capital of $650,000 , the whole of which is subscribed . We have been thus particular in the description of this line of rail-roads , on account of the effect it is destined to have on the interests of the East and the West . It opens a channel by which the currents of moving population and the tide of commerce may flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and the agricultural regions of the West , in place of a mountain barrier , which has hitherto turned the course of both towards the ports of the Atlantic . It is easy to foresee that the benefits , which must result from it , to the inhabitants at each extremity , must be of the most striking character . Whether we regard it as merely opening new sources of wealth , or as extending the means of social intercourse , and strengthening the bonds of union between distant States , we can not place too high an estimate upon its advantages . Some of the other lines of communication promise similar results to the tracts of country which they are intended to serve . But we shall be obliged to despatch them with a more cursory notice . The next line of rail-road from the Atlantic to the Western States , is the New York and Erie Rail-road . This road will commence at Tappan on the western shore of the Hudson River , twenty-four miles from the city of New York , and , after running northwesterly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern boundary of New Jersey and Pennsylvania , a distance of near five hundred miles , it will terminate at Dunkirk , a port on Lake Erie . It is estimated that this road will cost six millions of dollars . A capital of $1,800,000 has been subscribed by individuals , and the legislature of New York has engaged to make a loan of $3,000,000 , certain portions of which are to be advanced on the completion of specified portions of the road ; the last million not to be paid , until the whole road , with a double track , shall be completed . Books are opened to increase the subscription of capital to // the western termination of the route , and at other places west of the Genesee River , large donations of land have been made to the company , which are valued at one or two millions of dollars . These donations have enabled the company to offer to those who now are , or who may become subscribers to the stock , six per cent . per annum until the year 1841 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective subscriptions , up to that time , to be provided by sales , as far as shall be necessary , of these lands . This offer has been made with the further proviso , that the residue of the lands , which shall be unsold in 1841 , shall be divided among the holders , at that time , of the three millions of stock . Itis anticipated that by that time the work will be so far completed , as to admit of an income being derived from the road itself . This is a magnificent project , which must be productive of important results , in increasing the business of the city of New York , and in giving a new accessible frontier , along the whole length of the State , and thereby producing a vast accumulation of valuable property within its limits . Should it far exceed the estimate which has been made of the cost , these advantages will fully justify the expenditure . On proceeding southwardly to Philadelphia , we meet a third projected system of Western rail-roads , leading from that city to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already completed and in full operation in Pennsylvania , eight hundred and eighty-six miles of canal , and three hundred miles of railroad ; a part of which is the property of the State , and the rest the property of incorporated companies . There are in the process of construction , three hundred and five miles of canal , and four hundred miles of rail-road , and there are besides many works projected of both descriptions , which are not yet commenced . Among the works completed are a line consisting partly of rail-road , and partly of canal , belonging to the State , leading from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh . This line of works , though of great utility , does not admit of that rapidity of communication which is found desirable , and which is afforded by a continued line of rail-roads . The public attention has therefore been lately directed to the importance of a continued rail-road , leading not only to the Ohio River at Pittsburgh , but to Lake Erie . No definite route , however , has yet been designated for this road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its whole extent . It is proposed that it // shall consist in part of some of the works already constructed . The principal of these is the Columbia Rail-road , which extends from Philadelphia to Columbia , a distance of eighty miles , and is constructed with a double track . A branch diverging from this road at Lancaster , and extending to Harrisburgh , the seat of government of the State , is nearly finished . A bill is now before the legislature for authorizing a further extension of this line from Harrisburgh to Sunbury , and it is proposed to make a still further extension from Sunbury to Williamsport . A convention of delegates from the counties of the State was lately held at Northumberland , which recommended an application to the legislature for the incorporation of a company with adequate capital , to construct a rail-road from Lake Erie , by way of Williamsport , to Sunbury , thus completing the line to Philadelphia . Various other measures have been adopted , which show a strong direction of the public mind towards the attainment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on investigation to be the best . Some of the projects recommended tend towards the town of Erie , as the point of western termination , and others , towards Cleaveland in Ohio , by way of Pittsburgh and Beaver . It is , perhaps , safe to infer , that , considering the ample means for the attainment of this object , possessed by the people of this great State , and the stimulus which their patriotism is likely to receive , from witnessing the continued progress of the New York and Erie road on their northern border , and tending to divert a portion of the business of the West from their own capital , these projects will not be suffered to remain unexecuted . The mineral treasures of the State are alone sufficient , in many places , to support these works as mere local improvements , for rendering the mines accessible . In this respect the mountainous regions of Pennsylvania possess a decided advantage over those of New England . The next line of rail-road leading from the Atlantic to the waters of the West , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pioneer rail-road of the country . It was not only the first which attempted to traverse the Alleghany , but it was the first rail-road of any magnitude attempted in the United States . We have heretofore fully noticed the early history and progress of this enterprise . It has met with impediments to the attainment of its main object , the crossing of the mountains , of a most vexatious and embarrassing char // acter , from coming in conflict with a rival improvement , tbe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal , which had preoccupied the only channel through which it could pass . These impediments are at length removed , by an adjustment , by which both works will pass side by side , through the same channel , at a considerably increased cost to the rail-road . In the mean time , the directors of this road have learned much , from their own experience , as well as from other sources , respecting the best methods of laying out , constructing , and managing a work of this description . From this experience , and from improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit . They can now proceed in the extension of their road towards the east , to much greater advantage , than they could have done six or eight years ago . Several points in the science of rail-roads , which were then either unknown , or not generally admitted , are now considered as settled axioms . Such are the following ; slight deviations from a level , in the surface of the road , are not to be regarded as serious defects , as they afford an advantage , in many situations , in the draining of the road , sufficient to counterbalance the slight evil arising from the inequality of draft , required on the ascending and the level or descending portions of the road . Short curves are defects of a more serious nature , than they were esteemed by the engineers who laid out the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road ; and even a slight degree of curvature , although it may not be sensibly felt in the motion of the train , tends to increase the wear of wheels and axles . Much steeper inclinations can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought practicable . This fact has been satisfactorily established , by experiments made on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road , and by experience elsewhere . It results from this discovery that inclined planes , with stationary power , may be dispensed with on many routes , where formerly they would have been deemed indispensable ; yet the limit to which this principle may be carried remains to be tested by experience . Locomotive engines are found to be so decidedly superior as a motive power , for the transport of either freight or passengers , that the use of horses must be entirely superseded by them , on all works of any magnitude . They are cheaper , less hazardous , more manageable , and injure the road less . The iron edge rail resting on cross sleepers , is preferable to the flat rail laid on a continuous support of either iron or wood . // These and certain other truths , which could be learned only from experience , had they been known before the commencement of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road , would have enabled the enterprising projectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their items of expenditure . The Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road is completed with a double track from Baltimore to Harper 's Ferry , with a branch to Fredericktown , at a cost of $3,474,600 . There is , besides , a branch diverging from it at a point eight miles distant from Baltimore , to Washington , built at the additional cost of $1,588,899 . This branch last year produced a net income of five per cent. , exclusive of a fifth part of the whole receipts from passengers , reserved as a bonus to the State . From Harper 's Ferry a rail-road has been built , by an independent company , extending to Winchester in Virginia . This road is connected with the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road , by a continuous track , by means of a viaduct across the Potomac Rivei* , which has just been opened for the passage of locomotives and cars . Surveys have been made for the extension of the Winchester Rail-road as far as Staunton , which when completed will form a rail-road route from Baltimore , of two hundred and fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the last two years , for the extension of the Baltimore and Ohio rail-road , along the valley of the Potomac , in conjunction with the canal , and to the summit of the Alleghany Mountains , with a view of continuing them thence to both Pittsburgh and Wheeling . The engineers report with confidence , that the mountains between Cumberland and the Western waters can be passed , without the use of stationary power , by locomotive engines and their trains . The company has obtained , by virtue of acts of the legislature of Maryland and of the city council of Baltimore , subscriptions to their stock , to the amount of three millions of dollars on account of the State , and an equal sum on account of the city . With these liberal additions to their capital stock , and with such aid as may be anticipated from the citizens of Pittsburgh and Wheeling , there is reason to believe that ample means will be provided for the completion of the enterprise . No definite location of the route has been made , and consequently neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated . The completion of the road is a very important end to be attained , not only to the individual stockholders , but // to the city of Baltimore and the State ; for they are deeply interested in the income of the road , and in the effects it is expected to produce on the business of the city and State . The work , as it is at present situated , is hut an insignificant fragment of the whole , and it must remain , until finished , comparatively unproductive . Unlike the first western line heretofore described , it passes through no dense population which can give it an adequate support , independently of that on which it will ultimately rest , the traffic and population of the western country . Another Trans-Alleghanic rail-road is projected in Virginia . It has two terminations on the Atlantic , one at Richmond , and the other at Norfolk . From these , two lines proceed , one towards the sources of the James River , hy way of Farmville and Lynchhurgh , and the other by the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Portsmouth and Roanoke Rail-road , already described , the Greensville and Roanoke Rail-road , extending to Danville , a distance of one hundred and seventy-two miles , and the Danville and Junction Rail-road to Evansham , one hundred and thirty-seven miles in length . At some point between Danville and Evansham the two lines will probably unite , and will proceed to near the source of the Holston River , and , pursuing the channel of this stream to near the southwestern corner of the State , will pass into Tennessee , and terminate on the navigable waters of Tennessee River . From Lynchburgh , across the Blue Ridge , the Alleghany Ridge , and the ridge between New River and the Holston , two surveys have been made , by direction of the Lynchburgh and Tennessee Rail-road Company , and the cost is estimated at $14,000 a mile . A survey of the other route has been made , and the cost of the two roads , from the termination of the Portsmouth and Roanoke road , to Evansham , is estimated at $5,254,000 . Both routes are pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia has granted to the James River and Roanoke Company the right to construct a rail-road from Richmond to Lynchburgh ; and that company has voted to construct it , as soon as the Lynchburgh and Tennessee Rail-road shall have been commenced , and has instructed the directors , in that event , to open hooks of subscription for the necessary stock . It is anticipated that the Lynchburgh and Tennessee Rail-road will unite , near its southwestern // termination with the Charleston and Cincinnati Railroad , and thus enable the State of Virginia to share in the benefits of that great work . It is proposed also that it shall unite with the line of steam navigation on the Tennessee River , which , with the exception of the interruption by the Muscle Shoals , extends to the Mississippi . To supply the chasm in the line of communication , occasioned by the interruption of navigation at these shoals , a rail-road was constructed and put in operation two years ago by a company formed nader a charter from the legislature of Alabama . This was the first rail-road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Western States . It extends from Tuscumbia , a port situated below the Muscle Shoals , to Courtland , and thence to Decatur , at a part of the river above the Shoals , the length of road being forty-three miles . A project has been discussed in Tennessee , and countenanced by a convention of delegates held at Nashville , for establishing a central rail-road , leading through the State from the Virginia line , to the Mississippi River ; but no definitive measures have been taken for carrying it into effect . In a similar spirit of local patriotism , and with an ardent desire for improving the condition of their State , the people of North Carolina have projected a line of rail-roads , to be connected with the roads from Edenton and Beaufort , from Wilmington , and from Halifax and Raleigh , at Fayetteville , and to proceed thence in a northwesterly direction , by the Yadkin River , to unite with the Charleston and Cincinnati Rail-road , near the northwestern angle of the State . All these roads are projected by prhrate companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature , the chief part of the surplus of United States revenue which falls to that State is appropriated to a fund for internal improvements , and the commissioners of the fund are instructed to subscribe to the stock of these companies , to the amount of two fifths of their respective capitals , provided the other three fifths shall be subscribed by responsible persons ; no payment to be made on the part of the State , until a quarter part of the stock subscribed by individuals shall have been paid in . In all the lower parts of the State the face of the country is remarkably adapted to the favorable location of the respective routes , and for the cheap grading of the roads . In the northwest the route has not been fully surveyed . // We come next to the grand Charleston and Cincinnati Rail-road . This is one of the boldest projects of modern times , and it has been engaged in by the people of Charleston and of South Carolina , with an ardor which shows a determination to carry it into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently of its magnitude , it will be attended with difficulties in the execution , which will require the exertion of great skill and energy , and a very great expenditure of money . We are far , however , from supposing the enterprise in its nature impracticable , or that it is likely to fail from any cause , unless it be from the failure of the necessary means . Even these can hardly fail , if the other States interested in its success imitate the example of South Carolina , and contribute their fair proportion to the expenses of the undertaking . A company has been formed , and incorporated by joint acts of the legislatures of the four States through which the route passes , viz. North and South Carolina , Tennessee , and Kentucky , with all the powers necessary for accomplishing the work . The capital is $12,000,000 , and by a supplementary charter , the company is authorized to raise an additional capital , to be employed in banking , not to exceed at any time the amount actually raised for the road . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of the French Broad River , in North Carolina and Tennessee , as a part of it . This valley presents a most remarkable pass through the mountain , for a great extent . The bead waters of this stream rise in an extensive plain on the Blue Ridge , from which there is a descent for sixty miles , in the direction best suited for the rail-road , not exceeding an average of thirteen feet in a mile , and not exceeding forty-five feet in any mile , and with no curvatures , but such as locomoiives and their trains may pass without difficulty . Other parts of the route are no further definitively settled than that it shall pass through Columbia in South Carolina , Knoxville in Tennessee , and Lexington in Kentucky . Surveys have been made , which enable Governor Hayne , the president of the company , to state , " that the proposed route is entirely practicable , and may certainly be constructed across the mountains , with an ascent at the maximum of not more than sixty feet in any one mile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The distance will be from six to seven hundred miles . It will probably pursue the route , from Charleston to // Columbia , selected by the South Carolina Canal and Rail-road Company , on which they have already constructed a rail-road half the distance , with a single track . A negotiation has been opened between the two companies for settling the terms , by which a junction shall be formed between the two roads . The amount of capital stock already subscribed is $4,333,000 , of which $3,525,000 are subscribed in South Carolina . On this stock $216,660 have been already paid in . Measures are taken for an immediate prosecution of the surveys , and for the advancement of the work as expeditiously as possible . The State of Georgia has undertaken a series of rail-road improvements , traversing the whole length of that great State , from the eastern parts to the Chatahouchee River , and the Tennessee line , hardly less extensive than those of South Carolina . The policy of this State seems to have been , to grant to private corporations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and less expensive parts of the State , with such encouragements as are necessary to enable them to proceed with these works , and to undertake , on account of the State , such works in the newly-settled and more difficult parts of its territory , as are necessary for extending the lines of communication , until they shall meet others beyond the limits of the State . The legislature accordingly , at its last session , passed an act directing that " a rail-road communication as a State work and with the funds of the State , shall be made from some point on the Tennessee line near the Tennessee River , commencing at or near Rossville , in the most direct and practicable route , to some point on the southeastern branch of the Chatahouchee River , which shall be most eligible for an extension of branch rail-roads , thence to Athens , Madison , Milledgeville , Forsyth , and Columbus , and to any points which may be designated by the engineer or engineers surveying the same , as most proper and practicable , and on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides that no more than $350,000 annually shall be appropriated to the prosecution of this work , unless a future legislature shall otherwise direct . It also provides that the governor shall forthwith appoint an engineer , with such assistants as shall be necessary to accomplish speedily and effectually the proper surveys and estimates , and appropriates sixty thousand dollars for the payment of salaries and expenses . The governor , in pursuance of the authority given him , has already appointed a // chief engineer , and evinced his determination to prosecute the work with all practicable expedition . In the mean time , the works of private companies are advancing , with various degrees of energy , to meet the points indicated in the acts above cited . The Georgia Rail-road and Banking Company has begun its line of rail-road at the city of Augusta , with what is called the Union Rail-road , extending westward from that city . A distance of seventy-six miles is under contract for the grading , besides a branch of seven miles in length to Greensborough , and part of a branch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for laying the rails , and the iron is ready at Augusta and Savannah . In a similar spirit , though not so much in advance , the Central Rail-road and Banking Company are prosecuting their work , to connect the city of Savannah with another of the points named for the termination of the State work , near the town of Macon . The selection of the line of the State work is made with special reference to its connexion with a system of works in Tennessee . It is to terminate on the Tennessee line , five miles from Ross 's Landing , on the Mississippi River , to which point it will be extended by the Hiwassee Rail-road Company , incorporated in Tennessee , already organized , and waiting only for the movements of Georgia . It will thus have access , through the navigation of the Tennessee River and its tributaries , to the trade of East Tennessee , and a part of North Carolina and Western Virginia , and to the ClYarleston and Cincinnati Rail-road , the right of doing which is reserved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incorporation of the company for establishing that road . These are the great lines of rail-road communication which are projected , and most of which are in active progress , for uniting the East and the West , for traversing that supposed eternal barrier , by which nature had separated them , and bringing the commerce of the Mississippi valley , in direct lines , to the shores of the Atlantic . Two others are projected , to unite the ports of the Atlantic with those of the Gulf of Mexico , one leading , from Brunswick , in Georgia , to the Appalachicola River , and the other from Jacksonville , on the St. Johns , to St. Marks . The latter , called the East Florida Rail-road , is actually located , in nearly a direct line , over a level country , the distance being a hundred and sixty miles . We must defer to another occasion some notice of the ex // tensive works which are projected and in progress for extending the intercourse between the Western States , and of some of the almost innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every State . We can not close this notice , without offering our testimony to the very creditable manner in which M. Poussin has executed this first History of the Rail-roads of America . It emhraces not only the history , hut a full and satisfactory description , evidently founded on the most authentic documents , of the principal works which form the subject of his volume . We hope that he will follow up the progress of these improvements , and thus furnish not only to France and Europe , but to our own countrymen , the best evidences of American perseverance and enterprise.
