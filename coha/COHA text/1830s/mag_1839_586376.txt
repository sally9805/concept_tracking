The proposals , however , which his heirs received from the publishing houses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these expectations , that Mrs. Madison , with a just perception of what was under the circumstances due from the country , at once subni*tted a statement of the circumstances to the President , who commuri*cated them to Congress in a special message on the eighth of December , 1836 . The result was the appointment of a Committee , who recommended the purchase and publication of the manuscripts as a National Work , and thirty thousand dollars were subsequently appropriated to Mrs. Madison for the former object . The novel and interesting features of the case ,  --  the venerated relict of one of the founders of the Republic coming before the country with a maauscript precious in its relation to its national destiny as the Sybil 's books which the fables of mythology have loved to associate with the infant glories of the Roman State , - were such that the proposition was not to be met with a cold appreciation of merits , or with nice questions of Congressional power ; and this feeling , combined with the consciousness that the amount did not nearly equal that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand for publications unknown to all literature save that of the contingent fund , and not the less costly or paramount in their claims on the national purse , that they are as regularly denominated " trash " and " rubbish " by hundreds of grumbling economists , as the everlasting appropriation comes up for yearly action , silenced the constitutional scruples of the school who believe with us , that Congress has not the right to spend money by constructive legislation , because it may have the power . Indeed all the legislative proceedings in relation to this matter , rather resembled the tribute of a grateful country through its highest representative body , to the family of a citizen so illustrious alike by his character , his employments and his services to the State , than the purchase of a work , merely useful or interesting , for a given value . It was this feeling also which induced Congress to pass a subsequent act , giving to Mrs. Madison the honorary privilege of a copy-right in foreign countries , with the single proviso that the manuscripts in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the impropriety of a work being published abroad , before its appearance in the country where it was the national property , and to which its subject exclusively appertained , a merely nominal restriction , since one of the copies printed here would afford every requisite facility should its republication be desired . The work thus purchased was transferred by Congress to the care of the Joint Committee of the Library , and that body , it is understood , after inviting propositions from numerous publishers , // have made arrangements for its early appearance in suitable style , and by attaching a fixed sum for the copy-right of the work , to each copy that may be sold , sought to meet the original constitutional objection by putting it in the power of the country to repay the liberal advance which the Legislature has made from the National Treasury for the purchase of the work . We now proceed to give a brief description of the manuscripts . The work consists of two distin parts . The first contains the only records huo*vn to exist of Debates ii* the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debates are merely fragments of those which occurred ( luring the years 17*2 and 1787 , the interval has been filled up with numerous letters and extracts of letters descriptive of passing events , which were written by Mr. Madison in his official capacity to various distinguished friends , and which will be received as valuable accessions to our materials for the history of the period . Respecting these letters and debates , Mr. Madison himself gives the following circtmstnntial and authentic information in a prefatory note attached to the volume : " Mr. Madison took his seat in the Congress of the Confederation on the twentieth day of March , 1780 , but did not commence his Diary of its Debates till November fourth , 1782 . It was continued through the sequel of tIat year , and until the removal of Congress was decided on the twenty-first of June , 1783 , from Philadelphia to Princeton , where the task was not renewed . " In February , 1787 , being again a member , he resumed his Diary , which was continued till Play second of that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance ii* the approaching Convention at Philadelphia , which was to prepare a new Constitution for the United States . " On the close of that Convention he returned to his seat in Congress , which he held till March , 1788 , when he was called to Virginia with a view to his beiag elected to the State Convention which was to decide on the Constitution proposed by the General Convention . During this period it appears that no Diary was keptthe effect perhaps of the share lie had in *vriting the Federalist . Nor was it resumed in the interval between his return from the close of the State Convention , and his ? nal departure from Con*ress , then in the last stage of its existence , to become a candidate for a seat in the approaching House of Represent*Aives unde- the new Cbnstitution . " The series of Debates now published , though generally condensed into thieii* substance , are not without more Jetailed discussions on particular topics ; and being , with the exception of the debates in 1776 on the Declaration of Iadependtflce , end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Jefferson , which are also prefixed , the only known or peobable materials of what possed in Conaress iii that form , they can not fail ta to particularly acceptable to the public . The periods of the Diary comprise much that has been least known , and is of a nature to gratify a just curiosity . As Mr. Madison was engaged , whilst a member of the old Congress , in regular and often confidential correspondence * whIm several distinguished friends , some of them at that time his absent colleagues , it was thought that a number of his letters* and extracts from others , in which he gives information of what occurred in Con " * His letters of an important and secret nature to Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Randolph were written in cypher , but decyphered under his eye , except a few of a cypher used a shore thee with Mr. Randolph , the key to which could not be discovo ; ed.

" It can not be amiss to remark , that the letters derive a value not only from their perfect authenticity , and from the position of the writer as a member of Congress , but from the consideration that they were written without a thought that they would ever meet the public eye . So entire* absent was such a thought , that no copies , with scarce an exception , were , or indeed , considering their number , the frequency and the haste of the letters , and the situation of the writer , could be retained . And it was owing to the kindness of his correspondents or their representatives , that the originals here used make a part of his files . It is regretted that some of those originals were not effectually guhrded against damage , and that uthers appear to be missing . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partake in no respect of the imperfections which must necessarily be expected in a preliminary volume thus composed of historical fragments , which fortunate though accidental circumstances only enabled their author to preserve , and which were never intended as portions of a more perfect and permanent work . Mr. Madison entered upon the duties of the Convention with a solemn sense of responsibility to his country an ( l to posterity , which controlled all his actions ; and t'he record of the debates which he preserved was the result of a deliberate and systematic design , originating in a profound appreciation of th' importance of the discussions he recorded , which looked far into the future , and be .. yond the grave for a reward . These labors , which were viewed with distrust , by many , with unconcern , or hopelessly by others , and with doubt and anxiety by all contemporaries , he , with a few other trusting spirits , as surely saw , would be regarded by posterity with the intensest interest and veneration ever accorded to the deliberations of a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , the solemn-minded child of the future sat down to his task . No hope of fame , or reward , or applause of his fellow-citizens cheered his way , but the light of truth , manifested in the sublime developement of immortal principles , flashed upon his page , as day after day he urged his noble toil , and laid by his volumes for readers then unborn .. The generations around were too near to discern rightly the value and importance of his record in all its full and sublime proportions ; and with a faith anti trust characteristic of the man , he kept his work through all the phases of a long and trying political life , sacred for its owner  --  the posterity for which it was intended . We confess there is something noble and almost touching in the fidelity with which this reliance was maintained . How often , during the course of the last half century have we not heard our prominent statesmen radically differ in their interpretation of the Constitution ? How often during that time have uot the intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often has not every politician , mingling in the party conflicts of the time , felt the loss of the unerring guide which this publication will hereafter afford ? How often have we not seen the parties and partisans of the day interpret wrongfully , or darkly , or wilfully , the thoughts and meaning of the past which can now be illustrated and explained beyond the possibility of a cavil , from a work held back in the deep consciousr*ss of its author that the time for full revelation was not come , and that the impenetrable curtain of* the grave should be interposed between the last survivor of its framers and the millions of the great and prosperous nation who looked to the Constitution , and the new system of government which it created as the greatest and noblest fruit of the blood and toil of the Revolution-ere the proper period for fully unbosoming the secret proceedings of that time , to the respectful veneration of the country should arrive . The following extract from a preliminary essay *o the volume of Debates , by Mr. Madison himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every mind of the trtth of the above remarks , and fully shows how completely he was possessed with the responsibiliy of his self-imposed task , and what thorough confidence may be reposed in advance in reports prepared under such circumstances by such a hand : " On the arrival of the Virginia deputies at Philadelphia , . it occurred to them that from the early and prominent part taken bythat State in bringing about th' Convention , some initiative step might be expected from them .. The resolutions introduced by Governor Randolph were the result of a consultation . on the subject , with an understanding that they left all the deputies entirely open to the lights of discussion , and free to concur in any alterations or modifications which their reflections and judgments might approve . The resolutions , as the journals shew , became the basis on which the proceedings of the Convention commeaced , and to the developements , variations and modifications of which the plan of government proposed by Convention may be traced . " The curiosity I had felt during my researches into the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deficiency I found in the means of satisfying it , more especially in what related to the process , the principles , the reasons , and the anticipations which prevailed in the formation of them , determined me to preserve as far as I could , an exact account of what might pass in the Convention whilst executing its trust , with the magnitude of which I was duly impressed , as I was by the gratification promised to future curiosity by an authentic exhibition of the objects , the opinions and the reasonings from which the new system of government was to receive its peculiar structure and organization . Nor was I unaware of the value of such a contribution to the fund of materiala for the history of a constitution on which would be staked the happiness of a people great even in its infancy , and possibly the cause of liberty throughout the world . " In pursuance of the task I had assumed , I chose a seat in front of the presiding member , with the other members on my right and left hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I noted in terms legible , and in abbreviations and marks intelligible to myself what was read from the chair or spoken by the members ; and losing not a moment unnecessarily between the adjournment and reas* sembling of the Convention , I was enabled to write out my daily notes during the // 1839.1 Extract from Jladison 's Introduction . session or within a few finishing days after its close , in the extent and form , preserved in my own hand , on my files . " In the labor and correctness of this I was not a little aided by practice , and by a familiarity with the style and the train of observation and reasoning which characterized the principal speakers . It happened also that I was not absent a single day , nor more than a casual fraction of an hour in any day , so that I could not have lost a single speech , unless a very short one . " It may be proper to remark , that with a very few exceptions , the speeches were neither furnished , nor revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . tt from my notes , aided by the freshness of my recollections . A further remark may be proper , that views of the subject might occasionally be presented in the speeches and proceedings with a latent reference to a compromise on some middle ground , by wiutual concessions . The exceptions alluded to , were , 1st , the sketch furnished by Mr. Randolph , of his speech on the introduction of his propositions on the twentyninth day of May . 2d . The speech ofMr . Hamilton , who happened to call on me when putting the last hand to it , and who acknowledged its fidelity , without suggesting more than a very few verbal alterations which were made . 3d . The speech of Governeur Morris on the second day of May , which was communicated to him on a like occasion , and who acquiesced in it without a verbal change . The correctness of his language and the distinctness of his enunciation were particularly favorable to a reporter . The speeches of Dr. Franklin , excepting a few brief ones , were copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague , Mr. Wilson* it being inconvenient to the Doctor to remain long on his feet . " Of the ability and intelligence of those who composed the Convention the debates and proceedings may be a test ; as the character of the work which was the offspring of their deliberations must be tested by the experience of the future , added to that of nearly half a century which has passed . " But whatever may be the judgment pronounced on the competency o.f the architects of the Constitution , or whatever may be the destiny of the edifice prepared by them , I feel it a duty to express my profound and solemn conviction derived from my intimate opportunity of appreciating the views of the Convention , collectively and individually , that there never was an assembly t , f men , charged with a great and arduous trust , who were more pure in their motives , or more exclusively or anxiously devoted to the object committed to them , than were the members of the Federal Convention of 1787 , to the object of devising and proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which it was to replace , and best secure the permanent liberty and happiness of their country . " That resolution of the Convention which closed its doors to the public , gave much umbrage at the time , and exposed the body to great animadversion . Yet how wise and judicious was the provi-. sion . Their labor was not for their contemporaries . They worked for the far-off future . They spoke to an audience that no legislative assembly yet has ever addressed . And as posterity was to test the value of their labors , so posterity will now have an opportunity of judging reverently and candidly of their motives , their reasons , their intentions , their fear , and their hopes . The injunction of secrecy has been removed , and the people of the United States may now and henceforward learn and judge for themselves . One extract , only , are we tempted to make . It is the last sentence of the Work thus sealed up for fifty-two years . And we give it not merely for the striking and deeply interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands who will now see it for the first time , the exultation that must come home to every bosom , // in the feeling that the prophetic emblem of Franklin has been so completely verified in an amount of national greatness , prosperity , happiness , an ( l honor without a stain , never reached , even approached by any human community in the same space of time . May the sun that rose on that day never go down ! " Whilst the last members were signing , Doctor Franklin , looking towards the President 's chair , at the hack of which a rising sun happened to be painted , observed to a few members near him that painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising sun from a setting sun . I have , ' said he , often and often , in the course of the session , and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue , looked at that behind the President , without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , that it is a rising and not a setting sun . ' * ' It is not our intention , as already mentioned , to enter at present into an examination of these manuscripts in detail , but having brought the public thus to the threshold of this great National Work , we will await the period of its publication for additional observations . The occasion seems a proper one to bring the life and character of their illustrious author more immediately before the public . Mr. Madison has been so eminent in public consideration for the last half century that various accounts have been published of his life and character . It is therefore proper to premise that many of the following particulars are taken from another biographical sketch of him by the same hand , with some additional circumstances kindly contributed by others . It is also proper to add , that no eulogium is attempted , nor little more than an abridged statement of the prominent transactions of a long life of public distinction . James Madison was born on the fifth of March , 1751 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his maternal grandmother , opposite to Port Royal , a town on the south side of the Rappahannock , in Virginia . The house of his parents , James Madison and Nelly Conway , was in Orange county , where he always resided . It is remarkable for the beauty of the scenery and purity of the air ; and likewise , that within a short ( distance of each other , in that region three Presidents of the United States , Jefferson , Madison , and Monroe , all resided , as closely connected in personal attachment , as in political faith , who have impressed on the country a large share of the policy and distinction of these United States . After passing through the usual elementary education , Mr. Madison was placed , at about twelve years of age , under the tuition of Donald Robertson , a distinguished teacher in that neighborhood , with whom he accomplished the common preparatory studies for a // collegiate course . These studies were further prosecuted under the Reverend Thomas Martin , the parish minister of the Established Church of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family . The climate of Williamsburgh being deemed uncongenial with persons from the mountain region , Mr. Madison , instead of being put at the College of William an , d Mary , was sent to that of Princeton , New Jersey , of which Dr.*Witherspoon was then President , where he completed his college education , and received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the autumn of 1771 . While at college his health was impaired by over ardent study . It continued feeble during some years after his return home . We learn , from good authority , that for more than sixty years he suffered from organic bodily irregularity , which is mentioned only for the purpose of the encouraging reflection , how long , how cheerful , and how useful life may be with tolerable health , and much how enjoyment may be had notwithstanding bodily misfortunes which are a constant source of uneasiness , lie laid deep the foundations of those attainments , habits and principles , which graelually but without fail raised him to after eminence . XYhen he got home with impaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extensive and systematic reading , somewhat miscellaneous , but not without reference to the profession of law , although he formed no absolute determinalion to enter upon the practice . Mr. Madison studied probably just law enough , but his breeding was altogether that of a statesman ; an American statesman , for he never was out of his own country ; and though it has often truly been said that he would make a great Chief Justice of the United States , yet his studies and acquirements were free from all technical or professional restraint , and his seldom if ever equalled powers of reasoning were always exercised on a large scale , and with a 1 ) hilosophical comprehension of the subject matter . From nature , from habit , it may be even from the imperfect state of health to which he was reduced at the outset of his career , his was a passionless progress to elevation . 1-fe never addressed a passion or prOpitiate ( l a prejudice : but relying on reason alone for conviction , he effected his purpose without any appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he worked out every result like a problem to be proved . No one was ever more inflexibly attached to the principles of his adoption ; but then he always adopted them on earnest consideration and sufficient authority , before he gave them his affections . They were not his natural offspring . His preceptor , Jefferson , a man of high genius surpassed him in enthusiasm and brilliancy of imagination , and was better versed in mathematical science , and that of languages . But Madison was a good linguist , a chaste , elegant and attractive writer ; as a reasoner , superior to Jefferson , and perhaps of sounder // judgment , certainly more circumspect . His conversational talents* were uncommon , and his power of debate in public bodies , when he at length overcame the extreme diffidence by which he was at first much restrained , was of the first order . No man ever was more averse to controversy , detraction or invective ; he never gave offence by personality . Having received very early *d strong impressions in favor of liberty , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the American cause at the beginning of the dispute with Great Britain ; but his devotion to study and his impaired health , probably prevented his performing any military service . Devoted to freedom of conscience , he was particularly active in opposing the persecution of the Baptists , then a new sect in Virginia , who were consigned in some instances to jail for violating the law pro . hibiting preaching by dissenters from the established church . Throughout life he was- remarkable for strict adherence to the American doctrine of absolute separation between civil and religious authority ; and one of his vetoes , while President , attested that in advanced station and age the principles early imbibed on this subject were as dear to him as at first , when he was but a young and gratuitous reformer . In the spring of 1776 , when twenty-five years of age , he was initiated into the public service , from which he rarely afterwards was absent for forty years of constantly rising eminence , till it was all crowned by that spontaneous retirement from the highest station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first election was to the Legislature of Virginia , which , in May of that year , anticipated the declaration of independence by unanimously instructing the deputies of that State to propose it . It is a proof of Mr. Madison 's character that in this Assembly , being surrounded by experienced and distinguished members , he modestly refrained from any active part in its proceedings ; and never tried that talent for debate which he afterwards displayed so eminently . Beyond committee duty and private suggestions he was unknown in the Assembly . At the succeeding county election he was superseded by another competitor . His failure was partly owing to his declining to treat the electors ; but in no small degree to the diffidence which restrained him from giving fair play to his faculfy of speech and active participation in public affairs . But the Legislature , in the course of the ensuing session , repaired this popular defection by appointing him member of the Council of State , which place he held till 1779 , when he was elected a delegate to the Congress of the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council , Patrick Henry was Governor of the State ; and during the latter part of it , Mr. Jefferson . Both these personages experienced and appreciated the importance of // Mr. Madison 's assistance , knowledge and judgment , in a station which did not put his natural modesty to the severe trial of public display . His information , patriotism , probity and unpretending worth , gained for him the first fruits of his maturing distinction . lie proved himself a safe and serviceable man ,  --  recommendations without which brilliancy is often troublesome , and always useless . Mr. Jefferson used to say that *1r . Madison rendered himself very acceptable to the members of th' Legislature by his amiable deportinent , and by the services he performed in drafting reports , bills , &amp;c. , for them . It was this that recommended him for election the next winter as a member of the Executive council , where his talents for writing and for business generally , particularly his acquaintance with the French language , of which Governor Henry was ignorant , and which was necesary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French officers , soon made Mr. Madison the most efficient member of the council . He wrote so much for Governor Henry , that he was called the Governor 's Secretary . The council , moreover , was the best adapted stage for his first essays as a public speaker ; not consisting of more than ten persons , their discussions were less trying to a modest man . So extreme was Mr. Madison 's diffidence , that it was Mr. Jefferson 's opinion that if his first public appearance had taken place in such an assembly as the House of Representatives of the United States Mr. Madison would never have been able to overcome his aversion to display . But by practice first in the Executive Council of Virginia , and afterwards in the old Congress , which was likewise a small body , he was gradually habituated to speech-making in public , in which he became so powerful . Elected to Congress , he took his scat in that body in March , 1780 , and was continued there by re-dections till the expiration of the allowed term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1781 . From the spring of 1780 till the fall of 1783 , the journals show , as is known to all , that he became an active and leading member of Congress , taking prominent part in many of the most important transactions . The letter of instructions to Mr. Jay , American minister in Spain , in October , 1780 , maintaining the right of the United States to the Mississippi river , and the address of the States at the close of the war , urging the adoption of the plan providing for the debts due to the army , and the other public creditors , were composed by him , and are some of the earliest of his contributions to those American State papers , which , during the infancy of the United States , were among their most effectual means of conservation and advancement . In the years 1784 , 5 , 6 , he was elected a delegate by his county to the State legislature . During Mr. Madison 's service in this capacity , it was his primary object to explain and inculcate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to promote the means leading to such amelioration . The unsuccessful attempt to vest Congress with powers immediately required for the public wants , led to the meeting at Annapolis in August , 17% , to which Mr. Madison was deputed , and which resulted in a recommendation of the Convention with fuller powers at Philadelphia , in May , 1787 . The State of Vir*nia promptly set the example of compliance with this recommendation , by an act drawn by Mr. Madison , and by the appointment of a deputation , in which he was included . From 1784 to 1786 inclusive , beside what related to the federal system , several subjects of great importar*ce were agitated in the Virginia legislature : paper money , British debts , the separation of Kentucky from Virginia , the code of laws revised by Jefferson , Wythe , and Pendleton , and the religious establishment proposed by Mr. Henry . Mr. Madison took a conspicuous and effective part in all these proceedings against paper emissions , in favor of paying British debts , in favor of the separation of Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in opposition to a religious establishment . To the latter project he was strenuously and successfully an explicit antagonist ; and he composed the memorial and remonstrance , which was so generally concurred in and signed by persons of all denominations , as to crush Mr. Henry 's scheme . The journal of the federal Convention which sat at Philadelphia in 1787 , proves that he participated , as much as any member of that body , in framing the Constitution of the United States , which for now nearly fifty years has been the government of this country . For many years the survivor of all his associates in that illustrious assembly , Mr. Madison became entitled by various claims before his death to be called the Father of the Constitution . During the same period , and until the expiration of the old Congress , to which he had been re.appointed in 1786 , he continued a member of that body . His avowed object in returning there was to prevent , if possible , the project favored , by Congress , of shutting up the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of the Convention at Philadelphia for framing the Federal Constitution , and the meeting of the State Conventions to sanction it , the well-known work called the Federalist was written , which has since become a constitutional text-book . Gideon 's edition authenticates Mr. Madison 's contributions to it , and it is too well known to require that it should be dwelt upon . Till his country was secured , and its welfare established by a proper form of national government , Mr. Madison was indefatigable in his efforts to explain and recommend the Constitution for adoption . Accordingly , in 178S , he was elected by his county a // delegate to the Convention of Virginia , which was to determine whether that State would accede to it . His agency in the proceedings of that Convention appears in the printed account of them , and is too familiar with every person whose attention has beea turned to the subject , to require explanation . On the adoption of the Constitution , he was elected a representative to Congress from the distPct in which he lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelections till March , 1797 . His participation , during those eight years , in all the acts and deliberations of Congress was so prominent and pervading , that nothing of importance took place without his instrumentality ; and in most of the leading measures his was a leading place , especially in all that concerned foreign relations . Addressing the house on all important questions , he never spoke without full preparation , and so completely exhausted every topic he discussed , that it was remarked by his adversaries that Mr. Madison 's refutation of their views frequently suggested arguments which they themselves had not thought of ' , to be answered by him in the same triumphant strain of calm and respectful , but irresistible argument . The resolutions of the Legislature of Virginia in 1798 , against the alien and sedition laws , are now known to have been written by Mr. Madison , though not a member of that legislature . And it being understood that a vindication of those resolutions would be called for , he was elected a member the next year , and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the papers of the Federalist , has become a standard of constitutional doctrine . Mr. Jefferson being chosen President of the United States in 1801 , appointed Mr. Madison his Secretary of State ; in which office he continued during the eight years of Jefferson 's presidency , illustrating the whole period by his masterly writings and judicious participation . This is not the occasion for a full view of his performances in the Department of State ; but it may be said , in a word , that of all the great disputes on international and municipal law evolved by an epoch that at last , after great difficulties and efforts to avert hostilities , closed with the war which it was Mr. T*'Iadison 's destiny to conduct as Chief Magistrate ,  --  the complicated questions of the conflicting rights of war and peace , colonial commerce , contraband trade , impressment of seamen , search and seizure of ships and cargoes , blockades , embargoes , non-importation and non-intercourse ,  --  there was not one which Mr. Madison did not present to his country , and before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the annals of diplomatic writing . In 1805 , he visited Philadelphia for more convenient access to the best treatises on the subject of a pamphlet he published in 1800 , on the I3ritsh doctrine against the trade of neutrals with // enemies colonies . Throughout every succeeding year the country was enlightened by his elaborate productions , which every session of Congress brought forth . On the question of impressment , the most trying and perplexing of the grievances to which the United States were then subjected , his letters to the American ministers in England , and the British ministers in this country , were composed with a power equal to all we coi*jd desire , and in a temper which it was impossible for them to ta ? *e offe.nce at . It has been said of him , that give Mr. Madison the right side of a good cause , and no man could surpass him in its vindication . The Department of State at that time was the main stay of the country . Doubting the ability of the United States to contend in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and sea ; at all events , deeply interested in adhering to that neutrality which Washington established , and to which no one was more thoroughly $ attached than Mr. Madison ; his exertions to substitute the moral artillery of international law for brute force were incessant and intense . Although the war he endeavoured so earnestly to prevent came at last , in spite of his exertions and Mr. Jefferson 's immoveable determination to preserve peace ; yet the legacy of trouble which was left by him to Mr. Madison , when he succeeded to the presidency , was at any rate preceded by a theory of prevailing , if not perpetual peace , in that code of international justice and fair intercourse which is now a goodly part of the inheritance of these United States , and a national property that all other civilized nations have begun to appreciate . Peace on earth and good will to all mankind , were always principles dear to him . War he considered only and rarely tolerable , as , if even a necessary , a great evil , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closed as soon , as possible . With these impressions it was nevertheless his lot to be Presi dent during the war declared against Great Britain in June , * 1812 . In 1809 he was elected President , on the retirement of Mr. Jefferson ; and excepting the mere glimpse of accommodation which proceeded from Mr. Erskine 's short-lived arrangement , the first period of his chief magistracy was but the prelude to the war that accompftnied his redection . His inaugural addresses , annual messages , frequent special communications to Congress ; his proclamation for a fact , with the particular grounds on which it was issued ; his letters to Governor Snyder , of Pennsylvania , in the Olmstead case ; his recommendation of war ; his conduct of the war ; his various missions for peace ; the peace of Ghent negotiated under his auspices ; his settlement of the army , navy , and the internal revenue at the close of the war ; his veto , on one of the last days of his administration , of the great system of internal improvement introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unconstitutional ; -.  - -  these , together with the Bank of the Th S. , may be deemed the principal measures of his administration of the Federal Government . Even before Mr. Madison 's demise , there appeared to be well nigh one universal sentiment of cordial respect and deference towards him as a patriot of the purest intentions and wisest conduct . lJndertaking the presidency at a crisis of the utmost difficulty , he continue*in it by reelection during the established period of eight years , * when he retired , left the country in the highest degree glorious , prosperous , and content . Future ages must look back to his administration as a time of great trial and great renown . The Constitution which had succeeded in peace , under his governance , triumphed in war . While hostilities were checkered with the reverses which seldom fail to occur , under all circumstances Mr. Madison was the same . Victory never elated , nor could disasters ever depress him , heyonil the happy mean of his temperate life ; always calm , consistent , and conscientious , determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( l to that deluge of abuse which the leading men of free countries , with a licentious press , can not avoid , he was perfectly serene and unmoved by any vindictive emotion ; true to friends , patient with adversaries , and forbearing even with public enemies . All the emergencies of ivar never once betrayed him into infrinoements of the Constitution . It has been stated , on high authority , that while a candidate for the presidency , no one , however intimate , ever heard him mention the subject . Constitutionally simple and unostentatious in his habits , taste , and intercourse , he nevertheless maintaine ( l the dignity of his station with a decorum and urbanity that lent new grace to the duties of his office . At about sixty-six years of age he retired from public life , and ever after resided on his estate in Virginia , except about two months while at Richmond as a member of the convention in 1829 , to remould the constitution of that State . His farm , his books , his friends , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the twenty years of his retirement . During most of that time his health , never robust , was as good as usual , and he partook with alacrity of the exercise and the conviviality in which he had always enjoyed himself . A good farmer on a large scale , he acted for some time as president of an agricultural society , nn ( 1 for a much longer time first as visiter , and after Mr. Jefferson 's death as rector of the University of Virginia , at Charlottesville , in his near neighbourhood ; among the founders and friends of which he bore a conspicuous part . Prevailed upon , when just convalescent from severe illness , to be a member of the Virginia convention of 1829 , the infirm condition of his health , being then near eighty years old , prevented his taking a very active part in its deliberations . His main purpose , indeed , appears to // have been to promote a compromise between parties so stiffly divided on local and personal interests as to threaten the tranquillity of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understood to have yielded his own opinions to that consideration , as well as the urgent instances of his constituents . At eighty-five years of age , though much reduced by debility , his mind was bright , his memory retentive , and his conversation highly instructive and delightful . Suffe*ng with disease , he never repined . Serene , sociable and animated , he loved to discuss the Constitution , to inculcate the public good , strictly abstaining from party topics , and to charge his friends with blessings for his country . He was long one of the most interesting shrines to which its votaries repaired : a relic of republican virtue which none could contemplate without reverence and edification . One of his most striking characteristics was tenderness for the feelings , and deference for the opinion , of others ; always anxious to avoid giving offence , though frequently so situated as to be obliged to adhere to his own convictions , and differ sometimes with his best friends . Towards his numerous dependents and domestics on extensive plantations , he was uniformly kind ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from colonial dependence . He was actively alive to every feasible project for mitigating or removing these evils . The respectable gentleman who was his physician towards the latter part of his life , bears cordial testimony to the compassionate interest with which every member of his family , in common with their amiable and illustrious head , never failed to manifest for those who were by law his much regretted property . At periods towards the termination of his career , when conflicting sentiments on important questions agitate ( l the country , and when urged by zealous and importunate friends to let his views be known , he was always disposed diffidently to decline interference ; but every visiter of his hospitable mansion must have been struck with his patriotic devotion to his country , and with his veneration for that Union of which he was one of the original founders , and ever remained the enthusiastic and honest advocate . His attachment to the Constitution amounted almost to a passion , and , whenevei* the subject was at all relevant , he never failed to inculcate his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . One of his last acts , shortly before he died , was to reduce to writing the following patriotic aspiration , as it was communicated by his excellent widow . " ADVICE TO MY cOUNTRY . " As this advice , if it ever see the light , will not do it till I am no more , it may be considered as issuing fiorn the tomb , where troth alone can be respected , and the happiness of man consulted . It will he entitled , therefore , to whatever weight can be derived tom good intentions , and from the experience of one who has served his // country in various stations through a period of forty years , who espoused in his youth , and adhered through his life to the cause of its liberty , and who has borne a part in most of the great transactions which will constitute epochs of its destiny . " The advice nearest to my heart and deepest in my convictions , is , that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated . Let the avowed enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , and the disguised one as the serpent creeping with deadly wiles into Paradise . " As a leading member of the convention which framed the government , of the Congresses which organized it , of the administration of Jefferson , which conducted it for a long time in the path it has since for the most part followed , and finally as the head of his own administration in the most trying time , when the exigencies of war were superadded to the occasions of peace , no individual has impressed more of his mind , either theoretically or practically , on American institutions , than James Madison . Until within a short period of his decease , Mr. Madison continued to keep pace with the passing literature of the day . Most American writers were proud to lay their productions before him ; and he was a subscriber to the best periodicals . He was consequently acquainted with every tiling literary that was of interest , and devoted no small attention to science ; - most attached , perhaps , to the practical pursuit of natural history , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memher of his family , of whom we ventured to request information of his religious sentiments-on which subject , though an excellent biblical scholar , and otherwise well informed , he was always remarkably silent-answered by the significant assurance that he was good and perfect in religion and domestic life , and that nothing short of true religion can make man so . On the 28th June , 1830 , he dhd-as serene , philosophical , and calm in the last moments of existence , as he had been in all the trying occasions of life . President Jackson announced the event to Congress in a communication calling on that body for such measures as were proper to testify their sense of the respect due to the memory of one whose life had contributed so essentially to the happiness and glory of his country , and the good of mankind . And ex-president Adams in his eloquent address to the House of Representatives , of Which he was a member , dwelt on the merits of the venerable statesman , to whose memory appropriate honors were unanimously voted . Congress soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his private Journal of the Debates of the Convention which formed the Constitution of the United States , and others of his papers . They also conferred the franking privilege on his widow ; and the whole American people , grown under his auspices from a small to a g.reat nation , with one accord pronounced the spontaneous and cordial obituary eulogium of the honored and venerated Madison.
