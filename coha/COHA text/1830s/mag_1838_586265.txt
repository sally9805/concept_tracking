txt THE subject of this brief memorial had barely begun to be an actor in the great scenes where his part could not have failed to be a prominent one . The nation did not have time to recognize him . His death , aside from the shock with which the manner of it has thrilled every bosom , is looked upon merely as causing a vacancy in the delegation of his State , which a new member may fill as creditably as the departed . It will , perhaps , be deemed praise enough to say of Cilley , that lie would have proved himself an active and efficient partisan . But those who knew him longest an ( l most intimately , conscious of his high talents and rare qualities-his energy of mind and force of character-must claim much more than such a meed for their lost friend . They feel that not merely a party nor a section , but our collective country , has lost a man who had the heart and the ability to serve her well . It would be doing injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if , in paying a farewell tribute to his memory , we were to ask a narrower sympathy than that of the people at large . May no bitterness of party prejudices influence him who writes , nor those , of whatever political opinions , who may read ! Jonathan Cilley was born at Nottingham , New Hampshire , on the second of July , 1802 . His grandfather , Col. Joseph Cilley , commanded a New Hampshire regiment during the Revolutionary war , and established a character for energy and intrepi ( lity of which more than one of his descendants have proved themselves the inheritors . Greenleaf Cilley , son of the preceding , died in 1808 , leaving a family of four sons and three daughters . The aged mother of this family , and the three daughters , are still living . Of the sons , the only survivor is Joseph Cilley , who was an officer in the late war , and served with great distinction on the Canadian frontier . Jonathan , being desirous of a liberal education , commenced his studies at Atkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a member of the Freshman Class of Bowdoin College , Brunswick , Maine , in 1821 . Inheriting but little property from his father , he adopted the usual expedient of a young New Englander in similar circumstances , and gained a small income by teaching a country school during the winter months , both before and after his entrance at college . Cilley 's character and standing at college afforded high promise of usefulness and distinction in after life . Though not the foremost scholar of his class , he stood in the front rank ; and probably derived all the real benefit from the prescribed course of study that it could bestow on so practical a mind . His true education // consisted in the exercise of those faculties which fitted him to be a popular leader . His influence among his fellow-students was probably greater than that of any other individual ; and he had already made himself powerful , in that limited sphere , by a free and natural eloquence ,  --  a flow of pertinent ideas , in langua be of unstudied appropriateness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had calculated . This gift was sometimes displayed in class-meetings , when measures , important to those concerned , were under discussion ; sometimes in mock trials at law , when judge , jury , lawyers , prisoner , and witnesses , were personated by the students , and Cilley played the part of a fervid and successful advocate ; and besides these exhibitions of power , he regularly trained himself in the forensic debates of a literary society , of which he afterwards became president . Nothing could be less artificial than his style of oratory . After tilling his mind with the necessary information , he trusted every thing else to his mental warmth and the inspiration of the moment , and poured himself out with an earnest and irresistible simplicity . There was a singular contrast between the flow of thought from his lips , and the coldness and constraint with which he wrote ; and though , in maturer life , he acquired a considerable facility in exercising the pen , he always felt the tongue to be his peculiar instrument . In private intercourse , Cilley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard him with the kindliest fedings , because his companions were intuitively certain of a like kindliness on his part . He had a power of sympathy which enabled him to understand every character , and hold communion with human nature in all its varieties . He never shrank from the intercourse of man with man ; and it was to his freedom in this particular that he owed much of his subsequent popularity , among a people who are accustomed to take a personal interest in the men whom they elevate to office . In few words , let us characterize him at the outset of life as a young man of quick and powerful intellect ; endowed with sagacity and tact , yet frank and free in his mode of action ambitious of good influence , earnest , active , and persevering ; with an elasticity and cheerful strength of mind which made difficulties easy , and the struggle with them a pleasure . Mingled with the amiable qualities that were like sunshine to his friends , there were harsher and sterner traits which fitted him to make head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of need that the iron frame-work of his character became perceptible . Immediately on quitting college , Mr. Cilley took up his residence in Thomaston , and began the study of law in the office of John Ruggles , Esq. , now a Senator in Congress . Mr. Ruggles being then a prominent member of the Democratic party , it was natural that the pupil should lend his aid to promote the political views of // his instructor ; especially as he would thus uphold the principles which he had cherished from boyhood . From year to year , the election of Mr. Ruggles to the State Legislature was strongly opposed . Cilley 's services in overcoming this opposition were too valuable to be dispensed with ; and thus , at a period when most young men still stand aloof from the world , he had already taken his post as a leading politician . He afterwards fouad cause to regret that so much time had been abstracted from his professional studies ; nor did the absorbing and exciting nature of his political career afford him any subsequent opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was admitted an attorney at law in 1829 , and , in April of the same year , was married to Miss Deborah Prince , daughter of Hon. Hezekiah Prince , of Thomaston , where Mr. Cilley continued to reside , and entered upon the practice of his profession . In 1831 , Mr. Ruggles having been appointed a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas , it became necessary to send a new representative from Thomaston to the Legislature of the State . Mr. Cilley was brought forward as the Democratic candidate , obtained his election , and took his seat in January , 1832 . But , in the course of this year , the friendly relations between Judge Ruggles and Mr. Cilley were broken off . The former gentleman , it appears , had imbibed the idea that his political aspirations ( which were then directed towards a seat in the Senate of the United States ) did not receive all the aid which he was disposed to claim from , the influence of his late pupil . When , therefore , Mr. Cilley was held up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of Judge Ruggles and his adherents was exerted against him . This was the first act and declaration of a political hostility which was too warm and earnest not to become in some degree personal ; and which rendered Mr. Cilley 's subsequent career a continual struggle with those to whom he might naturally have looked for friendship and support . It sets his abilities and force of character in the strongest light , to view him , at the very outset of public life , without the aid of powerful connections , an isolated young man , forced into a position of hostility , not merely with the enemies of his party , but likewise with a large body of its adherents , even accused of treachery to its principles , yet gaining triumph after triumph , and making his way steadily onward . Surely his was a mental and moral energy which death alone could have laid pro-strate ! We have the testimony of those who knew Mr. Cilley well , that his own feelings were never so embittered by these conflicts as to prevent him from interchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While their resentments rendered his very presence intolerable to them , he could address them with as // much ease and composure as if their mutual relations had been those of perfect harmony . There was no affectation in this : it was the good-natured consciousness of his own strength that enabled him to keep his temper ; it was the same chivalrous sentiment which impels hostile warriors to shake hands in the intervals of battle . Mr. Cilley was slow to withdraw his confidence from any man whom he deemed a friend ; and it has been mentioned as almost his only weak point , that he was too apt to suffer himself to be betrayed before he would condescend to suspect . his prejudices , however , when once adopted , partook of the depth and strength of his character , and could not be readily overcome ; he loved to subdue his foes ; but no man could use a triumph more generously than he . Let us resume our narrative . In spite of the opposition of Judge Ruggles and his friends , combined with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1833 , and was equally successful in each of the succeeding years , until his election to Congress . He was five successive years the representative of Thomaston . In 1834 , when Mr. Dunlap was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Governor , Mr. Cilley gave his support to Governor Smith , in the belief that the substitution of a new candidate had been unfairly effected . He considered it a stratagem , intended to promote the election of Judge Ruggles to the Senate of the United States . Early in the legislative session of the same year , the Ruggles party obtained a temporary triumph over Mr. Cilley , effected his expulsion from the Democratic caucuses , and attempted to stigmatize him as a traitor to his political friends . But Mr. Cilley 's high and honorable course was ere long under stood and appreciated by his party and the people . He told them , openly and boldly , that they might undertake to expel him from their caucuses , but they could not expel him from the Democratic party ; they might stigmatize him with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height on which he stood , nor shake his position with the people . But a few weeks had elapsed , and Mr. Cilley was the acknowledged head and leader of that party in the Legislature . During the same session , Mr. Speaker Clifford ( one of the friends of Judge Ruggles ) being appointed Attorney General , the Ruggles party were desirous of securing the election of another of their adherents to the chair ; but as it was obvious that Mr. Cilley 's popularity would gain him the place , the incumbent was induced to delay his resignation till the end of the term . At the session of 1835 , Messrs . Cilley , Davee , and McCrate , being candidates for the chair , Mr. Cilley withdrew in favor of Mr. Davee . That gentleman was accordingly elected , but being soon afterwards appointed Sheriff of Somerset county , Mr. Cilley succeeded him as Speaker , and filled the same office during the session of 1836 . All // parties awarded him the praise of being the best presiding officer that the House ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Democratic electors of the Lincoln Congressional District as their candidate for Congress . That district has recently shown itself to possess a decided Whig majority ; and this would have been equally the case in 1836 had any other man than Mr. Cilley appeared on the Democratic side . He had likewise to contend , as in all the former scenes of his political life , with that portion of his own party which adhered to Mr. Ruggles . There was still another formidable obstacle , in the high character of Judge Bailey , who then represented the district , and was a candidate for re-election . All those difficulties , however , served only to protract the contest , but could not snatch the victory from Mr. Cilley , who obtained a majority of votes at the third trial . It was a fatal triumph ! In the summer of 1837 , a few months after his election to Congress , I met Mr. Cilley for the first time since early youth , when he had been to me almost as an elder brother . The two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to renew our former intimacy . In his person there was very little change , and that little was for the better ; he had an impending brow , deep-set eyes , and a thin and thoughtful countenance , which , in his abstracted moments , seemed almost stern ; but , in the intercourse of society , it was brightened with a liindlv smile , that will live in the recollection of all who knew him . His manners had not a fastidious polish , but were characterized by the simplicity of one who had dwelt remote from cities , holding free companionship with the yeoman of the land . I thought him as true a representative of the people as ever theory could portray ; his earlier and later habits of life , his feelings , partiahities , and prejudices , were those of the people ; the strong and shrewd sense , which constituted so marked  --  a feature of his mind , was but a higher degree of the popular intellect . He loved the people , and respected them , and was prouder of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l ) ublie interests to his care . His continual struggles in the political arena had strengthened his bones and sinews ; opposition had kept him ardent ; while success had cherished the generous warmth of his nature , and assisted the growth both of his powers and sympathies . Disappointment might have soured and contracted him ; but it appeared to me that his triumphant warfare had been no less beneficial to his heart than to his mind . I was aware , indeed , that his harsher traits had grown apace with his milder ones-that he possessed iron resolution , indomitable perseverance , and an almost terrible energy  - -   - -  *ut the'e features had imparted no hardness to his character in private iv tercourse . In the hour of public need these strong qualities would have shown themselves the most prominent ones , and // would have encouraged his countrymen to rally round him as one of their natural leaders . In his private and domestic relations , Mr. Cilley was most exemplary ; and he enjoyed no less happiness than he conferred . He had been the father of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  leaving , I thought , a more abiding impression of tenderness and regret , than the death of infants usually makes on the masculine mind . Two boys , the elder seven or eight years of age , and the younger two , still remained to him ; and the fondness of these children for their father-their evident enjoyment of his societywas proof enough of his gentle and amiable character within the precincts of his family . In that bereaved household there is now another child , whom the father never saw . Mr. Cilley 's domestic habits were simple and primitive to a degree unusual in most parts of our country , among men of so eminent a station as he had attained . It made me smile , though with any thing but scorn , in contrast to the aristocratic stateliness which I have witnessed elsewhere , to see him driving home his own cow , after a long search for her through the village . That trait alone would have marked him as a man whose greatness lay within himself . He appeared to take much interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of flowers . He kept bees , and told me that be loved to sit for whole hours by the hives , watching the labors of the insects , and soothed by the hum with which they filled the air . I glance at these minute particulars of his daily life , because they form so strange a contrast with the circumstances of his death . Who could have believed that , with his thoroughly New England character , in so short a time after I had seen him in that peaceful and happy home , among those simple occupations and pure enjoyments , he would be stretched in his own blood-slain for an almost impalpable punctilio ! It is not my purpose to dwell upon Mr. Cilley 's brief career in Congress . Brief as it was , his character and talents had more than begun to be felt , and would soon have linked his name with the history of every important measure , and have borne it onward with the progress of the principles which he supported . He was not eager to seize opportunities of thrusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned him , lie came forward , and poured forth his ready and natural eloquence with as much effect in the councils of the nation , as he had done in those of his own State . With every effort that he made , the hopes of his party rested more decidedly upon him , as one who would hereafter be found in the vanguard of many a Democratic victory . Let me spare myself the details of the awful catastrophe by which all those proud hopes perished ; for I write with a blunted pen and a // hand benumbed , and am the less able to express my feelings as they lie deep at heart and inexhaustible . On the 23d of February last , Mr. Cilley received a challenge from Mr. Graves , of Kentucky , through the hands of Mr. Wise , of Virginia . This measure , as is declared in the challenge itself , was grounded on Mr. Cilley 's refusal to receive a message , of which Mr. Graves had been the bearer , from a person of disputed respectability ; although no exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cilley ; nor need such an inference have been drawn , unless Mr. Graves were conscious that public opinion held his friend in a doubtful light . The challenge was accepted , and the parties met on the following day . They exchanged two shots with rifles . After each shot , a conference was held between the friends of both parties , and the most generous avowals of respect and kindly feeling were made , on the part of Mr. Cilley , towards his antagonist , but without avail . A third shot was exchanged , and Mr. Cilley fell dead into the arms of one of his friends . While I write , a Committee of Investigation is sitting upon this affair ; but the public has not waited for its award ; and the writer , in accordance with the public , has formed his opinion on the official statement of Messrs . Wise and Jones . A challenge was never given on a more shadowy pretext ; a duel was never pressed to a fatal close in the face of such open kindness as was expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Graves , and his principal second , Mr. Wise , have gone farther than their own dreadful code will warrant them , and overstepped the imaginary distinction which , on their own principles , separates manslaughter from murder . Alas , that , over the grave of a dear friend , my sorrow for the bereavement must be mingled with another grief-that he threw away such a life in so miserable a cause ! Why , as he was true to the Northern character in all things else , did he swerve from his Northern principles in this final scene ! But his error was a generous one ; since he fought for what he deemed the honor of New England ; and now that death has paid the forfeit , the most rigid may forgive him . If that dark pitfall-that bloody grave-had not lain in the midst of his path , whither , whither might it not have led him ! It has ended there ; yet , so strong was my conception of his energies-so like Destiny did it appear , that he should achieve every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not dwell upon his grave , but pictures him still amid the struggles and triumphs of the present and the future . NOTE . To make the above sketch complete , only a slight notice of subsequent events remains necessary . On the results of the ' investi , , ation ordered by the House , it is // not appropriate here to speak ,  --  further than the remark , that the evidence confirmed , in the strongest manner , all that Cilley 's warmest friends could have wished , as to his noble , mild , and generous bearing , in every point of view , through all the stages of the affair . That is all with which we can have to do here . The bearing of that evidence upon the surviving parties we leave to their consciences , their country , and their God . It has no proper connection with our sketch of the deceased ; who is now far beyond the sphere of any of those feelings of human resentments , which it would seem almost a profanity to the still sacredness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brin0 to the grave where " After life 's fitful fever he sleeps well . " His public funeral , as a Member of Congress , was , to the most careless stranger , one of the most impressive , and to his friends , one of the most heart-rending , scenes , it has ever been our fortune to witness . The most exalted tributes of respect and grief were paid to his memory from many quarters . Especially we feel bound to refer to the proceedings of a large meeting in Augusta , Maine , March the ninth , 1838 , composed of members of the Legislature then in session , and citizens from various sections of the State ; at which a long series of resolutions were adopted , deeply imbued with the strongest feelings on the subject ,  --  for which the reader is referred to the papers of the day . His remains were removed from the Congressionel burying ground , at Washington , to Thomaston , where they were re-interred with public solemnities , described as havina been of the most touching and impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance connected with that occasion , we can not omit to rescue from the oblivion of the newspaper columns of the day , by recording it here . On the Sunday succeeding the Saturday on which Mr. Cilley fell , his wife , the unconscious widow of the husband then lying dead , turning accidentally to a particular pa* , e in her Hymn Book ( 5*8th Hymn from Winchell 's Watts , of the selection , ) was impressed with peculiar feelings which induced her to mark it with a pencil . The recollection of it recurring to her mind some weeks after , caused her to turn a am to it ; and that was the Hymn , of which the following is a copy , which was sun on the occasion of his funeral . Its appropriateness to the situation of the widowed and heart-broken mother of his orphaned children will not fail to impress and interest every reader : Far , far o'er hill and dale , on the winds stealin List to the telling hell , mournfnlly pealing : Hark ! hark ! it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beet jays decay , XVhilst new their feeling . Now throngb the charmed air slowly ascending , List to the mourner 's prayer solemnly bending : Hark ! hark ! it seems to say , Torn from those joys away To those which ne'er decay , For life is ending . O'er a father 's dismal tomb see the orphan bending , From the solemn church yard 's gloom hear the dirge ascending : Hark ! hark ! it seems to say , How short ambition 's sway , Life 's joys and friendship 's ray , In the dark grave ending . So when our mortal ties death shall dissever , Lord , may we reach the skies , where care comes never , And in eternal day , Joining the angels ' lay , To our Creator pay Homage forever.
