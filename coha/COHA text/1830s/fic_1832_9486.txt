WOMAN 'S REVENGE The autograph manuscript of Woman 's Revenge , dated 1832 , is in the Harvard collection . Extant also in the British Museum ( L.C. 2/25/32 ) is the copy , in an unknown hand , submitted to the licenser for acting ; this , however is incomplete , as it contains only the dialogue , which is at times illegible . In the following text , the dialogue from the licenser 's copy is reproduced as far as possible ; and legible readings , when necessary , and the stage directions are taken from the Harvard manuscript . The play , a one-act burletta , was performed on February 27 , 1832 , at the Olympic and revived about thirty times during the year . In The Examiner for March 4 it is reviewed with approval : " Vestris does not allow the interest of her Olympic to flag for want of novelty . Woman 's Revenge was produced on Monday , with complete success ; ... it is well imagined , well written , and , for the most part , well played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French influence ; if the play is from a French source Payne has Anglicized it completely . Although several French and English plays have somewhat similar titles , such as Sdaine 's comic opera Les Femmes Venges , ou Les Feintes Infidlits , acted 1775 , or Cuvelier 's pastoral pantomime , La Damoisel et La Bergerette , ou La Femme Vindicative , 1799 , or Bullock 's satire of rogue life A Woman 's Revenge ; or , A Match in Newgate , 1715 , the similarity goes no farther . The strength of the play lies in the vigor with which the wealthy spinster Miss Flashington is sketched , and its weakness in the sentimental treatment of a stock theme , the rescue from financial distress , which is used by many of Payne 's contemporaries , among them John Buckstone in Luke the Labourer ; or , The Lost Son , performed 1826 , or Thomas Morton in Education , 1813 . Its morality , as The Examiner points out , is extremely dubious : " The author should have avoided the foolish and unprincipled commonplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being paid what is due to them . The balance of scoundrelism is usually on the other side .

Scene 1 : An elegant apartment in the country mansion of Miss Flashington . Right hand , a work table . Enter Fag cautiously , on tiptoe . Fag . Fag Alone Hist ! Mr. Merton , hist ! Not here ? Yet he seemed all anxiety for me to come to him forthwith . Ah , nothing can be done in this village without Fag , that 's clear . I do everybody 's business and get nobody 's respect . Miss Flashington heard outside Miss F. Miss Flashington Outside , vehemently Well , sister , and what if I am ? Fag . Fag That must be young Merton 's Aunt Flashington . She always , they say , comes , like a witch , in a whirlwind . Vanish , Fag ! She does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for Master Merton just now that she should not . Vanish , my boy , vanish ! Exit Fag , left hand . Enter Miss Flashington , very rapidly , followed by Mrs. Simper , very slowly . Right hand Miss F. Miss Flashington And what if I am , I say ? Why do n't you answer me ? That provoking serenity of yours would be enough to worry me into a fever , if I had no other cause . Why do n't you talk ? Oh , how I hate your sneaking , silent ones who ca n't even be scolded into a speech . They drive me mad . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper But , my dear , Frank Merton is my nephew as well as yours , and you see I do n't fly into a passion about his follies . Miss F. Miss Flashington Passion ? Ha ! Ha ! You in a passion ! You have n't the value of a passion in you . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper If he annoys you , cast him off . He is entirely dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an aunt ! Cast him off , I cast off Frank Merton ! Oh , how that 's you all over , Wilhelmina Simper . You would not quarrel with the poor fellow , but you 'd cast him off . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper If you do n't , dear , he 'll be your ruin . Miss F. Miss Flashington He 'll be no such thing . Good lad ! With such a heart ! But he sha n't bring me to beggary . If the rascal thinks I 'll forgive him , he 'll find himself woefully mistaken . I 've sacrificed enough for him already . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Aye , you have indeed ! Even matrimony itself . Miss F. Miss Flashington Not I. I never yet found a man worthy to be my husband . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper You did not think so , my dear , when Sir Thomas Dillon  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Mrs. Simper , have I not forbidden you ever to mention that person 's name in my hearing ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody knows that to devote yourself to the bringing up of that scapegrace , Frank , you have refused as many offers  --  Miss F.

Enter Frank Merton Mer . Frank Merton Ah , my dearest aunt  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington None of that . Take off that insinuating , hypocritical face of yours . It wo n't do , sir . How very like he is to poor sister Laura , is n't he ? And how very like you are , sir , to that father of yours , who robbed you of all your fortune and left you a resourceless orphan , when you ought to have been rich enough to have supported us all in splendor . Mer . Frank Merton With a friend like you , excellent aunt , I could never feel the improvidence of my father . Miss F. Miss Flashington Did n't I tell you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worth a hundred of you . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Do you think , my dear , that your father would have squandered in three months an allowance to support a prince for a year ? Miss F. Miss Flashington Aye , what have you done with that last three thousand pounds ? I know what you 'll say : you 'll pretend you 've spent it in  --  in  --  in the Lord knows what ! But it is no such thing : you 're a gambler , sir . Mer . Frank Merton Upon my soul , no ! Miss F. Miss Flashington Not a gambler ! Have you the effrontery With a sort of chuckle of delight which she in vain strives to hide to say you  --  you  --  you 're not a gambler ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Sister , you do n't give him time to say anything . Miss F. Miss Flashington Not give him time !

Frank Merton You are aware , dear aunt , how very fond I am of hunting  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington You do n't mean to pretend you 've spent three thousand guineas in hunting ! Do you think I 've forgotten that I fitted you out with horses and hounds and a provision for keeping them like a gentleman as you are , not eighteen months ago  --  Mer . Frank Merton Perhaps , aunt , you may remember the day when I followed the hounds some six and twenty miles from this  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington And did not return till the evening following ! I do remember it , Frank . It was a year ago yesterday . And I 'm sorry I do ; for what I remember of my misery when I was waiting your return that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attached to you than it is in your composition , you unfeeling varlet , to deserve . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper But let the lad speak , dear  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Speak ! Of course I will . Who prevents his speaking ? Well , you were hunting a year ago  --  come , out with it . But let me take my work and sit down first ; for a story beginning from a year ago can be no trifle in the telling . Enter John What do you want , hey ? I 'm busy . Do n't come to disturb me , sir , when you see I 'm busy . John . John Beg pardon , ma'am , but Farmer Dobbins is below and says if you could only let him speak to you a moment  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Nothing but vexation . Why ca n't people come at proper times ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Bid Dobbins wait , John . Bid him wait . Miss F. Miss Flashington Bid him do no such thing , John . The time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is only the rich that have leisure and they are robbers when they force the poor to wait . Mrs. S.

He is about falling on his knees No antics , here , sir . John ! Enter John The pony chaise this instant , and drive this booby to his farm . Exit John Dob .

Turning to Merton And now , you disgrace to all your family , you thought to escape in the confusion , did you ? Draw near , sir , draw near , and let me drag the truth from you , if possible , respecting your enormities . Mer . Frank Merton You will scarcely think them such when you know all . Miss F. Miss Flashington Indeed ! You think to smooth me down with your fine speeches , hey ! It wo n't do . Mer . Frank Merton I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Miss Flashington Why do n't you , then ? Have n't I been waiting here this hour and not a word of anything but rigmarole can I get from you yet . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Do n't be abashed . You were telling us , when overtaken by night and rough weather , on a hunting party  --  Mer . Frank Merton Aye , lightning flashed , the darkness was deepening . I was parted from my companions , and both my horse and myself were sinking with fatigue , when , looking about for some inn , I found myself opposite the mansion house of the Dillons . Miss F. Miss Flashington Starting The Dillons ! Mer . Frank Merton What , aunt , and you know the Dillons ? Miss F. Miss Flashington Y  --  y  --  yes  --  yes  --  once , once . Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper We saw a good deal of the present owner of that mansion when we were all younger : a civil gentleman enough , only somewhat the worse for the pride of his family in the noble blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . Miss F. Miss Flashington Aside , with a contemptuous shrug One of us ? Aloud Go on with your story . Mer . Frank Merton The rain beginning to pour down in torrents ; I thought I could not do better than seek shelter there . I knocked at the mansion and found it uninhabited . Miss F. Miss Flashington What ! Dillon dead ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Patience , sister , let him tell it in his own way . Mer . Frank Merton I traversed a courtyard in ruins , passed a pavilion once beautiful , but now degraded into a cattle shed , and at length saw a light in the window of a farmhouse , where I was received with the most endearing hospitality . Miss F. Miss Flashington But Dillon , what had become of Dillon ? Mer . Frank Merton I asked the cause of the desolation I saw around me . I found that the owner of the estate , involved in ruin by the extravagances of a fashionable wife  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Ah , ha ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always knew she would . Miss F. Miss Flashington I do n't believe a word of it . She was always a spendthrift , and I dare say the fault was his own . But right or wrong , the poor woman always got blamed , and you ought to be ashamed of yourself to take part against your sex . Well , why do n't you get on ? What of Dillon ? Mer . Frank Merton His wife being dead  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Dead ! Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper His wife dead ? He 's quite young enough to marry again . Mer . Frank Merton He resumed his post in the army and went abroad , for the double purpose of nursing his property and avoiding his creditors , but the scoundrels took advantage of his absence , and all would have been lost but for his agent , the very farmer beneath whose roof I was sheltered . The worthy fellow with the money he had saved as former steward of the family , kept the cormorants at bay and entered into arrangements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various claims by installments . Miss F. Miss Flashington A worthy deed , a very worthy deed . The man 's an honor to human nature . Mer . Frank Merton I thought so too , and when I heard how oppressed he was to keep pace with these engagements and that , in spite of all he had done , the estate was still liable to instant forfeiture , I think , aunt , you will do me the justice to be persuaded that I could not listen without something more than pity . Miss F. Miss Flashington Right , right , but what has all this to do with the three thousand pounds you squandered ? I call you to account for your extravagance , your wanton , unjustifiable extravagance , and here you come to me with a long story about a broken-down gentleman and a sentimental clodhopper . What became of the three thousand pounds , I say ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Be gentle with him , sister . Proceed deliberately , coolly  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Coolly ! You whose pulses would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Coolness ! What became of the three thousand pounds ? Mer . Frank Merton The farmer , unable to meet his stipulations , allowed me to supply him with the means . Miss F. Miss Flashington And this is what you have done with your three thousand pounds ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper I hope you will give him no more thousands to throw away thus . Miss F. Miss Flashington To save Dillon , for Dillon 's sake , my nephew has left himself penniless and parted with the money he received from me ! Mer . Frank Merton I have stated nothing but the truth . Miss F. Miss Flashington Our early life was passed in that vicinity . We lived next door to the Dillons . Every spot on that estate bears some remembrance of the sweet dreams of childhood . Sister , get your bonnet and shawl . The carriage was ordered for a drive . It shall drive you to the honest farmer 's . Mer . Frank Merton How  --  you ! You go to Farmer Gregory 's ? Miss F. Miss Flashington Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , come . Mer . Frank Merton But suffer me to go before and announce you . Miss F. Miss Flashington You seem rather disturbed , sir , at the idea of my going . Why are you disturbed ? I will go now , if it be only to find out the reason . Mer . Frank Merton Do , aunt , do . Miss F. Miss Flashington And you shall go with me , sister ! Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Give me time to put up my spectacles , dear . Miss F. Miss Flashington What an everlasting dawdle you are , " dear . " Snatching the spectacles Give me the spectacles and come along , " dear . " Catches her under the arm and hurries her out . Fag peeps in on the opposite side Fag . Fag Is the coast clear ? Mer . Frank Merton Fag , fly to Gregory 's  --  Fag . Fag Fly to the nest of my little Annette ? On the light wings of love  --  Mer . Frank Merton Keep your love for your lady love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I have done for Gregory ; but I have not dared to tell her of Sophia . Fag . Fag Shrewd enough . She 'd think the petticoat had more weight with you than the pity  --  Mer . Frank Merton A stronger reason yet : Sophia is the daughter of a woman for whom Dillon jilted my aunt . Contrive in the best way you can to make Gregory keep Sophia out of my aunt 's view . Fag . Fag How should your aunt see her ? Mer . Frank Merton Did n't I tell you she had taken a queer freak in her head to drive post-haste to the farm ? Fag . Fag No ? Mer . Frank Merton She has . Look she do n't get there before you . Miss Flashington calls , outside Miss F. Miss Flashington Outside , calling Merton , I say ! Frank Merton ! Mer . Frank Merton Her voice ! Away ! Remember about Sophia . Fag . Fag Her voice ? Her thunder ! What must her presence be , if that 's her voice ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural spot . In the distance , the family mansion of Major Sir Thomas Dillon . In the foreground , a vine-covered farmhouse , enclosed by a quickset hedge . Opposite to it , some dilapidated buildings . Enter Sophia Dillon , looking out at the back . Soph . Sophia Dillon Alone I may strain my eyes out , not a glimpse of him is to be seen ! This is the third long day ! And then papa 's unexpected arrival in the meantime ! My uneasiness about Merton has prevented my giving my whole heart to rejoicing for papa 's return , and I dare not tell him or anyone else the cause . I am sadly afraid papa will be angry when he knows . Sings 1 . When thou are away , the world 's brightest charms Look , oh , how drear ! But there 's a magic its frown that disarms When thou art near . 2 . When thou art away , even summer 's beams All cold appear ! But the coldest winter sweet summer seems Beside thee , dear ! Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter , miss ? I hope you 're not ill . I never saw you so sad and thoughtful before . Now a sigh , then a quiet little tear , and then up you are on tiptoe and peeping out , first on one side , then on the other . One would say you were looking for somebody . Soph . Sophia Dillon Whom should I look for ? Whom have we to expect , now dear papa is come back to us ? We never see anybody but , now and then , Fag . Greg . Farmer Gregory You forget Mr. Merton ; and really , I begin to fear he has forgotten us , though I never longed for anyone 's appearance more heartily than I do for his this very moment . Soph . Sophia Dillon I 'm sure , if he do n't like to come , he 's welcome to stay where he is . Greg . Farmer Gregory Looking out Hey ! What ? Who 's that I see ? Soph . Sophia Dillon Where ? Where ? Greg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stile . Confusion ! That is not he . Soph . Sophia Dillon Fag ! I 'm sure nobody wanted Fag . I 'll go away . But soft . He can give us intelligence perhaps of  --  I 'll not go away  --  Enter Fag , left hand Fag . Fag Ah , Farmer , how goes it among ye , hey ? Beg pardon , miss . Hope you 're well , miss ; and your charming daughter , Annette , Farmer , hope she 's well , too . Hope you 're all well . Greg . Farmer Gregory Annette is gone to be bridesmaid at the next village . She 's away for the week . But pray , have you seen Mr. Merton lately , Fag ? It is half a week since he was here , and that 's a long time for him to stop away . Fag . Fag Mr. Gregory , it is from him I come , minister plenipotentiary upon a special embassy . Soph . Sophia Dillon Then he 's not coming at all ? Fag . Fag I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say , I am bound to say  --  Soph . Sophia Dillon Well ? Fag . Fag In private to Farmer Gregory . Shocked to seem rude , but affairs of state require to be managed with diplomatic caution . Soph . Sophia Dillon Oh , if Mr. Merton has secrets , I 'm sure I  --  I  --  have no wish  --  to be  --  inquisitive , not I. Good morning , sir . Exit Sophia Fag . Fag Off in a huff . Natural enough , hey , Farmer , hey ? Greg . Farmer Gregory She is only concerned , as I am , at Mr. Merton 's unusually long absence . The last installment was to be paid today , and unless he aids me  --  Fag . Fag The dickens it was ! He ca n't then . Greg . Farmer Gregory How ? Fag . Fag Now I dare say it was about that he wanted me when he first sent this morning . But make your mind easy . He ca n't help you just yet . His purse is under quarantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have returned then , only to behold his ruin ! Fag . Fag Sir Thomas ? The old ' un ai n't come back ? Greg . Farmer Gregory Most unexpectedly , the day before yesterday . Fag . Fag Whew ! What the devil 's to be done now ? Greg . Farmer Gregory I do n't understand you . Fag . Fag Keep him close , Gregory , keep the old ' un close . Greg . Farmer Gregory Close ! What do you mean by close ? Fag . Fag Merton 's two aunts are to be here presently . Do n't let the old ' un see ' em . But , above all , do n't let them see or hear about his daughter . Greg . Farmer Gregory Why not ? Fag . Fag One of ' em , Gregory , is a devil in petticoats . But she 's desperate rich . Greg . Farmer Gregory Why should I keep my patron , or my patron 's daughter out of sight because rich folks are in the way ? Zounds , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophia nor her father should be kept back . They 're fit company for the best in the land and all the fitter for having known what it is to want and be forsaken . Fag . Fag You do n't hear me , Farmer . You wo n't understand me , man . There may be reasons why Mr. Merton 's aunt should not , just yet , know the affair between him and the young lady . Greg . Farmer Gregory What affair ? Speak out , what affair ? Fag . Fag Now , Gregory , you ca n't be such a noodle as to think Mr. Merton has been doing all he has for your sake only , when there were two such eyes to lure him on as those of Miss Sophia ? Greg . Farmer Gregory He advanced me money before he knew there was such a being as Miss Sophia . Fag . Fag Yes , but he advanced you more after he knew .

If , to show his wit , he strive , Seem the veriest ass alive , His job 's done : the fool 's a lover . Greg . Farmer Gregory A love affair ! A love affair ! Good Heavens , what will Sir Thomas say ? Fag . Fag What can he say if he do n't know ? Greg . Farmer Gregory Mr. Fag , I may be a simple man , but I am an honest man ; and I must tell you , Mr. Fag . I do n't like this roundabout dealing . Fag . Fag Nobody wants you to be roundabout . If there 's any maneuvering to be done , leave it to me . I 'm not so nice about groping through crooked paths when they lead to flowers and sunshine . Mr. Merton will be a glorious match for Miss Dillon . Answer me one thing , Gregory : would such a match come so very inopportunely just now , Gregory , hey , my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fag And if you are the cause of preventing it by prematurely meddling , you 'll do your master more harm than all his misfortunes . Greg . Farmer Gregory How ? Fag . Fag And I 'll tell you a secret , Gregory . One of Mr. Merton 's aunts is Sir Thomas Dillon 's bitterest foe . Greg . Farmer Gregory His foe ? His foe ? That 's indeed to be considered . Fag . Fag Hark ! Carriages ! There come Merton and his aunts ! This way with me , Gregory  --  Greg . Farmer Gregory But I must attend to the company first  --  Fag . Fag Attend only to me , and you 'll bless your stars that you have found such a counsellor . Oh , never mind the carriages . Come along , I say . Exeunt Scene 3 : The farmhouse of Gregory . Enter Miss Flashington , Mrs. Simper , and Frank Merton . Miss F. Miss Flashington Was there ever such a place as this ?

Farmer Gregory Proud to see anybody belonging to you , Mr. Merton . You 've kept away a long time this time . Fag . Fag Running down and twitching him , unobserved Mum ! Miss F. Miss Flashington So you and this chap are tolerably well together , it seems . He gives me a good account of you , Farmer . Greg . Farmer Gregory Not better , ma'am , than I can give of him . He 's been a rare friend to me and mine . Miss F. Miss Flashington So I found . He would have concealed it from me , but he failed . Farmer , was it considerate , was it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that without first ascertaining how he came by it ? I see you 're annoyed , but you deserve it all ; you 've both of you done a good deed , but you 've done it in a very bad way . Greg . Farmer Gregory Confused I 'm sure , madam , I  --  Mr. Merton arranged with the creditors without my knowledge . He enabled me to keep the arrangement without my asking . Miss F. Miss Flashington I must have some private talk with you , Farmer . Greg . Farmer Gregory Ma'am  --  Miss F. Miss Flashington Merton , you 're not wanted here . Go and see the horses unharnessed . Farmer , we 'll dine with you . Greg . Farmer Gregory The best the farm affords , ma'am , is at your command . Apart My stars , if in this mood she should come across Sir Thomas  --  Miss F.

I 'll not lose sight of him . Exit Merton Mrs. S. Mrs. Simper Farmer , was n't that wife of Sir Thomas a sad plague to him ? Greg . Farmer Gregory It is not me place to judge my benefactors . Miss F.

Miss F. Miss Flashington Vehemently Good ! Who in the world ever told you any good of me ? Soph . Sophia Dillon Faltering Madam ? Miss F.

Miss Flashington You might just as well have sworn you adored him . Soph . Sophia Dillon Good Heavens ! Miss F. Miss Flashington Young woman , the conduct of Frank Merton to your father can only have been prompted by wild , desperate passion . Men are not given to doing good for its own sake , miss .

Miss F. Miss Flashington What ! Are you not aware that after such attentions as you have allowed from my nephew , if he does not marry you , every old maid in the parish will have her joke upon you , and every coxcomb his sneer ? Soph . Sophia Dillon Terrified Merciful Providence ! Miss F. Miss Flashington Come , come , cheer up . I 'm sure you 're a good girl , and the malice of those who delight in a friendless woman 's sorrows is now and then defeated . Cheer up , my child .

No , it was not love : it was idolatry ! But Triumphantly never did he , no , never did living creature know the boundlessness of my faith in his professions , the intensity of my anguish at his desertion . Well , well , if I could not be happy myself , I should bless the fate which enables me to be the cause of happiness to others . And why should not an honest farmer 's daughter be a fitting match for Merton ? Why should she not be a better match than one of better standing ? Her attachment will be more exclusive , and if thwarted , the disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change of scenes and faces ; but a poor girl forsaken can not get away from the sad spot where every step reminds her of the happier past , but is chained to pore upon the aching dream of what she was once lured to hope , till her heart breaks . The man 's a scoundrel , be he high or low , who can deliberately cause such wretchedness . Should not I be as great a scoundrel , could I be accessory to causing it ? Dillon 's family conspired to prevent our union , because , forsooth , my father was a merchant , his a baronet . The selfsame cause ! Shall I be swayed by the prejudices which have made Dillon a beggar , me an abrupt , uncouth creature whom all avoid and tremble at ? No ! Frank shall marry the poor girl , or , hang him , I 'll make him too poor himself to marry anybody . Mrs. Simper runs in Well , what brings you here in such a hurry ? Mrs. S.

He seemed enraptured , implored to see you , but I took care to let him know you have a spirit of your own and that you hate him now , as heartily as you ever loved him . Miss F. Miss Flashington Eagerly Hate him ! No , no , I hate no one , sister . It is the beauty to quell the power of hating . But I can not meet the destroyer of my peace , the man who in a moment changed the whole scenery of life from a paradise to a desert . I do not hate him , sister , but I can not meet him . Mrs. S.
