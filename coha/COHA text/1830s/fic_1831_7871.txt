Emmons , Richard , 1788-1834 : ADDRESS TO THE MOON . from Defence of Baltimore , and death of General Ross ( 1831 ) A drapery of mist , the Queen of night Drew round her form , reverting from the sight ; But now , not hearing of the battle loud , Slow she disrobes her bosom from the cloud . Alas ! what horror doth her light reveal  --  The wasted gore runs trickling down the hill : Death pil 'd on death , and broken sword-steels red , And the pale faces of the warriors dead . Horse on his rider bleeding ;  --  skull bones bare Cast back the moonbeams with a hideous glare , Like that reflected from a spectre 's cheek , Troubling the tombs the rotten dust to seek . The silver bosom 'd daughter of the spheres , Turns from the scene and veils herself in tears . Loveliest of heaven ! doth sorrow dim thine eye For human grief , whilst travelling through the sky ? Ah ! yes ,  --  I mark affliction on thy brow , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast touch 'd that something in my breast , That makes me happy even when distress 'd ! For man , alas ! there 's ample cause to mourn  --  He falls to dust  --  ah , never to return ! Though now thy brightness wanes upon decline , Yet soon thy horns shall fill and glorious shine ; Not so with man  --  a flower in bloom to-day , To-morrow faded  --  mouldering into clay ! And is the grave the all  --  the last of man  --  His strength but weakness and his life a span ? Fair Mourner ! tell thy bended suppliant here , If man exist beyond thy lovely sphere ? If but to feed the grave-yard worms be all For which he buffets on this tossing ball  --  O then more close fold up thy thickening cloud  --  Stain it to blackness like the coffin shroud ! But if the soul beatitude shall find , Bless 'd with the rapt fruition of the mind , Dismuffle from thy veil  --  pour down thy rays , And let me ravish 'd on thy beauty gaze ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks new burnish 'd from the Deity ! Gaze , O ye mortals ! bend your eye to heaven  --  Behold translation in the symbol given ! Methinks , to greet thy presence , bridal Queen ! Touching their harps , are starry cherubs seen ! The Muse feels soaring on Elijah 's fire ! Propitious omen !  --  man shall not expire ! He like thyself a transient season dies To shine eternal in the vital skies !
