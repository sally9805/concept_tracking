txt HORTICULTURE . " Let us rise up then , and plant ; 1 speak to encourage and animate a work so glorious , so necessary . " EVELYN . IN no period of history have such wonderful events been developed , as during a cycle of less than sixty years . It is not merely the revolutions and conquests of nations , which have excited intense interest and unremitted observation , but those of letters , science and the arts have been equally remarkable and momentous . At such an epoch as this , how natural is the inclination , and how instructive the employment , of tracing back effects to their cause ,  --  to compare the state of society at different periods and in various countries , and to prognosticate the changes and ameliorations of the future , from those of the past ; but leaving to the Plutarchs of biography , to delineate the characters of eminent heroes and philosophers , and to the political and military Xenophons to describe the remarkable occurrences , in the annals of empires , we select a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been effected in the cultivation of the earth , and the means which appear necessary , for facilitating and perfecting the labors in one of the most interesting branches of rural economy , and inducing a more general disposition , for participating in that rational , pleasing and healthy pursuit . The simple wants of nature claim the chief attention of man , when he forsakes the forest and the arms of the chase , for the occupations of the field , and the implements of husbandry . In the march of // civilization , necessity is the first , and , for a long period of rude exist* ence , the only cause of moral and physical exertion ; but in his progress towards an exalted state of refinement , his views are enlarged , new objects of solicitude are constantly presented , and the range of employment is gradually expanded . To the demands of utility , are successively added those of comfort and embellishment , which ultimately become the most powerful excitements to vigorous action . With increasing industry , wealth is accumulated , and new sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as various , as the genius , taste and acquirements of the individuals , and the climes they inhabit , and as infinite , as the gradation in the route of human improvement . But although the cultivation of the earth was the first , and ever has been considered the most useful and honorable of the arts , still it has been slow in its progress , and surpassed by the others in perfection . The nations of antiquity were far advanced in intellectual attainments , before Horticulture was liberally patronized , and luxurious gratifications were sumptuously indulged , ere gardens were considered , as the most magnificent appendages of the regal palace and the villa of the affluent . If the humble mansion of the rustic was surrounded by a few ordinary fruits and vegetables , a taste for flowers , and a leisure to give neatness and beauty to the sequestered cottage , was not induced , before riches , intelligence and universal prosperity prevailed over the whole country . The history of the world , since the decadence of the Roman empire , presents similar results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIV . that Horticulture received distinguished attention even in Europe , and the present chaste style of ornamental planting was not introduced earlier than the age of George II. ; but for many years after , the votaries were few and the examples of improved cultivation rare . It is true , that many valuable works were published in France and England , on the science and art of gardening , during the latter part of the eighteenth century , and great proficiency had been made in the practical details , and the number of useful and ornamental plants vastly increased ,  --  . - still , this pleasing department of tillage did not assume its appropriate station and merited consequence , till the establishment of the London Horticultural Society . The cheering influence of that noble institution was soon expe* rienced throughout the globe . The imposing precedent was followed in many of the states of Europe and America ; and there are , now , numerous flourishing associations in both hemispheres , which are harmoniously co-operating in the collection and diffusion of information , on the culture of esculent vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of useful and ornamental planting . If in this country the progress of improvement has not been commensurate with the general advancement of the republic , the natural advantages of soil and climate , and the intelligence and resources of the inhabitants , yet much older nations are far in our rear , while brighter prospects begin to dawn upon us . We may now confidently anticipate glorious rpsults , from the generous spirit of inquiry , which has been awakened throughout the Union . Agriculture , manufactures and commerce have prospered to an extent , unprecedented in 19 // the annals of nations ; mechanics has centupled the products of in ( lustry ; canals and railways have opened new and extensive lines of intercommunication ; the steam engine enables the mariner to dispense with favoring gales , and , applied to the cars of transportation , the traveler appears to triumph over distance and time ; and there can not be a doubt , that we shall exhibit equal zeal and success , in every other pursuit , which contributes to the prosperity and happiness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Literature and science are the precursors of the fine arts , and if he western disciples of the former , have not , as yet , merited those high honors , which have been attained by transatlantic contemporaries , they have evinced a scope of intellect , and a profundity of research , with an ardor of genius , and a spirit of enthusiasm , which emulates the most splendid achievements of distant realms and ages . Beholding from afar , these encouraging indications , Painting , as the most adventurous of the ornamental arts , long Mince hastened to our shores , and numerous competitors have thronged her court , for the prize of immortality ; after a dreary and protracted intertral , Architecture appeared , arrayed in the chaste , yet magnificent robes of Greece ; more recently , modest Sculpture has unveiled her peerless beauties ; and , at last , the genius of Horticulture , resplendent in the united attributes and charms of her rival sisters , claims our admiratioi* and generous encouragement . She points to the forest , as the primeval residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rural decoration , in his most refined state of existence ,  --  as the natural picture for imitation , in restoring the scenery of his highly cultivated ( lomain , by clothing with wooded verdure the barren hill-tops , obliterating the dreary monotony of arid plains with variegated groves , winding umbrageous avenues through sequestered vales , and fringing each babbling rivulet with shrubs and flowers . By this lovely goddess we are instructed , that the savage came forth from the wilderness , but to learn those arts , which would enable him to convert it into a terrestrial paradise . After ages of laborious research and unremitted industry , he collects , under the guidance of agriculture , the products of every region , which can subserve the p***poses of food , raiment and shelter , and when manufactures , commerce , letters , and science have given wealth and erudition , he becomes the delighted pupil of Horticulture . From her he learns to combine ornament and recreation , with utility and comfort ; and commingling the plants of subsistence with those of decoration , his rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hey include every object , which can administer to his wants , or mul .. tiply the sources of his happiness . It is thus , that the vegetable treasures of each prolific zone are collected within the narrow precincts of the rural mansion ; and man , no longer doomed to wander over boundless wilds , to obtain a precarious support , assumes that dignified rank , for which he was destined , by the beneficent God of his creation . But the divinity of Horticulture does not presumptuously obtrude within the domains of husbandry ; her counsels are not officiously volunteered ; timid and fastidious , she must be sought by advances , propitiated by kindness , and her protection secured by assiduous de // votion . Having been graciously received upon our borders , she has gradually acquired admirers in the interior . In the vicinity of the large maritime cities , gardening has made cou* siderable progress , with the last twenty years , and the beneficial influ .. ence of Horticultural societies is extending over the whole country ; but all the advantages , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor can they become of general and efficient utility , until gardens of experiment are established , and seminaries are founded , for teaching the science , art and practical operations , in all branches of rural economy . Happily for this state , a plan has been projected by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society , for forming an experimental garden , connected with a rural cemetery in the vicinity of Harvard University . Of its complete success we have the fullest , confidence , and look forward with sanguine hopes , that the period is not 4ieta*nt , when the meritorious example will be followed in all the other states . It is to be regretted that the prospect is not equally cheering in relation to a Horticultural school . In this age of general improvement , when institutions and ass**jatioas have been , formed for . inculpgti*g intelligence in almost every branch of knowledge , and among all classes of society ; and when it is perceived , how successful have been the efforts , for affording instruction in the mechanic arts , it is very desirable , that measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivators of the soil . As a science and an art , Horticulture embraces a wide field of intek* ligence , requiring an extensive acquaintance with natural history and philosophy , while the practical operations are so various , and *f such a delicate and difficult character , that they can not be satisfactorily performed , without proper instruction , under the tuition of capable and experienced gardeners . Theory and practice must be taught , and science and skill acquired in a contemporaneousjnanner ; and this can only be done in a well managed school of instruction ; combined , with , a garden of experiment , where all the varieties of trees and plants , com monly introduced into gardens , or which may be employed in the embellishment of estates , arc collected , and constantly cultivated , by well educated and practical masters . Suc4i an establishment has been recently founded at Fromont , ' under the protection of the king of France ; and among the objects which the London and Caledonian Horticul* tural Societies had in view , in fbrming their experimental gardens it Chiswick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the places of gardeners ; and that is now considered one of the most important advantages , which is accruing to the public from those celebrated establishments . The practical information and skill will be pleasantly and easily ac* quired under the tuition of a chief gardener , and by the aid of such assistants , as may he found necessary , for superintending the esculent , fruit , floral , ornamental , green-house , and other appropriate depart . ruents . Whatever relates to theory , and the subservient sciences and arts , must be confided to competent professors , who should be required to deliver lectures on Botany , Vegetable Physiology , Chemistry , Mineralogy , Architecture , Hydraulics , Mechanics , and Entomology ,  --  or the eulture of fruit , forest and ornamental trees , shrubs and plants , culi // nary vegetables , and such as are used in the arts , and in the composi. tion of landscape and picturesque gardens . To complete these theoretical studies , there should be a library , a cabinet of demonstrative apparatus , collections of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instructers should also be provided , for teaching the elements of mathematics , topographical surveying , and linear and desc.riptive drawing , so as to enable the students to lay out grounds in the most correct , economical , and taste .. ful manner , and project plans for all kinds of country edifices . Besides the advantages of drawing , fir those purposes , it will be an agreeable and useful accomplishment , in the pomological and floral departments , where it is frequently necessary , or desirable , to delineate fruits and flowers , or new and remarkable plants , in an accurate and beautiful manner . It can not be expected , however , that the expense of creating and maintaining such an institution should be incurred by horticultural associations , but should be borne by the state or national governments ; and in the latter case , the establishment should be located in the Dis .. trict of Columbia , and founded on such an extensive scale , as to include , not only all the departments of Horticulture , but those of agriculture , and afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save for board and clothing , to hundreds of students , from every section of the Union . At least five sixths of the whole population of the United States are maintained by husbandry and gardening ; it is , therefore , of the first consequence , that instruction should be universally disseminated , on all the branches of tillage ; this would enable the proprietors of the soil to manage it in such a manner , as to insure the ' most abundant harvests , as well as to afford the greatest possible enjoyment to their households , from the *ariety , value , and beauty of the plants ' subjected to cultivation . The time has arrived when a powerful impulse should be given to these great branches of national industry ; it is required by public policy , patriotism , and a just regard to the rights and interests *f the people . Besides the experimental gardens and seminary which have been named , the French government has established the Jardin des Plants , a school of Rural Economy at Alfort , and the celebrated farm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence the foundation of like establishments in the capital of the Union ? The inducements are more urgent , the demands as imperious , and the prospective advantages incalculable . Thus far , we have been indebted to individual enterprise , for all the improvements which have been made in the various departments of Horticulture , except that of botany ; and even that very useful and pleasing science , so long patronized by the kingdoms of Europe , has not yet been deemed worthy of public attention in the United States . Neither the national*nor state governments have taken measures to encourage the study of natural history , or to facilitate inquiries or experiments in that vast region of science , to the full extent of its requirements . If the mineral , vegetable , and animal kingdoms have been partially explored , and their treasures developed , it is the result of private munificence and enterprise ; and while there is sufficient cause for gratulation , that so much has been accomplished , with such // limited means , we can not but feel dishonored as a nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , for the advancement of literature , science and the arts . This reprehensible indifference to intellectual pursuits ,  --  this total negligence of measures for inculcating theoretical knowledge and practical skifl , in whatever relates to the moral and physical education of the people , is inexcusable , and demands the serious consideration of the statesman and legislator . Even in monarchical governments , which are based upon the ignorance , rather than the intelligence of the people , numerous seminaries of learning have been munificently endowed , while in this land of liberty , where the converse political theory prevails , and on the practical observance of which the stability of the republic depends , nothing has been done , for the dissemination of instruction . The illustrious patriots who established the Union , as well as those venerated sages , who have presided over its destinies , in the days of its glory , considered it of the first importance that the citizens should be universally and eminently enlightened ; and that it was the sacred duty of the government to make ample provision for accomplishing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of the country ,  --  ' - so indispensable to the maintenance of the constitution , and as the only guarantee for the perpetuity of the Union.
