txt In Tesu'ming my " Glances at Congress , " as the Twenty-fifth Congress with which they commenced is about expiring , it is impossible to avoid a passing reflection on the striking changes , evident at a glance ' to one who knew the body at its commencement , and looked on it at its dose . Some whose faces were once familiar to me are no longer to be seen . Their places are filled with strangers . Some have retired from public service into the more quiet employments and enjoyments of domestic life . It is ant without painful emotions that I recall to my memory the countenances of some , who , at the organization of this Congress , sat here , like their successors , with hearts swelling with hope and expectation , and responding to the sensibilities of frierrdship and conjugal and paternal affection , and to the aspirations of ambition , who now live only in the memory of their friends and countrymen . The agitation , the intrigues , the angry collisions , and the foul deed of violence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review before the mind ; but upon all these time has dro'pped the curtain , and I shall not uplift it . I must dwell a moment on the new arrangements of the Hallan edifice itself of the most impressive character , in an architectural point of view . The Speaker 's ? hair , the Clerk 's table , and the seats of the members are restored to the position in which they were prior to the alterations authorized by the house , in the first session of the twenty-second Congress . The chair is now placed where it was originally designed to be-in the centre of the base of the half circle , which is the form of the Hall ; and where it is the focus of all the sound , from whatever part of the Hall it may come . The opposite arrangement , which has been abandoned , was unarchitectural , and destructive of the original plan of the Hall . The first alteration was an experiment in acoustics , which theory did not justify , and which upon trial proved abortive . The object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , hut its effect was to deform the room , without gaining any advantage in this respect . Under the present arrangements every thing which is uttered in nay part of the Hall may be heard at the chair , and whatever is said at the chair is audible throughout the Ilall. // It has been said-whether truly or not , I do not know-that the original design of the architect was to construct the Hall with a view to enable the members to address the House from the tribune , as in the French chamber of Deputies . If this was his object , it must be admitted that he succeeded in it most admirably . There is not a place , except the chair or Clerk 's table , from which a member may be distinctly heard in all parts of the hall . It is also difficult , even for veteran orators to ' . speak in this Hall ; to fill it with a volume of tone is impossible . The consequence is , that every speaker who is solicitous of being heard strains and breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers here have been those whose voices were shrill and fife-like , and destitute of deep and guttural tones . John Randolph and Philip P. Barbour , as I ivell remember , had voices so admirably adapted to the Hall / that they could speak in it , and be entirely audible in every part , without any seeming effort . John Randolph , in his very lowest tones of passion and feeling , was distinctly heard in every recess of the House . This , to be sure , may be partly attributable to the silence and attention which he always commanded , but more to the peculiarity of his voice . Before dismissing the Hall , however , and its arrangements , I must be indulged in a passing protest against the vile taste in upholstery which still seems to have the ascendent about the Speaker 's chair . The vulgar and gingerbread finery of the former plan has only given place to a tower of merino tasselled and fringed , more , much more obnoxious and offensive , inasmuch as to procure the room for this tasteless display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limited space of the ladies ' gallery , shutting out the public from a most advantageous position to see the House , and adding vastly and most unjustifiably to the discomfort and inconvenience of the place . We hope the Speaker or the new Clerk will deem it worth their while for the future to prevent these fantastic yet expensive tricks of upholstery run mad . Mentioning the Speaker 's chair , I can not avoid the expression of my regret that its distinguished occupant is so soon voluntarily to retire from a position which he has made illustrious as it was arduous , it being well known that this is the last year of Mr. Polk 's long and favorable term of service in the House . The Democratic Review has already given a fine sketch of the Speaker 's life , but I may notwithstanding be permitted to add the remarks that fall within my own peculiar range of observation . I have never seen a man preside over a popular legislative body with more dignity and effect than Mr. Polk . In person he is rather below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage which gives great self-possession and command to his manner . His head is finely formed , with a broad and ample forehead , and features indicative // of a character at once urbane and decided . He is scrupulous in his dress and always appears in the chair as if he were at a dinner party . His quickness of eye and ear in presiding over the House , his uistiring attention , which never flags for a moment , seem to give his presence a species of ubiquity . His manner towards a member when speaking is that of an earnest listener , and so completely is he master of this arL of necessary politeness , that even when he is signing bills , or doi ' *g some other indispensable duty , it would not be apparent that he had in the least withdrawn his attention . His knowledge of the rules of the House is more extensive and minute than that of any member of the body , and this doubtless is one cause of his admirable success in conducting its business . Mr. Polk must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proved on so many occasions that it is no longer disputed . In stating a decision , or settling a point of order , his manner and tone are at once fluent and collected , as if speaking from an entire consciousness of right , and intimate knowledge of his position . The soundness of his judgment has been confirmed in repeated appeals which disconcerted partizarts have made from his decisions . Every party now willingly unites in testifying to the rare ability and success with which he has filled this most difficult and unenviable position . Who will be his successor , I can not foretell ; but this is certain , that it will be easier to find a successor to his place , than to fill his place . By his prompt and firm interposition of the authority of the chair , he has guided the House through many storms and agitations ; and often have I seen shallow impertinence and brazen impudence abashed by his collected and dignified rebuke . Immediately below the Speaker , at the centre of the semicircular table or tribune which fronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles , oval countenance , and hair brushed aside from his forehead , will attract the attention . It is Hugh A. Garland , of Virginia , the new Clerk of the house , whose election at the commencement of the present Session over Mr. St. Clair Clarke , an opponent so influential and so popular that he was believed to be invincible , was a source of much congratulation to the administration party , and of surprise as well as mortification to the opposition . Though scarcely over thirty , Mr. Garland has brought to his present position a high political reputation , the more honorable as it was achieved in a S.tate prolific of public talent , and where the science of politics is more generally cultivated and understood than in any other part of the Union . His career in the Legislature of Virginia was brilliant and successful . He was prominent among those who , in that highly respectable and leading assembly , took ground in support of the late President Jackson , upon the great financial questions which were agitated during his administration . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political faith before the people of this country-I mean the separation of the Governrnent from Banks-he was emphatically a pioneer of those ( bctrifles which the Democratic party has espoused and will sustain . With a quick geniusv he combines the habit of labor ; and to entire purity of character , uniform courtesy of manner , and an amiable temper , he adds that firrfmess of* , purpose which is indispensable to political success , arrd which makes friends or creates respect , even where it disappoints . It has already carried him through difficulties that might have vanquished sterner spirits . FJ7hough thus decided in his personal opinions , Mr. Garland , as an officer , has won general esteem on both sides of the House , from the sincere impartiality with which he executes the ( unties of a situation which necessarily brings him into relations with every member . His manner of reading is scholar-like and effective . His voice is so well regulated , and his pronunciation so distinct , that it is evident he has cultivated reading as a polite art . In person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has that slight and peculiar stoop of the shouldeis which designates so frequently studious men . It is the general belief , even among his own party friends , that . Mr. Garland could not have been elected but for the successful introduction of the viva-voce system of voting , by one of those consummate applications of parliamentary tactics , so rarely possible , when brought to bear on a system so intricately complex as the standing rules and orders of the House of Representatives . A little to the left of the Speaker , at one of the central desks , we may see General Dromgoole , of Virginia , who effected this important result . One would scarcely believe him , from his appearance , to be thus versed in a skill only deemed acquirable by long and minute acquaintance with Congressional usages . He is a well-built , middle-aged man , though on the young side of the prime of life . Being of a florid complexion , and being exceedingly nearsighted , from which has proceeded a habit of peering as it were through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give a casual observer an impression of the powerful intellect and extensive information he possesses . General Dromgoole has effected a great political good , by intro .. ( lucing and carrying through , in the highest representative body in the Union , this important precedent of the viva-voce system of voting in elections of officers of the House . He brought forward the measure under discouraging circumstances , but his tact and address supplied the lack of other advantages , and his eloquent vindication of that mode of voting secured success to his motion . I have heard it sai ( l by experienced members , that no one menber could have carried through that important and int*resting innovation except General Dromgoole . Upon this measure alone , // which may be said to republican ize the elections of the House , any member might be content to rest the fame of his Congressional career . But Gcneral D. has , on other occasions , evinced a remarkable degree of parliamentary address , and has always exerted it for the protection and advantage of the House , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a prompt movement , brought the House out of great difficulty , as I l*ve heard a prominent opposition member declare . General Dromgoole speaks but seldom  --  and I am sorry for it , - for no man is more capable of enlightening and gratifying his hearers and the country . Well do I recollect his speech on the Independent Treasury Bill . It took many by surprise , who dreamt not of the power that slumbered in this modest and retiring member . The speech was a model of parliamentary eloquence ; fluent and harmonious in diction , lucid in arrangement , and so powerful in argument , that it would answer as well now , as when it was spoken , to produce conviction . The effort brought upon its author as much censure as praise , from his political friends ,  --  for they blamed him for not coming out before . General Dromgoole came into Congress with ahigh reputation . lie was elected to the General Assembly of Virginia in April , 1823 , and has remained in public life ever since . He served three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected to the Senate , in which body he served nine years , with such distinction that during the three last he was Speaker of the body . No member of Congress has been more thoroughly consistent in his principles than General Drorngoole . In the first session of his service in the Legislature of Virginia , he opposed the re.charter of the Farmers ' Bank of Virginia ; and then , with other young friends , of whom J. Y. Mason-who in the recent interesting contest for United States Senator received the honorable tribute of the unanimous support of the Democratic party for the office-was one , denounced the general tendency of the banking system as it then existed , and in a series of able arguments demonstrated the inconsistency of the privileges and monopolies secured by their charters , with Democratic principles and free and equal rights . Before he left the House of Delegates , Congress had passed the law for appropriations for making surveys preparatory to a general system of internal improvement , and had also increased the Tariff for the avo*ved purpose of fostering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided stand , maintaining then , as he ever has done since , that they were both violations of the Constitution , and he anxiously desired that the General Assembly should at once take groun ( l against the ( langerous heresies of the miscalled American System , and re.assert the ancient doctrines of Virginia Republicanism . So conspicuous were the // talents that Mr. Dromgoole exhibited in discussing these high constitutional questions , that some of the oldest members in the House , especially John Roane and Randolph Harrison , urged the gifted young member to take the lead in bringing back Virginia to the principles of Taylor 's Resolutions and Madison 's Report , and willingly , with their whole party , enlisted themselves under his able guidance for the purpose . The yesult is of record , a brilliant triumph of Republican principles , *hd a full committal of Virginia against the American system . During his service in the Senate , he served on and at the head of several of the most important committees , and frequently distinguished himself as a debater of signal power-in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people on the subject of calling a Convention , which he denounced as virtually denying the sufficiency of the Representative system to embody the public will . His speech on this occasion was called a master-piece of constitutional and popular argument , and , in particular , was so much admired by John Randolph , whose fastidiousness as a critic is well known , that he pronounced it the ablest speech that had been delivered during the winter , either at Richmond or Washington . The bill , however , passed ; and notwithstanding his opposition to it , Mr. D. was elected one of the members of the Convention from his Senatorial district ; and again , after the new Constitution had gone into operation , which General Dromgoole had materially assisted by his speeches and exertions , he was elected a Senator under it without opposition , and in a different arrangement of the districts . In the new Senate his course was highly distinguished . When the nullification of South Carolina , and the proclamation of President Jackson , brought before the General Assembly the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the removal of deposits , he took a conspicuous part in the animated debate which that measure produced . It was on this occasion that the instructions were passed which caused Mr. Hives to retire from the Senate . Mr. Dromgoole defended the removal of the deposits , and opposed the instructions in an elaborate speech , which was much admired . In 1835 he was elected to Congress , succeeding by a handsome majority over his successful competitor at the previous election . In 1837 he was re-elected without opposition . Of the position he has attained in the house , I have already mentioned sufficient instances . It is indeed generally believed that if General Dromgoole does not achieve the foremost place of the body  --  and a position of high political usefulness-it will be the fault only of himself . But here is another Virginian , on the opposite side of the Chair , and as near to it as he can get , without getting into it . A proximity which may induce him , for aught I know , when it becomes vacant // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAMES GARLAND , whom every body knows as the leading Conservative in the House . His dress , you will observe , is very plain , and he wears his hair something in the manner of the Methodist clergymen of the old school , brushed back from his forehead , but his black frock coat , stout walking stick , and heavy comfortable boots , would rather give you the idea that he was that fine character , the Virginia country gentleman , half farmer , ha* lawyer , whose honest heart is in his face , and whom you have an irresistible inclination to take by the hand . In person , Mr. G. is tall and erect , strongly and rather heavily built , and his general appearance is prepossessing . His features are bold and prominent , and strongly characteristic both of benevolence and of decision . I like to hear him speak , and , as he sl ) eal ( s frequently , I am often gratified in that way . There is an earnestness in his manner which gives an assurance of sincerity . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the minds of those whom he addresses . Towards political opponents he is courteous and liberal , and instead of assailing them with denunciation , he seeks to convince them that they are wrong . He is not one of the tomahawk and scalping-knife Conservatives-for there are some such-particularly Mr. Clark of Ne*v York , who in political controversy is as savage and as wild as it ' he were a lineal descendant of one of the Mohawks in whose country he lives , and to whom he , in fact , bears a strong and peculiar resemblance . We should not be surprised if the member from Chenango should turn out to be two-thirds Indian , and to have blood in his veins that erst assisted at many a massacre . Mr. Garland does not consider his political adversaries as foes , and he wages upon them no relentless and exterminating warfare . He has had occasion , in pursuance of what he no doubt deemed to be his duty , to differ , in some points , from the Administration , but he has never hesitated to award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patriotism ; and I am quite certain that he is disinterested and honest in his course . Major Garland is essentially a self-made man . He was born on the sixth day of June , 1793 , in Albemarle county , State of Virginia , and up to early manhood he was employed on his father 's farm in Amherst county , in the same State ; having only received , in the ordinary schools of the country , the elementary branches of an English education , and read a few Latin authors . His father having a large family , and his circumstances being too moderate to afford him a collegiate education , in his nineteenth year he turned his face to the world to seek his fortune by his own industry and energy , without a cent in his pocket . He repaired to the county of Nelson , where he now resides , and entered into the service of a relative , then and still Clerk of the County Court , for no other compensation than board , and // there he studied law with such assiduity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the fall of 1812 , he obtained license to practice law . Shortly after he commenced the practice of his profession , in the year 1813 , he was drafted into the military service of the United States , during the war , and performed a tour of six months sevice in a company of volunteer artillery . He was a great favorite with the ofilcers and members of his company , on account of the fidelity with which he discl*rged his duty , and was appointed to fill every vacancy that occurred , until he was appointed Captain , and subsequently Major . He was regarded as an excellent officer . In the fall of 1813 , he resumed his practice , and from the energy and industry with which he pursued it , soon became eminent , and acquired an extensive and lucrative practice . Indeed he became so prominent in his profession , that he ranked among the most distinguished lawyers in the State . In the Supreme Courts of Chancery and several times in the County Courts he argued many very important cases , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of its ablest men . Mr. Garland 's political career has been short . lie was first elected a member of the Legislature of his native State , in lS2* , and continued in it until 1831 . He was a member of the first Legislature under the new Constitution , where he was distinguished for his industry , attention and devotion to the public interest . In that session his ardent devotion to , and labor in support of the internal improvements of the State , aided much in giving that impulse to it which is now rapidly extending with such promise of a happy success . In 1831 he declined a re-election , to the general regret of all the people of the county . In 1833 , amidst the panic session , growing out of the removal of the deposits , when the administration of General Jackson seemed tottering to its fall , he became a candidate for Congress , in the Alhemarle District , in opposition to a very popular gentleman , and took a decided stand in favor of that Administration . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unpromising and untoward circumstances , and against the strongest influence of family , wealth and talents . In 1837 he was re.elected without opposition , having given general satisfaction to his constitents by the fidelity and ability with which he discharged his duties . He entered Congress a decided advocate of the State Bank System . Mr. Garland has of late acquired much notoriety-*ve can hardly say distinction-as one of the leading Conservatives in the I-louse of Representatives . That is a party towards which the Democratic Review will scarcely be suspected of leaning with any peculiar degree of favor , whether with a view to yielding to their opinions the slightest concession of the great principles involved in the leading measure of the Administration which they oppose , or to // softening their hostility by any unworthy attempts at personal pro . pitiation . Genuine Democracy can have very little respect for the motives and influences which appear to have actuated the vast majority of that party in its secession from the Democratic party , and it would be worse than labor lost to attempt to bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's experience is so proving it  --  to gain over to the principles and policy of the Administration thrice their number , * ? rom the sound and liberal portion of the Whig party itself . Let them go in peace . Let every man be free to obey the natural inclination of his opinions in the selection of his political course and party associations . The Democratic party is itself , and has always been , the object of too incessant and furious a persecution of abuse , from a Press of which three-fourths has always been under the control of their opponents , to incline a man of candid opinions to follow such an example , in the maintenance of its cause and the advocacy of its principles . Let the Conservatives , then ,  --  all of them that shall still choose to follow the guidance of their principal leaders-go in peace ; and , embittered as are usually the relations between former associates on such a separation , let us not deny them the same courtesy we claim for ourselves , of a liberal presumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat must be glad of the &amp;ecession , and will regard it as a much needed purification of the Demowcratic party itself ,  --  but this not with reference to the personal characters of the men , but to the essential character and tendency of their principles . I certainly know more than one individual among their number , for whom no collisions of political opinion and action could ever diminish that sincere personal respect and regard , which I should be very slow to extend to many of the most zealous and loud of the supporters of our own doctrines and measures . Mr. Garland in particular has peculiar claims to an indulgent consideration of his position , and to a liberal construction of hi* motives . His democracy except on the single yet vital question of the separation of Bank and State , can not , I believe , and never has been impeached . Though his conduct on the divorce question , and his associates for the last two years have sundered him widely from the great democratic party , yet it should be remembered that he acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less strong than those which compelled Mr. Buchanan to vote under a protest , against the Sub-treasury bill . He was first run by the friends of General Jackson as a friend of the State Bank System and in opposition to General Gordon 's scheme of a Sub-treasury , which had been insidiously introduced the previous session of Congress , when the forrncr plan was in the full tide of an apparently successful experiment under the auspices of the Adrrdnistration. // He was successful over his competitor , and thus came to Congress , as it were , pledged against a plan which a prodigious change of circumstances soon after rendered the cardinal policy of his own party . Mr. Garland 's great party error was that he did not meet the crisis . He did not rightly understand it . The disgraceful explosion of the whole Banking System did not alter his confidence in it , and instead of calmly profiting i*th his party by the experience of the crisis , and seeking with them to repair it by a firm and resolute return to the true and simple principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of reconstructing the shattered edifice at his feet . The heat of party contest , or the soreness of exasperated feeling may have led him into more decided opposition to his old party than he at first intended , but I do not think him , like most others of the new sect , totally lost to democracy . I am very cer. tam , that he can neither be led or driven either into Whiggery , or National Bankism , and I am not without my hopes of soon seeing him return in good faith to the bosom of the great party with which he has been identified so long . He feels ill at ease in his new sphere , and as the unholy alliance between Conservatism and I , *Thiggery becomes more and more apparent , James M. Garland ,  - -  or I am greatlymistaken ,  --  will abjure it . He has as little sympathy with the evils of the Banking System , or wish to perpetuate its faults as the most unwavering democrat , and I for one , do not despair of a candid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been making very free with Major Garland 's name and the pages of the Democratic Review , but I know your political can dor and consideration of opponents , and as to the rest my speculations may go for what they are worth . As my pen seems to run upon Virginians , I can not omit a gentleman , whose seniority at all events is entitled to precedence , and turn with my friendly reader to the old gentleman in the seat on the right of the centre aisle , and near the inner circle . Time has scattered memorials of experience and of care on his temples , but his complexion is still fresh , and his eye still lights up with the fire of youth . He is a favorite with all parties in the House , and , I believe , the oldest man , and the oldest member in Congress . It is Mr. JOHN TALIAFERRO , pronounced Tollever . He is near seventy years of age , and has been a member of the House , at different times , since the memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon th' overwhelming tide of Jeffersonian democracy , from a district that had been thoroughly and exclusively Federal . His competitor was the late Colonel John Tayloe , of Mount Airy , a Hamilton and Pickering federalist , and the contest was , according to tradition , one of principle , and very severe . Before that early period , Mr. Taliaferro was a leading member of the Virginia Assembly . For many years , he was the champion of Democratic // Republicanism , in his district ; sometimes succeeded , and was sometimes beaten , and , for years in succession , agitated the House with contested elections between him and his federal competitor , General Hungerford . He was a member of the House at the trying crisis , preceding and during the late war with Great BritTain , and enjoyed , in an emineut degree , the confidence and intimate friendship of Jefferson , Mad*on , and Monroe , and was always considered a practical and uri'Wavering republican of the school founded by these our " patres conscripti . " After the accession of Mr. Adams , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he became " absorbed** in the " National Republican , " or what is now called the " Whig " party , in which he has since continued . Mr. Taliaferro has always been an industrious , and more than that , a working member . He has seldom mingled in general debate , but has found other ways quite as potent for influencing votes . As a speaker , however , he held in former days no mean rank . He presented his views with a clearness and precision of language , and an aptitude of illustration , that commanded attention , and won conviction . At the hustings , I have been told , he was allpowerful , by means of his suavity and plausibility of manner , and his adroitness in the management of his topics . Mr. Taliaferro is now known as one of the most agreeable and pleasant men in Congress , and , at the same time , as one of the most useful and industrious members . He is cheerful and full of anecdote , and when you see him offer his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash from his small grey eye , you may rely upon it that something exceedingly facetious and pleasant is forthcoming . In person , Mr. T. is a little below the common height , and his figure is trim and well built . His style of dress is plain and neat , and his manner is that of an accomplished gentleman and courtier of the old school . Mr. T. , I believe , never followed any profession , except the noble one of agriculture ; and it is said that , as an agriculturist , he was unequalled by any man in Virginia , except perhaps , the " Arator , " Col. John Taylor , of Caroline . But a white-haired and florid-looking elderly gentleman , is addressing the Chair , and you can observe that his manner excites general attention mingled with some anxiety in many a member full of the unuttered speech that is peeping out of his pocket , or laboring in his b*east* He is SAMUEL CUSHMAN , from Portsmouth , Rockingham county , New Hampshire , and well known to the country by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have affixed to his name from the unrelenting frequency with which he is apt to cut short a debate big with the fate of tropes and figures and political rhetoric , by the infallible edge of the Previous Question . lie was born in the State of Maine , while it was // a District of Massachusetts . By profession , he is a lawyer ; by nature and choice a politician . He is a veteran in politics , a martinet in party discipline . No man was ever more true to his party , for , espousing a cause with sincerity , he supports it with unbounded zeal . lie has been frequently called to fill posts of trust and honor in the State which he now represents in Congress . He has been elected , if I mistake not , to both branches of Legislature , and has also served as County Attorne9*and Attorney General , situations which required talents , and demanded integrity and honor . But , to serve in Congress , is to be transferred from a provincial theatre to the Metropolitan boards . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to arouse applause , or even to escape the sneers of the " groundlings , " and the galleries . The honorable gentleman does not aspire , I believe , to fill the highest parts , either in comedy*or tragedy , but he has always appeared in a very respectable line of characters . Sometimes he has been damned with faint applause , and has very often been subjected to the ridicule and misrepresentation of those bigoted partisans who can see no merit in a political opponent . It has been gravely charged upon him that he moves the Previous Question . Truly , he does , and for that very service , if he had never done any thing else , he deserves a rnonument as a public benefactor . One man who can arrest a tedious , long-winded , factious , time-killing debate , is worth forty who can provoke or keep up one . It requires some moral courage , some spirit , and some tact also to move the Previous Question , and to move it , too , at precisely the right point of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the proper moment when to draw off the skirmishers and sound the charge . With the practical diities of legislation he is well acquainted , and his business knowledge and habits render him an efficient member of the Committee of Commerce , and other very important Committees on which he has served . He is very frequently forced into debate , either in defence of the principles of his party , or of some of his personal or political friends , in the Administration , who have been made the subject of wanton and malicious attack , and this duty he always does with urbanity and good temper . As regards his character in private life , he is amiable and blameless . His character here is unblemished . His manners are easy and bland ; his deportment courteous to all ; his temper mild and equable , and his disposition kind and obliging . His age is , apparently , about sixty ; his eyes dark , small , and piercing ; person of the middle size , rather spare , and very erect ; his motions quick ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good man is this same much abused SAMUEL CUSHMAN.
