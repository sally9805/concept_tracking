txt AGRICULTURE , the first pursuit of civilized man , has been the last to receive the direct attention and patronage of governments . Commerce , navigation , manufactories , the mechanic and fine arts , science and letters , had commanded much respect , and reached high degrees of excellence , before the cultivation of the earth , either for the purposes of profit or embellishment , found favor among the affluent and enlightened , or was deemed an object worthy of the careful consideration of statesmen and legislators . But , when nations have reached an advanced position in prosperity and refinement , and other more attractive or lucrative branches of industry have been so extended , as to employ a large portion of the population , an immensely increased amount of products is required , to meet the augmented demand of consumption ; and the necessity of rendering the earth more prolific becomes so apparent , that what had been improvidently neglected , and was , in fact , the most substantially momentous interest of the country , at last imperiouly commands the most grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England began to be rapidly developed after the accession of Elizabeth to the throne , the demand for subsistence became so much greater than the domestic supply , that vust quantities of wheat were annually imported , until , by bounties , and an improved system of tillage , the wheat crops of the island were so much increased , as not only to be sufficient for the supply of all the inhabitants , but to become a staple of exportation . Still there was not that general and strong interest excited , for advancing the science and art of agriculture , which has been so conspicuously evinced within the last fifty years , before the great land proprietors actively cooperated for collecting and diffusing intelligence throughout every portion of the kingdom ; for , although there had been several eminent writers on rural economy , from Fitzherbert , in 1534 , down to the practical and admirable Tull , in 1730 , whose successful // experiments and valuable treatise form an era in the history of British tillage , very few of the actual cultivators of the soil bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall , Young , Anderson , Bakewell , and Sinclair became distinguished , by their numerous , interesting , and invaluable publications . But the greatest , and perpetually operating , impulse was given by the establishment of a Board of Agriculture in 1793 , when Surveys of all the counties in England were immediately undertaken , in conformity to a method , which had been suggested by Marshall , several years before , to the Society of Arts in London . rrhe reports of the several commissioners being very voluminous , as they contained exact details relating to practical operations in every department of rural economy , digests were made , to render them more available , by the indefatigable projector and collaborator in the execution of this enlarged and efficient plan for advancing the important interests of the whole country . But even in that reduced form , with the other materials which he had individually collected during a period of nearly twenty years , which had been devoted to the subject , for compiling " a Compendious System of English Agriculture , " the work consists of fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely increased , from the commencement and during the progress of the war which followed the French revolution , and nearly half of the whole revenue being derived from direct taxes and the excise , it became of still greater consequence to the land-owners and their tenants , from whom that vast amount of income was chiefly received , to render each acre more productive , by the introduction of every possible improvement in the science and art of cultivation , which genius and skill could create or introduce , from the practice of any other age or country . Interest , knowledge , and industry were , therefore , actively and zealously united in a common cause , and the beneficial results have been truly wonderful . With a territory , whose area is not a third , and whose population is only halg that of France , and with a soil and climate not so propitious , the agricultural products of England are quadruple those of that empire . This astonishing difference is owing entirely to the superior methods of tillage , which have been so successfully extended over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly cultivated , prolific , and beautifully embellished domain , in all the appropriate appen ( lages which a refined taste in ornamental planting can devise and execute , that has existed at any period in the history of the human race ; while , in large portions of France , as well as Spain , Portugal , and many // of the Italian States , no favorable change has been introduced since the time of Virgil , and the implements , as well as the whole process of management , in rural affairs , is that described by the Roman bard . But , within fifteen or twenty years , the government of France has made highly commendable exertions to elevate the character and condition of its rustic population , by the establishment of agricultural and horticultural societies , experimental farms and gardens , the introduction of new plants , and awarding premiums for valuable experiments in all those departments of national industry . The same enlightened and patriotic spirit , which induced many of the most intelligent and eminent men in Great Britain to combine in an application to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable efforts to render the labors of the farmer more profitable to himself and more useful to the country , was simultaneously evinced in this Commonwealth , and with like happy consequences. , , The " Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture was incorporated soon after that which was established in England ; and the example has been eniulously followed in most of the counties throughout the State , while all have been encouraged and fstered by the seasonable and liberal endowments of the government . Much has been thus accomplished within the present century ; but , acting from a yet more enlarged and generous policy , the executive and legislature of the Commonwealth , with a munificence which reflects upon them the greatest honor , directed , two years since , an agricultural survey of each county to he made ; and a gentleman was appointed , as the commissioner for performing that difficult and laborious duty , who , from his attainments , industry , ardor , and practical experience , was eminently qualified for the station . This may undoubtedly with propriety and justice be considered one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization of the government ; for it is immediately interesting , and must be directly beneficial , not only to every citizen who depends upon the cultivation of the earth for his support , but to the whole population , of which the farming class constitutes at least seven tenths , being , at the same time , the grand nursery and constant source of supply for filling all the other diversified occupations in society . With a soil naturally as capable of tillage , and to as high a degree of perfection , as that of any other region , Massachusetts has been dependent on other States , for a large portion of the most indispensable products of agriculture , which are annually consumed ; not from a deficiency of territory , for , compared with the population , ours is double that of England , - nor because // it is not capable of yielding a sufficient quantity to meet the demand ; but mainly from an imperfect system of husbandry , and the general disinclination of the people to submit to the quiet , noiseless , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , by a perpetual cultivation of the earth . Besides these adverse causes , commerce , navigation , the fisheries , manufactories , the mechanical arts , and the mighty tide of emigration have made rapidly increasing drafts from the agricultural population , and thus produced a continually augmenting difference , between those who consume and those who produce , which has long since made it indispensable to expend the wealth acquired from other sources of income in procuring supplies from other parts of the Union ; and ultimately , so great became the disparity between the supply and the demand , that , as a nation , we have been compelled to resort to foreign countries for the first necessaries of life . It is our duty , then , to make every possible exertion to avert such alarming conjunctures in future ; for no nation can be said to be truly independent , and secure in its position and institutions , which is not at all times , and under all circumstances , fully capable of furnishing food and raiment , and whatever else is requisite , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first report made by Mr. Colman , there is ample testimony to warrant the assertion , that Massachusetts is capable of yielding more than triple the amount of agricultural products , which have hitherto been obtained . There is not a county , which the commissioner has visited , that has not presented examples of tillage , and experiments in all the branches of New England culture , which fully illustrate the immense advantages , that are derivable from a skilful application of science to the practical arts of husbandry . This verified and consequently most useful of all kinds of knowledge , but which has been confined within very limited and far separated circles , will hereafter be as universally possessed , through the medium of the reports on each county , as that which has been collected and published on every other subject connected with human industry ; and the whole , when completed , in the lucid , exact , and satisfactory manner , in which the first has been presented , will , allowing for the extent of territory surveyed , form the most accurate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will include the actual operations of each individual , who has best perfected that portion of rural economy to which his attention had been most exclusive // ly directed , from the nature of the soil , and geographical position as respects a market . hitherto , all the publications which have appeared on agriculture , have been principally compilations from the various treatises that have been written on that all-important subject , since the period of the illustrious Columella ; and , however laborious may have been the authors , and ingenuously faithful in design , or desirous of producing a work , which might the most perfectly subserve the purposes of the region of country for which it was intended , it is notorious , to every experienced and well instructed farmer and gardener , that they have invariably failed to accomplish , what had been so confidently anticipated ; and it is evident , to even the most superficial observer , that there is no other mode of concentrating , in a really useful form , the requisite information , for the general guidance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of enabling them to participate in the advantages which have been derived from the most approved methods of conducting the multifarious labors of a farm , than that , which has fortunately been undertaken by the government of Massachusetts , and which , from what has already been done , we have the fullest confidence will be thoroughly executed . Each of the most skilful and enlightened experiinentalists , whose results will be given in the reports of the Agricultural Commissioner , must have consulted the most celebrated authors , and to some extent taken them as guides , for directing them in their diversified operations ; and the benefits obtained will be at the command of every citizen . The agricultural survey is but the continuation and completion of a system , which has been projected for obtaining accurate information , as to the physical geography , topography , natural history , and general statistics of the Commonwealth . Massachusetts has been the first , of all the States in the Union , to cause a correct map to be constructed , based on the triangulation of its whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longitude of the most remarkable features and positions , and which , from the difficulties and expense to be encountered , has been applied only in France and Great Britain , to include a whole nation . Happily , however , for the navigation of the United States , the same operation is in progress , under the direction of the national government , fir forming complete hydrographical charts of the coast from Passamaquoddy to the Sabine . Connected with these important labors , a geological survey was undertaken , which has been most ably completed by Professor Hitchcock ; and the other departments of natural history , // including the animal and vegetable realms , have been directed to be explored , and the duty has been confided to several scientific gentlemen , from whom may be expected frill and interesting accounts of the quadrupeds , birds , fishes , reptiles , insects , and plants , which are peculiar to the State . These works will be honorable monuments of the enlightened and expanded views of the legislature , reflect lasting honor upon the chief magistrates , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitle the enlightened and meritorious gentlemen , who have participated in the very responsible labors , to the respect and gratitude of the present and all future generations . We have indulged so far in the general remarks , which the very interesting subject of agriculture has suggested , that there is left only sufficient space to commend to the real friends of the country the instructive Address , which the Agricultural Commissioner delivered , before the assembled yeomanry of several of the interior counties , during the last autumn . It is an impressive appeal to the farmers , urging them strenuously to endeavour to render their condition as prosperous and happy as their pursuits are respectable and important , by renewed efforts in the acquisition of intelligence , and to illustrate , by example , how independent and deserving of the highest consideration are those , who zealously emulate the hardy virtues and rural industry of their adventurous Anglo-Saxon ancestors.
