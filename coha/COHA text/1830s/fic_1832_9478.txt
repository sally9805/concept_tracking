PREFACE This is the second volume of two volumes of plays by John Howard Payne in the series of America 's Lost Plays , the first of which is entitled Trial without Jury and Other Plays by John Howard Payne . THE LAST DUEL IN SPAIN The manuscript of The Last Duel in Spain , apparently in an unknown hand , is in the Harvard collection . The Last Duel in Spain , a romantic comedy of " heroic " love intrigue , which was never performed , has been attributed traditionally to Payne . G. Harrison ( The Life and Writings of John Howard Payne , Philadelphia , 1885 , p. 395 ) lists it as Payne 's work , and A. H. Quinn ( A History of the American Drama from the Beginning to the Civil War , New York , 1923 , p. 439 ) not only ascribes it to Payne but states without qualification that the manuscript is in Payne 's hand ; whereas actually the writing seems more cursive and legible than Payne 's . What positive evidence there is , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , the unknown hand may be that of a professional translator , as Payne occasionally employed one . In the second place the play seems to have been designed as a kind of companion piece to The Spanish Husband and to have been written during the same period , 1822-1830 , for like The Spanish Husband , it is drawn indirectly from a play of Calderon , El Postrer Duelo de Espaa , but as the scattering of French phrases through the manuscript indicates , it is probably drawn directly from a French prose translation , D'Esmnard 's Le Dernier Duel en Espagne , which is included with Le Peintre de Son Dshonneur in the first volume of Chefs-D'Oeuvre des Thtres trangers ( 1822 ) . For two reasons the play seems extremely old-fashioned for a nineteenth century audience . First , Payne in his close translation failed to shorten the many long , sententious passages , which , as Washington Irving pointed out to him , apropos of The Spanish Husband , interfered with the rapid progress of the action demanded by the contemporary theatergoer . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " heroic " play , highly conventionalized in its motives of love and honor and its plot of intrigue and counter-intrigue , unless the central situation possessed some permanent interest . The emphasis in The Spanish Husband is placed upon pathetic domestic love , but in The Last Duel in Spain upon the solution of a problem that had long since lost its power to attract attention : the abolishment by Charles V of the legally authorized public duel in Spain .

Several Voices . Several Voices Long live the King ! Long live Caesar ! Other Voices . Other Voices Long live Charles ! All Together . All Together Long live Caesar ! Long live the King ! May the King live forever . Enter Don Jerome de Hansa and Don Pedro Torellas , meeting Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Signor don Pedro , welcome . How glad I am to see you ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas And you , my friend , my dear cousin , how happy I am to see you here ! Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Well , and how have you been ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Why very well at setting out , and in the end received in the best manner by our young king , by all his court . And you , my friend ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa I hardly know how to answer you . You breathe joy and happiness . Ought I to recount to you my troubles ? No , let us leave that for another time . Relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friend , good or ill fortune are in common between you and me ; my joy is yours , your cares are mine . Would it not be better to tell me first of these ? The recital of my good fortune will then be a consolation . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa No , my friend . Let us begin by the good first . ' T is the best method . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Much might be said upon that subject : there is always an advantage in being able to reckon upon a favorable conclusion . ' T is like a couch of rest that awaits us who suffer . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa You are full of content ; and it is better to succor the afflicted by administering the remedy beforehand . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Well , since you insist , I yield . As soon as the invincible Charles the Fifth , the heir of Jane , the descendant of Catholic kings , and daughter of Philip the First of Austria , to whom Spain owes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Caesars ; as soon , I say , as the invincible Charles became of age and had taken possession of this kingdom , weighty motives obliged him to return into Flanders . Like a faithful and devoted lover Spain for a whole year lamented an absence which seemed to her ages . Today she hears that her lord returns shining with a new splendor and that the imperial diadem glitters on his august brow ; that his illustrious grandsire , Maximilian , has bequeathed to him the sceptre of the Romans . All hearts intoxicated with joy and hope press to meet their monarch . The cities hasten to nominate deputies to bear to him the homage of his people ; and I who had not dared aspire to such an honor ( howbeit that fortune is pleased at times to favor the least worthy ) obtained the votes of my fellow citizens . As deputy of Saragossa , I was admitted to the honor of kissing his Majesty 's hand . I have nothing more to ask of Heaven ; all my wishes are gratified . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happiness of contemplating this illustrious monarch ! How admirably were majesty and grace mingled ! How at once he inspires both respect and love ! My soul is divided between the two sentiments . I have seen the countenance , have touched the hand of this young hero , who , scarcely in his eighteenth year , possesses all the experience of a ripened age . This is not yet all . The nobility of the two Castiles attended his Majesty . The first grandees looked upon it as a duty to be there in person ; and indeed , what finer ornament for a court than the presence of so many illustrious knights ? I should tell you too , my friend , that all these lords treated me with great good will . I return thence loaded with honors . But he who most sought to attach me to him is the Admiral of Castile . Scarcely arrived in town , he came to my house . He has permitted me to accompany him to the fte at court . Three noble dukes were the only ones invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bejar . But all the gentlemen of his family or his suite have partaken that honor . I know well that this distinction was not made to me entirely on my own account . My rank as deputy from the capital of Aragon partly conduced to it . For the Admiral , already descended from the blood royal of Castile , before the marriage of our King John the Second with the daughter of Fabricio Henriquez , of whom Ferdinand the Catholic was the worthy grandson , delights to see in that alliance a motive of interest for the Aragonese . That , probably , was the cause of the distinction I was honored with . But there is always a certain pleasure in the enjoyment of a particular favor , if it be due even to the merit of a noble , and we often find our vanity flattered by it . Impelled by gratitude , as soon as the King had determined to make his entry into Spain by way of Aragon , leaving Navarre on his right , I felt it my duty to offer the Admiral my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condescended to accept . Judge then if I have not reason to be satisfied . The important suit concerning the inheritance I lay claim to , my advancement whether in peace or in war , the honors to which I may aspire , my existence ( and no one can tell what one 's destiny may be ) ; in a word , my every interest may render the support of a patron necessary . The Admiral will become mine , and I know not where I could have found a better . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa This happiness is general . Without wishing to wound the self-love of anyone , since everyone may think at least he has the same rights as another , I dare say all the gentlemen of Saragossa are as well satisfied as yourself . I , for instance , thought it my duty to make an offer of my house for the service of the court and have received as my guest the Marquis of Brandenbourg , a German nobleman , who enjoys the good graces of the King , and who by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief of the armies of the Empire . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Indeed , the Marquis of Brandenbourg adds to the splendor of illustrious birth and distinguished valor , the most amiable qualities . He is universally esteemed . But let us speak of other matters . Till the King comes out to go to mass , we have all the time before us . Let me know , my friend , the cause of your grief . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Don Pedro , I will not conceal from you that my misfortune is , to have seen a beauty whose portrait I will not attempt to give you , for I must make use of commonplace praises , and then should tell you without exaggeration that the tresses of her golden hair are like rays of the sun ; that her fair and polished skin possesses the brightness and the whiteness of the driven snow ; her eyes are shining stars , are roses on beds of jasmine ; her teeth are orient pearl ; her neck an ivory column rounded by the graces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nymph . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas By my faith , I am transported with hearing you . The affair was rather cold at the beginning . There must be love in a story ; otherwise it is a body without a soul . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa You mock my troubles . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Why , what would you have ? I trembled at first for fear of some unfortunate event . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa What more unfortunate event could happen , Don Pedro , than to die deceived in one 's sweetest hopes ? One harsh breath has chased away the ideas in which I had cradled my infant happiness ; and the illusion has vanished as the light , shining clouds are driven away and scattered by the stormy winds . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Now that was really very well , my friend : now this an arial kind of sorrow , and very elegantly expressed . Never has a lover more grace than when he deplores the pangs he suffers . Some kind of folks require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive in his sorrows to complain with a grace . Come , my friend , suffer , love , hope , and believe that love will recompense you for all pain it causes . To know how to suffer is to have every right to its favors . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Your counsel would be more valuable if it did not come too late . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas How so ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa The cause of my torment  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Say on . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Is the rigor with which I am treated . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Ha ! Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa And then , jealousy  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas That 's another thing . Of whom are you jealous ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa That I know not , but jealous I am . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas And not know of whom ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Yes . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Tell me then  --  Jer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this fair one , I tried the fidelity of a waiting-maid , who before entering into her service , had been acquainted with my valet . This girl informed me that the heart of her mistress was no longer her own ; but she could not give me to know my rival , as she has but lately entered the situation . Seeking to know the cause of that disdain of which I am the victim , she one day heard a girl who has been there a long time say to her mistress , " Madam , soon he will be restored to your love ; Heaven will favor his arrival . Your request will be favorably received , and he will attain the rights of the property which belongs to him . Then there will be but one wish in the whole family , and your marriage will no longer be deferred . " Thus without knowing the name of my rival , there no longer rests any doubt of my misfortune . I have watched day and night without ever losing sight of the dwelling she inhabits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of whom I wish to know ; whence I conclude that those words " soon will be restored to your love " means that there has been some particular trouble which has prevented them seeing each other . Your arrival  --  Enter Gonsalvo Gon . Gonsalvo My lord  --  Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa What do you want , blockhead ? Gon . Gonsalvo It is time to come if you wish to join the procession . The Emperor has already entered the first court of the palace . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa I here then suspend my tale . I had just got to the moment when I met you . ' T is you that should be  --  But we 'll speak of that at a better opportunity . This lady I am speaking of will come presently to present to his Majesty a petition , on the subject of some right she lays claim to as hereditary in her family . I do not wish to have a mortified appearance in her presence . I must be at the court . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait for me . I shall return in an instant . Exit with Gonsalvo Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Ah ! It is not thus I act with love . No one knows a syllable , and I am myself my only confidant . O my dear Violante ! For all the riches of the world , I would not trust my secret to my best friend , my dearest kinsman . I come back to Saragossa on the wings of the wind , and the delay of minutes seems ages ; yet still have I not dared to approach the dwelling she inhabits . I wait till night , the silent patroness of my love , lends me her friendly shade . Enter Gins Gin . Gins Thanks to Heaven ! I find you once more alone and disengaged . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas What do you want ? Gin . Gins I want you to pay my wages and let me go . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Indeed ! What 's the matter now , that you wish to quit me so ? Gin . Gins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done me ! I only waited till you got home , to go about my business . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I have done you injustice ! Gin . Gins Yes , and so shocking that it has no example since valets have existed in the form of pages in the service of masters who are not old . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas What is this injustice ? I do n't comprehend  --  Gin . Gins A contraband love affair which has been smuggled in without paying toll or fee to me , your faithful esquire I What a whole year you keep all to yourself ; speak it between your teeth and never open your lips to me ! Soon as night appears , off go you , and never come back till dawn . If you return pleased , no one knows it but yourself ; if sad , why then I pay for your ill-humor . Beat me , with all my heart , but at least say , " Such a one is an aspic , a fury ! " Then it 's all well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady who occupies your thoughts ! My honor wo n't consent to it . I ca n't bear it any longer . If I can meet with a master more communicative , be his temper what it may  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Why you have drowned your senses in wine . Gin . Gins No , signor , wine is not got here for nothing . I deny your major ; either the lady 's name or my wages , and I go . Music heard behind Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Retire . We shall see about it . This is no time for foolery . The King is coming out . Gin . Gins See , there is a lady of quality in the way who is advancing toward his Majesty . She is well attended . Among her knights I see one  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Whom ? Gin . Gins Don Jerome de Hansa , your friend and kinsman . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Heavens ! What do I behold ? Violante is doubtless the lady of whom he spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King ! Exeunt Scene 2 : Court of the Palace . Voices . Voices Make room , gentlemen . Enter Charles . At his side , the Admiral of Castile and the Marquis of Brandenbourg ; behind him , the Constable of Castile ; on the other side , Donna Violante de Urrea in mourning ; Don Jerome de Hansa ; numerous suite Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Kneeling at the King 's feet Sire , I am  --  Char . Charles Rise , madam . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea She sees Don Pedro . Aside Another source of trouble ! I can scarcely breathe . To Charles Sire , I am Donna Violante de Urrea , daughter of Don Diego de Urrea , whose services in your army and in your councils obtained for him the confirmation of a recompense merited by his ancestors , the office of hereditary governor of Alarcon . My father is dead and has left but a daughter . I have no other position than the right of naming , with your royal approbation , and that of my elder relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Majesty for the enjoyment of my claim . The new governor will become my husband ; and this is the only dower I can bring him . Char . Charles Takes the petition I shall not forget it . Constable . Con . Constable Sire  --  Char . Charles Giving him the petition Put me in mind of this presently . Keep that petition apart . The knights file off before the emperor who addresses them Chevaliers , it is my will that henceforward recompense should accompany merit and not that merit should sue for recompense . Exit with suite . Martial music Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea May Heaven eternally preserve your days ! 1st Chev . First Chevalier As he passes her How beautiful ! 2nd Chev . Second Chevalier And how she has recovered from her first alarm ! Her sense equals her beauty . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg The Spanish ladies surpass those of all other countries . What a shape ! What grace ! Ad . Admiral of Castile If you say so , Marquis de Brandenbourg , what compliment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marquis of Brandenbourg The same thing . There is no vanity in doing myself justice . Exeunt Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Stop , Don Jerome . You should not follow me . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Madam , I know what I should do . I place myself amongst your servants . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Stop , I say , or I must . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Madam , my accompanying you is not an act of familiarity on my part . ' T is only discharging a duty . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea I have done , sir . Let us respect the place where we are . Aside Ah ! Don Pedro , if this night should be favorable ! Bring it quickly , god of love ! Exeunt Gin . Gins Now we are alone . Let us return to our accounts . I have served you since  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Wretch ! Do n't speak to me of that , when I am bursting with anger and vexation . Gin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you were as calm and affable with me ! Signor , who has turned your wits ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas What , you will talk when you see what I suffer ! Beats him Gin . Gins And I , too , for company . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Peace , nor anger me farther . Gin . Gins Calm yourself , signer ; since I am not worthy to learn by words what 's the matter with you , do n't tell it to me with your hands , I beg of you . I do n't understand the language ; and return to my account . I want to go , or to know who is the fair lady to whom I am indebted for all the contradictions of which I am the victim . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas You shall neither know , nor go . Take care of yourself . Enter Don Jerome Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Don Pedro ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas To Gins Retire . Gin . Gins There it is again ! Jer . Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I adore . I told you she was going to present herself before the Emperor . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Yes . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa What think you of her ? Is she not enough to justify my passion ? Has she not in her favor , sense , birth , and beauty ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Oh , certainly . Aside Let me think first what I shall say . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Now , my friend , learn what you can do for me . She can have no suspicion of you , since you have never testified any desire of attaching yourself to her . With an appearance of being engaged in some other affair , you must fix yourself in this street . Between us two , it is impossible but in the end we shall make some discovery by those who pass through it with apparent design or cast the slightest glance of meaning toward the Venetians of that balcony . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I shall be here every hour , I promise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another design in my head , should this not succeed . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas What is it you intend ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa To keep no longer any measures with her , but to push gallantry to scandal . My rival in his turn must suffer what I have borne myself . This evening I fill the street with musicians ; if it is honorable in a gentleman to be silent when he is blest , a coward only can contain himself when his jealousy is provoked . He will be compelled to make himself known . Adieu ! The gauntlet 's thrown . I am going to follow her carriage . Exit Gin . Gi ns Signor , may I approach ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas No ! Now  --  nor never ! But is it this poor fellow 's fault ? Gins , my good lad , my friend , my faithful companion , do what thou wilt henceforth ; but leave me at present to myself . Gin . Gins What the deuce has calmed this storm ? Ped . Don Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gins Diocletian never invented a torment equal to that of serving a master who never tells you his affairs ; if it were only that one might at least chat over them with a friend . Exit Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Just Heaven ! Where am I ? My love is such a secret that Violante and one servant only know it . To see each other we have a mysterious passage which leads from her house to mine on the opposite side of the street ; and this concealment should last till our several affairs , her claim on the Emperor , or the end of my law suit , give us the means of a favorable union . To confess my love to Don Jerome is to break my oath . I forfeit my word to speak of it to anyone whomever ; and not to avow it is coward-like to bear the shame of knowing that another woos her . On the other hand , to be myself the cause of jealousy to Don Jerome , whilst he gives me all his confidence , is to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time run on , and wait till it become more favorable , is yet a baseness , for at last our marriage comes , and all must be revealed . And then , what infamy ! It will be said that I consented to another 's love at the very time I thought of making her my wife . Besides that , Don Jerome has said that none but a coward could contain himself when his jealousy was openly provoked . To show myself in this case is to hazard the honor of my mistress , and to commit myself with a friend who will not demand a satisfaction . And not to do so is much the same : She will be openly addressed , and he her declared lover . I shall have the right then to complain of both and yet should lose them both . How to find a mode of justifying a quarrel with Violante ? That would leave me at liberty to act as I would with Don Jerome . Let me see how I can contrive it . I 'll go and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the serenade shall serve me for a pretext . I will complain of it , accuse her of inconstancy , and my jealousy shall serve as an excuse to her . She will have to reproach herself as being the cause of it ; and after all , should this not succeed , should I lose Violante , I can think of no other means . My brain 's distracted . This dragging in different ways , these doubts , these transports of jealousy , this torture of the mind and heart force me to break silence . Let me at least preserve honor . Though the amorous proverb says , " My mistress above all , " the proverb lies . Honor has precedence . ' T is honor above all ! Exit Scene 3 : Castle of Donna Seraphina . At the back of the stage a confused noise of peasants singing . Giletta and Brito , with a crowd of peasants who sing and dance before Seraphina . Ser . Servant You have done your best , my friends ; nothing can remove my melancholy . Brit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what cause of sadness a handsome , rich , young lady can have . If I were you , I should like ' em always to be singing and dancing before me . Ser . Servant Brito , the cause of my grief is so public , that it would be useless to endeavor to conceal it . I take a pleasure rather in telling it , that everyone may see the injustice of it . That is my sole consolation . Gil . Giletta Madam , if that can console you , ease your heart with us . Ser . Servant Don Pedro Torellas is my cousin ; we have both of us a claim to an estate of importance , to which we each think ourselves equally entitled . Our mutual relations wished to make up the dispute between us by joining our right in a union of our hands in marriage . Don Pedro at first appeared pleased with the intended union ; and I was not insensible to his attentions . All at once he changed his conduct in the most offensive manner when the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , when I had gladly yielded my consent . This insult has inspired me with an aversion for him . It was enough that I was a woman , had I not been his cousin even , not to have shown me such contempt . My love is changed into hatred , into fury ; if I could , I would tear out his life . This is why I have sought a retreat in this castle , why I keep out of his presence , till I find some favorable moment to avenge myself on his honor or his life . Brit . Brito Our mistress is right . And I too , one day that I went to town , I saw Don Pedro ; and says I to him , " You 're a wicked , ungrateful , disloyal knight , and if I had you where nobody was by , I 'd take the life of you . " Ser . Servant And what said he ? Brit . Brito He never said a word . To be sure , I spoke to him in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Servant What stupidity ! Gil . Giletta Madam , he only does it to amuse you , to divert you , like the ball which we have prepared to celebrate your arrival . Ser . Servant There is no longer any pleasure for me . Brit . Brito We shall sing and dance anyhow , and try to make you share in our joy . They sing , dance and go out . Exit Seraphina Brit . Brito Detaining Giletta Giletta ? Gil . Giletta What do you want ? Brit . Brito Why , to say the truth , I want you to love me . Gil . Giletta How sensibly he expresses himself . Why , that 's quite a new way of declaring love . Brit . Brito To love honestly and openly is the true way of loving . Gil . Giletta What folly ! Do n't you see that everyone has their eyes on us ? Brit . Brito Do you appoint a properer place then . Gil . Giletta Asi de He shall pay for his familiarity . Aloud I am going tomorrow morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copse in such a way that no one can see you , except myself when I come ; and there I can listen to you without intermeddlers . Brit . Brito Oh ! I 'll hide in such a way that the devil himself that always finds his own , would seek me in vain . Gil . Giletta I 'll come ; but take care . Brit . Brito Lord , you have made me so happy . Gil . Giletta Let no one see you . Aside I swear I 'll keep him there all day ! Brit . Brito I tell you I 'll hide well enough . I 'll not stir till I see you . They go out dancing Scene 4 : The house of Donna Violante . Enter Donna Violante and Flora . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Is everyone gone to bed , Flora ? Flor . Flora Yes , madam . I have fastened the door of this chamber where we are alone . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Come , clear away the large picture which conceals the secret entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to listen to us , for we have curious girls in the house . There is one I have only lately taken into my service , and whom I do not yet know . Aside Either my heart deceives me , or Don Pedro is already waiting . She draws away the picture , and Don Pedro is discovered . Flora goes off Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Yes , ' t is I ; he who waits for happiness is ever impatient . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea At last , my only good , my love , my lord , I have the bliss again to see you . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas If you complain of absence , what should I do ? Aside Alas ! How dissemble my feelings ? Aloud ' T is I , who should accuse the slowness of the hours ; I , to whom thy presence is life , thy absence , death . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Let us leave this discussion , of which suffers most from this absence . It does not please me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna Violante de Urrea If you are in the right , ' t is a proof your love is the more tender of the two ; if I , then I love you more than you love me . Poor alternative , in which each must necessarily find something to regret . So , my dear friend , let us be content one with the other , and let it suffice to know that not a single minute flies , without thy image engraved upon the memory , and on the heart of thy faithful and affectionate Violante . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Here is another question to resolve . Have I not done better on my side , in not seeking to remember , fair Violante ? Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea How ! Pedro ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Yes ; need we endeavor to remember what we never have forgotten ? Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Truce with these subtleties and flatteries , my love ; let us speak seriously , with perfect frankness , of what really concerns us . How are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near you , happy . Aside I should indeed be happy , if other troubles did not oppress me . Aloud And you , Violante , how are you ? Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Doubly happy : first , in having the pleasure of seeing you ; and again , because I trust the audience I had of the King , where you saw me , will eventually prove favorable to my wishes . The goodness of his Majesty gives me hopes of obtaining what I solicit , and of offering it to thee . Were you glad when you saw me ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I think I never suffered more . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea How ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas You know the property I possess is little . I would tave given all the world , all , save my honor , not to have seen thee in that situation . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Ah ! If I had thought that could displease you , had the world 's empire been in question  --  Ped .

Donna Violante de Urrea What ails you , Don Pedro ? Why that angry look ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Nothing at all . But this is another thing : I was shedding tears , and here people come to sing . ' T is everywhere the same  --  some sing , while others weep . Mus .

Donna Violante de Urrea Should it even be meant to me , is it in my power to hinder or restrain a mad or silly passion ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas No , but if that is your excuse , is it my business to suffer it ? Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Listen . She forces him to stay Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Let me go . I am determined to see and know this gallant . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea It is Don Jerome de Hansa , if that be all you wish to know . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas You knew it then ! Perfidious ! And how feigned surprise ! Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Every woman who boasts to him she loves of inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity ; in place of flattering the self-love of her lover , she does but provoke contempt . Ped .

Donna Violante de Urrea I have neither authorized his passion nor his serenade . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas ' T is false . Such liberties are never taken , but where they are sure of being favorably listened to . Singers continue and repeat the burthen frequently . Don Pedro and Violante speak in dumb show Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Don Pedro , my love , you shall not go . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Cease to oppose me .

Donna Violante de Urrea And is it thus you would commit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Are you astonished at it ? When you betray your faith , ought I to fear to break my word ?

Don Pedro Torellas Your pardon , madam . Devoured by suspicions and jealousy , I can not condemn myself to silence . ' T is you who have given birth to those suspicions ; it is your fault . Aside Now I may speak . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea My fault ! Mine ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Yes . Is it not you who have given me to hear those charming words , that delightful music ? Vio .

Gins watching him , behind . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas She has justified my quarrel and has nothing apparently to reproach me with , should I even reveal our secret ; ' t is she who appears culpable . I have little to fear from her anger ; the anger of a jealous man does him little harm in the eyes of his mistress . Now , let me see . I must find a fair mode , in which , fulfilling at once the duty of a gentleman , a friend , and a lover , I may tell Don Jerome the plain truth : That ' t is I who am the cause of his alarm , and that ' t is he who has given me offense , both unintentionally . Now to do that . But who is behind me ? Sees Gins Gin . Gins ' T is I , who am following you . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas You ! Gin . Gins Yes , master , as up to this moment you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress , nor to settle my account , and that still you keep me in your service , why here I am . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas And since when is it you have been so officious , so exact ? Gin . Gins My lord and master , God touches hearts . I ought not to be always accused . As I have many faults to reproach myself with , and as I am about to quit your service , I wish to make reparation and to make up for the omissions I have made in the exercise of my duty . I will neither quit you , nor lose sight of you till you have paid my wages or confided to me the object of your desires . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Do you think , scoundrel , that I do n't understand you ? You are here on tiptoe to discover if , in my grief , some indiscreet word escape me , and pick it up . Gin . Gins Why , the devil must have told you so . And since it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without catching the least thing to say , I beseech you , master , take pity on your servant , relieve him from the state of uncertainty , if it were only to spare him the regret of having formed a rash judgment ; for if I were to imagine your lady as to whom I have only conjecture to form is round as a ball , or as meagre as a skeleton , or as black as charcoal , or as red as the fire , or old , and that 's saying everything , for the greatest fault in a woman is to be a living ruin , bearing witness to the power of time  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Truce with buffoonery . Go see if Don Jerome has left his house . Gin . Gins ' T is but a little while since I saw him enter the palace . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Go seek him . Tell him I wait for him in the Cathedral Square and that I beg he will come here and speak to me . Gin . Gins That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don Pedro Torellas Yes , perhaps it is . Gin . Gins In what comedy did one ever see a valet treated thus ? Exit Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Why should I torment myself ? Each way has it disagreeable ; but I know Don Jerome . He is haughty , passionate ; I shall never make him hear reason . However , the lot is cast ; the business is commenced . Let me do my duty , and let fate look after the consequences . Enter Don Jerome , Gonsalvo , and Gins Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa If I had known where you were , Don Pedro , I would have saved you the trouble . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I wish to speak with you . To Gins and Gonsalvo Retire . Gon . Gonsalvo Gins , what 's the meaning of all this ? What 's the matter between our two masters ? Gin . Gins They are our masters . Gon . Gonsalvo Come , you shall know what I know of mine . Gin . Gins I 'll do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of mine . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa How I am obliged by your kindness ! How fortunate I was in opening my heart to you ! Do you know this gallant ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas As I do myself . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa You will tell me his name then . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas There are first two things to observe . Aside If my moderation could but have any effect ! Aloud First , if he had ever foreseen that he should be your rival , he would never have so engaged himself as not now to be able to draw back . Secondly , if you knew his name even , it would grieve you . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Why ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Because he is your friend ; and since he is admitted and preferred by this lady , and you are not , you ought not to cause him a pain he never had an intention of giving you ; for he was favored before you were known . Jer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his designs to please me , had he previously known mine , I admire his delicacy ; but as to my giving up in his favor ( be he who he may ) , as to my renouncing , I say , a pursuit in which I am so heart and soul engaged , it would be a folly to think of it . If he could not foresee the pain he might cause me . I in turn , can not spare him that which my determination may give him now . So , my dear Don Pedro , as you have been kind enough to find him out , tell me at once his name . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas It is one who so far humbles himself , as to beg you would not trouble the smooth heaven of his love ; and I , throwing myself at your feet , I ask that favor as your near relative , as your dearest friend . Do it for my sake . Be generous enough to desist from your pursuit . You will oblige a common friend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Do me the pleasure to let me know , whether he has you engaged to look after his interests , or you are occupied with mine . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I am occupied with yours , since I seek to spare you the regret of having done an unjust action . See you not that the intention of a mediator may be to serve both parties and avoid an unhappy quarrel ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa If such be your intention , Don Pedro , it is he who owes you kindness for your good will . It is he who fears the quarrel . As for me , I fear it not , and I owe you on that account no obligation . Going Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Listen . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa What would you ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas To tell  --  Aside should I fear his passion ? Aloud  --  what I have said on his part , although I have employed the tone of entreaty and submission , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa What then ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas It is that he has consulted prudence alone , the common resource of him who has nothing else at heart . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa By my faith , when a man is not in such a case ready , sword in hand , and seeks a mediator , the thing is clear . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Would you wish to find that this is not the case , and that he hesitates only because he is your friend ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Yes . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Well ! Know then  --  Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Say on . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas This rival is  --  Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Who ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I. Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa You ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Yes , I ! I love Violante . It is I who , I will not say favored by her ( a gentleman may have such honor , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , if not favored by her , have not to complain of her neglect . And if it be necessary to call any other witness to witness of what I say , it is of me that woman spoke at Violante 's house , when she said to her mistress that " soon I should be restored to her affection . " Now , have you heard me ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Before any reflection  --  why , when I confided to you my passion , did you not tell me what you now have said ? I ask you that . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I thought thereby to have in my power to oblige you . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa How , to oblige me ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I hoped to obtain sufficient empire over myself to give place to you . I found the effort was beyond my strength ; for after , ' t is difficult to conquer one 's self , and I dare not promise , lest I should not have courage to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken openly in the beginning ; but I remember our conversation was interrupted , by I know not what accident , and that I had not time to explain myself to you when I wished it . Now , ' t is for you to judge if , being your rival , this disposition on my part to seek a roundabout way , a mode of conciliation , has been , could have been , as you have termed it , a shameful submission , a base humiliation in favor of a rival , a resource which none employ but those who have heart for no other ; finally , if this has been a want of courage concealed under the veil of prudence  --  Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa I am sorry for having said it , but I never retract ; therefore , Don Pedro , what is said , is said . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas And what have you said ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa If we were in a less public place , I would tell you . Ped . Don Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell it to me in . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa On this side we go straight to the Ebro  --  Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Go on , I follow you . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa We can go together . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Come on then .

Otherwise we shall be infinitely the loser . We shall be deprived of the sight of that multitude of handsome women who are at the balconies . Let us admire at our ease these living stars , these flower gardens suspended in the air , that prodigious variety of colors as vivid as the rainbows of a light shower in the month of May . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas My lord , the brightness of the court is reflected from the city .

Ped . Don Pedro Torellas It seems to me , my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Castile Preoccupied ? No ; but to say the truth , I feel a very natural desire to find out a female whom I only had a glimpse of for an instant , for the first time today . Ped .

Admiral of Castile At the audience of the Emperor , where she came to petition his Majesty , on some affair I know not what . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Aside This blow too , pitiless fate !

Donna Violante de Urrea Wherefore ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Because I am born rather to deserve being hated than sought after by the ladies . Vio .

Donna Violante de Urrea Yes , you . After your menaces yesterday , I feared lest you should commit some mad folly and have come disguised thus to seek you . The step , I allow , is unpleasant , but yours , Don Pedro ! Yesterday evening , the outcries , the noise and grief had distracted me ; I knew not what measures to take . I come today to beg that you will listen to me . In better spirits at present , perhaps I may find means to persuade you . The ruinous condition of our fortune , Don Pedro , and the embarrassment attendant upon a birth which has need of being accompanied by other advantages , oppose our union . Of two evils let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives , with frankness and in the customary forms ; let us resolve to brave the reproaches of wounded vanity and set down to the account of love the privations for which we ought to be prepared . Provided that I live with you , the most humble asylum would be sufficient for my happiness , and what signify other riches ? On the other hand , if our secret must be made public , in place of serving as a pretext for duels and jealous transports , is it not better that it should be known in a manner which neither compromises our honor nor endangers your life ? Once my husband , troublesome gallantry has no longer the least excuse ; my honor is preserved as clear , as brilliant as the star of day . Let us then take a better stand ; a husband 's presence has more power than a lover 's sword .

Sighs belong but to rejected lovers , and you have not to complain of my affection . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Violante , Heaven is my witness . Aside What shall I say to her ? I am lost ; the remedy comes too late . Aloud That I am affected deeply by thy love , that I admire thy judgments , that thy counsels are dear to me ! To such a degree that  --  Enter Gins Gin .

Don Pedro Torellas It is impossible for me to tell you . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Ah ! Do not let me imagine , by this mysterious reserve , by this refusal to speak , to agree to my proposal , that your love is but a feint ; that you , that you seized the pretext of a reproach to make me , that you might return to the former ties which attached you to your cousin .

Don Jerome will be entirely delivered from my rivalry , and I shall not have to accuse myself of ingratitude towards one or the other . I think I have hit upon an excuse for the absence ; but to give it all the appearance of necessity , I will go see her at he own house . I can get through the secret passage from my house to hers ; ' t is but to give the appointed signal . Confused Voices . Confused Voices At the back of the stage The other side ! The other side !

He makes to the foot of the ravine . Enter Donna Seraphina , couteau de chasse in her hand ; Giletta , with a boar spear ; a servant Ser . Servant I wish to give him the last blow myself .

" " No , ' t is you who ought to take it . " And then there was so many compliments , each insisting on his side , till one picks up the sword and restored it to the other , who answered , " I receive from you honor and life . " And then they each went away different ways , as is the case when all such affairs are finished , the conqueror making a great bragging , and the conquered doing the same . Ser .

Brito Why , something  --  some words here  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what lady , Violante ; for he said , as he presented him his sword , " Remember , ' t is understood that I adore Violante , and that I wo n't renounce her . " And the other replied , " I abandon Violante , who came to supplicate me , to weep , to throw herself in my arms ! ' T is an infamy ! " Ser . Servant What have I heard ? Heavens ! ' T is Violante ( Oh , cruel friend ! ) , who is the cause of Don Pedro 's refusal ! ' T was to betray me with such perfidy that she received me at her house when I went to the city , and whom , on my side , I treated with so much friendship when she comes to my castle to enjoy the pleasure of the chase . Oh , furies ! Under the semblance of the most sincere attachment , to assassinate one 's friend ! She has not even the pretext of being ignorant of what she was doing , for a thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends had judged so suitable to Don Pedro and to me . It was not enough then , that Don Pedro should be disdainful and ungrateful towards me , but Violante must superadd on her part this treachery !

Let me rather bless the chance which arms me with the means to avenge myself on both . As God lives ! Perfidious cousin , false and ungrateful friend , but ye shall dearly pay me . He shall lose , on his side , honor ; and she , her dearest hopes . Quick , Fabius , let them bring up the carriage . Goes off with servant Brit .

Exeunt Scene 3 : An apartment in the house of Donna Violante . Enter Donna Violante and Flora Flor . Flora Madam , they say tears are soothing ; but then they come from the heart . To weep so much must weaken it . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Let me weep , Flora . In affliction our weakness has no other resource ; ' t is our only vengeance . Flor . Flora I do not say your grief may not be just . Yes , not to deign even to answer you , to leave you in the midst of the street and turn his back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to weigh above all . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea And you never say a word of the cruellest of my pangs ? Flor . Flora I do not know  --  Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea ' T is on account of Seraphina  --  Flor . Flora Madam , that is but an imaginary fear , for he has told you himself that he will return and will answer everything . One should not always think the worst ; we are ignorant of his motives . Perhaps his explanation may fill you with joy . Be calm ; depend upon it , he will be here tonight . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Ah , Flora ! I shall not be so happy ! Had he intended to explain himself , must he not have seen the state in which I was ? He would not have waited till this evening to see me . The entrance of this apartment is equally open to him day and night . Flor . Flora Hush ! Listen ! Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea What ? Flor . Flora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The explanation arrives just in time to dissipate your grief . ' T is he ! Now I hope your tears will cease . All your wishes will be satisfied . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Go place yourself near the door . I will take on me to remove the picture . She draws the picture , and Don Pedro appears Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Sweet Violante , do not complain ; do not doubt my faith nor my tender attachment to you . Listen to me first . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Ungrateful , mad , imprudent man ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Listen . Aside I know not what to say to her . To tell her a falsehood for the first time ! Aloud A dreadful affliction rends my heart . You will not be insensible to it ; you will excuse me . You know my uncle , Don Alphonso of Barcelona . A courier who has just arrived , they say , has related at the inn , that he has been assassinated in the most barbarous manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . This is the reason for which I left you , when they brought me my horse . I had the happiness to get there and to learn from him  --  Voices . Voices Stop ! Stop ! Enter Flora Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea What noise is this ? Flor . Flora One , madam , we are accustomed to ! ' T is Donna Seraphina who according to custom has just stopped at the door . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I must then retire . Going Vio . D onna Violante de Urrea Yes , from this room , but not from the house . For you shall not go till I have heard what you have to say to me . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Well . But as Seraphina has no doubt of you and is pleased to trust you with her confidence , speak to her of me ; you will find that as you imagine that you have two causes of complaint , you will be doubly satisfied .

ServantSpeaking as she enters Let the carriage wait . I shall be down in an instant . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea How , my dear friend , so short a time to stay ? You begin by giving me bad news . Disagreeable things are always the first which announce themselves at my house . Ser . Servant Ah , Violante , my dear friend ! ' T is a dreadful affliction which brings me here , an affliction of which I shall die . I am come to implore your aid , to trust to you my life , my honor , my soul . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea You need not say so much . You know you may confide in me with safety . Calm yourself , my dear . Take breath a moment , and let me know what it is you wish me to do . Ser . Servant I wish only  --  Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Speak . Ser . Servant That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to my cousin , Don Pedro , here . Aside Shall I be able to conceal my agitation ? Aloud It would be better that I should speak to him in your presence ; for you must know that the old dotards among my relations have begun again to plague me on account of him . At first I listened to the proposition with pleasure ; but as he hesitated to give his consent , I wo n't hear tell of it . I abhor him to that degree that , were he a sovereign prince , I would not marry with him . What said I , marry him ? To speak of it , aye , to think of it , is injurious to me . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea That 's an affair easily managed . Aside Heaven bless you ! Ser . Servant Asid e How she 's rejoiced ! Aloud And as I am not so far mistress of my actions but that I must pay some respect to white hairs , faithful to my resolution , yet not wishing to offend my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old relations , I have formed the design of saying to himself . Since he has already acted so disdainfully , I wish to beg him to continue it ; and thus I shall have nothing to reproach myself with . Your friendship then will suffer me to send for him here ? I have no other house in town at my disposal for this interview . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Make no difficulty with me , my dear ; you shall see him here . Why , this is a trifle . Ser . Servant One thing more . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Speak it . Ser . Servant As I have no one with me , let me beg of you , to let me have some one to go in search of him for me . I suppose , distant as he has shown himself , he will have politeness in the room of love . Let them say ' t is I who wish to speak to him . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Whom shall I send ? Flora ! Flor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Do you know him ? Flor . Flora So well that no one in the house could sooner or more easily discover where he is . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea And where did you get these directions , pray ? Flor . Flora Madam , before I came to you , I lived at the house of a gentleman in the city , who saw him every day in a society close by this house . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Well , since it 's so , go , tell him that Seraphina wishes to speak to him at my house , do you understand ? Flor . Flora Yes , very well , madam . Aside He will follow me through the gallery , and I 'll conduct him round by this door , as if he had come from the street . To Don Pedro at the back of the stage where he is concealed Come , follow me . Exit with Don Pedro Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Aside Very well ! I shall have the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I shall be revenged , Don Pedro . Ser . Servant As ide How happy she is now ! Ah ! She forgets that pleasure 's day is often sorrow 's eve . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea So , my dear Seraphina , the vexation which the indifference of your cousin caused you is converted into determined hatred ? Ser . Servant A side How she loves to hear me repeat it , and I 'll not balk her . Aloud Yes , my dear . What woman scorned would not do as much ? Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea He is blind to be insensible to your charms . Ser . Servant Ah ! Your heart is too good . I knew I might rely on you . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Most assuredly you may ; I deserve all your confidence . Don Pedro and Flora enter Flor . Flora Was I not right , madam ? Here is my lord , Don Pedro . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I am quite at a loss , ladies . I know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it to charming Violante I am indebted for the permission ? Or is it you , fair Seraphina , who have furnished the motive ? However , since both one and the other have claims upon my soul , my life , in what can I employ them ? Ser . Servant My lord , Don Pedro , let us lay aside compliments and come to the fact which interests us both . You think probably that under favor of a friendship which I abuse , perhaps , I have taken the liberty of sending for you here , to complain of the indifference with which you have regarded your conquest and your having scorned in my person the blood , the rank , the advantage of our family . No , signor , I have not the silly pretension to constitute myself the judge of your conduct ; I ask not of the stars an account of their secret influences . You shall see that I have other thoughts ; far from addressing my reproaches , ' t is my thanks I give you . But since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess that of bearing the injury generously . You have taken the first step , you commenced the breach . Continue it , and spare me the regret of being compelled to the same in my turn . It is too painful for a woman who respects herself to cause vexation to succeed sentiments of another nature . Do not imagine this is a resolution lightly conceived . Listen to my motives : This very day I was spoken to about you . Our relatives wishful of preserving the estates of the family in the right line , ever fear lest they should pass through you or me to some minor branch , and the arms of Torellas be confounded with those of a stranger . But it is not I who have refused to confirm their hopes by our marriage . ' T is to you then , they will naturally address themselves , to you who first testified the repugnance for this reconcilement of family claims ; so I have thought that their present applications may have been induced on your part . Has it chanced to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the rigor of a certain lady for whom you drew your sword today ? This perhaps is a rash judgment , and in this case the misfortune is not great ; but if I have guessed aright , it is fit you should know that I am not made to serve your love 's last shift . Since the dangers to which she exposes you , whose name I leave to others the care of publishing , have made you come to yourself again and change your intentions respecting me , ' t is a stronger reason on my side why I should pay no respect to them ; so I repeat , and will never cease to repeat , Don Pedro , I beg you will keep your character and refuse having anything to do with me . I am perfectly consoled for your contempt , and you can stand in need of no consolation , you , who commenced by being insensible for my kindness . If the question should again be brought on the carpet , and I find myself under the necessity of stating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , no matter what persuasion or violence they may employ , here is my answer : I will never give my hand to a man who in an affair of honor , could not keep his sword ; I will never associate my existence with that of a man who owes his life to the mere pity of his adversary . Exit Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Hear ! Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Wait ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Ah ! Wretch that I am ! Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea And that I am ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas What deadly coldness ! Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea What shuddering has seized me ! Ped . Don Pedro Torellas What sudden terror ! Cruel fate ! Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea A fatal destiny . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas My heart has ceased to beat . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea The words expire on my lips . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Disloyal knight ! Was it thus shamelessly to falsify it , thou hast given me thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt but it is in the crucible of our rage that generosity is refined . Don Pedro , if the matter which now presses on your mind had not deprived of the faculty of thinking , you might think perhaps that I should give myself up to grief and overwhelm you with reproaches for having betrayed our secret , compromised my honor , and trampled under foot all consideration for me . But think otherwise . My affection gets the better of my anger . I think no longer of the injury done me ; I complain neither of your passion nor your fatal imprudence ; I admit the cause of jealousy . Would you aught more ? I agree to look upon a folly as a proof of love . Let us have but one only thought ; let us forget what regards me and think now only of you . Some fatal accident ( I judge so from what that cruel woman has just spoken ) , a fatal accident , I say , has deceived your valor . Your reputation is at stake . ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you life and honor , and that a woman publishes it openly . In affairs so delicate a single witness suffices ; and although you may except against the testimony of an avowed enemy , still , the public made acquainted with the tale , nothing can prevent scandal which gathers as it flies like the contagion of a pestilence . You know your duty , Don Pedro . Here is mine . All I can do , all that I profess belongs to you . Dispose of it . Do not render yourself unhappy on my account . I shall hide my tears in the cloister 's gloom , with no other hope but that of being always faithful to you . Your honor , no matter at what price , must above all be saved . I love you , Don Pedro , I adore you , idolize you . But love , adore , and idolize your honor still more ! Adieu , till I see you revenged , or adieu forever ! Exit Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Stay ! Hear me ! She has shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to tell her , her counsel should be followed to the tittle . Oh ! Doubly , she shall not see me till after I am avenged , or she shall never see me more . THE THIRD DAY Scene 1 : Before one of the gates of the city , and entrance of the public walk of Saragossa . Enter Don Pedro and Gins , the latter from the gate , the other from the promenade . Gin . Gins It was high time I should find you . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas You are come in fine time , if you think I have any to hearken to your foolery . Gin . Gins What are you going to ill use me again at first , to be sorry for it directly afterwards ? Signor , let us reason amicably . What a thing , to leave the city with that woebegone melancholy air , at the moment when all the nobility and the people , attracted by the news of the King 's departure , are crowding the avenues of the palace ; and you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty , you are not even the last today . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas It is precisely because all are content , because the King treats them all with honor , that I shun speaking to anyone , whoever he may be , and that I fly to this solitude . Aside In truth , since I left Violante 's house , I have not dared to look at anyone . I tremble lest they should have known my disgrace . Shame o'erwhelms me ; therefore , I seek this solitude to meditate on means of re-establishing myself in the public opinion . Come , let me first see what the whole city will say of me when it shall be told that  --  Brit . Brito Si nging behind the scene at the back of the stage " Two cavaliers fought for life and death .

Not through fear of your adversary , but through respect for the King ! Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa The King ! At that name every gentleman obeys . I withdraw . Exit . Enter Charles V and suite Char . Charles Marquis , Admiral , what is all this noise ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Sire , I will tell your Majesty . No one here should bear the blame , but I , who alone am culpable . Oh , Charles , first of the name amongst our kings , and fifth among the rulers of the empire , ' t is an affair of honor , an affair which has in one instant o'erstepped the distance between honor and infamy , between the highest elevation and the most ignominious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your favor and blest in your goodness ; today sees me here burthened with shame and contempt , a sad example of the vicissitudes of fortune , who frequently reserves the greatest fate for him who rises the highest . The man who seeks to wash out his stain in the blood of his enemy by attacking him publicly , ought to render an account of his motives , that the whole world may acknowledge their justice . A day or two ago I fought a duel with a noble cavalier , Don Jerome de Hansa ( in such a case the rank should he remembered ) ; before I reached the spot , wishing to prove by my haste to arrive that some accident had detained me , my horse fell . My arm was hurt in the fall ; but I did not complain , nor wish that the contest should be delayed on that account ; and courage silenced the expression of the great pain I endured . My arm , much weakened , was visibly swelled , and , soon unable to hold my sword , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it up again . I am free to tell it . I do not wish to take away the merit of what he has done , although I complain of the wrong he has done me . Not wishing afterward to turn my sword against so generous an adversary , I besought him to give me death , preferring rather to fall in such an unhappy affair , than to survive my honor . Don Jerome then promised me solemnly , gave me his word that he would keep what had passed inviolably secret . He added it is true certain conditions which indeed I felt most painful ; and although he did not formally exact them , I thought it my duty to begin by fulfilling them . My misfortune thus became less insupportable by the reflection that the only witness of what had passed between us knew also the accidents of which I had been the victim ; and relying on the word he had given to keep the most perfect silence , I re-entered the city . Sire , at the first step I made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but insolently boasted everywhere of his triumph . He has covered me with reproach . He has so wantonly dishonored me , that my shame is the subject of all tongues ; and what wrings the hot tears of fury from me is that I am the subject of the rhymes sung on each corner of the streets . Two motives equally sacred call on me to justify myself . In the first place , it should be known that a fatal accident was not a cowardice ; and that the revenge I seek is just , since my adversary has broken his promise and violated the faith he gave me . After these reasons , Sire , by virtue of the privileges of Aragon and Castile , recorded in the Green Book , which assures to every noble , proved to be such , the right of avenging his injury sword in hand , I claim that of meeting in the list in open combat him who has offended me . You see me , Sire , at your feet , humbly soliciting as a favor what your justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; appoint the place of combat , face to face , on foot or on horseback , armed at all points , or undefended , for the choice belongs to him who receives the challenge . I will maintain to the outrance , that he has been a disloyal knight , in assassinating with his words , the man to whom he had left life . Char . Charles The existence of the privilege you claim is not unknown to me , but the exercise of it has been abandoned . Therefore , address yourself to the Constable , whose business it is to answer you . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Sire , I appeal to your Majesty . My sovereign should render me justice . Char . Charles In addressing you to my Constable , I do render it to you . By the ancient rights of his office he is not only captain general of my troops , but is the hand of justice , more especially when I am with the army in person ; he possesses both military and civil authority . Edicts , capitulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his order . His salary is a proof ; he receives as much each month as one day 's pay of the whole army . Thus the Constable is the supreme judge of all rencontres and deeds of arms on land , as the Admiral is of all at sea . I therefore refer you to your right tribunal , in order that he may do you justice and you maintain your rights , your honors , and your privileges . Address yourself to the Constable .

Admiral of Castile I engage to do so in Don Pedro 's name . To Don Pedro Come near . ' T is proper that you should hear me . I engage that he shall desist , provided he obtain an honorable satisfaction . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas All that , Don Fabricio Henriquez ( I suppress your titles , as here ' t is the noble knight rather than the great lord we have to do with ) , can counsel me , no doubt I shall find just and honorable . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg My lord , you know the affairs of your party ; they are public . You may speak in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me nothing of his . I can not speak without knowledge of his cause . Enter Don Jerome Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa Having learnt , my lord , what Don Pedro has said in my absence , I come not only to reply to his challenge by accepting it , but to maintain , in the imputing to me the betrayal of a promise , he does me wrong . The secret has never passed my lips . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg Now I know his sentiment . I may speak in my turn . What greater satisfaction can a gentleman give than by declaring that he has not said that which he has been accused of ? Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa A moment , my lord . Before I knew that in my absence you had spoken in my favor , I had just declared elsewhere that the secret had never escaped me ; but it was for my own satisfaction that I made the acknowledgment , not for that of another . I never give it in answer to a challenge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have said as a fact , I have no wish to conceal . I shall retract if it is interpreted in another manner . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg This satisfaction is the more positive , as it is given without the intention of giving it . Ad . Admiral of Castile No , it is not sufficient . It must be given with the formal intention of giving it , and moreover  --  Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg What ? Ad . Admiral of Castile Proofs must be added . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg Proofs ! How ? Ad . Admiral of Castile In bringing here the person to whom it has been told . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg It is not easy to know who has seen what passed in the midst of a lonely wood  --  Ad . Admiral of Castile Nor to believe without having  --  Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg What other satisfaction can you have than what has just been given ere it was required ? Ad . Admiral of Castile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the reports which are spread abroad in the capitol , doubtless Don Pedro would have nothing more to desire . But the public , ever ready to believe the worst , may imagine , unless positive proofs are given them , that there has been a mutual concession on both sides ; that one has appeared to recant , and that the other is content with the appearance , and both be blamed . Therefore , Don Pedro , unless positive testimony be adduced , does not accept the satisfaction . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg Neither do you , Don Jerome . Have you such evidence at your disposal , now produce it . It would be out of all reason to take on the word of another what is not received upon your own . Con . Constable I have chosen good sponsors ; neither can recede . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa I persist in repelling an odious imputation and accept the combat . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg Keep to that , Don Jerome . Ped . Don Pedro Torellas And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of no sort of composition . Ad . Admiral of Castile And do you , Don Pedro , hold to that ? Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg That is to wish absolutely that there should be no reconciliation . Ad . Admiral of Castile ' T is you that wish there should be no understanding . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg But that which is just . Ad . Admiral of Castile Nor I , but what is positive . Con . Constable Gentlemen , this is in one way or another to render the duel inevitable . After all , what is it you decide upon ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas To admit no satisfaction . Jer . Don Jerome de Hansa And I to give none . Con . Constable Then , there is no longer any remedy .

Don Jerome de Hansa The sword : ' t is the weapon of a soldier . And that no one should be so uncourteous as to suspect a motive for my choice , let us also take the battleaxe ; to manage that requires equal strength and agility . Con . Constable Well , gentlemen , adieu . I shall expect you at the rendezvous . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg Don Jerome , to the field of honor . I promise you to be by your side . Ad . Admiral of Castile To the combat , Don Pedro . The field is accepted , body to body ; although in public duels the sponsors must not draw their swords , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do more than if I fought for you : I will be your sponsor . Mar. of Br . Marquis of Brandenbourg To Don Jerome And I yours . All . All Adieu ! We shall soon see each other again . They go out Gin . Gins Can two such madmen be found elsewhere on the earth ? It costs them more care , more ceremony , more preparation to know how to cut each other 's throats than it costs many people of wit to know how to live . And me ! Poor me ! What will become of me ? An orphan both of master and mistress ! Of master , since mine is gone without a word to me and placed himself by the side of the Admiral in his carriage ; of mistress , because I never have known any .

Gin . Gins I am his valet . I can tell you even without knowing . There was a Moorish queen who was wandering among the mountains enchanted , where the Moorish king had left her .

I was right to tell you of the enchanted queen . It 's all of a piece . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea They go to Valladolid ? Gin . Gins Yes . Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea Why ? Gin . Gins Because it 's the farthest off , and because , folks say , it should be a public satisfaction memorable in ages to come . It 's all about a sword and a secret that one let escape his hand and the other his mouth . Don Pedro is gone in such a hurry , so uncharitably , that he never even said to his squire , " There are the keys .

Is not the Emperor 's decree signed at the bottom of my petition , by which I am authorized to propose the person who is to fill the post of governor of Alarcon in the council of Aragon ? Does not this council sit at Castile ? This is a plausible motive to justify my journey to the court . Ladies of the highest rank go themselves to solicit on their own affairs without any remark being made . And since I am determined to set out , can I do better than address myself to Don Pedro 's valet to take me to him ? He will be a witness of my tears . Flor . Flora And what then ? Vio . Donna Violante de Urrea I shall see with my own eyes . I would rather know all my misfortune than be condemned to the torture of suspense and uncertainty .

What one tells badly , the other disfigures , makes worse . But alas ! Confused as their tale appears , I have but too well understood it . This news fills me with confusion .

Oh ! That I could have suppressed my anger ! He was right that said , " Oh tongue ! Thou art more cruel , more untameable , more dangerous than the most savage beast . " For this reason did nature place it under a double lock . Vain precaution ! Nothing can restrain it . A breath is sufficient to deceive its guards . How shall I act that the truth may be known , and the duel not take place ? That Don Pedro may know his rival is incapable of such baseness ? What ! Do I hesitate ? The viper that has given the poison , should it not afford the remedy ? My imprudent , angry words have done the evil , and they shall repair it .

Count de Benavente The factions of Salamanca have agitated the whole of Castile . I am grieved that calm was not re-established before the news of our troubles had reached your Majesty . You would not have had it on your mind during your journey ; but order at present is re-established . Sire , pardon the means I have used . To keep Salamanca in order I caused myself to be made the corregidor of it , and I have caused justice to be respected . Finally , partly by rigor and partly by clemency , I have had the happiness to appease the tumult . You will find peace now throughout the province . The chiefs who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy for them , for had they waited my coming , they would have lost their own . Char . Charles You have no need of pardon , Count . On the contrary , I owe you thanks ; and Salamanca may boast in its turn of having a Count de Benavente among its corregidors . Count . Count de Benavente We are only , Sire , feeble rays of the sun . Deign to enter , and repose yourself after your journey . Char . Charles I wish to accustom myself to the profession of a soldier .

The rendezvous is appointed at this city , all according to the ancient privileges which gentlemen , known to be such , have inherited from the valor of their ancestors . Being by accident lodged with one of them , I am engaged in their quarrel , and can not do otherwise than act as sponsor for him . The Admiral is sponsor for his adversary . What can balance the influence of so great a lord ? I do not wish that he whom I uphold should enter the lists with less splendor than his rival ; therefore , I venture to ask of you , Count , to honor me and the cavalier whose cause I espouse , with your support . Count . Count de Benavente Marquis , I and mine are all at your disposal .

Not to be wanting in any of the requisite formalities , I come to ask you what is there I should do ? There are trumpets and drums echoing on all sides . They are publishing the first ban of the duel . Ad . Admiral of Castile This ceremony has been so long out of use , that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary formality . What says the ban ? Do you know ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas I was too much interested to forget the slightest detail . I know the whole . The ban orders that no one shall enter or go out of the circle drawn around the square of the palace ; that no one should go to examine the ground or the barrier , doubtless in order to prevent surprise , or trick , which would render the equality of the combat void . The Constable has directed everything as supreme judge of the field . There is a throne for the King , where his Majesty will sit , with a golden wand in his hand . The Constable sits below the King . On the two opposite sides of the square they have erected two tents with entrances without and within the square , by which the combatants enter alone with their sponsors . Ad . Admiral of Castile Does the ban say anything concerning the sponsors or combatants ? Ped . Don Pedro Torellas Nothing hitherto . Ad .
