txt THE state of Maine , which lies in about the latitude of the middle and south oC France , contains nearly as many square miles of territory as the remaining part of New-England ; and , though situated down east , ( towards which place every step is supposed by some to descend , ) it yet contains the highest land in New-England , if not in the United States . The climate , like that of the other countries on the coast of North-America , is colder than in the corresponding latitudes in Europe , which is owing , in some degree , to the prevalent north-easterly winds , but still more to extensive swamps and wet grounds , which will be much improved by cultivation . The winters usually last five months , and though our southern brethren imagine that the country is then a gloomy desert , and that // the inhabitants pass the time like dormice or inarmots , it is the very time of business and jollity . The farmer , lumberman , merchant , and in fact all classes of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the spring ; they wish it would " hold on about a fortnight longer . " A winter of South-Carolina , or , indeed of Maryland , would be a calamity to the country ; the farmer would be unable to carry his produce to market ; the trader would find few customers ; the lumberman would be interrupted in his business , and the lover would lose his sleigh-ride . The weather in winter is not a great deal colder than in Massachusetts , Rhode-Island or Connecticut , but is much more steady ; and ( as a person of one of these states once observed to me ) " it is cold and wintry in Maine in the proper season ; but here , at that time , we have all weathers . " The large rivers , in general , run southerly ; that part of the St. John 's , however , which is in this state , flows to the east . Natives of Maine , who are accustomed to hear only the largest streams called rivers , are tempted to laugh at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty brook has this name . I recollect that , when once traveling in the county of Bristol , in company with several gentlemen acquainted in that part of the country , on coming in sight of a stream larger than usual , I inquired of one of the party the name of the brook , and was answered with a solemn countenance , that it was " Taunton great river . " The waters of the streams of Maine , generally , have a very swift motion , with numerous falls and high banks . Considering these two circumstances in connexion with the great number of streams in the state , and the facility with which materials may be transported by means of the navigable waters , it is easily perceived that Maine has manufacturing advantages , which , perhaps , no other state possesses . The rivers are separated by ranges of highlands , two or three thousand feet in height ; at the heads of the Penobscot , Kennebec and Androscoggin , there is an immense cluster of mountains . In the centre of these , Mount Katahdin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest mountain in the United States ; * other mountains near it have nearly the same elevation . The view from Katahdin is most sublime . Innumerable lakes and ponds are seen surrounding its base , which , in the sun beams , appear like so many mirrors . The whole of the valley of the Penobscot and Kennebec is discerned from this mountain , and the highlands separating them , and those bounding them on each side , appear like immense waves . Not a single human habitation is seen . It is no unpleasant sensation to have that melancholy feeling excited by sitting on some jutting crag of this rugged , gigantic pile , in the autumn , and viewing the shining lakes and the winding rivers , which show like so many veins of silver drawn through the forest in the vales below . The trees ( which , in this part of Maine , are of a mixed growth of hard and soft wood , ) present a uniform aspect . The neighboring mountains look lonely , and yet have a wild and terrible appearance ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out in bold relief , and are entirely destitute of vegetation at the Mount Wasliingtoii has been regarded as the iuo4 elevated land in the United States , but that is a mistake . // height of four thousand feet . The ascent of Mount Katahdin is rugged and precipitous ; but the top spreads out into a broad plain , with a superficies of nearly eight hundred acres . No Indian dares to approach this mountain , unless accompanied by a number of white men ; they suppose that Majahonda , or the author of evil , resides upon it even when they proceed up and down that part of the Penobscot river , which passes at no great distance from its base , they keep a profound silence . A ridge of highlands separates the waters flowing into the Atlantic ocean from those flowing into the St. Lawrence ; but the height of this ridge has been determined only where the road from Hallowell to Quebec crosses it . It has an elevation of two thousand and two feet . J1he valleys of the rivers are generally sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads . The coast , also , is usually level , especially in the south-eastern part of the state . Large bogs are found in many parts of Maine ; one , near the head of Passadumkeag river , ( a branch of the Penobscot , emptying into it on the eastern side , about seventy miles from its mouth , ) is more than fifteen miles in length , and seven or eight in breadth , and extends into the valley of the St. Croix . Another , at the source of the river Molunkus , a branch of the Mattawamkeag , which empties into the Penobscot about a hundred miles from its mouth , is about the same in extent . On entering these immense oceans of moss , we experience the same impressions as the Baron de Humboldt in the lianos of the river Oronoco ; the sky and earth appear to meet at a great distance ; an eternal and death-like stillness reigns all around , and we feel ourselves alone in the vast expanse . The Penobscot Indians defeated the Mohawks in Passadumkeag Bog , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warlike nation , long before the settlement of the country by Europeans ; the remains of the slain warriors are said to be occasionally found in a complete state of preservation in the soft muck . Many of these bogs , it is plainly to be seen , were formerly lakes ; and many of the present ponds and lakes are gradually filling up , and seem destined to share the fate of the celebrated fowling-pond of King Philip . Most of the rivers and streams , in passing out from a bog or lake , are broken by waterfalls . The Penobseot , soon after leaving Chesuncook lake , has a tremendous cataract , called " Grand Falls ; " it passes over ledges , descending fifty feet almost perpendicular , and for nine miles below this place the water runs with amazing velocity , and appears of a milky whiteness . Ten persons , forming a family , entirely detached from the rest of the world , live at the foot of the Grand Falls , and apparently enjoy themselves in the solitude and amidst the tremendous roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the wilderness , fifty miles from inhabitants ; they say that they " are poor and must live somewhere , and like better to live in the woods , where they have enough to eat and drink with little labor , than to live among folks , and drudge or starve . " Indeed , it is not easy to imagine that they should ever be in want of drink ; and as for food , the great quantity of fish which are always found at the bottom of a water-fall , and the vegetables of a garden , abundantly supply them . Near the mouth of the Mattawam // keag ( a branch of the Penobscot , about the size of the Merrimac at Lowell , ) at the outlet of a lake or expansion of the river called Jemskitticook dead-water , there is a fall , called " Slugundy , " and immediately below this another , called " Gordon 's Falls . " At each of these places , the river is hemmed in between enormous rocks , not sixty feet apart . Slugundy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods in length ; the river runs , or rather flies along , in a zigzag manner , and appears like a whirlwind of smoke and flame . A person who carried the United States mail to Houlton , a few years ago , in coming down the river in a batteau with a single passenger , was sucked into the fall by the force of the current , and hiinseli ; the passenger and batteau , were ground to pieces in an instant . At Gordon 's Falls , the water pours over a smooth , perpendicular ledge , twenty-five feet in height . On the night of the fourteenth of October , 1831 , I encamped with several men on the very verge of the bank at the foot of the cataract . The river was then swollen by rains to the size of the Penobscot in ordinary seasons , and , instead of falling twenty-five feet perpendicular as usual , the quantity of water was so great that it only made a curve at this place ; the velocity , however , was inconceivable , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . The appearance by moonlight , ( for the moon at that time shone with a dazzling brightness , ) was most splendid , and though the evening was chilly , and even cold , I passed several hours on a rock projecting over the stream , listening to the tremendous roar , and watching the snaky furrow in the rushing waters , as they glistened and danced in the moon-beams , darting by with the velocity of lightning . There are many other beautiful water-falls in this state , some of which have a considerable degree of grandeur . A person accustomed to view the forests of tropical countries , where heat and moisture combine to produce the largest vegetables , on arriving in the southern part of New-England , believes that the diminutive and scrubbed appearance of the trees , is owing to coldness of climate , and is tempted to think that another Samson might level these woods as a mower the grass of the prairie ; but , passing to the upper part of Maine , he finds the forests composed of trees of enormous magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees from three to eight feet in diameter , and rising a hundred and fifty or two hundred feet , with no limbs except at the very top , * abound in this portion of the state . The hemlock , spruce , birch , maple , beech and cedar trees , which attain no great size in more southern regions , are three or four feet in diameter , and have an astonishing height . Even in the middle of summer , when the sun , blazes with all its splendor , the air , under the immense canopy of leaves and branches , is often chilly . On entering these forests from a scorching and dazzling sun , the cool air and darkened appearance is most delightful ; but , after traveling in them a fortnight or a month , when we again emerge to the habitation of man , we feel that we pass from night to day . Before experiencing this sensation , we have but a very imperfect conception of the phrase so often repeated by the Indian chiefs , when visaing the early settlements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we in darkness . " Lumber , it is well known is chiefly pine ; but lately , hemlock and spruce have been much used ; birch and maple are employed considerably for cabinet furniture . Why curled and bird's-eye maple , which are found almost exclusively in Maine , are not used as extensively , and for as nice work as mahogany , is not easily perceived ; they are as hard , less liable to split , as susceptible of receiving as fine a polish , and much more beautiful . In lumbering , a company of men from ten to fifty , with the proper number of oxen , proceed to the place where they are to chop , and commence operations by clearing a place to camp . Their camp is constructed of logs about the size of a barrel , and is shaped much like a shed , except that an aperture is left in the roof near the front , through which a fire , resembling Vulcan 's fournaises ardens , night and day , continually streams , and keeps the inmates , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state not very different from that of M. Chaubert in a hot oven . Into this " establishment , " as they call it , all their provisions and other " munitions of mouth " are brought* and arranged in such a manner as to form beds , chairs and tables . If any one should suppose that they lacked the luxuries of life , he would , perhaps , be mistaken ; for though their tea and coffee may be made in a camp-kettle , and drunk from tin dippers , their bread baked in the ashes , and their slapjacks cooked in a frying pan , they at least have all that is necessary , even of soap and water , notwithstanding the tint of their skin may be intermediate between lampblack and a leg of bacon . Their labors , sufficient to frighten men unaccustomed to the greatest hardships , are considered as diversion . Their evenings are passed in the relation of fairy legends , in " singing the songs of other times , " or , what is still more frequent , in viewing some desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirous of giving the blood a free circulation , and of keeping all parts of the system in exercise , as well as to shew their pugilistic propensities . All this is sport indeed compared with the dangers and labors which they are destined to encounter when their logs are to be floated , fifty or a hundred miles , down the stream . Then every ledge , eddy or whirlpool , is sure to detain a portion , and not unfrequently they all lodge together on some rapid , from which they must be disengaged , one by one , at the constant hazard of life . These dangers are despised by lumbermen ; and , turning their batteaux over their heads at night , they Laugh at the queerest joke which is heard in the group , and , throwing themselves on the naked earth , sleep with as much complacency as a king in his palace . The forests of Maine are filled with game , and that of a size which promises some reward to the hunter . The moose and deer bound through the almost interminable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bogs ; while the bear , wolverene and wild cat find a safe retreat , though surrounded with inhabitants . It is no childish amusement to shoulder one 's rifle , and pursue the moose , caribou , deer or beaver , a hundred miles from human society , especially in the autumn , when an encounter with the two first is dangerous in the extreme . Caribous are usually found in groups , and , if a person is // careful to keep to the leeward , they may he easily approached and shot . When one falls the rest seem at first to regard it with astonishment , and then play a variety of gambols around their dead companion , giving the sportsman a fine opportunity to pick them off ; but if he approach them to the windward , their smell is so delicate that they immediately perceive it , and scud off like the wind . It is amusing to see a drove of these animals in full flight on a bog so soft that a man would immediately sink ; their feet are spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , and , at every spring , the hind leg touches the ground as far as the gambrel . Grouse ( or partridges , as they are called ) are very thick in the unsettled portion , and so tame that I have destroyed a dozen in a flozk with a walking cane without their attempting to fly ; but near inhabitants they are very shy , and are roused at the sight of a man . The hunters say " that the back-woodspartridges are much like the back-woods men ; they are awkward , clumsy , and look at you with a fixed stare ; it is necessary to be in the company of gentlemen to learn activity and politeness . " The same observation might be made with regard to the fish in the unfrequented lakes in the northern parts ; I have often seen trout , weighing twenty or thirty pounds , * speared with a sharp stick . Maine is well fitted for grazing , and , although no great attention is yet paid to this branch of agriculture , upwards of fifteen thousand horned cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small kind are of late generally raised in this state . When these were first sent to other parts of the country to be sold , they were despised ; " Maine runts are not wanted , " it was said but now their superiority over the larger breed is universally acknowledged . However , some people still suppose that the diminutive size is owing to climate , and I have seen many a stranger fixed in amazement at the sight of a drove of oxen of the old sort . Large quantities of hay are yearly sent to the southern cities to market . Maine has , perhaps , as great agricultural advantages as any other state in the Union . The land which was first settled was on the coast and the large rivers , where it is generally poor ; a person , therefore , who formed his opinion of the soil from a visit to the country thirty years ago , has but an indifferent idea of it at at present , where many parts of the interior are covered with inhabitants . The immense ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent judges as having a soil equal to any other part of New-England ; most of the northern unsettled portion is excellent land . However , if four or five thousand square miles of territory at the north , are to be given up by regarding the bed of the river St. John as the highlands , separating the waters flowing into the Atlantic ocean , from those flowing into the river St. Lawrence , as is recommended by the Dutch king , to settle the dispute for territory between the United States and Great-Britain , we may qualify our observations by saying , that the better part of the state is lost . The French settlement of Madawaska lies on the north bank of the St. John ; the inhabitants , who amount to upwards of two thousand , generally desire to come under the government of the United // States , but their fear of the English , ( who often exert their power in a capricious and arbitrary manner ) is so great , that they usually assert the contrary , except when they speak in confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Apr*s que les Anglois avojent conquis le Canada , us nous opprim*rent , nous nous *tions re*tir6s dans lafore*t pour jouir de notre libert* , mais us nous avons suivis et us nous tiennant le conteau d let gorge . " ( After the English had conquered Canada , they oppressed us , and we fled to the wilderness to enjoy our freedom , but they have followed us , and have us wholly in their power . ) The English , living at this place , have a great degree of haughtiness , and , judging from their appearance , it is not hard to account for the phrase so common in Europe , " as proud as an Englishman . " They seem to feel all their importance , and enlarge very much on the resources , of the province of New-Brunswick . I have never laughed more heartily , than in hearing one of them relate the exploits , and talk of the military talents , of Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell , * as though the United States would make but a meal for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a well dressed pedlar , or hoot-black . This state , it is well known , has a very extensive seacoast ; and it is a common observation among the masters of vessels , that Maine has as many good harbors , as all the rest of the United States . Such a remark , no doubt , is an exaggeration ; but it may be safely asserted , that it possesses advantages , in this respect , superior to any other state , and perhaps to the larger portion of the Union . It therefore seems to be marked out for a commercial state , and in fact , from its present situation with respect to navigation , it is easily seen that the inhabitants are not unmindful of their advantages . Twelve years ago the amount of tonnage owned in Maine was one hundred and seventy-five thousand or twelve and one half per cent . of the whole in the United States . This proportion is not only greater , at present , but constantly increasing . Yankees do themselves the justice to believe that they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of Maine have an undoubted right to claim the precedence of their brethren . The fact that they own one eighth of the tonnage of the whole Union , though there are but few capitalists in the state , is a plain proof of their adventurous spirit . They would be maniacst indeed , from mere inanition of ideas , if their minds were not employed in planning some scheme to grow rich , or in executing some undertaking , from which they expect to reap the advantage . Immense shoals of salmon , shad , and alewives ascend the rivers in the spring , and are taken in vast quantities . It is with mingled feelings of pleasure and dread , that one stands on the bank of the Penobscot or Kennebec towards evening , during this season of the year , when the streams are swelled with rains and melted snows . The water , cold and blackened , moves swiftly forward , whirling into eddies and bearing along innumerable rafts of lumber of various kinds , while the songs of the watermen resound over the waves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of destruction to the finny tribe , and the glistening of the silver scales in the last beams of the setting sun , with the joyous hurrah , enliven the mind with the most cheering ideas . The * The present Lieutenant-Governor of the petty province of New-Brunswick. // fishery on the coast of Maine might also he turned to great profit by the inhabitants ; but of the ten or eleven thousand men of this state , employed in navigation in its various branches , there are not many who are content to improve advantages so near at hand . Many of the inhabitants living near the sea , and on the innumerable islands at little distance from the shore , pass about equal portions of their time on the land and on the water , and , like amphibious animals , are perfectly qualified for neither situation . As their attention is divided , their interest , like the man who attempted to sit on two chairs , generally finds the floor . The Sea Serpent is often discovered on the coast ; the one seen at Boothbay last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and a hundred and fifty feet in length . His appearance must have been very terrible to deter Maine fishermen from attemping his capture ; for they regard a combat with the cachalot or ballena as a frolic , and must have understood that a 1 ) rize of that kind would have been a fortune for a dozen of them . There are many literary and scientific institutions in Maine , of an order superior to academies ; their funds , however , are not great , and the state for two successive years has refused the most of them any pecuniary aid . On this account the Gardiner Lyceum , an institution intended for the instruction in science of those persons who have occasion to make a practical application of its principles , has been discontinued . It is to be hoped , however , that its present state will not be permanent , as every practical man in the community is interested in its revival . The earliest important settlements in Maine were made by English emigrants ahout the year 1630 , a considerable quantity of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the Indians had bargained away or been cheated out of a large portion of territory . The first proprietors of the country , or those to whom the king of Great-Britain granted certain tracts , thought it at least would do no harm to keep the natives quiet by buying their land ; that is , the Indians , having committed the horrid crime of being heathen , themselves , as Christians , of course , owned the soil , though they considered it prudent enough to put the Indians in good humor , by presenting them with divers showy trifles , of no use to either party . The Indians , finding themselves outwitted , and always treated with contempt by the English , of course , conceived themselves injured , and longed for revenge . They felt their strength also ; for Maine was at that time possessed by many powerful tribes . The French on the north nurtured this hostile spirit , supplied them with arms , and urged them to fall on the unprotected settlements . It would have been astonishing had ignorant men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the destruction of their enemies . The colonists of Maine , therefore , experienced attacks from people , who knew no difference between war and extermination . The Indians were principally destroyed ; the only remaining tribes are the Passamaquoddies , the Penobscots , and the St. Johns , consisting of about three hundred and fifty persons each , These are but poor remnants of the celebrated Tarra .. tines , who formerly held the Massachusetts Indians in constant dread of their incursions , and defeated the Mohawks several times when they were invaded by that warlike nation . I well recollect the sensation of // terror , excited in me when a boy at the sight of an Indian ; stories of murder and rapine , of torture and captivity , were vivid in my recollection , and the half-concealed tomahawk and sheathed knife , by no means tended to quiet my apprehension . I imagined that the one would be buried in my head , or the other in my bosom , and perhaps either of these things would have been preferred to a life with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apprehended from them in their present situation , and I have seen many a poor Indian kicked and buffeted about without his even daring to show the least resentment . Their appearance at present is most wretched ; dressed in rags , they have lost their proud gait and demeanor . Destitute of property which they can command ; rendered by law incapable of trading for themselves ; receiving an annuity from the state sufficient to destroy all their natural energy in gaining a subsistence , their lives are passed between plenty and want ; every exertion seems painful to them ; hunting is no longer a diversion ; and though they still possess several townships , and more than a hundred beautiful and fertile islands in the Penobscot river , which they formerly cultivated , they have wholly renounced agriculture . The appearance of these islands is most delightful ; the larger portion of them are situated in a broad expanse of water , more resembling a lake than a river ; many are destitute of trees , and others skirted with the flowering maple to the water 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always smooth and glassy , being sheltered by enormous trees which grow on its banks . Many names of rivers , towns , &amp;c. in Maine are of Indian original , and are sufficiently uncouth to furnish amusement ; such as Mattawamkeag , Mattanaucook , Medunkyunk , Cobbossee , Contee , &amp;c. ; the oddity in the application of other names is equally curious ; for instance , a man might get up in Levant , warm his feet in Etna , and , the rest of the day , survey all the wonders to be found in Troy , Athens , and Rome , pass sorrowfully perhaps through Joy , and take tea in China . Again , one could easily take his horse from La Grange , and in the course of three days visit Paris , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Poland , Mexico and Peru . However , " names are but sounds , " and " words are wind , " and it would be hard indeed if the people of Maine could not indulge their whims in such things , since their neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are by no means unapt in the other imitative arts , and their enterprize , combined with the natural advantages and present progress , will probably , at no distant day , render Maine the first state in commerce and manufactures . In agriculture it must shortly equal all the rest of New-England ; its exports already amount to more than eight millions of dollars , though there are but four hundred thousand inhabitants : in fact , as a writer has already observed , there is nothing that hinders Maine from becoming a rich and powerful state , but a lack of liberal sentiment.
