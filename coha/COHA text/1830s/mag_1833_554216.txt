txt Could we persuade ourselves by any effort of imagination that the Rev. Micab Baiwbidder was still among the living , we should have no doubts respecting the authorship of this work , notwithstanding the name it hears . We see in it tliie same absence of perspective in the view , the same deceptio visas , by which the little object before his eye exceeded in magnitude the whole earth and heaven ; and , above all , the same triumph of art , by which he contrived , without one spark of egotism , to give a full length portrait of his own simple-hearted character , while intent upon describing his favorite city . It is really refreshing to a reviewer , who is compelled to look upon so much display , effort , and pretension , to encounter such a page in the history of human nature ; there is nothing like it , except perhaps the century sermons of some of our New England divines , who , in giving the annals of their village , paint with laborious finish every leaf on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen under ourobservation before ; but we hasten to make atonement for our seeming neglect , though we can not promise to notice all and singular* the events here recorded . The work is certainly rather long : even now , though the author takes praise to himself for the forbearance which has restricted it to a single volume of not more than eight hundred pages , he directs us to notice particularly , that in most cases of recital from others , a smaller type has been used than the common text . We give him credit for his moderation ; but , in this last instance , it reminds us of a student in one of our colleges , who , on submitting a poem to his professor , was told that some of the lines were too long by several syllables for the heroic measure ; he replied that he was fully aware of the objection , and intended to obviate it by writing the lines in question in a smaller hand . Though there is something which tempts one to smile both in the design and execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minuteness may increase its value to many inhabitants // of the beautiful city which it describes . The author candidly admits , that it may be deemed sui generis in its execution ; but , says he , it has powers to please apart from its style and composition , ' inasmuch as it is a treasury of reminiscences , which no one else would have thought of collecting . He had determined , as he says , to rescue them from the ebbing tide of oblivion : ' and it is no small consolation to us to learn from one whose attention has been devoted to the subject , that the above mentioned tide is actually falling : we had supposed that it was gaining fast , at least upon the literary world . However it may be with the fugitive facts , ' which were the objects of his pursuit , we know that many works , which go forth like gallant barks , are constantly sinking where no diving-bell can reach them ; but , if his philosophy be true , we need not mourn for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . On the whole , it is well that there are men who can engage with all their hearts in such labors as this ; the local changes which they describe interest many beside those who were born among the scenes of their description , because they are signs of a mightier change which has been going on beyond their borders . The growth of a single place like Philadelphia , from the wilderness to the village , and from the village to the city , gives a concentrated and powerful impression of the vastness and rapidity of those changes from glory to glory , which our whole nation has hurried through . These fugitive facts , also , help to fill up the broad outlines drawn by the biographer and historian , which are often too indefinite to fix themselves in the mind ; and answer the same purpose for one class of readers , which the imaginations of the poet and novelist serve for another , *ivin* a local habitation ' and reality to recollections , which would otherwise soon die away . But this writer claims too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will transfer back the mind to scenes before : ' which , as we understand it , is a kind of retrospective forecast not within the reach even of prophetic inspiration . Every Philadelphian has a right to be proud both of the founder and the foundation of his state . Never was an enterprise more wisely and happily conducted ; and its success must be ascribed to the disinterestedness and judgment of Penn , since the circumstances were no more favorable than in other cases , where the first results were discouraging . It was the first time the world had ever seen an individual of com // macding influence and station acting so decidedly upon the Christian principle , that no man can serve his own interests so well as by serving others . It was remarkable that such a person should come from the halls of a slavish court and under the authority of an arbitrary king , and establish a state , with the single-hearted ambition to show men , as free and happy as they could be , ' as an example to the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , his own power was cautiously limited and defined ; the right of suffrage was given freely to all ; the ballot-box , which , small as it is , holds the destinies of nations within it , was used probably for the first time thus extensively in the Western world ; so far from securing to himself the means of profit and power , he declared that he would deprive both himself and his successors of the power of doing mischief , so that the authority of one man might never hinder the general good . His views for the welfare of his people were judicious as well as liberal ; he required that all children should be taught to read and write , and after the age of twelve should be engaged in some useful employment . All prisons , he said , should be *vork-houses ; the law and practice of primogeniture were abolished , and this at a time when a law which we could mention , nearer home , provided that parents should follow the order of nature , ' and give a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted whether his institutions were not more mild and free than his colonists were fitted to enjoy ; certainly the privileges which he gave them were not always used in the way which gratitude would have directed . One of the greatest triumphs of this extraordinary man was his influence with the Indians ; and since our relations with this unfortunate race are likely to produce excitement for years to come , his example can not be too often cited . The only charm by which he acquired so much influence over them , was by treating them with uniform justice ; and perhaps it would be well for states and individuals , who complain of them as bad neighbors , to try the same novel experiment , and see whether it may not be attended with similar success . In his letter to the Free Society of traders , Penn gives an account of this unfortunate race , as descriptive as that which Tacitus gives of the Germans . After speaking of their habits and manners , he says , do not abuse them , but let them have justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land to which he held // 362 April a title from the king of England , and strictly enjoined it as a duty of inhabitants and surveyors , not to take possession of any land which they claimed , till he had first , at his own cost , satisfied them for the same . The modern practice of assuming jurisdiction over them was then unknown ; and had it been otherwise , his conscience might have been too unaccommodating to allow him to take advantage of that ingenious discovery : it is gratifying to reflect that he has lost nothing by his course , but on the contrary stands considerably higher than he otherwise would in the estimation of the world . The Indians always regarded him with respect and affection , and he kept up a frequent intercourse with them in order to confirm their good will . Thus palisades and block-houses , the usual defence of frontier settlements , were rendered unnecessary ; so far from having any disposition to molest them , the Indians sometimes carried their kindness to excess . Thus we are told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in distress for food . As none was to be had nearer than Newcastle , he prepared to go thither , and sent his children meantime to beg the hospitality of the Indians , which they not only granted , but took off the boy 's trowsers , tied up the legs , and sent them back to the parents filled with corn . It is not till a comparatively late period , that the aborigines have disappeared . Tedyuscung , a Delaware chief , was a frequent visitor in Philadelphia so late as 1760 . Governor Dickenson speaks of negociating a treaty at Albany , on which occasion this chief undertook to address the assembly ; his wife , who was present , spoke to him in the most gentle and silvery tones imaginable , in the Indian tongue , . with her eyes fixed steadfastly on the ground ; every one was enchanted with the sweetness of her voice and manner . On Inquiring of Tedyuscung , who spoke English fluently , what his wife had said , he answered , Ho ! she is but a poor weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great king like me , to present myself drunk before the great council of the nation . ' The last chief of the Delawares near Philadelphia was Isaac Still , a man of sense and character , who had been much employed by the whites as an agent and interpreter among the Indians . He dwelt with his people in wigwams on Logan 's place for a time , but as soon as he could , collected the remains of his tribe , to lead them to the Wabash , far away , ' as he said , from war and rum . ' A person who witnessed their march , with Still , a fine looking man , ornamentedl // with feathers , at their head , described it as an imposing scene : Thus , in 1775 , the last vestige of the Leni Lenape disappeared from the region . This writer however tells us that one , called old Indian Hannah , was living in the present century on the Brandywine , and retained a high and haughty spirit to the last . This writer relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomacy on the part of Penn in his treaty with the Indians , which , to say truth , does not appear precisely in keeping with the tastes or habits of either party . A certain old lady , who was present , averred , that after eating their roasted acorns and homony with them , when they rose to testify their satisfaction by hopping and jumping , he rose with them , and jumped higher than they all . The figure of Penn , judging from his statue , was in no wise calculated for such exploits ; we see no other reason why it may not be true . The writer says , I will not pretend to vouch for this story ; I give it as I received it from honest informants , who certainly believed it themselves . It was a measure harmless in the abstract . ' Certainly , and in the concrete also ; Penn doubtless thought that there was no more want of dignity in curvetting after the manner of the wigwam , where such was the fashion , than in bowing and kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that the sect to which he belong* ed are not distinguished for this kind of adaptation , but perhaps the reason is , that they will not be courteous upon compul .. sion . We have heard on good authority , that our early legislatures were constantly enacting laws requiring the Quakers to take off their hats in courts of justice , but not a single beaver could be brought low by either force or fear . After a time they repealed all those laws at once ; and from that moment , as if by magic , every quaker 's head was uncovered . Our author quotes , from an ancient journalist , an opinion that may throw some light on the character of Penn ; he was naturally too prone to cheerfulness for a grave publiQ Friend . ' The truth probably was , that he conformed to thic excellent sect , as nearest , in his opinion , to the original *mplicity of religion , but could not be made a slave to the 4prnmons or practices of any party . We may infer as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iv*'that respect one of the bright lights of that age ; we must-confess that here he appears to more advantage than our pilgrim fathers , though it is true , at // the same time , that their exclusiveness may be strongly defended . It was a lesson which he learned not from tradition nor example ; for we do not find that such men as Sir Thomas More , and the wisest and best of that or any former day , re-* garded intolerance as anything more than a fair and natural *se of power . The losing side counted themselves unfortunate indeed ; but the party that happened to prevail , whether Catholic or Protestant , distributed crowns of martyrdom with princely liberality , and all that the sufferers complained of as irreligious was , that they should be the victims . We honor those , and Penn was not alone , who rose above the general spirit and example , followed the dictates of Christianity and their own better feelings , and offered to all who were persecuted for righteousness ' sake , an asylum , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with their consciences and their God alone . But it would seem that the generous disinterestedness of hi* views did not save him from a large share of disappointments and vexations . This however was to have been expected . Such is human nature , that not even the smallest charity school can be established , without opposition from those who are habitually skeptical and despondent , as well as from that class of philanthropists , who always run for the engine when they see a spark of benevolent feeling likely to kindle and spread ; but these obstacles , which discourage the feeble , are an inspiration to energetic minds ; they never expect to accomplish anything great without meeting resistance from various quarters ; and so far from giving up to those difficulties , they consider it little more than a healthful exercise to encounter and subdue them . Penn met with much that was irritating from those who had no confidence in his success , and , notwithstanding the placid calmness which we always associate with his character , he sometimes expressed himself in language tolerably emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protestant refu*ee from France , ancestor of the well known clergyman of that name , came over with him in one of his voyages , and lent him tv*enty pounds by the way . When they arrived , Penn , who was a*posed to do him a favor , offered him a square in the city by way of payment , telling hini that the price was small , but that he would let him have a great bargain as an act of friendship . Dudi6 thanked him courteously , but said he should prefer receiving the money ; Blockhead * said // Penn in wrath , thou shalt have the money ; hut canst thou not see that this xviii be a great city in a very little time ? ' Duch6 afterwards sorely repented his choice , and fully acknowk* edged the appropriateness of the term which Penn had applied . The rapid increase of the land in value is illustrated by*an anec* dote mentioned by our author . An aged female friend , who gained a subsistence by selling cakes , said that her grandfather had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , together with half the square , for his ser .. vices as chain-bearer in surveying the city . She had lived to see the Bank erected on a part of it , bought for the purpose with one hundred thousand dollars . But this incredulity , though provoking , was by no means the greatest of his evils . The writer has stated his most serious difficulty in short hand , saying , the truth was as in the days of yore , when the sons of God came together , Satan came also . ' Vile persons , as he suggests , from Maryland and New-York , we are glad to see that New England was not implicated , came and contaminated the thriving settlement . Penn was also tormented by wrong-hea , ded persons of his own sect , some of whom wished to enact that all young men should be corn .. pelled to marry at a certain age , and that only two sorts of clothes should be allowed ; - one kind for summer and the other for winter . Moreover , his expenses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and day , ' he says , spending my life , my time , my money , without being a sixpence enriched by my greatness . ' His liberal expenditure for the benefit of the colony , and the necessary expense required to keep favor at where nothino- could be done without money , involv court , b ed him in continual difficulties . His rents were slowly and reluctantly paid . In a letter to R. Turner , dated 1681 , he says , I have been these thirteen years the servant of truth and of Friends , and for my testimony 's sake I have lost much : not only the greatness and preferments of the world , but siiteen thousand pounds of my estate , which I might have obtained long ago , had I not been what I am ; but I murmur not . ' In 1684 he embarked for England , and xvhile there , was constantly engaged in endeavors to secure advantages for his province , and to resist those who tried to restore it to the immediate government of the crown . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preparing to return in 1690 , when he was arrested on suspicion of disaffection to the new king , William , // and was compelled to live two years in retirement , while his government was entrusted to another , by which he lost , as he estimated , thirty thousand pounds . He says that his quit-rents were five thousand pounds a year , but he could not get one penny . In 1686 , he says , in the sight of God , I may say I am five thousand pounds and more behindhand , than 1 ever received for land in this province ; and to be so baffled by the merchants is discouraging , and not to be put up with . ' Again , he says , as to a supply , I will sell the shirt off my back , before I will trouble them any more . I will never come into the province with the family to spend my private estate to discharge a public station , and so add more wrongs to my children . This is no anger , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . ' In 1699 , he returned to the province , resumed the cares of his official station and renewed his friendly relations with the Indians . But the crown officers in England were still actively employed against the colonies , and in 1701 , a bill was brought in to take them under the direct control of the crown . Penn 's friends obtained an indulgence to stay proceedings till his return , for which he made preparations . Our author however assures us , that there was no pressing necessity for his presence there , and he would have remained , had the colony provided suitably for himself and his family . His last public act in the country was to give a charter to the city of Philadelphia . Some ancient records of the city , preserved by this writer , show a curious and edifying state of feeling with respect to public officers . Several instances are given of Aldermen who were fined thirty pounds each , for declining to accept the office of mayor ; and so late as 1746 , James Hamilton , mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , instead of the entertainment always expected from that officer , when his term of public service expired . We would suggest to the consideration of those who remember the scenes which our country exhibited four years ago , whether their recurrence might not be effectually prevented by returning to this primitive state of things . We hear of no effort on the part of one aspirant to supplant another ,  --  no contest for the spoils of victory ; so far from it , an unambitious reserve ,  --  a generous surrender to the claims of others prevailed , which is almost without example . We read , that Alderman Morris , the Mayor elect , not being present at the meeting , a committee was ap // 36 ' 7 pointed to wait on him , and inform him of the appointment with which he was honored ; the committee reported , that they had been at his house , and were told by his daughter that he was out of town ; afterwards , another messenger reported that he had called at Mr. Morris 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who absolutely refused to receive it : at length , finding that the Mayor elect was not likely to appear , they found it necessary to confer the honor on another , who had not time to get out of the way . The office of contractor , also , was one by which no man was allowed to make a fortune . In 1753 , Charles Stow prayed the Board to make him some allowance for firewood and candles supplied by him at the Mayor 's court , for the space of twenty-two years . They agreed to allow him for firewood , candles , and his trouble , ( with interest probably included , ) the sum of seven shillings and sixpence a year . William Penn returned to England in 1701 , and his interests in the province do not seem to have been materially served by those who reigned in his stead . In 1704 , John Evans came over as deputy governor , and one of his first official acts was to call for a militia for the service of the Queen . ' It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Friends . He however did not believe in their aversion to war , and in order to surprise them into a desertion of their principles , devised a stratagem , the first and last of the kind ever resorted to by one in such a station . He had an express sent up from Newcastle , saying that twelve French ships had arrived there , and would at once make an attack on Philadelphia . The whole city was in an uproar ; he rode through the streets with his sword drawn , calling on the inhabitants to take arms ; the Friends did not answer to the summons , but plate was thrown into wells , and much valuable property injured and lost , in consequence of the alarm . This jest , however pleasant in its way , did not tend to increase his popularitf , and after a time he was recalled . But a regular opposition was formed to the rights and claims of Penn ; his friends in the province advised him in confidence to sell his title to the crown , and secure terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constant conspiracies against his interest , and that it would be impossible for him to retain his authority , as matters were then conducted . He took their advice and made advances , which we learn from his wife would have been read- // 36S History of Philadelphia . ily accepted , had he not insisted upon every possible security for the rights and welfare of his people . At last , in 1710 , he wrote to them an expostulatory letter , in which are these words : when I reflect on all those heads of which I have so much cause to complain , I can not but mourn the unhappiness of my portion , dealt out to me by those from whom I had reason to expect so much better ; nor can I but lament the unhappiness too many of them are bringing upon themselves ; who , instead of pursuing the ways of peace , love , and unity , which I at first hoped to find in that retirement , are cherishing a spirit of contention and opposition , and oversetting by party violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This address was in fact a farewell ; for in 1712 , his health failing , he sold his right for twelve thousand pounds , reserving the quit-rents and estates ; but a stroke of apoplexy so impaired his mind , that the business was never concluded . His speech and mind were both affected , but the care of his wife , who kept from him all matters of business that might have disturbed him , prolonged his life in comparative comfort till 1718 , when he died , expressing to the last the most affectionate interest in his people . We know not how much they were to blame , but it is painful to think of the difficulties which such a man was obliged to encounter . He had however a firmness of purpose and principle which bore him triumphantly through , and the judicious view which he took of the subject of religion did much to sustain him ; he says , religion helps us above all other things , even in things of the world , clearing our heads , quickening our spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English Governors , while Penn was living , do not seem to have had the most harmonious intercourse with the people , nor was the state of things much altered in this respect after his death . We have already alluded to Governor Evans . After him , came Col. Gookin , who held the reins tf government with a high hand . At one time lie removed all the justices of the common pleas in Newcastle county , for deciding against his brother-in-law , leaving the county without a single magistrate for six weeks ; at another time , when the judges of the supreme court had refused to allow a commission of his to be published in court , he sent for one of their number and kicked him . He afterwards apologized for these things , and said that his physician had told him he had a // weakness in his head . ' It was impossible to refuse to accept such an apology , for no one doubted the penetration of the physician , nor the fact that he was so afflicted . The intercourse between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in later times . In 1755 , the Assembly say to Gov . Morris , that his offer was a mere idle illusion , intended to impose first on the Assembly and then on the people ; and also to figure at home in the eyes of the ministry . ' To which his Excellency replies , your very tedious message is of such an inflammatory nature , that did not the duties of my station and justice to the people require me to take some notice of it , I should deem it beneath my notice as a gentleman . ' It is matter of considerable interest , to know the history of the family of William Penn . His eldest son , the only one by the first wife , was named for himself , and was regarded as heir to his office and estate in this country . He was sent to the colony from England by his father in 1701 , but his habits were too light to conciliate the grave tastes of the people : he did not like the society of Friends , nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for in 1704 we find him presented by the Grand Jury , with some others , for beating the constable and watch ; this indignity was greatly resented , the more so , perhaps , because it appeared that he had received harder blows than he had given . When he returned to England he added much to his father 's embarrassments , if we may judge from a passage in a letter , where , speaking of his son and his young wife , Penn says , that they living beyond their means , were much expense and grief to him many years , and many ways . ' He joined himself to the church of England , but bad habits of life destroyed his constitution , and he died in 1720 , leaving three children , none of whom ever came to this country , though one of them , William , was offered ten thousand acres of land near the forks of the Delaware by the Indians , if he would live in America ; such was the affection which they bore to the name of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were called , showed , one and all , a great reluctance to remain in this country . They probably had adopted the impression that the founder of the State was hardly treated ; and so no doubt he was : though beside the natural jealousy of power , other circumstances may have operated to make the colonists illiberal in their // dealings with him . The colony seems to have been prosperous in *4l substantial respects , from its beginning , but money did not abound ; in 1704 James Logan says , money is so scarce , that many good farmers scarce ever see a piece of eight of their own throughout the year : ' on another occasion , . pay for lands sold near Newcastle to the amount of near three thousand pounds is due , and I have received but two hundred , and that in produce ; nor will one half of it ever be paid unless times should mend ; for the land , as in many other cases , will be cast back upon our hands . ' Such was the veneration then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonists would have counted themselves in desperate poverty , even though all the comforts of life abounded , and probably felt as if the most just assessments were wrung from them by extortion . At the Revolution , the State of Pennsylvania compounded with the family , and gave them one hundred and thirty thousand pounds , with a conflrmation of title to all the manor lands , in order to extinguish their title forever . Franklin estimated their estates to be worth ten millions sterling . Considering the changes effected by Pie Revolution , they probably thought themselves fortunate to gain such terms in exchange for their proprietary claims . John Penn , a grandson of the founder , was in this country since that event , and is still living in England . We are told that he has a large and valuable collection of papers belonging to his ancestor , in perfect order and preservation . Some branches of the family have applied to him for the use of them for historical purposes , but the proposal was declined , , on the ground that he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , we hope he will remember that life is short , and that , if he does not execute his purpose , it can be of no great importance to him whether it is done by another while he is living or after his death ; while the materials contained in such a collection might be of great value to the public , who naturally feel an earnest desire to learn all that can be known of one of the most remarkable enterprises and remarkable men that the world ever saw . All the letters of William Penn give the impression that he was a clear and accurate observer , and though he was evidently brought to this country by his religious feeling , there are no traces of enthusiasm in his conduct . He says that he wishes to try a holy experiment , and to serve the truth and people // of God ; and in his whole proceeding , he showed , that while mere commercial enterprises failed in several instances along our shores , those which were inspired by religious feeling , and directed by cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds time , with all the care of a new government on his shoulders , to make observations on the natural history , on the climate and resources of the country , and makes frequent suggestions respecting them , which show an active and ingenious mind . His remarks upon the climate could inly have been The result of attentive observation , and he observes that however favorable it may be then , the cultivation of the country will soften and refine the air . He describes the vegetable productions of the forest and field , mentioning among other things that the Indians have the peach in great perfection , but whence it was obtained he does not know . He says , that he is *doubtful whether it is best to improve the fruits of the country by cultivation , or to import from abroad those which have been so improved already , and expresses his resolution to try them both if his life should be spared . He is greatly struck with the beauty of the flowers , and transmits such varieties as he thinks most remarkable to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Indians , who are great botanists in their way , what are their peculiar properties and virtues . What activity of mind was implied in all this , may be better estimated , when we reflect that he was to the colonists what Moses was to the Israelites , obliged to bear the blame of all their hardships and sorrows , and reminded of his agency in bringing them away from the flesh pots of Egypt , whenever a moment of privation came . These were not rare occasions : the settlement of a new country under the happiest auspices is very different from play , and his colonists , though not so severely tried as many others , were obliged to take their share . An old lady related their history , as she received it from her aunt , who came from England with William Penn . She told her niece , that they made their first abode in a cave , scoopc*zl from the river bank , which was the common resource of the colonists , till better dwellings could be constructed . Few of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a aid was not to be hired , the women assisted their husbands ; she helped her husband in his work with the saw , and brought water for him to make the mortar for his chimney . At one // time , when she was evidently exhausted by her labor , he begged her to leave it and think of dinner . She went home , weeping , for their provisions were almost entirely exhausted ; but the question arose in her mind , Didst thou not come for liberty of conscience ? hast thou not got it ? hast thou not been provided for beyond expectation ? ' She said that she begged forgiveness on her knees in prayer , and never repined again . This writer tells us that Rebecca Coleman , who died in 1770 at a very advanced age , was one of those who first came over . She was then a child . One day , when sitting at the door of the cave , eating her milk porridge , she was overheard to say , Now , thee sha'nt again . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her permitting a snake to eat with her out of the vessel , which rested on the ground . This story has an apocryphal sound , but probably the snake was present , without actually accepting her hospitality . One incident of those times is creditable both to the colonists and the Indians . A lady , whose husband died on the passage , was left with the charge of nine young children . She was provided with a cave by her companions ; and the Indians , who took compassion upon her , made her frequent visits with supplies of food : afterwards a Friend , who had built a house , gave a shelter to her and her children . The latter never ceased to do kindnesses to their Indian friends , and extended their liberality to Old Hannah , who has been already named ,  --  the last remnant of the race . At these times , all went on in perfect order ; the hours for work and meals were fixed and made known by the sound of a bell : at nine in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  went through the settlement , and suffered none to remain at the public house , except lodgers . This habitual order , which Penn established , was one of the secrets of his success . Our readers would of course take little interest in an account of merely local changes ; but it is pleasant to read the history of a prosperous community , increasing by means of its own resources , and sustained in its flourishing state , by the good spirit and habits of the people . They happily secured themselves against the Indians , without resorting to force or fear ; and the Swedes and Dutch , whose fierce wars are fully related by Knickerbocker , had been fortunately disposed of before the grant was made to Penn . Even the Puritans from New Hayen , // who came to plant churches after a godly sort , ' not to speak of trading and trafficking with the Indians , ' though a most persevering race , had been put to flight in haste by William the Testy , many years before . The account which Gabriel Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1681 , and in which he remained fifteen years , shows a growth almost unexampled , from the poor accommodations just described , to the comforts of civilized life . He mentions , that even then , Philadelphia was a city , though , we imagine , it was like those of scripture , a little city , and few men within it . ' The streets were already named from the trees which grew in greatest abundance upon the spot where their lines were drawn : it had its two markets every week , and three fairs every year ; fulling mills and corn mills were already built ; iron works were in preparation , the country being rich in iron stone or oar ; ' great encouragement was given to laborers of all descriptions . He dwells with much delight upon the riches of the soil . There is curious building stone and paving stone ; also tile stone , with which Governor Penn covered his great and stately pile , which he called Pennsbury house ; there is also very good limestone , of great use in buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that of itself sufficiently fruitful : besides , here are load stones , ising glass , and that wonder of stones , the salamander stone , having cotton in veins within it , which will not consume in the fire . ' In the said city are several good schools of learning for youth , for the attainment of arts and sciences , also reading and writing . Here is to be had , on any day in the week , cakes , tarts and pies : we have also several cookshops , both roasting and boiling , as in the city of London ; happy blessings , for which we owe the highest gratitude to our plentiful Provider , the great Creator of heaven and earth . The water mills are made by one Peter Deal . ' They pay no tithes here ; the place is free for all persuasions in a sober and civil way ; there is no persecution for religion , nor even like to he .

' // 374 April , Our author bestows much research upon the subject of the Treaty-tree , ' under which William Penn negotiated his first treaty with the Indians . It was an Elm , of spreading branches , which was destroyed by a gale in 1810 . It is a subject of regret , that the monument of so memorable a transaction should have been lost so soon ; but after it had fallen , it appeared from its annual circles of wood , that its age was two hundred and eighty-three years . If so , the gale did hut anticipate a little the decay of nature , for the Elm is not a tree , like the oak , to last for ages ; it affords a grand and solemn shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strength and duration . The writer engages , con amore , in discussions concerning the Penny-pot house and Blue Anchor , Poole 's Bridge and Pegg 's Run ; he also throws considerable light upon the Rising *Sun , ' which he holds to *e identical with Penn 's Cottage : this place he proposes to embalm , and to treasure within it all the relics that can he found of its first possessor . But these are the days of fact not fancy , ' and we fear that few will he moved hy his appeal . Why should we not retain for exhibition the primitive house of Penn ? yea , whose foundation constituted the first cellar dug in Philadelphia ? ' We perfectly agree with him in his indignation at those who estimate such places only by the worth of the brick and mortar , and sympathize in his wish that the Slate House , ' the residence of Penn , which still exists , should be preserved ; for even now it xvould offer a greater attraction to the stranger , than any of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn during his residence in this country , and while he was absent , by his friend James Logan . In it Logan received Lord Cornbury , the well-known Governor of New York , and son of Clarendon , who came in great state with a retinue of thirty persons , being , as Penn described him , at once a man of luxury and poverty . ' We know little of this personage except from the reminiscence of an old woman , who told the Parker family , that she remembered to have seen him at Chester ; and having heard that he was a lord and a queen 's cousin , she had eyed him with great exactness , but could see no difference in him from other men , except that he wore leather stockings . ' We think that our author is quite right in his opinion on and other subject of a similar kind . Stupid and tasteless improvements are the pest of every city ; the popular architect feels // glorious and happy , when he has removed every vestige of antiquity , and replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstance that there is nothing like them now existing , and not the least danger of their ever being imitated . The State House in Philadelphia , which has been standing about a century , contains the apartment in which the Declaration of Independence was signed , but no longer exhibiting the appearance which it did on that memorable day . The effacing fingers of modern improvement have removed what this writer calls its wain-scotted and pannelled grandeur . ' We think that it might he restored to its original form , at least so far as to he in keeping with the rest of the building . The steeple has been restored to its former character , and truly the house can have but little beauty except that which is borrowed from venerable and pleasing associations . We are told that , as if from some prophetic association , the bell , set up in colonial times , bore the motto , To proclaim liberty to the land and to all the people thereof . ' We doubt whether the people , any more than the bell , anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that the charter of freedom was signed in the hall below . Many particulars , which this writer has collected concerning the institutions of former times , are curious and interesting . Some of these give us an idea of the administration of justice in that early day . In some , we trace the mild and forbearing spirit which public opinion ascribes to Penn , with whom all these institutions originated ; but we can not say this of all ; for we read that in 1731 , Catharinc Bevan was sentenced to be burned alive in Newcastle , for the murder of her husband ; they intended to strangle her by hanging over the fire before it could reach her ; but the fire rose up at once , burned off the rope , and she fell into the flames and struggled there in agony till she died . We rejoice to say that this was a solitary example . This however was after Penn 's day . While he presided , we read that Andrew Johnson and Hanse Peterson , having a difference depending between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , and ordered them to enter into bonds for fifty pounds apiece , for their good abearance , which they accordingly did . ' We have not heard that this precedent has been followed in any modern court of law . In some cases , there seems to have been an . unusual spirit of accommodation in those who framed the laws . // Thus , we observe that the ancient lawgivers of the city , by reason , as they said , of the extreme difficulty of convicting those who suffer their chimneys to take fire , generously enact that ten shillings of the fine shall be given in to those who will come forward and pay the rest . In other instances , the laws were enforced with wholesome severity . John Smith was punished for ' being disguised in woman s clothes , walking the streets , against the laws of God and this province , to the staining of holy profession and against the law of nature . ' John was not alone in the offence and condemnation , and such exhibitions were so effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late years a foreigner , who probably had not read the ancient records , made an attempt to get up a masquerade , but was interrupted by an act of the Legislature , which rendered it inconvenient to accept his invitations . Penn 's legislation held no compromise with evil doers . In 1702 , George Robinson was indicted for swearing three oaths and uttering two very bad curses ; ' either the said George wa* contumacious , or the habit was strong ; for not long after , he was brought to justice again for ' uttering a grievous oath on the 13th day of the 7th month . ' Many barbers are indicted for trimming on the first day of the week . ' A hutcher too was punished , for by color of his art blowing up the meat of his calf with his breafh and wind , whereby the meat was made unwholesome to the human body . ' The whipping-post was the common remedy on these occasions , and that it was in considerable use , appears from a grant allowing ten pounds a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when Mayors served for nothing . It was afterwards urged with some force , that the public ought not to be burdened with charges for a service that was thus rendered to individuals , and an act was passed , requiring that those who were whipped should settle with Daniel , at their own expense , for the benefit received at his hands . That the Governor 's office was no sinecure , appears from various records . N. Allen complained , that H. Bowman , for value received , owed him 6 cwt. of beef with the hide and tallow , and six pounds sterling , and prayed for redress of his grievances , the whole being unjustly detained ; whereupon it was ordered , that William Clarke , John Simcoe , and James Harrison should speak to H. Bowman concerning this matter . ' The simplicity of legal process was extreme . The first trial for murder took place in 1791 . When the prisoner was brought forward , the clark // asked , art thou guilty ? ' He answers , not of the murther , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confronted with the corpse , and ordered to touch it , which he did , but it does not appear that any blood followed , though he afterwards confessed himself guilty . It does not appear that the prisoner had any counsel ; and when the King 's attorney demanded judgment , there arose a difficulty , inasmuch as the court were only justices of the peace , and bad no power to pass sentence of death ; hut as the jury and others present joined in a petition to them to proceed , they determined to waive objections , and ordered him to the gallows . The writer has sought diligently to discover where the ancient prison stood , but in vain , till a few years ago , in digging a cellar , they discovered as they supposed , the walls of the old jail , of four inch poplar plank dovetailed at the corners . Old Isaac Parish , a laudator temporis ecu , showed it to Judge McKean , who remarked , Times are altered now ; once wood was sufficient ; but now stone itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imprisonment for debt had not then been agitated on any considerable scale ; for we find a petition of forty-four poor debtors , stating their objection to the fee-hill for debts under forty shillings creating an expense of seventeen shillings each in case of sheriff 's execution , which was formerly , when in the hands of magistrates , but three shillings ; and they say , some of your poor petitioners have been kept in the common jail , until they could find persons to sell themselves to for a term of years to pay the same , and redeem their bodies . ' The writer thinks , that this practice of selling single men for debt was a very wholesome restraint on prodigals ; we should however doubt the expediency of such a provision ; but lie evidently thinks that in these respects and the habits connected with them , ancient times had greatly the advantage of ours . The vision of a golden age floats before his memory , when there was no such thing as attempts to conduct business in the present wholesale manner . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aspire to great wealth , but were satisfied with a competent subsistence ; importers were retailers also ; ruinous overstocks of goods were unknown ; and as for bankruptcy , when it occurred , which was but rarely , the citizens met with faces expressive of general sympathy and concern . An aged person told the author , that when a certain man of business failed , the house was shut up for a week , as if in // deep mourning . We agree with him that the feeling on these subjects is not changed for the better , though the indifference to such calamities , which offends him , is owing rather to the increase of business7 and of course of its hazards , than to any general decline of moral feeling . But we can forgive him the wrath which he expresses , at seeing men , who have failed in business , appearing abroad with expensive display , elbowing aside their suffering creditors . ' He brings in his own experience ; he says , I occasionally meet with such by whom I have been injured7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass by and dust me , and who nevertheless would feel their dignity insulted , at even a civil hint to spare me but a little of the disregarded debt . It might lower the dignity of such , to know that there was a time in our colony , when such desperate dealers and livers were held for a term of years to pay their just debts . ' We fear not ; if conscience and honor are wanting , we doubt whether the recollection of ancient times would make any deep impression . Our author is evidently deeply impressed with the conviction that the former times were better than these , though he is too candid , not to be willing to allow a fair chance to the moderns . He says , the old people all testify that the young of their youth were much more reserved , and held under much more restraint in the presence of their elders , than now. , Bashfulness and modesty in the young were then regarded as virtues ; and the present freedom before the aged was not countenanced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents or elders . ' If it is any consolation to him , we think we can venture to assure him , that when his ' veteran informers themselves were young , their elders made the same complaint of their forwardness . It has been so ever since the flood ; the children of Noah were no more distintinguished by respect for age , than those of our day ; and as for young lovers , the circumstance of their taking sidelong glances was not an imposition enforced by authority , but a natural consequence of the total blindness or partial obliquity of vision , which is thought to be inseparable from love . He was also informed by an old lady , that it was the custom in her day , for the younger part of the family to dress themselves toward the close of day , and sit in the street porches7 where they conversed with their acquaintances , who happened to be passing . On this he remarks , those days were really // very agreeable and sociable . To he so easily gratified with a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratifying to every travelling stranger ? Afternoon visits were not made at night as now , but at so - early an hour , as to permit matrons to go home and see their children to bed . ' In this last particular , the times are indeed greatly altered : even the dinner hour would now interfere with such a display of mater* nal affection . But as the author is not an old man , he may live to see the old fashion restored . Holinshed tells us , that in his day the more fashionable people dined at eleven , while the vulgar were Qontent to wait till noon ; and as the hour for That solemnity is deferred still more and more , if the same process is continued , it will be pushed through the night at last , and he attended , as in former days , at an early hour in the morning . On one subject , the author betrays a strong anti-republican leaning ; but we know not whether to ascribe it to some liiigering remains of toryism , or to an antiquarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has heard aged citizens say , that tradesmen were formerly a different generation from the present ; there was a marked difference between them and the acknowledged gentlemen . The tradesmen and their families had far less pride than now . While at their work , or in going abroad on week days , all such as followed rough trades , such as carpenters , masons , coopers , blacksmiths , &amp;c. , universally wore a leathern apron before them , covering all their vest . Dingy buckskin breeches , once yellow , and check shirts and a red flannel jacket , were the common wear of most working men ; and all men and boys from the country were seen in the streets in leathern breeches and aprons , and would have been deemed out of character without them . In those days , taylors , shoemakers and hatters waited on customers to take their measure , and afterwards called with garments , to try them on before finished . ' In the olden time , all the hired women wore short gowns and linsey woolsey or worsted petticoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society is now changed from the plain and unaffected state of our forefathers ! ' Truly , if there was no pride and pretension before the Revolution , there has been a considerable change either in our country or in human nature ; but good comes out of evil ; and our author will hardly be able to find an ancient , who does not speak with as much delight of his escape from the leathern // *8O April , integuments just mentioned , as the patriot does of our release from the house of bondage ; and again we must be permitted to doubt , whether those who lived in that age were conscious of their blessings , since they had the opportunity of comparing it unfavorably with an age older still . So obvious is this truth , that we grievously suspect the author to be of the class of those , who maintain that green peas have been a month later in the market ever since the Revolution . He says , Great sociability prevailed among all classes of citizens , till the strife with Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acrimony ensued , and the previously general friendly intercourse never returned . ' As for the glutton clubs , ' which he alludes to as one of the means and manifestations of this sociability , it is not the worst effect of the Revolution , that it swept them away . We could mention several particulars , in which times , even taking his own account , are altered decidedly for the better . Thus , the wedding entertainments can hardly be thought of without dismay . The house of the parent would be filled with company to dine ; and the same company would think themselves deficient in proper attention , unless they appeared in the same capacity at tea and supper . For two days , fountains of punch were flowing for the benefit of all concerned ; the gentlemen paid their respects to the bridegroom , and then ascended to the second floor to salute the bride , who received that civility without power of retreat or resistance , sometimes to the amount of a hundred*kisses in a day . But this was not all . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties at their own house , having the groomsmen and bridemaids in constant attendance ; and after all , great offence might be given , unless punch , cakes , and meats were sent abroad in all directions , even to those who were not visiters in their - family . The sternest mourner for old times would hardly wish that these practices should return ; certainly not , if there were any prospect of such a dispensation falling on himself or his children . When the author approaches the subject of female dress , he seems conscious that the moderns may hold up their beads ; but he gives mysterious hints , which we do not pretend to understand , by which he intimates that our boasted simplicity is not unquestioned ; that there are extravagances which do not appear ; and that it might be found , on examination in the // right quarter , that absurd fashions were not confined to ancient times . We can only say that we think it a manifest improvebent , if they follow the example of our grave citizens during the French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the hat . Here too he betrays circumstances which work against his cause ; he shows that our forefathers were grieved in spirit at the excesses of fashion , and resorted to various efforts of practical waggery , to discourage the ambition of their xvives and daughters . They wasted no time in words , which they had found by experience were thrown away ; they were men of action , and their jokes were of a strictly practical kind . When the fashion required each lady to have an expensive red cloak , they provided such a dress for a woman who was sentenced to be hanged ; she made her appearance in it at the gallows , and the same act of justice put an end both to her and the fashion . On another occasion , they were exercised in mind by an article of dress called a trolloppee . ' What it was which offended them in this piece of raiment , we are not able to ascertain ; but they forth* with procured a dress of the kind , which they presented to the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her bravery , made her appearance in all places , and put the fashion to flight with great expedition . Little however was gained by these successes ; it was hut stopping one hole in a sieve ; other fashions arose and reigned in their stead . The women wore caps , stiff stays , hoops from six inches to two feet on each side , high heeled shoes , and in the miry times of winter , clogs , gala shoes or pattens . ' Ancient ladies have told me , that they often had their hair tortured for four hours at a sitting ; some have had the operation performed the day before it was required , then have slept all night in a sitting l ) Osture , to prevent the derangement of their frizzle and curls . This formidable headwork was succeeded by rollers , over which the hair was combed , above the forehead ; these again were superseded by cushions and artificial curled work , which could be sent to the barber 's like a xvig. * Once they wore the skimmer hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various others , known by the names of bath , ' muskmelon , ' whalebone , ' calash , ' and wagon ' bonnets , while the straw-beehive ' was generally worn by old people . One fact is worth noticing ; he tells us that the time was , when the plainest among the Friends wore their colored // 382 April , silk aprons , though now they are so averse to fancy colors . In time , white aprons , once so fashionable , were disused by the gentry , and then the Friends left off their colored ones , and used the white . It is amusing to observe with what tenacity sects cling to their slight peculiarities of dress , manner or opinions ; it is said that the Quaker dress was originally adopted , because it was the prevailing fashion of the day ; but the fashion changed , and the Quaker refused to alter with it , condemning himself forever to a dress , which has no convenience to atone for its want of beauty . And thus it is with respect to opinions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious , cling with desperate faith to opinions , which the founder of their sect , had he lived , and kept up with the changes of improvement , would long ago have cast away . It does not appear how our forefathers could , with any decent consistency , have taken umbrage at the dress of ladies , when the fashionable coat had several large plaits in the skirts , wadding like a coverlet , to keep them smooth , large cuffs , reaching up to the elbow , with weights of lead , and the cape low , so as to display the stock buckle at the back of the neck . The shirts had sleeves , finely plaited , and hand-ruffles . The breeches were closely fitted with knee-buckles of stone , paste , or silver . Wigs were gray , white , or brown ; but a blow was given to this fashion after the return of Braddock 's army , who , as might be expected , had lost their wigs in the war , and its fate was confirmed by the bold action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remonstrances , cast the inconvenient ornament away . Swords were generally worn by men of fashion . Their cocked hats and vests were laced with gold ; the vest had great depending pocket-flaps , and the breeches were low in the waistband , because suspenders were a luxury then unknown . Gentlemen carried little woollen muffs , called mufftees , in winter . Watches were very rare ; spectacles were worn by the aged , but never by the young . These however were bridge spectacles , ' which were kept in place by nipping the bridge of the nose . One would have thought , that a blade decorated in this way would have done well to hold his peace respecting excesses in female fashion . We can hardly comprehend how the Friends , with their antipathy to superfluities , could reconcile themselves to the fashion of wigs , on those whom nature had furnished with hair . It s true they were not unanimous on the subject ; but the wigs // had great authorities in their favor . In 1685 , William Penn writes to his steward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jonathan Dickinson , a Friend , writes to London , I want for myself and my three sons , each a wigg-light good hobbs . ' An ancient peruke-maker advertises full bottomed wigs , tyes , brigadiers , dress bobs , bags , cues , scratches , cut wigs , and tates and towers for ladies . ' In 1722 , a servant of the Rev. D. Magill , who had run away , is advertised as clothed with damask breeches and vest , a broadcloth coat of copper color , lined and trimmed with black , and black stockings ; * and another as having leather breeches , glass buttons , black stockings and a wig . ' From this , and several advertisements of the kind , it would seem that they were worn by all classes , and also that the aristocracy were not so much distinguished by the articles of their dress , as is generally believed . When the circumstance alluded to above had destroyed the reign of wigs , at least for a seasln , the peruke-makers saw nothing but utter ruin before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden as they apprehended ; the hair was still to be dressed by plaiting , queuing , or clubbing , or by gathering it into a silk bag , adorned with a large black rose . But while the hair was so affectionately cherished , some other parts of the system were cruelly neglected . Dentists were unknown , and the only way of cleaning the teeth was by rubbing them with snuff or powdered chalk upon a rag ; this was the practice of the most genteel ; it was generally deemed effeminate to clean them at all . In these respects , the moderns certainly have the advantage , both in the knowledge of the tooth brush and the absence of the preposterous wigs , which are now hardly known , except from the grotesque pictures which Hogarth has preserved for the admiration of all coming time . With all this display in dress , our ancestors were less solicitous for the comfort of their dwellings ; or perhaps we should say , that many things essential to our comfort were not then wanted , because not known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couches ; but these were not common . The articles in common use were settees and settles , the latter containing a bed in the seat , which could be opened and spread ; this , as well as the settle , had a high hack of plain hoards of white pine . That Cowper speaks truth , when he says restless was the seat , ' many who are yet living are fully able to tell . // Neither was mucb gained by resorting to the chair of inahogany or red walnut , with its high perpendicular hack , meant probably to recommend a solemn uprightness to the form . One corner of the room was occupied by the round mahogany tea-table , standing uprigbt on its solitary leg ; the other , by a closet with a glass door , in which the china was arranged , surmounted by a large punch-howl , which was very often on duty . The tables were spread with pewter platters , and by many in the country with wooden trenchers . The furniture of the room was not complete without a chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ; and our author says , evidently with a sigh , It was no sin to rummage them before company . ' The two remaining corners were appropriated , one to the clock-case , the other to the chimney . The floor was covered with sand , drawn into fanciful figures with the broom . The carpet was not introduced till The middle of the last century , and then was regarded as an ornament , covering only the central part of the room . The fireplace was ornamented with china Dutch tiles , on which scripture pieces were represented in a very artless manner , which certainly impressed the incidents of the Old Testament upon the memory , so as to make it quite impossible to forget them . But all these things are passed away ; the familiar porch upon the street , in which the family used to assemble after the labor of the day ,  - -  the windows , with their diamond panes and leaden casements , opening like doors ,  --  the hull 's eye glasses over the front door , to give light to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet square , and called the hall ,  --  the shutters , with the hearts cut through them , to let the light shine out , and tell of hospitality witbin ,  --   --  the broad pannel and carved cornice ,  --  all are so thoroughly removed by the relentless hand of modern improvement , that when our author wails to the present generation over the things that were , he finds it next *o impossible to make them comprehend what he means . We think we can observe in this writer a slight leaning toward the superstition of ancient times . Here the victory of modern philosophy has been complete ; not a ghost is left to haunt a deserted mansion , nor to guard the Pirate 's treasure . We find that William Penn , as might he expected fi'omn his strong and sagacious mind , was no patron of superstition ; or perhaps we should give him credit for remarkable exemption from an infirmity , which debased many great minds of his day . // 385 We find that two Swedish women were arraigned before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified , that one of them , Margaret Mattson , had bewitched calves , geese , &amp;c. oxen were rather beyond her ; but her powers extended to all minor cattle . Governor Penn charged the jury , who thereupon brought in a verdict , in which they state that it is proved that the woman has the reputation of being a xvitch , but not that she is guilty of the reality ; and the offender was required to find security for her good behavior for six months . This certainly appears like a judicious attempt to save the innocent , without resorting to any process which would incense the public mind , and in that way expose them to more persecution and danger . But there appears to have been no lack of superstition in more harmless forms . Our author indulges in a strain of remark upon the subject , which , so far as one can gather its meaning , would seem meant to show that he does not believe anything ; but other observations indicate a suspicion , that some of these things may possibly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the authority of an old man ; Michael H- , Esq . well known in public life , gave out , in a mental delirium , it is hoped , that he had sold himself to the devil , and should he carried away after a certain time . Crowds actually assembled near the house to witness the catastrophe ! There must have been some truth in this relation , for I see by the Gazette of 1749 , a public notice of this gathering , as offensive to the family . M. I-I . is vindicated from some reports , which said he was distracted , and witnesses appear before Judge Allen , and testify that he was then sane , &amp;c . It was certainly on all sides a strange affair ! ' He also gives an instance of what Captain Dalgetty calls the deuteroscopia , in the person of Eli Yarnall . When a lad of seven years of age , he burst into a laugh one day in the house , saying that he saw his father running down the side of the mountain , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father was then distant from home , but when he returned , confirmed the story ; from which we should infer that he had overtaken it , or possibly that the whisky had overtaken him . The boy became the wonder of the neighborhood . ' He was visited by Robert Verre* , a public Friend , wThio asked him many questions concerning what was then going on at his own house in another county . When Verre* returned , he found that all circumstances answered precisely to the boy 's description . Some of the Friends became anxious // that he should be properly brought up , thinking that he might have a peculiar gift and a good spirit ; he was accordingly committed to Nathan Harper of Frankford , where , after many wonderful exhibitions of his power , it gradually departed from him . On this the author remarks , These are strange things , evidencing matters * not dreamed of in our philosophy* " I give these facts as I heard then I " nothing extenuate , nor aught set down in malice . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another story which he relates , of a negro in Philadelphia , who professed that he had sold himself to the devil , and had come to the city to receive the counsel and prayers of pious men . Hundreds went to see him , and found him in great distress of mind . The Rev. Dr. Pilmore took him to his own house , where he at last discovered , . that his greatest calamity was laziness* ' We apprehend that close investigation would be attended with the same result in all such cases , unless the spirit , as in the case of Eli , departs before such examination is made . There is one department of this history , which we confess . we should hardly have expected to find in a province settled under the auspices of William Penn . This is the military preparation for defence . Dr. Franklin , always active in such plans , procured an act establishing a militia in 1755 , which met with considerable opposition ; hut it appears from this writer , that Penn , though one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary means by which colonies are defended . A letter from Penn himself , of 1703 , says , that in order to quell the complaints of Col. Quarry and his party , the acting Governor Hamilton granted a commission to raise a militia ; and then , with the natural instinct of opposition , Quarry and his party violently opposed it , because the Friends declined to bear arms ! James Logan , writing to Penn at an earlier date , strongly recommends the measure , as absolutely necessary , on account of the perilous condition in which every infant settlement neeessarily stood ; he was a Quaker as well as Penn , and both seem thus to have admitted the right of defensive war . The measures adopted , however , seem to have been sufficiently pacific to satisfy the most determined advocate of non-resistance * for an order is found upon the records of the council , in which it is stated that an express has arrived from Maryland , bringing accounts that vessels , supposed to be French ships , have been seen upon the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch of this city be carefully and duly kept , and that the constables , at their peril , take care of the same ; and in ease there appears any show of danger , that they give the alarm by ringing the market*-bell ; and further , that one of the Aldermen see the watch , &amp;c . ' This proceeding seems to have been founded on the advice of Dogberry to his watch*. men ; viz , that if such dishonest persons should be found break .. ing into a house , the less they had to do with them the better . It appears that , in 1718 , there was some military organization , since Governor Keith , on receiving the news of the death of William Penn , solemnized it oddly enough with a military funeral . In 1748 , great preparations were made , which were principally owing to the exertions of Franklin , who was offered the appointment of Colonel of volunteers ; he declined the office , but entered into the business with great vigor , and was seconded by some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the original grant to Penn , that he and his heirs should muster and train ,  --  make war and van* *uish , or put to death all enemies by sea and land . ' He does not seem to have taken much advantage of this very liberal permission . But we can not follow the author in his later re. * miniscences , which he says he has * snatched like drift*wood from the stream of time , which would otherwise naturally seek the ocean of oblivion forever . ' One fact is worth remember* ing , since it shows that peaceful feelings were associated with the city and the name of Penn . In 1778 , John Penn , member of Congress , was challenged by Henry Laurens , president of that body . The parties were fellow boarders , and , after break .. fasting together , they started to go in company to a duel-field near the city ; on the way , in passing a deep slough , Penn offered to assist Mr. Laurens , who was much older , and finding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were engaged in a foolish affair , which it was better to end by re* conciliation ; Laurens assented , and the matter was settled without bloodshed : this we think honorable to both parties , though it might perhaps be condemned by the foolish laws of honor . The writer has recorded in his vast miscellany , some particulars concerning Count Zinzendori and Whitfield , whose eloquence produced as great a sensation in Philadelphia as in any part of the country . A confidential letter of James Logan to a friend describes the Conat as a knight errant in religiom , // whose extravagances were such , that he was generally supposed to be insane . A pleasing specimen of his correspondence is here preserved , addressed to F. Vende , in Germantown , a person whose daughter had become one of his followers ; To the cooper F. Vende : -I take you both , man and wife , to be notorious children of the devil , and you , the woman , to be a two-fold child of hell . Yet 1 would have your damnation as tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this is a specimen , prevailed with the parents , does not appear ; but it is recorded that Miss Vende followed him to Germany . When Whirfield appeared , immense crowds followed him ; he sometimes preached to as many as fifteen thousand people , who were all able to hear him . The voice of this singular man seems to have been one of the great secrets of his power . The writer says , Col. Morris , now ninety years of age , told me that he was distinctly heard by persons at the distance over the water of two miles . ' Perhaps this musical and commanding voice , a graceful and natural manner , which was not then common in the pulpit , together with an appearance of earnest devotion , are sufficient to account for all the effects which he produced ; he gave no evidence of intellectual power ; his sermons are not of a high order ; his plans , various as they xverc , were almost all unsuccessful , and the effects of his preaching in most instances soon died away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he confesses himself to have been ; 1 have carried high sail , whilst running through a torrent of popularity and contempt . I may have mistaken nature for grace , imagination for revelation , and the fire of my own temper for the flame of holy zeal ; and I find I have frequently written and spoken in my own spirit , where I thought I was assisted entirely by God . ' His followers were equally zealous . Tennant affected eccentricity in dress ; he xvore a great coat , fastened round him by a girdle , and appeared without a wig , which was then very singular for a preacher . After his force was spent , he was afflicted with similar misgivings ; and in a sort of recantation , published in the papers , he says , My soul is grieved with such enthusiastic fooleries . ' It is difficult for us now to conceive of the excitement which prevailed throughout the country . Some of the States were so incensed , as to pass laws against the Revivalists . Connecticut enacted , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested as a vagrant ; and shortly // after , when Davenport made his appearance there , he was taken up without ceremony , and sent to Long Island . Certain students of Yale College were dismissed , for having attended some of these meetings while at home with their friends in the vacation . But after preaching against good works and Bishop Tillotson , ' and succeeding so far as to close the dancing schools and assembly rooms , beside building the largest church then standing in the city , the zeal of the community subsided into the same dead calm as before . Tillotson and the Whole Duty of Man , a work particularly reprobated by Whitfield , were again read , and his followers were little distinguished , except by the name of New Lights , from other sects of Christians . The Methodism of Wesley , which came to Philadelphia in 1769 , took a touch firmer hold . Dr. Pilmore was its first preacher , but he was occasionally aided in preaching by Capt . Webb , the British barrack-master at Albany , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in military costume , caused attraction enough to bring many to hear , from curiosity , who soon became proselytes to Methodism . Our author gives a picturesque account of one of these preachers , old Benjamin Abbott from New Jersey . He was an old man , with large , shaggy eyebrows and eyes of flame , with a powerful frame and great extent of voice , which he exerted to the utmost , xvhile preaching and praying , which , with an occasional stamp with his foot , made the church ring . It was like the trumpet sounding to battle , amidst the shouts of the victorious and the groans of the wounded . His words ran like fire-sparks through the assembly , and they who came to laugh , stood aghast upon the benches , looking down upon the slain and wounded , while , to use a favorite expression of his , the shout of the king was in the camp ! ' A singular instance of mental delusion is found in the account of Morgan Edwards , minister to the first Baptist Church in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own death was supernaturally foretold to him . He announced it from his pulpit , and took a solemn and affectionate farewell of his people . At the appointed time , his house was crowded with people , all waiting with silent expectation , while he himself breathed heavily , expecting every breath to be his last . His constitution however proved too strong for the delusion , and he did not succeed to die ; but so great was the wrath and disappointment of the people , that he was obliged to depart into // the country , where he lived twenty years afterwards . This work affords materials which might serve the purpose of one who writes the history of enthusiasm . Some sects , which were violent in their beginning , throw off their accidental over-earnestness ; and like the Baptists , and Methodists , become useful and important to society ; while others , like the Mormonites , having nothing substantial under the enthusiasm , last only till the enthusiasm perishes by natural decay . The case of the latter may be compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia many years ago ; it was thought to possess unrivalled virtues ; the newspapers sang its praises , and crowds came to be healed . At last , philosophy intruded with its severe investi*ati to all , that it owed its peculiar on , and made it manifest materials from the remains of flavor to the deposit of foul a long covered and forgotten pit . Everything is interesting that relates to the memory of Franklin . The incidental notices of him , scattered throughout this work , show how various were the employments of his active and powerful mind . First we see hini as a printer , making his own ink , making successful experiments in founding types , carving wood cuts , engraving copperplate , and constructing his own presses . Then he acquired influence , as editor of an able print , and exerted himself to establish an academy , and to provide for the public defence by a military force and fortifications . At leisure moments he introduced the cultivation of the willow , which he chanced to find sprouting in some wicker-work brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of broom-corn , upon an imported cornwhisk , ' belonging to a lady in the city , he secured and planted it , and made it the parent of those vast plantations of broom-corn , which are now found in so many parts of the country. * He then becomes eminent for his electrical discoveries , and amused himself with bringing a lightning rod into his chamber ; where , by placing a chime of bells between the two ends of the divided rod , they were rung by the passing clouds , and remained , till Daniel Wister , who succeeded him , was obliged to remove them , to quiet the fears of his wife . When travelling , he * Then he invented the well known Franklin stove , which was the first , and is still regarded as one of the best improvements upon the vast fire-place of old times . // stretched silken cords over crevices where the wind came into houses in which he sojourned , and thus provided himself with the music of the winds ; once , happening to pass one such house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it deserted on account of the strange and melancholy sounds heard within it , which it was thought could proceed from no mortal hand . Scarcely any mention can he found of Franklin in any quarter , which does not illustrate the practical and searching turn of his extraordinary mind . This writer seems to think that he had too much to lose by the Revolution , to he hearty in the cause of his country , and says that he was slow in making up his mind to sign the Declaration . He was habitually cautious no doubt , and not likely to share the overwhelming enthusiasm of the day ; hut his country owes him too much to complain , if he did not anticipate all the success hy which that bold measure has since been justified : and perhaps , if the prospect seemed to him less encouraging than to others , there was the more merit in his sacrifice than in theirs . It is painful to read the account here given of ' Robert Morris 's great mansion , ' and to see how those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , failed to save their possessor from ruin . He purchased a whole square for ten thousand pounds , on which his palace was to he erected . The estimates of his architect deceived him ; he spent immense sums upon the foundation only , and when the walls were completed , and the costly furniture already imported from abroad , he was a ruined man , and was often heard , was he looked upon the work , uttering imprecations upon his architect and his own folly . It was taken down by the creditors , and the materials sold , leaving the arches of the foundation , which were so massive and firm that they did not attempt to remove them . This distinguished man , upon whose ability his country leaned with confidence during so many years of trial , passed the close of his life in a jail An account is also here given of Charles Thompson , the well known secretary of Congress , to whom the Indians , who by sore experience have acquired much insight into character , gave the name of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died upon the passage to this country , leaving him to the charge of the master of the vessel , who proved false to his trust . By persevering exertion , he contrived to get an education , and was employed by Dr. Franklin as teacher in the // academy , an employment which be afterwards abandoned for mercantile adventures . He was induced to study Greek , from having bought part of the Septuagint at an auction sale ; he did not know what it was , and all the auctioneer could tell him was , that it was printed in outlandish letters . When he was able to read it , he was anxious to procure the whole ; but the booksellers ' shops afforded no copy ; it happened , however , that two years after , in passing the same auction room , he found the auctioneer engaged in selling the remnant of the same copy . It is well known that he afterwards published a valuable translation of the Septuagint , and collected materials for a history of the Revolution . We have several incidental notices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropy . It would seem from an incident here mentioned , that his benevolence was by no means confined to the race of man . An old friend , who visited him one day , found him engaged in feeding rats in his area , where they would come at a call , and gather round him like chickens . The friend expressed his wonder at seeing him thus patronising such troublesome vermin ; Nay , ' said Antony , I will not kill them ; you make them dishonest by starving them ; I make them honest by feeding them ; for being so fed , they never prey on goods of mine . ' He carried this feeling so far as to abstain from animal food . When the French neutrals , as they were called , were banished by severe state policy from Acadia , and distributed among the colonies , where , to their latest day , the remembrance of their wrongs and sorrows was fresh in their souls , Benezet exerted himself to the utmost to relieve their wants and educate their children . The fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is universally known . We have no room to follow the author in his notice of James Logan , the patriarch of the settlement and the friend of Penn , a man of liberal , enlightened , and accomplished mind ; nor of John Bartram , the self-taught botanist , a gentle lover of nature , whose establishment before the Revolution is described by Hector St. John ; the host , with family and slaves , all met at the same table , the Africans being arrayed at the foot , opposite to the guest and their master . His passion was first inspired by the sight of a daisy , on which his eye fell as he rested from ploughing under a tree ; from this time he devoted himself to the study , and acquired the distinction of being called , by // Linnicus , the greatest self-taught botanist in the world . His employment was favorable to health and happiness , for he died at the age of seventy-six , and his son , who inherited his tastes , property and collection , lived to the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature which the city ever afforded , was Benjamin Lay , who , like Jonas Hanway in England , was so fanatical in his opposition to the use of tea , that in the time of the Friends ' general meeting , he took a large box of china belonging to his wife into the market place , where he began to break the pieces separately with a hammer , bearing his testimony all the while . The people , thinking this a needless waste of property , fell upon him in a body , bearing their testimony in their own way , overset him , and carried away his ware , to be used by those whose conscience was less particular . The spirit of another Friend , Samuel Foulke , was equally stirred , when he saw an advertisement in 1743 , by S. Kinnett , proposing to teach the noble art of defence , and also dancing . ' Upon this friend Samuel took the pen , saying , I was surprised at his audacity and brazen impudence , in giving those detestable vices so high encomiums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are diabolical . ' Among the reminiscences which the author has collected from all quarters , are sundry local anecdotes of the Revolution . A lady of his acquaintance describes the entrance of the British under Cornwallis into Philadelphia . His suite took possession of her mother 's house . She says , my mother was appalled by the numerous train which took possession of her dwelling ; for a guard was mounted at the door , and the yard filled with soldiers and baggage , and J can well remember what we thought of the haughty looks of Lord Rawdon and the other aid-de-camp , as they traversed the apartments . My mother desired to speak with Lord Cornwallis , and he attended her ; she told him how impossible it would be for her to stay in her own house , with such a numerous train : he behaved with great politeness , said he should be sorry to give trouble , and would provide other quarters . ' We are told that General Howe , while he remained , seized a lady 's coach and horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers were uneasy at his conduct ; but his companions , who had influence with him , were the most idle and dissipated officers of the army . Lord Howe was much more sedate and // 394 April7 dignified than his brother . Sir William Howe was a fine fig-. ure , six feet high , and well proportioned ; in appearance he was not unlike General Washington ; his manners were graceful and affable , and he was murch beloved by his officers . Sir Henry Clinton was short and fat , with a full face and prominent nose ; reserved in his manners , and not so popular as Howe . Lord Cornwallis was short and stout ; his hair somewhat gray ; his face well formed and agreeable , his manners remarkably easy ; he was much beloved by his men . Col. Tarleton was rather below the middle size , strong , heavily made , but uncommonly active ; his complexion dark , his eye small , black , and piercing . The British officers gave a splendid and fancifidf&amp;e on the occasion of Gen. Howe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the Meschianza , ' as it was called , was the life of the company . We see one fact here recorded , which shows how attentive the fathers of this settlement were to everything that tended to public prosperity and improvement . So early as 1725 , James Logan , writing to the proprietaries , recommends the culture of silk in the country , and speaks of attempts which had already been made , as promising great success . In a letter of the following year , he speaks of some which has been sent to England , and says he is glad that it proves so good : he doubts not that the country will in time be able to send large quantities abroad . Such was his reasonable expectation , and yet after the lapse of a century , the country is but just beginning to turn its attention seriously to the subject , which is treated as if it were almost entirely new . Governor Gordon , in 1734 , says that the tree is natural to our soil , and the worm thrives well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of trade . In 1770 , the subject was taken up with much interest ; and , as might be expected , Dr. Franklin , then in Europe , urged it upon the attention of his countrymen . Funds were subscribed , and a fliature opened ; in the next year 2300 pounds were brought to it to reel . The Queen patronised it by wearing a gown of American silk , and everything promised well ; but the interest seems afterwards to have declined , and those who are now endeavoring to recommend it to the public attention , are obliged to go over the whole ground again . We feel bound to give credit to the industrious author , for the information which he has here collected . Much of it nos // doubt appears trifling , but a great part of that which seems unimportant throws light upon the manners , fashions , tastes and feelings of the day , and therefore affords materials , which the future historian would find valuable in his estimate of character , which is after all the most important subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Penn has found such an honest chronicler as Griffith ; ' but we trust that it will not prevent some other hand from giving a popular account , from its beginning , of one of the most judicioin , happy and prosperous settlements , ever made in this or any other country.
