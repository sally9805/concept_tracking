txt To the honorable the Senate and Rouse of Representatives of the United States of . /lmerica in Congress assembled : The memorial of a Convention of Friends of Domestic Industry assembled at New York , on the 25th of October last , RESPECTFULLY 5HOWETH : That , having been deputed by a large number of their fellow-citizens in all parts of the country to meet together , and adopt such measures as might appear suitable for the encouragement of domestic industry , they have deemed it their duty to address themselves to your honorable body , and to state their views upon the economical condition and policy of the country . Belonging , for the most part , to a class of the people whose interests are directly involved in the measures that may be taken by the Government in regard to this subject , their opinions are in general the results of their own experience ; and they venture to solicit for them the attention which may be due from enlightened legislators to the observations and conclusions of practical men . The leading object of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your honorable body to continue the duties on imported foreign articles which were intended for the protection of domestic manufactures , whatever reduction it may be found expedient to make in the duties on such imported foreign articles as do not enter into competition with the products of our own industry . The crisis in the financial situation of the Government , which will be the effect of the approaching extinction of the public debt , will render it practicable , and consequently proper , to reduce , very considerably , the amount of the revenue ; but , your memorialists believe that this reduction may be made , and that regard for the welfare of the country imperiously requires that it should be made , without infringing on the principle of protection . In support of this opinion , they respectfully submit the following suggestions . Your memorialists are aware that it has been sometimes questioned , whether the Government of the United States possesses , under the constitution , the right of imposing duties on foreign imported articles for the purpose of protecting domestic manufactures ; but they deem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of this peint , Their views respecting it are fully stated in their Address to the people of the United States , to which they respectfully solicit your attention . They consider it as well established , by the facts and arguments contained in that address , that the protection of domestic industry , by the imposition of duties on foreign articles , which are or may be abun-1 // dantly produced in this country , was one of the main objects which the people of the United States had in view in forming and adopting the federal constitution ; that the constitution expressly confers upon the Government the power of laying duties at discretion for any purpose which they may deem conducive to the general welfare , and particularly for that of regulating commerce ; that the language of the preamble of the first revenue act , and the uniform practice of the Government ever since , prove that the powers conferred by the constitution were understood by the framers of that instrument , and by all their distinguished successors in the administration , and in Congress , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties on imported foreign articles for the purpose of protecting domestic industry . The correctness of these opinions is also admitted by many of the most intelligent and enlightened of those persons who doubt the expediency of the protecting policy . Of the very respectable assembly of delegates from this class of the citizens who met at Philadelphia last year , a large proportion were so fully satisfied of the constitutionality of this policy , that it is understood that they were prepared to retire from the convention rather than give their assent to any expression of a contrary opinion . The memorial to your honorable body , which has been submitted by a committee of that convention , waives any objection on that ground ; and some of the ablest writers in opposition to the protecting policy , have recently declared their decided belief in its constitutionality , which is thus confirmed , to a very great extent , by the strongest of all arguments , the assent of persons having an adverse interest . Under these circumstances , your memorialists can not regard the constitutional right of the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic industry , as a doubtful question ; nor , if it were , would they wish to add any thing on this occasion to the expression of their views upon this subject contained in the address to the people . Without dwelling on this topic , they proceed , therefore , at once to offer some considerations in support of the expediency of the protecting policy , and in answer to the objections that are urged against it . In restricting themselves to this division of the subject , your memorialists are well aware that they still have before them a topic much too vast to be treated satisfactorily within the limits that are assigned by usage to an exposition of this description . They can only hope to touch very briefly upon some of the most important general principles connected with the inquiry . A minute investigation of details would carry them too far , and would also be , as they conceive , irrelevant to the present purpose . The settlement of the precise form in which the protecting principle , if maintained , is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which , at present , your memorialists have no occasion or disposition to enter . These points will naturally be regulated , from time to time , as circumstances may require , by the wisdom of successive legislatures . The great question which now engages the attention of the country , is simply this : Shall the Government maintain or abandon the protecting principle ? This must be decided on large and general views of the past history , the present sitiation , and the future prospects of the Union . It is not exclusively , as some suppose , a question of the actual and possible prices of arti* // des , although the effect of protectin* duties on prices is no doubt in* eluded in the inquiry . It involves , besides , a consideration of the causes that promote the welfare of nations , by determining their progress in population , civilization , and political power , as well as mere wealth . It has indeed been one of the errors of the opponents of the protecting policy , that they have looked too directly and exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - although , in regard to these , they are , as your memorialists conceive , entirely mistaken ; - and have not sufficiently regarded its operation on the great and permanent interests of the people , considered as a community . It is to these that your memorialists propose , at present , more particularly to request your attention . The general object of a protecting policy , is the encouragement of domestic industry in all its great branches , agriculture and commerce , as well as manufactures . Its direct and immediate application varies according to the geographical characteristics and peculiar circumstances under which it is applied . In this country , it was deemed important forty years ago to protect the culture of cotton , by a duty of three cents a pound on the foreign article , and to encourage our own navigation by discriminating tonnage and light duties , amounting to a dollar a ton on foreign ships . Whatever may be the product or branch of industry which is the immediate object of protection in the first instance , it confers , in its general results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the extension of industry in one of its departments , naturally creates a corresponding extension in all the rest . Under the present circumstances of the country , manufactures and the agricultural products that are employed in them , such as wool , iron , hemp , and flax , are regarded as among the proper objects of the protecting policy , and , in most discussions of the subject for practical purposes . the inquiry turns upon the expediency of protecting and encouraging domestic manufactures by duties on the corresponding foreign articles . It is generally acknowledged alike by the friends and the opponents of the protecting policy , that our domestic manufactures would not flourish , or even exist , without protection . If they could , the protecting duty would be nugatory and merely nominal , as that on cotton in fact is . Whenever the protection is real and operative , it is of course necessary to the existence of the manufhcture . The question of the expediency of protection , resolves itself , therefore , into the question of the advantage of possessing domestic manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the benefits they bring with them , without protecting duties ; and , in order to be able to jud* , e whether the protecting policy is expedient or not , we must inquire what advantages the country will derive from possessing manufactures . By comparing these with the sacrifices , if any , imposed by the protecting policy , it will he easy to see whether the expected benefit is worth what it costs . It may be proper to remark here , that the necessity of legislative protection to the prosperity and even existence of our manutactures , is not the result of any deficiency in this country of natural advantages for the prosecution of this branch of industry . No community l ) erhaps on the globe is , in this respect , better situated than the United States of America . The vast extent of our territory , stretching as it // does through a great many different climates , furnishes an inexhaustible supply of materials of every description , the boundless abundance and variety of which we are ourselves scarcely beginning to realise . Forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow in any part of our soil ; it now forms the staple product of six States , besides the territory of Florida , and supplies , in addition to our own demand , twothirds of all that is used in other countries . It is only since its cession to the United States , in 1803 , that the soil of Louisiana has been turned to accouut for the production of sugar . It already furnishes , under the encouragement of a judicious protecting duty , an annual product of sixty million pounds , and bids fair , at no distant period , to supply the whole consumption of the Union . Within a very few years , we have discovered the gold mines of North Carolina and Georgia , have begun to appreciate the great value of those of lead in the Upper Mississippi , and have brought into use the still more precious treasure of our coals . Silk is becoming very fast an object of attention . Such , in short , is the richness and variety of our natural products , that hardly any considerable manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priiicipal materials within ourselves . Next to an abundant supply of materials , the most important requisite for success in manufactures , is an easy communication by means of water-courses , roads , and accessible harbors between the different sections of the same country , and with foreign parts . Here , again , our situation is unrivalled . In no region of equal extent , are the facilities for intercourse by land and water so abundant . Our sea coast of fifteen hundred miles , with the bays arid rivers that indent it , lays open the interior as far back as the mountains , to the access of foreign and internal trade . Beyond the mountains , again , the magnificent chain of lakes and rivers that extends , with its countless ramifications , from the gulf of St. Lawrence to that of Mexico , seems , if we look only at the natural means of communication , to bring them almost to the door of every citizen . To these , we may already add the numerous canals that do so much honor to the enterprise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect , the rail-roads , of which the results are so extraordinary , that we can hardly yet trust ourselves to calculate on them , although we see them realised before our eyes* In the last and principal requisite for success in manufactures , which is to be found in the intellectual and moral qualities of the people , the United States may fairly claim at least an equality with other countries . It would , in fact , be doing injustice to our intelligent and enterprising citizeiis , not to admit that , as a community , they have shown a peculiar aptitude for making discoveries and improvements in the mechanical arts . The world owes to them a large proportion of the remarkable inventions of the last half century , of which the cotton-gin , the steam-boat , the nail and card machines , are only the most prominent among hundreds of others of less note . It is hardly necessary to add that the moral qualities that distinguish our population , their general uprightness in dealing , steady industry in pursuit of their respective callings , and habitual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn their natural and intellectual , advantages to the best account ; while the transcendant blessing of our excellent political institutions , by securing to every citizen the full and unmolested enjoyment of the fruits of his labor // and opening the whole field of wealth and distinction to his honorable ambition , supplies the motive to exertion , without which the happiest natural gifts are often permitted to rust unused . We should prove ourselves ungrateful to the bounteous Giver of all these blessings , not to perceive in them a combination of advantages , physical and moral , for the prosecution of every department of labor , including all the liberal and mechanical arts in the widest comprehension of the terms , such as has rarely , if ever , fallen to the lot of any other people . Your memorialists have deemed it not irrelevant to the present purpose , to dwell a little upon the great natural advantages possessed by the United States for the prosecution of all the branches of industry , and especially manufactures , inasmuch as it would be impolitic and unavailing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interdicted by the nature of the soil and climate , or the character of the people . Such , however , is not the case . It is not owing to the absence of natural advantages for the prosecution of manufactures , that this branch of industry requires ast present to be fostered and secured from foreign competition by legislative protection . Various circumstances iu the past history of the United States , which are too familiarly known to call for more than a passing allusion on this occasion , have naturally led to this result . It was a part of the old colonial system to prohibit the colonies altogether from engaging in manufactures . Even Lord Chatham , the political friend of America , and , in many respects , a more enlightened and liberal statesman than many of his contemporaries , declared , in open Parliament , that , if he could help it , there should not be a hob-nail manufactured in the Colonies . This continued till the war of independence . The period of exhaustion , poverty , political imbecility , and partial confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of economical establishments of any kind . Scarcely had the adoption of the federal constitution introduced some degree of confidence , and the continuance of peace permitted the accumulation of a moderate capital , when the breaking out of the war in Europe , threw into the hands of our merchants the carrying trade of the world , and thus offered an irresistible bounty on the investment of capital in commerce . It accordingly took that direction almost exclusively , and with great profit to the country , until the commencement of the commercial restrictions in 1807 . These , and the war with England which succeeded , diverted capital from commerce , and threw it into the channel of manufactures , which accordingly sprung up and flourished with great vigor . It thus appears that , from the period of the first settlement of the country till the commencement of the late difficulties with England , there was always some particular cause in operation , the effect of which was adverse to the establishment of manufactures . The impulse which was given to them by these difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , and the importation of the flood of British products which were thrown in for this express purpose . It has since recovered itself , and , with the aid of the protection afforded by the successive tariffs of 1816 , 1824 , and 1828 , has been gradually and regularly gaining strength . No particular obstacle now opposes the developement of this branch of industry , which , on the other hand , is favored by the present state of foreign commerce , and the payment of the public debt , // Under these circumstances , new manufacturing establishments are forming ; flourishing and populous villages are rising in various quarters ; the fairest prospects of future prosperity are opening upon us . But all this admirable creation is still in infancy . These young establishments can not yet contend with the practised skill and accumulated capital of European industry , still less , with the tremendous fluctuations to which the state of that industry is subject . It is admitted by all , as your memorialists have already remarked , that , without protection , our manufactures can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the protecting policy , by gradually withdrawing this protection , to bring them , by a slow process , with as little injury as possible to vested interests , to destruction . Excepting as far as this is accomplished , the repeal of the protecting duties would work no change in the condition of any portion of the country . It would neither increase the sales of agricultural produce in foreign countries , the importation of foreign manufactures from abroad , nor the amount of navigation employed in bringing them home , bit desirable then that the existing manufacturing establishments of the country should be destroyed , and the present prospects of future progress in this branch of industry blasted ? What is the operation of domestic manufactures on the wealth , population , and general prosperity of a country ? Is it favorable , injurious , or simply indifferent ? If favorable , is there any thing in the operation of the protecting policy which tends to counteract their good results , and to what extent ? These are the questions which appear to your memorialists to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now briefly attempt to resolve . The time has been , and it is not a very remote one , when the question , whether the operation of domestic manufactures is or is not injurious , would have been readily answered by many persons in this country in the affirmative . They were habitually viewed with distrust , as likely to exercise a pernicious influence on the morals of the persons employed in them . In the earlier discussions of the protecting policy in Congress , and up to the period immediately preceding the last war , this was the argument principally urged in opposition to it , amd it wa* urged with peculiar zeal by the representatives of the eastern States . Experience has since corrected this error , and has shown that , in well-in *naged manufacturing establishments ,  --  the only ones which can long thrive , and which , of course , determine the average condition of the whole ,  --  the standard of morals is as high , if not higher , than it is in those belonging to any other branch of industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience has amply demonstrated the great positive advantages resulting from the possession of domestic manufactures , the most important of which your memorialists will now very briefly recapitulate . The first and principal one is an accession of wealth , population , and political importance , exactly proportioned to the whole amount of capital , and the whole number of persons which they employ . This proposition may appear at first so trite and obvious as to be nearly or quite self-evident . That an agricultural village , town , and country , which obtains its supplies of manufactured articles within its own limits , is , in the same proportion inure wealthy , populous , and flourishing , than one , in other respects similarly situated , which send . for them to // distant city , is a truth too familiar to every one from actual observation , to be made the subject of question . It is also apparent , that the remark is equally true of communities politically independent . But , as this truth , however obvious , is constantly denied by the opponents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step in most of the reasoning by which they endeavor to support their opinions , it may be proper to dwell upon it for a few moments , for the purpose of stating it in a more precise form , and examining the objections that are alleged against it . It may be remarked , then , that , in every community , the wants of the people are regularly supplied by the co-operation of the three great branches of industry , agriculture , commerce , and manufactures , in proportions determined by the degree of civilization . The three classes of laborers who are respectively engaged in these three different employments , all derive their means of subsistence , and the manufacturers their materials , from the products of agriculture , and must receive their share alike , whether they dwell within or without the country . If they live abroad , they still consume the same amount as before , of the products of the community for which they work , and the wealth and population of the latter are of course regularly smaller in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  . and such is nearly the case in the wealthy and civilized parts of the Christian world ,  --  that these three classes of laborers are regularly equal in number , then a community which receives its manufactures from abroad will regularly export one-third part of its agricultural produce in exchange for them , and will be one-third less wealthy and populous , than it would be if they were all supplied at home . Besides this , the labor required for exchanging the products of the two classes of workmen now belonging to distinct communities , regularly divides itself between those communities , and the agricultural country will thus sustain the loss of half its commercial , in addition to the whole of its manufacturing population . The distance at which the exchanges are made being now greater , it requires a greater amount of labor than before to effect them ; or , in other words , to carry on the necessary commerce ; so that , if this branch of industry before occupied a third part of the laborers , it will now occupy more . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of the absence of domestic manufactures , there is , therefore , a loss of more than half the wealth and population that naturally belong to it . But the wealth and population of every country form the true measures of its general prosperity and political importance ; and a community which receives its manufactures from abroad , sustains , therefore , in each of these respects , a positive loss of half its natural advantages . But this is not all . The wealth and population thus lost , go to swell the wealth and population of some other country ; of necessity , one with which the losing people have a close relation . If the elements of wealth and power belonging to the countries thus situated , in other respects , be naturally equal , one now gains and the other loses more than half the amount , and the relative forces of the two become as three to one . Thus , the want of domestic manufactures deprives a country of half its positive , and two-thirds of its relative importance ; degrades it of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mercy of the // powers with which it has the closest connexion , and to which it is naturally equal . It is said , however , on the other hand , that the foreign manufactures which we obtain from abroad in exchange for our agricultural exports , are as much the products of American industry as if they were made at home , and that they , of course , put in motion an equal amount of American capital and labor . The friends of the protecting policy are told " that the erroneous doctrines prevalent respecting the injurious consequences of the importation of foreign goods arise , chiefly , from overlooking this leading principle , viz. If we buy , we must pay for what we buy ; if we import foreign goods , we must export domestic products , or something for which domestic products are exchanged , to pay for these foreign goods ; " and it is candidly added , that " these truths are every day denied by men who have an interest in imposing upon the public . " We are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as every article imported must be purchased , and can not be paid for by any possible means other than the products of American industry , it necessarily follows , that whatever may be the amount of imports , and of foreign industry , by which they may have been produced , an equal value of American products , and an equal amount of corresponding American industry , is employed by the foreign trade . " " The error of the restrictionists , " as a majority of the people of the United States are politely and elegantly styled , is said to consist " in not perceiving that the foreign trade promotes puts in motion two equal amounts of for eign and domestic industry , and in supposing that the American industry , which , in the establishment of a new manufacture , is substituted to for the foreign industry , is an addition to , instead of being a deduction from , the American industry , which was , or might have been , otherwise employed . " In reference to these and other suggestions of a similar import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they have not , as is supposed , overlooked the very obvious fact that no foreign article can be imported excepting in exchange for a domestic one of equal value . They are well aware that , in general , all commerce , whether between nations or individuals , consists in an exchange of equal values . They also readily admit that the foreign product thus obtained in exchange for the imported domestic one , may itself be regarded without impropriety , when brought into market , as an American product , and as having given employment to American labor and capital . But it is not the less certain that the exported and the imported article can not both be considered as the products of American labor and capital . If a planter , who exchanges a bale of cotton for a bale of broadcloth , choose to consider and represent the latter , when brought into the home market , as his product , he may do so without impropriety but in that case , he must consider and represent his cotton as the product of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is apparent that each can only be regarded as the producer of one of the products so exchanged ; and it is of no consequence to the present question , whether they are regarded as producing respectively their exports or their imports . On the other hand , when the exchange takes place in the same country , it is equally clear that both the products exchanged are domestic , and that the operation sets in motion // exactly twice the amount of domestic industry and capital which is put in motion by the other . Your memorialists will add here , that they have no disposition to impeach the motives of such of their fellow-citizens as may differ from them in opinion upon these important subjects . They believe that while self-interest is one of the motives that operate on both sides of this , as of all other questions , there is also on both sides a large , perhaps an equal , proportion of patriotic feeling , and honest intention to promote the public good . But as the character of their own motives is pretty freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps be permitted to say that the foreign origin of the doctrine they are noticing , in the most imposing form in which it has yet appeared , is apparent on its face as quoted above , and that a foreign origin not unfrequently indicates a foreign interest . The British , the French , and the Swiss manufacturer , would gladly persuade us , and have an interest in persuading us , that we lose nothing by consuming their products instead of our own ; but it is plain , that if the American cultivator give a product upon which he has employed a certain amount of labor and capital to an American manufacturer , in exchange for an American product which has employed another equal amount of American labor and capital , the operation puts in motion twice as much American labor and capital as if he gave the same product to a foreign manufacturer , in exchange for a foreign product which has employed an equal amount of foreign labor and capital . The point is too clear to admit ot argument , and yet we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceiving that the foreign trade promotes , ( puts in motion , ) two equal amounts of foreign and domestic industry . " The friends of the protecting policy know very well that the foreign trade puts in motion two equal amounts of industry , one foreign and the other domestic ; but , though emphatically charged with blindness , they can not help seeing that the internal trade puts in motion two equal amounts of industry , both of which are domestic ; and that it employs , of course , twice as much domestic labor and capital as the other . It is said , again , that the whole capital of every community is at all times employed ; that the establishment of manufactures can only be effected by withdrawing from agriculture or commerce a prtion of the capital that was previously employed in them ; and that , as the reward of labour is equal in all its departments , the community gains nothing by the operation , and of course loses to the full extent of any sacrifice that may have been made for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed on respectable authority , " can not generate the smallest amount of capital , it can only transfer the capital already existing from one employment to another . " It is said to be " obvious that a certain amount of American industry , which was or might have been employed in producing one million of dollars worth of articles intended for exportation , and to be exchanged for an equal value of foreign goods , can not , if employed in a domestic manufacture of goods of a similar nature , be any longer employed in producing the exportable articles ; and that the only question is , whether that amount of industry is more or less profitably employed in its new , than its former employments* " This , as your memorialists conceive , is the radical er // ror in the theory of the opponents of the protecting policy , and it appears to them not less obvious than it is important . It is no doubt perfectly true , that a portion of capital which was , or might have been , employed in one branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rendered more productive by being transferred to another . But how does it appear that the capital and labor which are put in motion by the establishment of manufactures in a country where they did not exist before , was , or might have been , employed in some other way ? How does it appear that all the capital and labor of every community are , at all times , employed in such a way as to yield the ordinary return ? Many persons of great discretion believe , that there is in most , if not in all countries , at all times* what has been contemptuously called an %maginary dormant capital ; in other words , that a certain portion of the capital and labor of almost every community , is at all times either unemployed , or not employed so as to yield the ordinary returns . A circumstance which renders practicable the introduction of a new branch of industry that did not exist before , by stimulating enterprise , has a tendency to bring this dormant capital into activity . We are assured , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opponents of the protecting policy , " that , by multiplying in any country the channels of domestic industry , a greater scope is given to its application , a market more diversified and less likely to be glutted procured to its products , and a larger field opened to every species of skill and labor . " Now , an act of legislation which counteracts the danger of foreign competition , is precisely one of those circumstances that multiply the channels of industry . Such an act renders it practicable to invest in manufactures capital and labor which would not otherwise have been employed in that way , and , of course , has a tendency to bring into action a portion of capital and labor existing in the country , which was not , and , even if it might , would not have been employed in any other manner . It is admitted , that the female labor employed in the cotton and woollen manufactures , is an example of a result ofthis description , although , at the same time , the importance of this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no disposition to exaggerate it . They deem it , in fact , themselves , a comparatively insignificant item in the great sum of national industry . They will remark , however , in order to set the matter right , that the number of females so employed , at present , is calculated at not less than 100,000 . Most of them are the daughters of the cultivators living in the neighborhood of the manufactories in which they are employed , and , if not employed in this way would have had no occupation whatever of a lucrative kind . They now earn , we are told , from three to four dollars a week ; but if we calculate the average earnings of all , over what they would have gained in their former situations , at only $100 a year , we have already , from this single source , a clear addition to the annual revenue of the community of ten million dollars . The profit derived by the country , merely from the female labor which is brought into action by the protecting policy , trifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless equals , very nearly , the annual expenses of the Government . In connexion with the remarks on female labor here alluded to , an attempt is made to estimate the total value of all the profits accruing to // the country from the encouragement afforded to our domestic industry by the establishment of manufactures . We are told that , " making the most ample allowance for errors or omissions , it is utterly impossible , on any rational and candid calculation , to swell their aggregate value to an amount approaching the national loss arising from a difference of ' 20 per cent . between the respective prices of the domestic and similar foreign commodities . " A very easy calculation , founded on data furnished on the same authority on which this assertion is made , will show how far it is consistent with facts . The total value of manu* factures , foreign and domestic , annually consumed in this country , is estimated , on this authority , at about $200,000,000 . The supposed national loss , resulting from the rise of 20 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty on foreign goods to that amount , can not be felt on the whole , because it is admitted that the duty on coarse cottons , the most extensive branch of ' our domestic manufactures , is nominal . But admitting that the supposed loss is felt on the whole , the amount will be only forty millions , while the single unimportant item , on the profit side of the female labor employed in the manufactories , covers a quarter of that sum . It appears , therefore , that the dormant capital of the country is not so entirely imaginary , nor yet so completely insignificant , as some have supposed . The whole amount of this dormant capital , whatever it may be , which is thus brought into action , may be regarded as a real addition to the previously existing , capital of the country , resulting from the establishment of manufactures , and from the protecting policy which rendered that establishment practicable . But let it be admitted , for argument 's sake ,  --  for the case is so strong as to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  let it be admitted that the notion of a dormant or unemployed capital is entirely imaginary ; that the capital and population of all countries must be supposed to be always fully employed , the stock all producing the ordinary returns , the laborers all earning the ordinary wages ; how does it appear that , even on this supposition , the capital and labor which are put in motion by the establishment of manufactures , were , or might have been , employed in some other way ? In every flourishing country , there is a constant increase of population and accumulation of profits , or , in other words , a constant formation of fresh amounts of capital and labor . This is the fund which regularly furnishes the capital and labor for all new establishments , agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial . We are told , in fact , on authority which will not be questioned by the opponents of the protecting policy , that " it is generally true , that there is a sufficient amount of capital and labor applicable to manufactures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , commerce , or mechanical pursuits . For , though there may be in certain parts of the country instances of that kind , yet , considered on the whole , there is not , notwithstanding the numerous recent manufacturing establishments , any diminution in the agriculture , foreign commerce , or domestic exports ; nor is it necessary , in order to explain this state of things , to recur either to an imaginary dormant capital , or to a pretended creation of capital by banks or legislative acts . Every year adds 150,000 nble-bodied men to the labor of the country . The whole popula@@183058209.txt The diffusion of knowledge among the mass of mankind is the grand feature of the present age . The history of the nineteenth century , if all auguries do not disappoint us , will be a history of the effects of popular education . Even if war , to a certain extent , must , unhappily , be the school ; if tactics must be one of the lessons , yet under this rough and stern tuition the general mind will advance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century , if they must come , will be wars of the oppressed many against the oppressive few , wars of the people against despotism , wars of individual man against official man . They will be , as has been said , wars of opinion . And the grand opinion on which the history of this age will be based , the great characteristic idea , the secretly working , but strong and controlling philosophy of the age , the germ of its chief develQpments will be found , as we believe , in a regard , never before paid , to individual man . Not , as in the Grecian philosophy , to the ideal man , honored in theory and bodied forth in beautiful creations of art , while man himself was left ignorant and oppressed ; but to the personal , actual being . Yes , we believe that the sublime age is approaching , which is to place man in his just position amidst the material and social works of God ; which is to give full development to the great idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal and artificial society ,  --  - not the king , the prince , the noble , the priest , the official being , the creature of forms , but that man himself and by himself is to be the central , the ultimate , the engrossing object of attention ; that he is to be protected , provided for , educated ; that he is to be made intelligent , free , religious , virtuous , happy ; and that this is the very end of society , government , jurisprudence , // theology , art , labor , and whatsoever pertains to the combined power and action of the world . But this elevation in importance of man as man , this elevation of the mass of mankind to knowledge and power , is held by many to be a step full of danger . We have said that the general diffusion of knowledge is the grand feature of the age . We will now add , that the relation which knowledge bears to political liberty is one of the most important practical subjects which the age presents to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then proceed to consider what education should be , in order to be adapted to the condition of a free people , or to the purpose of promoting and securing political freedom . The relation of knowledge to freedom , then , to proceed to the examination of it , is , as we maintain , immediate , strong , and indissoluble . It is the relation of cause to effect . Knowledge will invariably and inevitably produce freedom . The question , whether a people shall be educated , amounts to the whole question , whether they shall be free . This we argue from the very nature of the human mind . It is the effect of knowledge to give the mind a sense of its own value . The feeling of its own ultimate and personal importance springs from education with equal directness and certainty . A mind , under this training of knowledge , becomes conscious of itself , conscious of what itself is , and , from thence , intuitively conscious of its own intrinsic worth . Just in proportion as any mind possesses this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely for relative objects , not merely for political uses , not merely to act its part in the machinery of a state ; but that it was made for purposes of which the state is the instrument , for purposes terminating in itself , for improvement , for virtue , for happiness . The power of this conviction is expansive ; as truly so as that of any element in nature , and it is as mighty and irresistible . The mind possessing this sense of its own worth and destiny , will demand freedom to act for those great ends which God and nature have established as the ultimate ends of its existence . It will not be a slave to any political institution , but will hold the institution to be its servant , investing it , indeed , with power , but with only so much power as is necessary to make it a useful servant . It pill cease to respect , and at length to tolerate , any government , // but such as ministers to its improvement , virtue and happiness . If an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village full of obstructions to his movement and progress in its passages and thoroughfares , so neither will he build a fabric of government bearing this character . And if such a being , who found himself amidst such inconveniences of a merely local situation , would strive to remedy them ; bow much more will he strive to reform the evils and errors of government . Political reform is no creature of temporary circumstances and impulses , but it is the steady and strong demand of every enlightened community . The tendency to it is irresistible . It is the tendency of thought ,  --  ofmind ,  --  - of an agent endowed with invincible energies , of an agent which , wben once awakened and aroused to action , can never be lulled to sleep again . The power of the mind , in such circumstances , we repeat , is expansive . It will penetrate the surrounding mass of institutions and forms , gently insinuating itself into them , and swelling and moulding them at its pleasure ; or being pent up , it will reveal itself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolution . Again , the mind of a people , in proportion as it is educated , will not only feel its own value , hut will also perceive its rights . We speak now of those palpable rights which are recognised by all free states ; for there is , as we think and will soon undertake to show , a higher estimate of human rights , to which knowledge and reflection will yet lead . But the palpable rights of men , those of personal security , of property and of the free and unembarrassed pursuit of individual welfare , it is obviously impossible to conceal from an educated and reading people . Such a people rises at once above the condition of feudal tenants . It is no longer part and parcel of the soil it cultivates or defends . It directs its attention to the laws and institutions that govern it . It compels public office to give an account of itself . It strips off the veil of secrecy from the machinery of power . The mysterious budget of national expenses is opened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much is levied for war , how much for internal improvements and for what improvements of this character , how much for the support of public officers , of magistrates , of kings and royal families , how much for pensions and sinecures ,  --  - all this is known . And when all this is spread abroad in newspaper details , when it is thus carried to the firesides of a whole people , of a people // that can read ; when the estimate is freely made , of what the government tax levies upon the daily hoard , and upon apparel , and upon every comfort of life , can it be doubted that such a people will demand and obtain an influence in affairs that so vitally concern it ? This would be freedom . When gov-. eminent is a fair expression of the aggregate mind of a country , there is perfect political freedom . if enlightened human nature will not demand this , then there is no index by which we may know it . If we can not be sure that it will d*nand this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , by little and little perhaps , but inevitably gain it ,  --  then it is certain that neither philosophy nor history teaches us any thing . We say , nor history ; for the truth is , that history most fully confirms the position we have taken . The most enlightened nations in the world have been the freest nations . The steps of freedom are ever to be found in the path of light ; in the broad path , let it be observed , however , where the sun of knowledge has shone upon the whole mass of the people , and not necessarily where a single taper has shone from the scholastic cloister , or from the study of the secluded philosopher . These indeed are radiating points , and they tend to spread lights ; but it is only where this result is obtained , by whatever means ; it is only among nations the most enlightened in the whole body and mass of their population , that the greatest freedom is alleged by us to have existed . Of this truth , the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend to times more ancient , the only instance of political freedom is found in the Hebrew Commonwealth . And although we hear much of the learning of Egypt , yet it can not be doubted , whether we consider the institutions , the laws , the usages , the theology or the popular literature of the Hebrews , that they must have been in the body and in their best days a more enlightened people than the Egyptians were . The wisdom of Solomon was not of that vague and half-fictitious , nor of that merely religious character , which is commonly ascribed to him ; but it consisted very much of popular common sense , and useful learning . He was a proverbialist , a poet , and a naturalist . The cast of his productions and the kind of knowledge he cultivated sufficiently appear from the brief catalogue given in our Bibles . He spake , ' we are informed , that is he wrote , three thousand proverbs ; and his songs were a thousand and five . And he spake of trees , from // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springeth out of the wall ; he spake also , ' - still meaning that he wrote ,  --  what now indeed is lost to us , of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things and of fishes . ' If we now come to the history of modern civilization , it bears witness to our position , at every step . Just in proportion as education has been carried down among the mass of any people , has it demanded , and with such exceptions as circumstances always will create has it obtained , civil liberty . Wherever the schoolmaster has been abroad , the political reformer has invariably followed . The successive struggles Tor freedom in England , the growing demands for reform in its constitution , have always kept pace with the increasing intelligence of the people ; and it requires no gift of prophecy to predict other demands of the same nature . We would not , indeed , offer the intelligence of any people in pledge for the propriety of all its requisitions ; because this tendency of human nature , like every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that in some cases , the extent of the demand will be in an inverse ratio to the intelligence that makes it ; that is to say , it may very well happen , that in proportion as any people is intelligent , wise and reflecting , the changes they demand will be less violent and sudden . Still the general tendency of the difibsion of knowledge to the spread of liberal principles is unquestionable . This tendency , in fine , has been most fully illustrated among ourselves . The revolutionary struggle , as has often been said , was a contest for principle ; for a principle almost theoretical . There was no grievous and grinding oppression to complain of . But there was an erroneous principle asserted , a dangerous precedent put forth , and we fought against it , as if it were against the rack and the dungeon . That spirit sprung from the intelligence of the people . It was not a mere arbitrary fashion of thinking which we had got in this country . It was the offspring of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . These are our walls of defence against the encroachments of arbitrary power . These are the nurseries of that free spirit which nothing can conquer . May they ever fulfil their high vocation ! Obvious as these reflections may be , on the tendencies of knowledge , they serve at least one useful purpose ; they show what the question is , about free institutions . They bring that // question within a very narrow compass . They present to every doubter about liberal principles of government , a clear and naked alternative . He must choose freedom , or ignorance . He must hail the progress of civil liberty , or he must call back , again to brood over the world , the night of the dark ages . Those who , some years ago , took their stand against the diffusion of knowledge in England , were , on their principles , altogether in the right . They said that projects for political reform would come , and projects for political , reform have come . They said that the people would not be satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . Let the advocates of things as they are , let the defenders of existing abuses look to it ; for , unless they can arrest the progress of all knowledge , they can not withstand the progress of improvement . They must , to be consistent , take decided ground in this matter . They should have taken it long ago . They should have seen that light was fatal to them . And , now , if they would do any thing effectually , they may be sure that no half-way measures will serve their turn . Their true policy will endure no schools . They must keep the people as ignorant as possible . Ignorance is safety , if it be not bliss ; and there is no other safety for the supporters of arbitrary rule . For them to permit one such dangerous post , as a school-house , to be built on their domain , is extreme stupidity , or miserable infirmity of purpose , or a foolish concession to the spirit of the age . This knowledge has a strange and fatal tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flame , which nothing can extinguish . To educate one mind is to make an enemy , and an enemy that may yet marshal a host . We say again , that the question about free institutions is brought within a small compass . A man has only to decide , whether or not the human mind was made to be educated , made to be intelligent , if it was not , let it be resigned to any dominion , it matters little , what : the body is then , indeed , its prison and its house of bondage . But if it was made to be educated , then it was just as certainly made to be free . It was made , that is to say , with an irresistible tendency to improvement , individual , social , political ; with an irresistible tendency in every member of the state to devise a system of government which shall equally favor all ; which shall permit in all the free action that is compatible with the welfare of all . This follows as a matter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from undeniable premises . A man may have his fears about this tendency ; or rather about this progress , in imperfect beings , from light to liberty . Every thoughtful man will have them . But the conclusion he must admit . And what is more , he must submit to the consequence . The age has come , we believe , which must bring the human character to this great trial . The course of popular education is set , the impulse is given , the progress is commenced ; and nothing can turn it back . As well might a man strive to turn back the progress of the day , because at its dawning he was alarmed at gigantic shadows , cast athwart the landscape , and at the flaming mountain-beacons touched with fire from heaven , and at the dread mutiny and conflict of the powers of light and darkness . The dawning has come ; the day is advancing , and it will move on , through whatever clouds and storms arise , to its noon-tide splendor . But we have yet something further to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the development and action of yet higher principles of social freedom and mutual respect , than have ever been fairly recognised and fully received in any civilized community . Human rights , as they have been admitted in practice if not in theory , have hitherto been very palpable things . They have been rights of property , or of personal security from outward violence and oppression . They have been rights , so to speak , of the body rather than of the mind . For such rights , it is , indeed , that men have fought many a bloody battle . But there is to be another conflict , bloodless perhaps , but bitter and sharp as that of battle , for the rights of the mind . What are they ? We answer ; the toleration of all honest opinions , whether political or religious ; and the claim for that just consideration in society which is chiefly due to character ; to dignity of mind , rather than to dignity of condition ; to personal qualities , rather than to adventitious circumstances . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental , from the progress already made in physical liberty . It does most clearly follow as a matter of argument ; and arguments , it is to he hoped , are every day becoming stronger things with the world than they have been . If they are not , the world is not advancing in intelligence and civilization , and gives itself more credit than it deserves . Suppose , now , to illustrate the argument in question , that society , in its sovereign // and irresistible power , should please to levy upon a certain class of men , who had acquired wealth by free and lawful industry , contributions to the amount of a fourth part of their fortunes . Would not an outcry be immediately raised against this , as most intolerable oppression ? Could the most despotic government do any thing more tyrannical ? But here is a class of men , let it be supposed on the other hand , who , in the free and lawful exercise of their reasoning , have arrived at the possession of certain opinions , political or religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of *theirs , without being able to resist the conclusions to which they have come , they are cut oil ; by society , from that which is dearer than property , their good name ! They are made odious ! Their motives are misrepresented , their virtues decried , their conduct traduced , their private character given into the hands of partisan defamers . Is this a state of freedom ? Is this the liberty which the mind jusdy claims for itself ? Rather , has not the iron of the chain that was broken from the body , entered into the soul ? Has not the work of freedom stopped short of its noblest triumph ? Freedom of opinion is not , indeed , exemption from attack . It is not exemption of any man 's character from fair scrutiny . It leaves open the question whether his opinions are honest ; whether , in other words , they are his opinions , or only pretences , or mere suggestions of interest , which to his own imagination he has clothed with the character of opinions . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse parties are , as such , to be visited upon them as moral obliquities , if the public press will not respect the sanctity of private and domestic life , if neither reason nor conscience can have any sanctuary in which to act without the fear of this reproach , if this fear is yet bearing down , with paralyzing weight , upon the mind of the whole people ,  --  then , indeed , is there a liberty wherewith the world is to be made free , which is far beyond its present and boasted attainments . Next to the toleration which men will claim for their opinions , the consideration which they will demand in society is deserving of attention . Indeed , whether we choose to examine it or not , the subject is forced upon our attention , and it presents itself as a subject full of difficulty . There is , from the very nature of things , a relation of inequality in society , which can not be removed from it . It is involved in the very // condition of parents and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employers and the employed . But there are tokens too obvious to be mistaken , that even this necessary relation is passing through some important changes , that men are not satisfied to have it continue to be what it has been , that one class is demanding a consideration and influence greater than it has heretofore possessed . There are popular ebullitions and revolutionary movements , more or less violent , in all the free countries throughout Christendom : the demand for improved constitutions in Prussia and in many of the German States , the change of government and the abolition of the hereditary peerage in France , the reform bill in England , which sprung from the general intelligence of the people , though it is advocated in higher quarters ,  --  and finally , there are , in our own country , combinations of the employed to procure higher wages , political working-men 's parties , and fearful signs of resistance to the highest authority in the Federal Union . Nor is this change passing only upon a large scale , where we can survey it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere matter of speculation . It is coming home to our cities , and villages , and very dwellings . Aristocratical influence , and magisterial power , and parental authority , too , have been declining among us ever since the Revolution . There are abolitions of peerages in our towns ; there are reform bills in our families ; and our children are educated so freely , as to threaten rebellions , if not combinations for securing their rights . There are , indeed , tendencies of this sort , which must be controlled and regulated , or society can not exist ; tendencies to a radical reform , so radical , indeed , that if not restrained it will tear up every social institution by the roots , and leave nothing behind but disorder , waste , and ruin . But we confess , without intending to say any thing paradoxical , that we look to the very power which has given the impulse , to *control it . That power , undoubtedly , is education , the diffusion of knowledge , the spread , among nations , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of governments . Education , at present , is imperfect , and its result crude . The world , thus far , has only that little knowledge which is a dangerous thing ; ' and deeper knowledge and reflection will sober it again . ' But this topic will more properly fall under our consideration , when we come to examine the // kind of education , which will be necessary for the support and security of free institutions . All we say , at present , is , that knowledge , spread as it never was before among mankind , is tending to the development of new , and higher and more generous ideas of liberty . But if the effect of this is to modify even the natural and essential relations of society , we shall not hesitate to say , that the artificial distinctions which exist in the old world can not stand before it . As the relation of man to man becomes more and more intellectual and moral , the feudal relation of noblemen and peasants , lords and commoners , must decline and verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or can safely take place , we undertake not to decide . It will probably be hastened to its consummation with a rapidity much beyond what prudent men will desire . But that . it should sooner or later come , is what , as good republicans , . we can scarcely be expected to regret . Let hereditary aristocracies go where the French peerage has gone , and where every institution , that tramples upon the essential rights of human nature , ought to go . One of these rights , as we insist , and we believe that the educated world will come to see it , is a right to such respect , to such visible respect in society , as every man 's talents , acquisitions and virtues deserve . The desire of this , the desire of esteem , in other words , is one of the original principles of human nature . It is more truly original and natural than the desire of property . The object it strives for is as truly valuable as property .. The respect of society is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever class of men , therefore , or whatever institution , treads upon these just and honorable feelings of our nature , upon these well-earned treasures of the mind , invades our personal liberty . In a just appreciation of this claim , it is ' not too much to say , we would rather that society should take one fourth part of our annual income and cast it into the highway , than to take one fourth of our personal respectability and cast it down to be trodden under the feet of a privileged order . That there must be distinctions in society , we freely admit ; but we have a right to demand that these distinctions shall be graduated as nearly as possible to the principles of human nature , and to the claims of individual merit . Let talent laboriously cultivated , let wealth honestly earned , let virtue // sacredly cherished , each have its distinction . But let not all , and more than all the honors due to all these , be conferred upon an order of men , whose whole claim lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of privileged descent . It is a serious injury to both classes . It goes , so far as it goes towards completeness , to des*truy in both the spring of individual responsibility . But it is , above all , a heinous oppression and a crying injustice to the one class , for which in the social system nothing short of necessity should be pleaded . This tyrant 's plea , we know , is liberally used ; but it seems never to get any farther towards distinct argument , than to be a great fear that some great evil will arise , from the abolition of hereditary distinctions . The only specific and intelligible argument that we have ever heard in their favor , is one which truly ought not to be delivered in rough and plain dealing prose , but in smooth and flowing verse . It is the poetic argument , and the fine sentiments in which it deals are these : that there are feelings of veneration implanted in the human breast ; that these feelings need objects ; that these objects are provided in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerate arrangement , a most kind provision , and it is only necessary to be on the side of those receiving this homage , instead of those rendering it , to find the system very acceptable . But we correct ourselves . The high-minded nobleman would say to many a fawning sycophant , with the angel in the vision of the apocalypse , I am thy fellow-servant ; worship God . ' There are , indeed , sentiments of veneration in the human hei*rt ; but they are too holy to be given to any thing but human virtue and heavenly glory ; and that men are led to reverence these , by paying homage to an idle , vain , haughty and often licentious nobility , will be a truth strange and hard to learn . It may be thought that we have not done justice to the poetic argument . We have stated it quite too abstractly , too coldly , with too rigid an adherence to the exact truth . Those noble mansions , it may be said , models of architecture for the whole country ; those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fine old castles , whose walls and towers bear inscribed upon them the history of centuries ; those names which they bear , names which are written in glorious annals , and are themes of national pride and glorymng ,  --  what high associations must they not keep alive with past // times ! What powerful effects must they not have in elevating the sentiments and refining the taste of a people ! We do not doubt that , as travellers , we could very much admire these things . We are not disposed to deny that some real advantages may he derived from them . We are willing to admit that they may on the whole have been useful in a state of the world and of society , much more imperfect than that to which we are looking . And yet we must confess that our candid admissions and our poetic associations are very much held in check by our recollections of the game laws and of the corn laws , and of all the oppression connected with them . Nor is the spectacle of one majestic seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent mind can very satisfactorily repose . We are not without sympathy in this feeling , and that too from a quarter little likely to produce it . When an Earl of Leicester was complimented upon the completion of his great design at Holkham , hd replied , It is a melancholy thing to stand alone in one 's country . I look round ; not a house is to be seen but mine . I am the Giant of Giant-Castle , and have eat up all my neighbors. ' * But the great objection against this system , we repeat , is its essential injustice . Itis an invasion , in fact , of the right of property , since it is based upon entails . But it is an invasion of rights dearer than those of property . If it could be shown that it is nevertheless useful , if such an anomaly in Providence could be made out , as the permanent utility of injustice , we should pause with a doubt , deeper than any distrust of our immediate argument . But we do not believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in this particular instance . We believe that a people is not elevated , but degraded by the homage which it pays to the mere outward condition of a class placed above it . We believe that there is more envy than respect , more exasperation than regard , either affectionate or reverential , in the feelings of such a people ; and that the case must be worse and worse , as the general mind becomes more and more intelligent . We firmly believe , too , that God never designed that this should be the relation in which his creatures should stand to each other ; and that it is not the condition most favorable to their improvement // and virtue . We allow , at the same time , that the relation of equality is one which involves many difficulties ; but we believe that it was intended that through these difficulties , men should work out a more perfect state of society , a truer respect for one another , a juster regard for the real glory of human kind , and a condition , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmony , than the world has yet seen , or is likely to see , till the only right , the Christian basis , is adopted , and till it bears its just and legitimate fruit . Far enough are we from saying that this happy result is yet witnessed among ourselves . All we can say is , that we are placed at the right school . We are learners , and have yet almost every thing to learn . What we have learned , however , renders it impossible that we should ever go back to the wornout systems of feudal discipline for improvement and happiness . But if popular education is an engine so powerful , and is producing such immense effects upon the political and social condition of the world , and is to produce yet greater effects , it needs to be regulated and managed with the utmost skill and prudence . The character which this education should receive , can not be a sul ? ject of too deep and anxious attention . If it were not to threaten our readers with too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , that we had designed the observations already made , to be preliminary to this great subject . We will not , however , despair altogether of their patience , while we endeavor to compress within as small a compass as we are able , some leading views of what we consider to be a safe and sound popular education . It was stated in the public prints , not long since , on the authority of a French writer , whose name , however , is not given , that the departments in France which are the most enlightened and send the greatest number of children to the schools , do yet produce the greakest number of criminals ; and that the most moral of the departments are those which send the fewest children to the schools . ' In order to judge fairly of these results , provided they are truly stated , it would be necessary to know more than is told us of the precise local condition , population , wealth and moral exposures , of these contrasted departments . But , leaving the questions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have introduced the statement , for the sake of distinctly admitting that // mere education , considered without reference to the sort of education , is not enough . We are far from saying , that the social safety and prosperity of any people is to be measured by the number of schools alone . We look with equal solici .. tude to the character of these schools . Knowledge , simply considered , is nothing but power . And knowledge that is crude and imperfect ; that is mechanical , being rather an implement in the hands of the mind , than the culture of the mind itself ; or that is speculative , being blended with no moral influences ,  --  such knowledge is a dangerous power . The idea too much prevails among us , that schools have a kind of talismanic virtue to promote and preserve free institutions . We are every way placing too implicit a reliance upon outward means and props ; upon Constitutions , and Elections , and the Trial by Jury , and we repeat it , upon schools . We should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with temporary failure in France , provided the lesson were thereby taught , that something more than bare education is necessary to train up a people to that free and happy condition , for which all enlightened nations are seeking . Popular education , to answer its purpose , must possess a certain , definite character . And the requisites which make up this character of useful and safe popular education , must , as we conceive , be these . It must be thorough ; it must be practical ; and it must be moral . Thorough , we say , in the first place . We would meet the alarmist , on this subject , in the very outset . We would touch with a decided hand , the very point of his apprehension . Thorough education , we say , is the only safe education . Regard the diffusion of knowledge as we will , whether with fear or with favor , this is the only reasonable conclusion to which either way of viewing it can lead us . If the light could have been shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , with such dangers only as belong to darkness . But the light has broken through all the barriers , whether of jealous power , or of scholastic monopolies ; the eyes of men are opened to behold it ; and we might as well undertake to bar the gates of the morning , as to keep it out , or to shut again the eyes that have once seen it . Instead , therefore , of setting up temporary and local defences , frail screens , to resist this spread of knowledge , it is better thoroughly to study its laws , fully to understand its nature and // its requisitions , and as fast as possible to adjust the relations of society and the principles of government to this new condition . A new element has entered into the process of civilization , and mankind must he taught , by the most thorough instruction possible , how to use it . This , we repeat , is the only sound policy on any hypothesis . If popular education he a good thing , if it he the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the more safety there is , then let its aid he welcomed and employed , to the utmost extent . But , even if we regarded it as a wild heast that had broken into the pale of Christendom , and which could neither be driven out nor destroyed , we should think the only policy would be , to tame and to train it to useful purposes . Whatever opinion , therefore , a man may entertain concerning the tendencies of modern civilization , we can not think that he properly understands the age in which he lives , if he find nothing to do hut to rail against and ridicule it . Grant that there are things enough around us on which to exercise the weapons of wit and sarcasm , such weapons can no more avail to resist ' the liberal cause , than would arrows to stop the sun in his course . The cause of education must take its trial ; and it requires all the soher judgment there is in every country to bring the trial to a safe and happy issue . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial is safest , in being thorough . The danger , in fact , lies not in a thorough , hut in a superficial education . The alarm , we are aware , of many theorists is , lest the people should know toq much ; but the just fear , in our apprehension , is that they will know too little . Whether as applied to the social or political relations of man , this seems to us to be true , and the true answer to the common objections against a liberal system of popular education . It is objected , for instance , against carrying the education of the poor and laboring classes beyond the simplest rudiments , of knowledge , that such a course will make them discontented with their sphere , will unfit them for their situation , will fill their heads with erroneous ideas of their place and duty , will puff them up with pride and arrogance . If increased facilities for improvement should awaken in some a reasonable desire to improve their condition , and should lead a few from the humbler walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which no liberal mind , surely , will object . But the bad // effects alleged , do not arise , as we contend , from thorough , but from superficial education . It is not because men are too much educated , but because they are not enough or not rightly educated , that they become too proud for their employments . Who has not observed that this sort of sensitiveness and discontent , this fear of being degraded by what are called menial toils , this narrow-minded jealousy of their superiors , is extremely apt to manifest itself in the most ignorant persons ? The very thing which such persons want is more knowledge . It is not to be made more ignorant , but to be made more intelligent . Besides , we must again remind the objector , that it is not a question about theory , but a matter of fact , that is presented to us . What the people have learned can not be unlearned . The case of partial knowledge is the case in hand , and we must make the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best that we can make of partial and imperfect knowledge is to make it more thorough and complete . Give us , we would say , if we were to speak as employers ; give us intelligent persons to deal with . Deliver us from testy , suspicious , narroxv-minded ignorance . Real knowledge moreover is itself a great resource for the mind . It gives more content to the humblest state , than any degree of observance could . It also draws to it a real respect , which is more valuable , and which is felt to be more valuable , than any homage that is ever paid to mere splendor of fortune . It brings the different classes of society to the truest and noblest equality * and there are beautiful instances which every one may have observed in real life , where the regard between individuals of the different classes is so mutual , that it is difficult to say , which respects the other most . Yes , it is the beautiful Christian law , and the Christian type of heaven . Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D.iogenes was once sold as a slave ; and his noble behavior not only won his master 's regard , but the highest place in his household . iEsop too , and Epictetus , were originally slaves . And even Socrates was not only born in a humble condition , but for some time pursued the calling of his father ; till the adn*iration of Crito called him to the high seats of philosophy . This is a subject at once of so much difficulty and of so much imnportance , that we shall be pardoned , we trust , for dwelling on it a moment longer . The greatest difficulty , among us , in social life , is occasioned by misconceptions of the // nature of domestic service . We say , by misconceptions ; for knowledge ,  --  we still insist ,  --  enlargement of mind , reflection , is precisely the thing that is wanted . Of the strength of feeling which prevails on this subject , some idea may be formed , by one or two letters published last year in the New England Farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighboring review . A person , representing himself as a parent , there says , that he would rather follow his daughters to the grave , than send them into the kitchens of his wealthy neighbors . The idea , of course , is , that this domes-. tic relation implies , on the one part , extreme degradation . But so do we not conceive of it , and so will not an enlightened judgment lead any one to consider it . We would protest , as much as the parent in question , against any real degradation . What is the tenor of this relation ? It is a voluntary compact . It is not a feudal service , that is rendered or demanded . It is not any bondage or vassalage , imposed or consented to . It is a compact . It is labor for a compensation . But that is the condition of every man 's industry . The merchant , the manufacturer , the professional man is laboring for a compensation . Every individual in the active business of life sustains the varying relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The humblest individual , in the course of every month , employs twenty persons to minister to his convenience and comfort . And the highest in function and office is but the servant of all , the servant of the public . If this circle of relations were rightly contemplated , if the mind were disabused of all ideas of feudal distinctions which now perplex the subject of domestic service , if reflection were at work on this subject , and a more intelligent and Christian view were taken of it , we are certain that it would be relieved of many of its difficulties . We doubt not , indeed , that public opinion in general , and private practice in many particular instances , need to be much reformed . But general intelligence and personal refinement will always be found most ready to give respect to real worth in every station , most considerate of the feelings of every fellow-being , and most favorable to a healthful and happy state of all the social and domestic relations . Domestic service must take a new character in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possesses in most other countries ,  --  a character which nothing but intel you . xxxVI. - NO. 78. 12 // ligence can give it . Ignorance is its bane and curse . We would say to those who engage in this employment , Do it deliberately ; do it with reflection ; consider whether you ought to engage in it : if you ought , enter upon it cheerfully , as the lot which Providence assigns you ; fulfil honestly and honorably your contract , not as slaves , but as those who were free to make or not to make the contract ; respect yourselves too much , to show disrespect to others ; act thus , from a feeling of duty , and self-respect , and domestic affection , and be assured that you will be beloved in your turn , and respected , and honored . ' If we turn , now , to the political relations of society , we shall find the same doctrine to apply to them . The popular commotions , the violent and dangerous tumults that are breaking out in so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , indeed , but not by any means of too much knowledge . It is precisely from too little intelligence that they spring ; intelligence itself imperfect , dazzled rather than enlightened , seizing on some just ideas of its rights , but holding them in much ignorance , in strong passion rather than in strong perception ; - intelligence acting , it is true , on a condition of great hardship , and often of that oppression which maketh even the wise man mad . ' There is much apology , indeed , for these ebullitions : there are cases , where nothing , perhaps , but violence will answer the purpose . But looking at the general action of the popular mind at this day , we can not hesitate to believe , that if it were more intelligent , more considerate , more justly informed , it would proceed more soberly and calmly to its object ,  --  to the attainment of those political advantages which it is seeking . It would see that gradual amelioration is better than rash amendment , at the expense of turmoil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liable after all to be lost through the very violence with which it is sought . If the public mind were more enlightened , it would understand more of those complicated interests which are to be affected by great political changes , and it would he proportionally cautious and moderate . It would feel a juster confidence , also , in the power of enlightened public opinion , a power which , it is certain that nothing can long resist . The disposition to disturb the tenure of property , which is so constantly apprehended to prevail in the poorer classes of the community both at home and abroad , is , if it really exist , // emphatically the offspring of ignorance . It can not be the permanent interest of any one to do this wrong ; and the desire to do it , therefore , can only spring from the rashest and blindest of impulses . To destroy the frame of society , only to roam lawless through it , for a day , can be the wish but of a fool . Property is valuable only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rationally , who intelligently desires it , must desire its security . The members of any class , therefore , who , by legislation or combination , by menace , coercion , or the force of numbers , would , either directly or indirectly , assail the possessions of the rich , are but putting into the hands of successive combinations , a whip to scourge their own folly . We know not , with the exception of the learned professions , whether all the branches of business are not rewarded in a pretty nearly equal proportion ; for it is to be remembered , that where there are great fortunes , there are proportionally great hazards and many failures ; and truly , whatever the fact may speak for the credit of the country , there are no classes that we are aware og who have more occasion to strike work than physicians , lawyers , and the clergy . Indeed , we believe , that resort to combination ,  --  to pursue the topic one moment longer ,  --  and that all the machinery of partisan xvarfare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion as the body of the people are more thoroughly educated and enlightened . An intelligent and reflecting man does not like to he marshalled in any party phalanx , to follow the leading-staff of whomsoever chances to hold it . It is too much the disposition of many such persons to retire from all political agitations ,  --  a disposition , it can not be too emphatically said , in which they ought not to indulge . But it is a case , at any rate , which clearly falls in with the view that we are taking of the effects of knowledge , and of the influence , particularly , of superior information , and culture of mind . This is not an influence that is likely to form political agitators . Let any one select from the common walks of life , from the undistinguished mass of the community , ten of the best educated , most intelligent and reflecting men he knows , and compare them with ten men , if he can find them , who can not read ; and then let him decide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuation , any torrent of numbers that was sweeping all before it ; upon whose sobriety , consideration and calmness , he would most rely in any // great and perilous national crisis . The force of numbers , which is the dangerous force in all free communities ,  --  the power of combinations , in other words ,  --  must inevitably decline , as the power of intellect increases and is spread among the whole body of the people . And we would venture the remark , that , in many parts of our country , and in those especially which are most distinguished for the progress of knowledge , it is more difficult to carry on a systematic course of electioneering operations now , than it was ten or twenty years ago ; that such measures for controlling the popular choice will meet with more resistance than they formerly did , and that this resistance will be chiefly found in the sense and self-respect of the better educated , more independent and intelligent minds of the mass of the people . The next requisite in a sound and wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be practical . The only knowledge which seems to furnish an exception to the general principle which we have been maintaining in this article ,  --  the only knowledge which has not sought freedom , is scholastic knowledge . That flourished in a feudal age ; no other , indeed , could have borne it . But it will not suffice for times like ours . The liberated and free mind of the age is demanding that knowledge shall be applied to use , and no other than this practical knowledge can fulfil the designs of an enlightened freedom . By practical education we do not mean , merely or chiefly , that which is to be employed upon machinery , or upon the improvement of soils , or upon any other physical improvements , highly valuable and important as all these applications of knowledge undoubtedly are . It is that education which bears upon the machinery of the human mind , which is most truly practical ,  --  that which breaks up C the fallow ground ' of the human heart ,  --  that which brings forth the fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doubt whether this great , and ultimate , and truly practical end of all education is distinctly and sufficiently kept in view . Is it common , we are tempted to ask , - we know that there are instances ,  --  but is it common for the teacher of our youth , when entering upon the discharge of his duties , to say with himself ,  --  ' now , my business is to do what is in my power to rear up for society intelligent and virtuous men and women ; - it is not merely to make good arithmeticians // or grammarians , good readers or writers , good scholars who shall do themselves and me credit at an examination ,  --  this , indeed , I have to do ;  --  but it is still farther , to make good members of society , good parents and children , good friends and associates ; to make the community around me wiser and happier for my living in it : - my labor , in fine , must be , to engraft upon these youthful minds that love of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor useful , nor fitted for the greatest duties , and without which , indeed , all their acquisitions will soon drop like untimely blossoms from the tree of life ? ' The blossoms , indeed ,  --  to carry out the figure ,  --  must fall ; but that they may not be untimely , that they may produce fruit , there must be formed within them a germ . That germ in the human mind is the love of knowledge , is the intellectual habit that will lead to further acquisitions . Without this , education , and that which is often called the most finished education , is to little purpose . The actual knowledge acquired in our schools must necessarily , the most of it , pass away from the memory . The largest proportion of those who have studied in our colleges , after the lapse of ten or twenty years , know very little of Greek or Latin , of the Mathematics or the Natural Sciences ; and if they have gained from their studies no habits of thought , of discrimination , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally thrown away . But to return to our common schools : there is still too much , *we apprehend , that is scholastic in them . School-boy knowledge is still too much a mystery ; a thing necessary to be acquired , but without any distinct and assignable reason , on the part of the pupil or the parent , or any reason assigned and kept in view on the part of the teacher . Geography , as generally taught , is still a science too technical and dry ; arithmetic is attended with too little demonstration ; and grammar is as dark , to multitudes of pupils , as cabalistic lore . The direct connexion of all this with some useful object , either in life or in mental culture , should he continually pointed out . The child is father of the man ; ' and the child can no more study , zealously and effectively , without some useful end in view , than the man . May not the government and instruction of a school , also , be such as will constantly appeal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils , and indeed , to all those@@183058210.txt Degerando says , in the 208th page of this translation , There is nothing good which we may not expect from the generosity of this age , and the enthusiasm which is peculiar to it. * On no subject can this generosity and enthusiasm be applied more profitably , or more honorably , than in efforts to improve the condition of the poor ; and to prevent the Causes of pauperism . The efforts of past times have been directed to the relief , not to the prevention of misery . The duties , which are beginning to be felt and to be performed , are to know causes ; and knowing these , to apply means to the far better purpose of banishing , than of relieving . Degerando writes of pauperism as it is seen in great cities in Europe . All his remarks are not applicable to this country . He writes , too , with an amiable enthusiasm , which does his heart the highest credit . Whether he can inspire equal enthusiasm in his readers , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling respect for him , nor without wishing to be as good and charitable as he seems to be . The author of this work is said ( in the Encyclopmdia Americana ) to be a native of the city of Lyons , born in 1770 ; to have been much in favor with Napoleon ; to have held important state offices under him ; to have been , also , much in favor after the restoration ; to have written the best work which the French possess on the History of Philosophy . His last work is that by which he is most known in this country , translated and presented to the public by the title of ' Self Education , or the Means and Art of Moral Progress . ' // The volume now to be noticed is said , by the translator , not to comprise several parts of the original , which were thought to be inapplicable to this country . It may be inferred from the introduction ( written by the Reverend Dr. Tuckerman ) , that some latitude has been taken in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American readers . The introduction was intended to give effect to the thoughts of Degerando ; in which purpose the writer appears to us to have been entirely successful . His experience among the poor qualifies him , eminently , to speak of their wants , and of the duties of other classes to them . We can not , on this occasion , enter into a discussion of the causes of pauperism , nor of the means of prevention and relief . This is a most comprehensive subject ; and one of peculiar interest in this country . Americans ought , while they can , to attempt the mastery of this difficult matter , embracing , as it does , political and moral considerations of the greatest importance . There is yet a wide difference between the pauperism of the new , and that of the old world . The latter arises from inequalities of condition , founded in long-enduring political and moral causes , which are unknown here . There are here many , and there will be more causes of pauperism , than there need to be ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . The causes of inequality are necessarily fewer here than in Europe . The right of ruling brings no riches in its exercise ; military glory secures no wealth ; the church has no benefices ; a favored individual of a family does not inherit all , to preserve the family name and dignity . Here wealth is acquired by talent and industry , and sometimes by unexpected good turns . It is lost with great facility , and in a few years , by successive descents , it is scattered and dissipated . Here poverty is less depraved and odious , than in Europe . It is seldom hopeless , despairing , desolate . The poorest man 's son may hope to be something . But till every one is free from vice , ignorance , and misfortune ; or until the whole community make common stock like the shaking quakers ; or until the care of the whole community is assumed by the Government , and all the citizens are merely agents for the community , as happened in Sparta , there will be poverty , suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives to the care of the poor are twofold . // 1 . hiterest. 2 . Duty ; which , in fact , is only another name for interest . The rich and the poor are connected by numerous ties . This is not apparent in single cases , but is so when many cases are taken together . Whether the whole number of the poor are moral , and sufficiently informed to know in what their best interests lie , is a touching inquiry to the wealthy ; and equally so to the poor , to know , whether the wealthy understand and provide for their necessary relation to them . As the resources of the poor are easily exhausted ; as the calamity of long-continued winter , or prevailing sickness , soon brings them to craving want , the good of the whole demands provision against suffering , violence , and crime . But , besides these calls , there are duties of humanity from which the well informed and considerate can not , and would not , excuse themselves . Nor would they lose the pleasure of affording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor , which Degerando proposes , is not called for in our country , as in some of the cities of Europe ; yet even in our cities and great towns , there is abundant room for the exercise of charity . But we are wandering from the prescribed purpose , which is no more than to make a brief examination of this little volume , leaving it to the good sense of the reader to apply the general character of the work , by his own knowledge of the wants of society , and by his own perception of duty in ministering to these wants . And first , of the introduction we have to remark , that until the generosity ' and enthusiasm , ' on which Degerando relies , shall become more common than they now are , it will be the safest course for all who would benefit the poor , to employ such agents as Dr. Tuckerman . If they have not the taste nor inclination to visit the poor themselves , they may have the assurance that their bounties will be well applied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is severe labor for one , or even for many . Degerando means to show that such labors should be common to many . The first chapter is entitled , Aim and Character of Charity . ' He divides society into three classes : those who have the superfluities of life ; those whose resources are nearly balanced by those necessities which stimulate to labor ; those whose // pressing wants can not be entirely satisfied by their own in- industry . The first and third classes he connects together , and attempts to show , throughout his work , that while the latter may be relieved and made better , the former may be gratified and improved . Though this philanthropist may be thought to be somewhat in advance of his age , and eVen fanciful , yet all who can appreciate him will agree , that alms-giving , which is by many considered to be the whole of charity , is but a small part of it . He says , it even contradicts , and sometimes destroys the intended *fl'ect of charity . ' The second chapter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits of long experience . He discriminates among the contrivances and frauds which are sometimes practised , and the real claims to charitable relief . He discloses a knowledge which might be put to profitable use among us , and which few , but professional ministers , have used to much extent . Every part of this chapter is abundant in rules , which those , who would copy Degerando in his benevolent labors , may study with advantage . The Classification of the Poor ' is the title of the third chapter . Herein he supposes , that the visiter of the poor has exactly ascertained existing wants ; their nature and extent ; - and considers the great secret of charity to be the art of proportioning it to the necessities of poverty . The whole chapter is devoted to rules and illustrations , which must have been drawn from actual observation of the miseries which may be found in such a city as Paris . Happily , all of them may not apply among us . But whoever intends to become a visiter ' will find this chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virtues of the Poor , ' is , perhaps , the most interesting in the book . He properly gives little credit to the affluent , and the easy , for their virtues . He shows how beautiful and admirable virtue is in those who are overwhelmed by reverses of fortune , by the disdain of the rich ; exiled from society ; banished , as if to a desert , in the midst of cities ; every thing hostile ; and when the very affections of nature become the source of keenest suffering . We can not forbear to extract something from this chapter , in honor of human nature under most distressing visitations. // I have seen a well born young lady , whom the reverses of her family had plunged into indigence , after having been reduced for subsistence to the labor of her hands , attacked by a cancer . She suffered acute pains . Every thing failed her . She had not eveii linen , with which to dress her wounds . She had not even a bed to repose upon in her agony . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she felt that her strength was declining . She had no other prospect of relief , than the tomb open to receive her . But not a complaint escaped her lips . Her countenance was serene and gentle , and her calmness was not impaired a single moment , till the hour of her release . I have seen also a mother of six children , extended , night and day , upon a little straw in a garret , with a fatal ulcer , which was destroying her , and not able to give bread to those poor little beings , who were weeping around her . In her own husband , too , who ought to have been her consolation and support , she had an additional subject of cutting sorrow ; and she was thus supporting , at the same time , the sufferings of body and soul . But she supported them with an unalterable sweetness , pardoning even the unworthy husband , who aggravated her woes , instead of relieving them ; and who abused the succors destined for her , and consumed them himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forsaken widows occupying a nook so low and narrow , that one could scarce enter it , and having no other light than what came from the stair-case , and there waiting the immense favor of entering into a hospital ; ( for such is the great and supreme ambition , such the object of the wishes of a great num ber . ) And alas ! - how many desire it in vain , and can not obtain it ! -I have seen miseries which pass all belief , and physical tortures united with the most pressing wants and painful privations ; and all these endured by martyrs of patience , without aid , hope , or witness ; submitting to the Divine will . Where are crowns worthy of such triumphs ? What tenderness mingles with our respect , when we think , that the beings called to display such courage are feeble women , and old men , already exhausted by long trials ! In some families of the indigent , you will see the most touching examples of conjugal love , and of all the domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to support their children , and widows who can not be consoled for the loss of their husbands . Lately we have been witnesses of a touching struggle between an aged mother and her daughter , herself the mother of a numerous family . The mother had asked to be received into a hospital , and insisted upon obtaining this favor , in order not to be a // burden , in her last days , with the infirmities she foresaw for herself ; , to a family already very much straitened . The daughter warmly solicited a refusal for her mother , desiring to take care of her herself , when this care should become necessary ; and only counting as pleasures , the sacrifices which she imposed upon herself to fulfil this pious duty . An old soldier , made infirm by his wounds , with his wife and numerous children , had been taken home by a simple workman , the brother-in-law of the wife , who shared with them the fruits of his labor . This estimable man was killed . A few crowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the procuring of a distinct grave , to receive the mortal remains of their benefactor , over which they often go to pray in memory of him . ' This chapter is rich in beautiful moral lessons , on the effect that may be produced on favored mortals , from becoming acquainted with the real miseries which are common in the world . But there is another and far different picture in the fifth chapter , entitled Vices and Moral Amelioration of the Poor . ' The various classes of the vicious poor are here described ; and a mournful exhibition of nature it is . It is seen in this , how greatly the miseries of poverty are aggravated by vice . But the humane writer 's object is to show , that the utmost tenderness is due even to these unfortunate beings ; and that they are frequently the more entitled to compassion and charity , from their very vicer . He shows , that among this class may be found many on whom charity may perform its most beneficent labor ; and startles one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life depends on circumstances , which the degraded could not control ; but which the thoughtful and charitable might easily prevent . Assuming , as he well may , that he has convinced the visiter ' of his duties , and inspired the will to perform them , Degerando has yet other important instruction to give in his sixth chapter , entitled Means of obtaining the Confidence of the Poor . ' Throughout this part of the volume are found illustrations of his knowledge of the human heart , under all the varieties of sorrow and distress . The seventh chapter is entitled Education of the Children of the Poor , ' and is devoted to showing the moral and social effects of education . It applies less to our country , than to that in which the blessing of free schools is unknown . The // object appears to be to induce individuals to render that benefit , which is provided here at the public ' charge . Still there is ample scope for the benevolence of the visiter , in this respect , among us . This will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this chapter . I have known , I think , more than a thousand poor families ; and , in not a few of these families , I have found a great insensibility to the importance of availing themselves of the means which they have for the education of their children . But I have never known a poor and ignorant parent withhold his child from our schools , or express unwillingness that he should go to them , from " a jealousy that the child would thus be raised above him . " Some of the poor children , who are seen in our streets , were brought to the city by their parents at an age at which they were too old for the primary , and could not read well enough for admission into the grammar schools . Some are truants . Some have been taken from school , that they might earn what they could for the families to which they belong ; and , having lost the employment obtained for them , have fallen into vagrancy . And some are children of inefficient , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education of their children , and who leave them exposed to every contaminating influence , only because they are themselves too ignorant , or too obdurate , to perceive the value of the good they so lightly estimate . If any visiter of the poor shall be led , by the appeals which are here made to him , to the benevolent enterprise of saving one or more of the poor children among us , who are now on the brink of ruin , I think he will find them to belong to one or another of the above-named classes ; and that the difficulty with which he will have to contend , in his intercourse with the parents , will not be " a jealousy , " in any one , " that his son may surpass him ; " but , either a most painful lack of parental sensibility ; or , a strong claim of interest in the immediate labors of which children are capable ; or , inability in the parent to control the child ; or , the disqualification of the child for admission into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vicious children in our city is , that a greatly increased interest has recently been excited in the cause of their salvation ; and a just perception of the causes of the condition in which we find them is important , in view of the measures which are to be taken for their rescue . ' The benevolent author does not content himself with prescribing the duties of instruction to children . He pursues the subject into employments which follow , as apprenticeships , // and trades , and other occupations , in which , however , he expects more of visiters ' than is likely to be obtained , until these humane duties shall receive greater attention than has hitherto been given to them . There is one part of this chapter which deserves great consideration , and which applies , in some places in our country , as decidedly as it does in France . The development of industry , in certain countries , has produced a great demand even for very young children , who are emplo.yed in manual labor that requires neither much vigor , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of these little creatures . They are exhausted by fatigue ; they neither leave them time for school , nor for rest ; hardly enough to eat a hasty morsel , or to take hurried sleep . These little creatures languish with exhaustion ; and their health suffers as much as their characters and education . Yet the pressing wants of some parents , the cupidity of others , and the want of foresight in many , deliver up these young creatures to this fatal regimen . This abuse has been carried so far in England , that an express law was required for its suppression ; a bill was passed , a year ago , to regulate the maximum of the task which should be imposed upon children in manufactories . In France , though some workshops have presented so sad a spectacle , we hope the legislative authority will not be necessary to restrain it , and that the power of manners , and the authority of public opinion , will be sufficient to arrest the evil in its birth . However , the friend who watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who is employed in a manufactory , that he may not be exposed to become the victim of excessive fatigue . The capacity and skill of a child must not be measured by the money he earns . In certain places , a child can earn from two to three francs a day by picking up bones for the fabrication of animal carbon ; but what will he have learned ? It is often the most false speculation , as to the real interest of a family , to be too hasty in obtaining profit from the labor of these little creatures ; in that as in many other things , it is sacrificing the future to the present . ' The eighth chapter treats of Begging . ' In many parts of Europe , begging is an important branch of business , in which many ingenious and capable persons are highly accomplished . In this country , this occupation is comparatively rare . Travellers who have passed through* // Ireland , England , France and Italy , are more struck with the absence of street begging , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . So far as beggars are known among us , the observations in this chapter have some application . But , probably , not in those which relate to the complicated frauds and deceptions , *Igainst which this chapter is intended to warn . Other observations , applicable to real objects of charity , are as just here as in Europe , excepting that the objects are much fewer . The author discourages giving money to beggars . He recommends that whenever such sopplication occurs , the party should be required to make known his place of abode , and should be visited there ; that the truth or falsehood of the statements made should be inquired into ; and that the proper charity which the case demands should follow . This is said to be a practice among many of our benevolent citizens , and is , no doubt , the most proper and satisfactory course . lines deleted // In certain emergencies , such benevolent persons obey the call . There are charitable societies among us , the members of which deserve the highest praise . If they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been excessive in this city . It must be admitted , however , that the kind of charity thus applied is limited to relief , and falls far short of the meaning of the word charity , as used by this writer . We see no better mode of accomplishing the comprehensive schemes of this philanthropist , in the present state of our community , than to confide to employed agents the duty and the responsibility of visiters . ' This implies , of course , that those who have not the leisure , nor the inclination to visit personally , should furnish such agents with all the means which their employment requires . The inducements to supply these means will he greatly strengthened , by learning from this volume the uses which can be made of means , by those who understand the true purposes and duties of charity . The eleventh chapter treats of ' the Advantages to be reaped by the Visiter of the Poor . ' It presents charity in a new and interesting light . The benefit of charitable acts , to the indigent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we find charity commended for the good it does , not to the object of the bounty , but to those from whom it moves . The visiting of the poor is here represented as a school for valuable instruction , in the purposes of human life ; as a means of self-esteem , self-gratulation , and of grateful pleasure , which can not be derived from any other source . A few extracts will disclose what the author means by the good which the charitable can do to themselves . My friend A- is an honest man , who annoys and injures no one ; and , having a great talent for business , has given himself up to it , all his life . Living like all the world , he was accustomed to breakfast , dine , sleep , read his newspaper , and cultivate the relations of society . He did not himself suspect the ordinary nature of his existence , the frozen temperature of the atmosphere he breathed . He fulfilled his external duties , went punctually to church every Sunday , ( for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrets of moral life , the high destinies of our nature , the sublimer vocation of man . The maxims of sages , upon this matter , seemed to him an idle specu // lation ; he smiled at the illusion of those who raise themselves to these ideas . As to himself ; he had no time to lose in philosophizing . But one day I proposed to him to accompany me in a visit I was going to make . He could not go ; he had an appointment ; the order of his day could not be deranged ; besides , could not I do better than he ? He begged me to take charge of what he had to bestow . I persuaded him , however , and , though a little out of humor , he went with me . We entered into conversation with this family , which had also its own business , which he made them explain to him . I left him without his perceiving it , in the midst of the afflicted circle . He gave useful counsels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he obtained their confidence , and had the happiness to render a service . A few days after , I met him , and made my apologies for having taken him away from his business . But he was no longer the same man ; the expression of his countenance was changed . He was more affectionate than I had been accustomed to see him . His conversation took another direction , and he asked me various questions about the objects of our solicitude . He had discovered something new in life ; he had begun to conceive that man is not created , and put into the world , merely to make an establishment , and live at his ease , in peace with his neighbors . There was a hook on his table . He had discovered that there is another , superior region , whose influences ennoble and animate the monotonous existence of earthly interest . I knew Mrs. - to be an amiable and gentle woman ; her house was ever attractive , and her purse open to the poor . But serious conversation wearied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing should go on of itself ; her children were at a boarding-school . Dress and company cheated time of its languor . The excitement of pulpit eloquence , when there was any , interested her ; but she relished serious reading little I solicited this lady to accompany me in one of my visits . Nothing seemed more impossible ; dust and filth inspired her with insuperable disgust ; rude manners were her antipathy . I did , however , obtain what seemed impossible . The next morning , I found her by the bed of the invalid she had visited with me . She had returned , of her own accord , and without me . But this was not all . The employment of her time was soon changed ; her husband found her more attentive and affectionate ; the education of her children awakened in her more interest ; her friends soon discovered a new expression of sensibility in her conversation ; and what a guardian had this poor family found ! I had visited it more than once , had inquired of the // neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to learn , and provided what I intended to procure : I was only obliged to warn her to be economical in her bounty . ' One young friend of mine was frivolous and fond of pleasure1 and less afraid of dissipation than ennui : he had natural talents , but was too indolent to study . He had good qualities , and was a devoted friend , l ) ut wasted all his time . Another of the same age was dissipated and prodigal , ostentatious and vain , and wasted his property . Can visiters of the poor be made out of such subjects ? I tried : the former followed me without reflecting , but soon his good heart enlightened his reason , and he came to himself : the latter would not hesitate to do a proper and worthy thing , but his vanity soon became a proper sense of character . How did these changes come about ? Iu the first instance , surprise and almost horror was awakened in a man ignorant of the great trials Providence sends on man . He discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had vaguely suspected , he was unwilling to define to himself . But the voice of God 's creatures was heard ; the tears of a widow , the languid eye of an old man , met the eyes of the man of the world , and melted his heart . Questions were asked , and heart-rending details were obtained . Faculties and powers , till then slumbering , were waked up in the soul of the man of the world : his mind became concentrated , and he returned pensive to involuntary meditation . He looked within , and for the first time , his thoughts passed beyond the narrow bounds of present and material things . Soon , the relief he witnessed gave him the idea of a new order of pleasures , and the confidence he inspired acted on him as a sacred engagement . The soul opened to a new order of affections , and he commenced the moral life ,  --  the only real life . The poor man 's house was his school , and benevolence introduced him to the other virtues . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lady , who had much mind , and was thought to have extreme sensibility . She swooned at the recital of an accident : she could not bear to see a tiler on a house ; her table was covered with romances ; no one was more eloquent in expatiating on the interests of humanity ; - she was admired by both sexes . But she was not liberal ; she was not even careful to pay her debts ; her house was in disorder ; no one commended her temper . She neither knew how to diffuse happiness , nor to be happy . She went with me , because it seemed to her a romantic adventure , and was something new . She became simple and natural ; her native generosity was revived and exercised , and happiness awoke within , and around her . ' // The twelfth chapter is devoted to a discussion on the Utility of Associations , for the purpose of performing Charitable Duties . ' In this country , we are familiar with societies . This is so common a mode of effecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems unnecessary to remark on this part of the volume . The thirteenth and last chapter is entitled the Co-operation of Young People in the Establishments of humanity . ' The author endeavors , in this part of his work , to raise charity to the dignity of a science , and to prove that the young should be trained up in the theory and practice of it , as in any other serious employments in life . This subject is well followed out , in illustrating the benefit which the indigent would derive from having the zeal and enthusiasm of youth engaged in their claims ; and the far greater benefit which the young might secure to themselves , from such an engagement . The sum of this chapter is , that happiness in this life is to be found in the conscientious performance of duty ; and that all duty is not done in taking care of one 's self , and one 's own . To inculcate this truth , may be said to be the very moral of this work . But how are the young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he convinced that there are any social duties ? And if convinced , bow are they to he assured that the performance of such duties is a means of rational happiness ? In no way but by a course of education , which teaches the true purposes of life . To those who are so taught , ( and we fear the number of such is very limited ) this translation of Degerando 's book will be a most acceptable instructer and guide ;  --  to such we cordially recommend it . We recommend it not to be read hastily ,  --  nor to be read as though one perusal would impart all that can be learned from it . It is rather to be commended as a book to be studied . And there is no risk in asserting , that any one who does study it will be not only enlightened , but will be a better being , both to live in the world , and to leave it . The lady , who has given Degerando 's work to the American public , deserves their respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste to read the original with pleasure it is , we hope , a deserved compliment to American readers to have believed them fit for , and capable of enjoying , and of profiting by the opportunity of seeing the work in an English version . // We have spent no time in looking for errors , either of language , or of the press . If there be any of either kind , we have not stopped to notice them . On the contrary , the translation appears to us to have been happily executed . If there be any thing to dislike in this book , it is not the fault of the translator ; but of the original work . This , however , is merely matter of taste , and no cause of displeasure to those who are lovers of French eloquence . This , we do not profess to admire in all instances in which we have seen it , in serious subjects . It sometimes has little claim to be eloquence , in the estimation of any but Frenchmen . If this be an objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove it . We should think it a proof of the good sense , and good feeling of the present day , if this volume should be extensively in use . No subject , not connected with civil and religious liberty , and good education and sound morals , is more interesting to this young country , than the subject treated of in this volume . What can be done tojprevent poverty , and the crimes which it engenders ; and in what way can the indigent be most properly treated ? It is easy to answer these questions in a single sentence . Educate all ; set all to work ; provide work for all who can work . No doubt if this were practicable , there would be products of labor enough to diminish the number of the indigent almost to an indiscernible part of the whole mass . But how are these causes of exemption from indigence to be brought into operation ? This question is not so easily answered ; and whatever the eulogists of this fortunate country may justly say , it is beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things will exist . If the poor are relieved according to Degerando 's sense of the word charity , if the causes of pauperism are sought out , and annihilated , the affluent and the independent must do the work . This book tells them how they can do it . When we consider how large a portion of the lives of many is spent in vain , frivolous , and disgusting pursuits ; and also , what a change might be produced among the poor , as well as among those who so spend their lives , we can present no better wish to both parties , than that Degerando 's volume may be found , read , and duly respected , in every family , which is capable of being instructed by it.
