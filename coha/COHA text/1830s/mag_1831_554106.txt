txt Steinthal , or the Ban de Ia Roche , is a small canton hidden in the mountains of the German boundary of France . It belonged to the province of Alsace , which was ceded to Louis XIV . in 1648 , and divided into the departments of Upper and Lower Rhine . La Roche lies in the latter , within a day 's journey of Strasburg . Its area contains about nine thousand acres of land , constituting two parishes ; the Rothau settlement forming one , and the hamlets of Foudai , Belmont , Waldbach , Bellefosse and Zolbach , the other . Waldbacb , the central village , and the seat of the parsonage , stands on the acclivity of the Champ de Feu , a mountain which rises three thousand six hundred feet above the sea , and is supposed to be of volcanic origin . The temperature and fertility of the district greatly vary ; in the higher parts , the climate is said to be Russian , while the valleys enjoy the soft warmth of a Genevan sky . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains from ' September to June . The prevalent religion is the Lutheran , the toleration of which was guarantied to the inhabitants on their union with France . Owino ' to its inaccessible site-having only a foot-path lead-b ing to the German highway  --  the barrenness of the soil , and // the ignorance of the population , consisting of not more than seventy or eighty families , this district was well nigh forgotten . It furnished no attraction to draw the traveller from his course , or to invite the visits of traders . Its spiritual guardian-the Lutheran Consistory of Strasburg-seein to have assigned it as a place of retirement for their superannuated curates , who contributed nothing to the moral or civil advancement of their charge . The result of this disastrous combination was , that in 1750 , the people were on the confines of primitive barbarism . Cut off in their mountain seclusion from intercourse with the moving world , they gradually lost the natural incentives to labor , and gave way to their constitutional inactivity . Their fields lay fallow , or scarcely repaid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manure ; they lived in wretched hovels , cut out of the rocks , or dug into the sides of the mountains ; the potato-long the staple of the district-being their main , and often their only food . In that year , however , whether accidentally or from conipunction , the Church presented a man of enterprise and piety to the hopeful benefice . In the exploratory examination which M. Stouber made of his charge , his first inquiries were directed at the institutions of education . He was , accordingly , conducted to the principal school , ( saving the antiphrasis , ) where the pupils were rioting in noise and play . The pedagogue was discovered stretched on a pallet in a corner of the room , and candidly disclosed , in reply to the questions of his visitor , that the station of teacher had been conferred on him in consideration of the ability with which he had tended the Waldbach pigs ; his age and infirmity disqualifying him for a swine-herd , he professed to teach the children all he knew ; which , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other villages had no advantage over this veteran , except in youth , and when Stouber endeavored to persuade some of the better in- formed young men to undertake the task , he found that the office had become so degraded in the public estimation , that there was no prospect of success . Lie at length adopted the expedient of abolishing the vulgar title of schoolmaster , and a number at once consented to act as . Messieurs les Regents . Teachers and a suitable building being provided , the popular prejudice was excited against the innovation , by a dislike of its expensiveness , and the fear of not a few , that their children were to be submitted to some occult mode of acquiring // knowledge ; of which they thought they discovered alarming indications in the detached letters and syllables , used by the abecedarians . The progress of the pupils in the mystery of reading dispelled these fears ; and such , at length , became the emulation for knowledge , that Stouber was encouraged to open a seminary for adults , who were taught on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed among the rn fifty bibles , each divided into three portions , for more extensive circulation . When they became convinced that these diminutive copies were as authentic as the large book they had been accustomed to see in the pulpit , they were highly prized and sedulously perused . Excepting an interval of four years service in another cure , Stouber resided at Waldbach in the faithful discharge of his duties until 1767 , when he accepted the al ) pOintment to a church in Strasburg , and prevailed upon Mr. Oberlin to become his successor in the IBan . To the biography and character of this individual we now direct the attention of our readers . Jean-Frederic Oberlin was horn at Strasburg , on the last day of August , 1740 . His father was a teacher in the gymnasium of that place , a man of good acquirements and respectability , and the instructer of his nine children . To their affectionate mother , also , they were indebted for a sound and prudent inculcation of their moral and religious duties . John Frederic manifested an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wish of his father that he should embrace a learned profession . Several anecdotes are related of the uncommon benevolence of his disposition in childhood , and the unusual sacrifices and personal courage he displayed in behalf of the suffering or oppressed . These traits are at once recognised as the germs of a character , which expanded into noble developement in his manhood . After the usual preliminary education , Oberlin entered the theological class of the University at Strasburg , and in due time was ordained as a minister . He did not undertake any parochial charge , hut served for seven years as tutor in the family of a distinguished surgeon , in whose service he casually acquired a portion of medical knowledge , which was of great use to him afterwards in Waldhach . The following pleasant anecdote is related as an example of the influence he acquired by his exemplary virtues among his fellow-citizens. // An honest tradesman , relying on the power of his faith , came to him one day , and after a long introduction , informed him , that a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently presented itself before him , and awakened hopes of discovering a treasure buried in his cellar ; he had often , he said , followed it , but had always been so much alarmed by a fearful noise , and by a dog , which he fancied he saw , that the effort had proved fruitless , and he had returned as he went . This alarm , on the one hand , and the hopa of acquiring riches on the other , so entirely absorbed his mind , that he could no longer apply to his trade with his former industry , and had , in consequence , lost nearly all his custom . He , therefore , urgently begged that Oberlin would go to his house and conjure the ghost , for the purpose of either putting him in possession of the treasure , or of discontinuing its visits . Oberlin replied , that he did not trouble himself with the conjuration of ghosts , and endeavored to weaken the notion of an apparition in the man 's mind , exhorting him at the same time , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that his efforts were unavailing , he promised to comply with the man 's request . On arriving , at midnight , at the tradesman 's house , he found him in company with his wife and several female relations , seated in a circle in the middle of the apartment . Suddenly the whole company turned pale , and the man exclaimed , " Do you see , Sir , the Count is standing opposite to you ? " " I see nothing . " " No*v , Sir , " exclaimed another terrified voice , " he is advancing towards you . " " I still do not see him . " " Now he is standing just behind your chair . " " And yet I can not see him ; but , as you say he is so near me , I will speak to him . " Then rising from his seat , and turning towards the corner where they said that he stood , he continued , " Sir Count , they tell me you are standing before me , although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from informing you , that it is scandalous conduct on your part , by the fruitless promise of a hidden treasure , to lead an honest man , who has hitherto faithfully followed his calling , into ruin-to induce him to neglect his business  --  and to bring misery upon his wife and children by rendering him improvident and idle ; begone , and delude them no longer with such vain hopes . " Upon this the people assured him , that the ghost vanished at once . Oberlin went home , and the poor man , taking the hint which in his address to the Count he had intended to convey , applied to business with his former alacrity , and never again complained of his nocturnal visitor . ' In 1766 , Oberlin accepted a chaplainship in a French regiment ; but while he was occupied with the preparatory studies , // the situation and prospects of the people of Steinthal were represented to him by M. Stouber , in such a light , that , at his solicitation , he resigned the ' military appointment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his residence at Waldbach in March , 1767 , being at that time in the twentyseventh year of his age . The only mode of communication which the greater part of the parish had with the neighboring towns lay through the river Bruche , where its waters were shallow enough to be passed on foot ; the farmers had no implements and no means of procuring them ; the produce of their fields was inadequate to the consumption , and the subjection , in which they were held to the lords of the domain disheartened them from exertion . It required much practical wisdom to effect a reform , on the scale projected by Oberlin . His first suggestion of the kind aroused the opposition of the most lawless of the subjects of his patriarchal dominion . A conspiracy was even formed to waylay him , and inflict violence on his person , which his ready wisdom frustrated . Having received notice of their design , which was to be executed on Sunday , he preached on that day on the Christian duty of meekness under injury . After the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution of their purpose , and were amusing themselves in surmising how far the pastor would act upon the doctrine of his sermon , when they should put it to a practical test . Suddenly the door of the apartment opened ; Here am I , my friends , ' said Oberlin , with his habitual dignity and calmness , I am acquainted with your design . You have wished to chastise me , because you consider me culpable . If I have indeed violated the rules I have laid down for you , punish me for it . It is better that I should deliver myself into your hands , than that you should be guilty of the meanness of an ambuscade . ' At this apparition and address , they sued humbly for forgiveness ; and the authors of this and other plots of the kind , which were defeated by the same firmness , endeavored to remove all reproach for their meditated offences , by double zeal in furthering his views . In 1768 , Oberlin married Madeleine Salonu* Witter , an orphan daughter of a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was his rule to enter upon no engageinent // or service , until he was persuaded that Providence was propitious to his design . He carried this principle to a rather amusing extreme in his matrimonial plans , and failed in his first attempt , or rather withdrew from his proposed suit , because the mother of the lady he had chosen did not make the first proposal ; which he had fixed upon as the omen , by which he should know whether she were the partner designed for him by Heaven . The mother gave him a courteous reception , and even called down her daughter , whose appearance did not , however , particularly please him ; they sat down , talked of a pretended cause of the visit , of the weather , and of the news about the town , till at length , all topics being exhausted , a silence succeeded ; the parties looked at each other in some surprise , for Oberlin was a novel visitor there , and then looked down again . This scene of " silent state " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided in his own mind how to act , made a polite bow and took his departure , leaving both mother and daughter at a loss to conjecture the cause of this singular visit , and the marriage was never again thought of . ' The secret most probably is , that the match was set on foot by his mother ; when he made his own choice , he acted more discreetly . Miss Witter , being on a visit to Waldbach , The time of her departure at length drew near . Only two days before the period fixed upon for her return to Strasburg , Oberlin felt as though a secret voice within whispered , " Take her for thy partner ! " He , however , resisted the call . " It is impossible , " said he , almost aloud- " our dispositions do not agree . " " Take her for thy partner ! " the voice still continued . He spent a sleepless night , and in his prayers next morning solemnly declared to God , that if He could give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proposition , that the union was in accordance with His will , he would cheerfully submit to it , and consider the voice he had heard as a bidding of Providence . After breakfast , the same morning , he found the young lady sitting in a summer-house in the garden . Placing himself beside her , he began the conversation by saying , " You are about to leave us , my dear friend ; I have had an intimation that you are destined , by the Divine will , to be the partner of my life . If you can venture upon this step , so important to us both , I expect you will give me your candid opinion about it , before your departure . " Upon this Miss Witter rose from her seat , and , blushing as // she approached him , placed one hand before her eyes , and held the other towards him . lie clasped it in his own . The decision was made ; a decision which he never found cause to regret , for , notwithstanding the determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , she became truly devoted to his interests , and the most cordial attachment ever afterwards subsisted between them . ' To open a communication with the civilized world , was among the primary objects of the Pastor 's care , and for this purpose he devised a road to intersect the great highway from France to Germany , through Strasburg . In a general convocation of the peasants , he opened his plan to them , and recommended that they should proceed at once to blast the rocks , in order to obtain stone to construct a wall about a mile and a half in length along the banks of the Bruche , for the support of a river road , which was to terminate in a bridge to be thrown across it at Rothan . The proposal astounded them as visionary and impracticable , and they unanimously began to make excuses for not assisting in the mad enterprise . Oberlin represented to them the advantages they would enjoy by having a market for their produce , and a free intercourse with the neighboring districts . The reward seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arguments , now threw a pickaxe over his shoulder , and invited those to join him who would . An enthusiasm then seized the boors , which efrected all that was desired . The pastor was soon followed by an ample corps , to whom he assigned their respective tasks , taking the most laborious parts to his own share , and animating them by his example . In a few months the work was completed , and a way opened to Strasburg , over a fine road and the neat pont de charit6 . ' The roads leading from the several villages of the parishes were next laid out or improved , and thus the first step of civilization was accomplished . As the district was wholly destitute of mechanics , Oberlin selected the most ingenious lads and bound them to masters in Strasburg . When their trades were acquired , they returned to serve the peasantry , and instruct their own apprentices . The people were also persuaded to abandon their cavernous abodes , and to avail themselves of the skill of their new artisans in providing comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The science had been nearly lost , through the slothfulness and pov // erty of the cultivators , yet they were unwilling to receive instruction from a clergyman who had spent his life in a city . Deferring , apparently , to their prejudice , Oberlin resolved to make a more urgent appeal to their senses , and set about cub tivating the gardens of the parsonage , which were well known to contain some of the poorest land in the parish . He planted a nursery of fruit trees in trenches of better earth , and reared a beautiful orchard of several varieties unknown to that region . The experiment was successful , and the wondering peasants eagerly sought to know the secret of such mysterious success . Planting and grafting became a general employment , and the cottages were surrounded with A circling row Of goodliest trees , laden with fairest fruit ; ' which had heretofore looked upon only The champaign head Of a steep wilderness , whose heavy sides , With thickets overgrown , grotesque and wild , Access denied ; and over head up-grew Insuperable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fir . ' The old people remembered to have heard from their fathers , that prior to the year 1709 , the peasantry depended principally upon wild apples and pears for their sustenance . A famine , which visited them in that year , compelled them to cultivate the species of potato , for which the district is still celebrated ; but owing to their ignorance of the method of recovering crops , the productiveness of the fields had diminished in 1767 , to a third or fourth of their former returns . Oberlin taught them the science from Parmentier , procured seed from Switzerland and Holland , and they had afterwards a surplus for exportation . He introduced a variety of herbs and leguminous plants ; the culture of flax and Dutch clover became commoo ; he taught them to extract wine from the wild-cherry , juniper , and dog-rose , oil from beech-nuts , and brandy from elder-berries . The indigenous plants were made to yield their properties , as his botanical skill found them useful for food , or in the arts . The fermentation of manure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were important contributions to their stock of knowledge , and the improvement of the shallow soil . At great expense of labor in blasting // rocks , or covering them with earth , the least useful pastures were turned into arable ground , and the cattle stalled , by which means the quantity of grain , as well as of milk and butter , was greatly increased . At length , to promote the improvement of husbandry in its largest extent , he formed ( in 1778 ) the most intelligent farmers into an Agricultural Society , connected with one at Strasburg . Appropriate works were obtained for circulation and reference , and prizes established for competition in raising produce and cattle . Once a fortnight , Oberlin devoted two hours to a familiar lecture on subjects connected with tillage and grazing . The literary and religious improvement of his people , were no less zealously attended to than the external reforms which we have detailed . His regular clerical duties were punctually discharged in the pulpit , in friendly visits , and in private charity . M. Stouber 's plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objections made to an increase of the expensiveness of education , he entered into an engagement , previously to commencing the erection of commodious edifices , that no part of their cost should be charged upon the parish funds . He began with his own slender capital , and the contributions of his friends in Strasburg ; and in a few years had the satisfaction of seeing a school-house in each of the five villages , and the inhabitants voluntarily assuming the expense and superintendence of them . In the meantime , the teachers were passing through a course of preparation for their office , and children from the ages of two to six years , were the only members of the community who were not usefully employed . Nor did they long escape the vigilant providence of the pastor . To him belongs the honor of introducing Infant Schools , and the models of the Ban de la Roche have received few improvements , since their adoption in France , Britain and America . In each commune , he placed one of these nurseries under the care of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own resources . The children were taught to read , and to knit , spin and sew ; they were entertained with pictures representing Scripture scenes , or subjects of natural history , accompanied with appropriate explanations and examination . They learned the first lines of Geography , on maps constructed for their use ; they were also instructed in singing , and special attention was paid to the correction of theirpatois . At the proper age , they were removed to the higher schools , where they // passed through the ordinary branches of education , and learned the principles of agriculture , astronomy and history . Every Sunday , the children of each village in rotation , recited the religious lessons of the week to the Clier Papa , as he was universally called , sung their hymns , and received his exhortations . This system was devised several years before modern Sunday-schools were commenced in Great Britain. * All the scholars of the district met weekly at Waldbach , that the pastor might compare the qualifications and systems of the different teachers , and excite a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled Oberlin to establish a circulating library for the use of the children , and a book-society , for their seniors and for families . A number of school-books were printed for the exclusive use of the Ban . A mathematical and philosophical apparatus was procured , and prizes distributed to teachers and scholars . He prepared and published an Almanac , divested of the usual symbols of superstition , and adapted to the taste of the people . The children of ten or twelve years , were required to copy and commit to memory essays on agriculture , and were initiated in the science of botany , for which the Steinthal aflbrded a fine field , as its natural products are supposed to comprise one thousand of the four thousand eight hundred and seventy-four species of the French Flora . In domesticating the wild plants , and copying flowers with the pencil , the young naturalists made great proflciency ; the presentation of living garlands , or of a painted copy , with affectionate inscriptions , was among the interesting acknowledgements they made upon festive occasions to the Clmer Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the presenting to the pastor of the first-fruits of the two trees , which each child was required to plant at a certain age in a designated spot . In January , 1784 , a severe calamity befel Oberlin in the sudden decease of his wife . This event severed his fondest hold upon life , and it became his constant prayer to be reunited to her in another world . Every day he devoted whole hours to holding communion with her in those elevated frames of mind , which require not the aid of superstition to make us conscious of the presence of those we love . ' * The real founder of Sunday-schools was Borromeo , Archbishop of Milan , in the sixteenth century ; and they have never , we believe , been intormitted , to this day , in that diocese . // He was left with seven children , and the care of his household devolved upon an orphan girl , whom he had adopted into his family , and who was one of the most active conductrices of the infant schools . A visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligence of the inhabitants as remarkable ; carrying back the imagination of the beholder to past , or idea.l ages of peace and innocence . Some of the peculiarities of the worthy author of these changes are recorded . The walls of his house were covered with maps , drawings , and vignettes ; and verses from the bible were inscribed over all his doors , as Moses was required to write the words of the law upon the posts of the house . ' On the entrance of his visitors , he presented each with a printed text , of which he had thousands of copies to distribute at every opportunity , and upon which he endorsed his receipts , messages , &amp;c . His study was lined with engravings of portraits , insects , animals , and minerals . I am writing this at his table , ' says one of his visitors , whilst he is busily preparing leathern gloves for his peasant children . His family are around him , engaged in their different avocations ; his eldest son , Frederic , is giving a lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instruction are judiciously blended ; and the Cker Papa , without desisting from his employment , frequently puts in a word . He took me this morning into his work-shop , where there is a turner 's lathe , a complete set of carpenter 's tools , together with a printing-press , and one for book-binding . I assisted him in coloring a quire of paper , which is intended for covers of school-hooks . He gives scarcely any thing to his people but what has been , in some measure , prepared by his own or his children 's hands . He will never leave ' this place . A much better living was once offered to him ; " No , " said he , " I have been ten years learning every head in my parish , and obtaining an inventory of their moral , intellectual , and domestic wants . I have laid my plan . I must have ten years to carry it into execution , and the ten following to correct their faults and vices . ' Steinthal escaped much , comparatively , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of his stipend , and the subscriptions of the parishioners , which they offered in its place , never exceeded fourteen hundred francs annually ; whilst for two successive years , he received but four hundred francs in each . He would never accept fees for his parochial duties . My people , ' he used to say , are // horn , married , and buried free of expense , at least , as far as their clergyman is concerned . ' In this exigency he took charge of a few private pupils , the sons of foreigners of distinction , and by his frugality , was able to bestow a considerable portion of the emolument upon his needy peasantry . In 1793 , his eldest son Frederic fell in battle ; a loss which be felt most severely . Whilst religious worship was interdicted throughout France , and most of the clergy of Alsace were imprisoned , Oberlin was not only unmolested in his employments , but upon being cited before the Supreme Court of the department , on a charge of favoring Joseph II. , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that even a momentary interruption of his course had taken place . The pastor 's views of the morals of politics were of the oldfashioned school of patriotism . We are republicans , ' he said in a paper addressed to the younger inhabitants , in 1794- ' we are republicans , when we neither live , nor act , nor undertake any thing , nor choose a profession or situation , nor settle in life , except for the public good . We are republicans , when , from love to the public , we endeavor , by example as well as by precept , to stimulate our children to active beneficence ; and seek to render them useful to others , by turning their attention to such pursuits as are likely to increase the public prosperity . We are republicans , when we endeavor to imbue the minds of our children with the love of science , and with such knowledge as may be likely , in maturer life , to make them useful in the stations they may be called to occupy ; and when we teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lastly , we are republicans , when we preserve our children from that self-interested spirit , which , at the present day , seems to have gained more ascendency than ever over a nation , whose people have , notwithstanding , reason to regard each other , and to love each other as brethren , but the greater part of whom care only for themselves , and labor only for the public good when they are compelled to do so . Far from us be this spirit ! It is as anti-republican as it is anti-christian . ' In consequence of the interruption of trade , incident to the state of the country , he refused to receive any salary , or to permit any collections to be made for his personal maintenance , or the support of his various institutions of education , religion , and charity ; giving notice , that whenever any one had money or produce which he could conveniently spare , it might be // brought to him , and assuring all , that no complaint should be made if they brought nothing . In return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement written on the back of the cards containing his printed texts . He was however enabled , during all the pressure of the Revolution , not only to maintain inviolate his determination to owe nothing , but to persevere in a plan he had adopted , of devoting three tenths of all his receipts to useful objects . These he divided , 1st , into a fund for building and repairing schools and churches , for the salaries of the conductrices , the purchase of Bibles , and the general purposes of religion ; 2 . For the improvement of roads , school-masters ' wages , public works , Sunday dinners to the poor people who came from other villages , &amp;c . The third was consecrated to the service of the poor . He sold all his plate in order to make a donation to a Paris Missionary Society , with the reservation of a single spoon , which he bequeathed to a similar association at B*sle . He had indeed at one period of his life , determine .. 4 to become a missionary himself . His design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only frustrated by the occurrence of our Revolution . Nor were his sympathies less comprehensive than his charity ; a description of the condition of the slaves in the West Indies so deeply affected him , that he ever afterwards abstained from the use of sugar and coffee . But the most remarkable instance of his conscientiousness , was his redeeming , at his own expense , the assignats of the Convention of 1794 , which happened to be in the hands of the peasantry , when they were rendered nearly valueless by a decree of the Directory . To this he was urged , not only by anxiety to save his people from the loss , but to preserve , in some measure , the credit of the government , who were unable to satisfy their creditors . One of these assignats is extant , with this inscription by his hand , . /Iinsi , grace d Dieu , ma nation est encore dicharg*ie d'une mani*ire Itonn*te de cette obligation de 125 francs . ' By taking these notes at their par value , he succeeded , in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ban . The largeness of his benevolent desires was well indicated during the delirium of a severe illness , in 1794 , when he continually called upon his attendants for thousands and thousands of money to promote his plans . In the subdivision of the duties of benevolence , the care of orphan children was spontaneously assumed by several respectable females , without // any expectation of reward . Two of these sisters of charity , dependent on their own labor for the means of support , had charge , at one time , of ten destitute children , whom they clothed , educated , and supported . At the instance of the Pastor , other females devoted a part of their leisure hours to reading the Bible to the aged or illiterate of the parish ; and some kept free schools for such children as , from their poverty or remoteness , could not attend those in the villages . Several of his children being married , three of his daughters to respectable clergymen , two sons settled in the ministry , and others resident in the Ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision , for which his advancing years were gradually unfitting him . Various arts had been introduced to meet the increasing industry of the population , which , in 1813 , amounted to three thousand souls . Cotton-spinning and weaving , ribband-making , straw-plaiting , and dyeing , were their principal employments . That year is memorable in the annals of Waidhach for having witnessed the close of a litigation , which had been pending for more than eighty years , between the peasantry and the feudal Seigneurs , respecting the right to the forests . The dispute had been maintained with equal obstinacy , and at great expense , by both parties . So much did the existence of this dispute distress the pacific Pastor , that the following inscription had for ninny years been placed over one of his doors . 0 God , have mercy on the Steinthal , and put an end to the law-suit ! ' All the influence which he possessed over his flock was exerted to persuade them to consent to a compromise . He at length succeeded ; the prefect of the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the character of the Pastor , tind the contest was brought to an end . The Mayors , in deputation , requested Oberlin to preserve the pen , with which the amicable agreement was signed , as a trophy of the victory his mild virtues and Christian influence had gained over long animosity . Oberlin hung up the pen in his study , and often said , that the day it commemorated was one of the happiest of his life . In the winter of 1817 , he was called to follow another child to the grave . His son Henry , who had returned from Russia , where he had served as tutor in the family of Count Richter , of Riga , contracted a pulmonary disease in consequence of his // exertions in assisting to extinguish a fire , in a town in which he was spending the night , on a tour through France . He removed to Rothau for the benefit of his brother 's advice , who was both a clergyman and a physician ; but perceiving his complaint to be rapidly approaching a fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . The wish was no sooner known , than twelve peasants offered to carry him on a litter to the paternal roof , a distance of six miles . It was thought more advisable to convey him in a covered cart ; and the twelve preceded it , removing every stone and obstacle in the road . Among his dying expressions , he frequently repeated these words of the Gospel of John , v. 24 , de la mort * la vie-de la mort * la vie , ' from which words the Pastor , then within three years of fourscore , preached a sermon on the day succeeding his son 's death . The Royal Agricultural Society of Paris voted Oberlin a gold medal , in 1818 , for his promotion of the science in the Ban . The Count de Neufchateau , in proposing this honor , warmly testified to the improvements the pastor had effected in his humble parish , and stated that Waldbach should serve as a model to the government in all their future plans of organizing new villages . Louis XVIII . conferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These distinctions were the more stirprising to the modest recipient , from the fact that he never went to any considerable distance from his parish , and in the whole course of his life had not even seen Paris . The King , ' he said , has had the goodness to send me this decoration ; hut what have I done to merit it ? Who , in my situation , would not have acted as I have done , and perhaps better still ? ' Oberlin 's personal manners were admirably adapted to his station . While entire equality was maintained with all the villagers , and his notice of them was indiscriminately familiar and kind , he preserved a dignity which commanded universal and filial respect . He was careful to set an example which should not be liable to misconstruction , or appear opposed to his precepts . In this , as in every other matter , he was to the last degree scrupulous . On one occasion , ' says a visitor , as we were walking up a hill , he had the arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fearing that this might be considered sel - indulgent or disrespectful by some of his younger parishioners whom we happened to pass , ( though he was then in his eightieth year , ) he // stopped to make an apology for this apparent disregard of the law of civility and kindness . ' I happened one day , when we were driven by a man , who seemed to go in a hazardous manner , to say " take care . " The pastor appeared hurt at this admonition , both on my account and on that of the driver . He assured me that all was safe , and at the end of the drive , took the greatest pains to prevent any feeling of vexation , which might arise in the mind of his parishioner . ' His activity was unceasing . He was at one time minister , schoolmaster , farmer , mechanic and physician to the parish . He would climb the steepest of the Vosges , through cold and snow , to visit the sick , often travelling to Strasburg in the night to procure medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation and charitable purposes , were , some one of them , almost daily demanding his presence . Besides these clerical services , he addressed circulars to particular classes of his people with advice or monitions on subjects of moral or domestic concern , which could not well be presented from the pulpit . Sometimes he addressed to them questions , to which they were expected to return written replies . Every Friday he conducted a service in German , for the benefit of those to whom that language was more familiar than the French . On this occasion he laid aside all formality , the women knit stockings for the poor , whilst the patriarch would pursue a train of familiar reflections on some portion of Scripture . To prevent weariness , he would occasionally inquire , Well , my children , are you not tired ? Have you not heard enough ? Tell me , my friends . ' And according to the frank reply of No , Papa , go on , ' or Enough , we believe , for this time , ' he would resume or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics , Lutherans and Calvinists , met at his communion table ; and to meet their respective scruples on the subject of the species of bread used in the sacrament , he provided wafers , and leavened and unleavened bread . In the early part of his ministry , he reprehended a mob which abused a poor Jew , who happened to stray into the parish , observing with unusual warmth , that if the stranger wanted the name of a Christian , their conduct proved that they were equally destitute of the Christian spirit . Oberlin amused himself with the study of physiognomy and phrenology , to which he was probably invited by the warm friendship which subsisted for several years between him and // Lavater , of Zurich . He collected a large number of profiles under which he portrayed the characters of his friends , and the supposed characteristics of strangers . Upon his own profile , he made this antithetical estimate of himself . I am a strange compound of contradictory qualities . I do not yet exactly know , what to think of myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - prudent and more politic than my fellow-clergymen , but also very apt to blunder , especially when in the least excited . I am firm , yet of a yielding disposition ; and both , in certain cases , to a great degree . I am not only daring , but even courageous ; whilst , at the same time , I am often in secret very cowardly . I am very upright and sincere , yet also very complaisant to men , and in a degree , therefore , insincere . I am a German and a Frenchman ; noble , generous , ready to render service , faithful , very grateful ,  --  deeply affected by the least benefit or kindness , which is ever after engraven on my heart ; and yet again flighty and indifferent . I am irritable to a formidable degree . He who treats me generously soon gains an ascendency over me ; but opposition creates in me an astonishing degree of firmness , especially in matters of conscience . I have a lively imagination , but no memory , properly speaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind remain with me , but dates and the names of persons I often forget the next day , notwithstanding all the pains I have taken to remember them . I used to speak Latin fluently , and even elegantly , but now I can not utter three or four words together . I make selections from books , and instruct others in some branch of science for a long time ; but a few years after , my scholars , even if they know nothing , have then what I taught them , many in their turn become my teachers , and the books from which I made extracts ( with the exception of those of a certain description ) appear wholly new to me . I habitually work my way through my studies till I obtain clear ideas ; but if I wish to penetrate deeper , every thing vanishes before me . I have a great talent for removing difficulties , in order to render every thing smooth and easy to myself and to every body else . I am so extremely sensitive , tender and compassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my feelings , so that the latter almost overpower me , and occasion me acute pain . I am always busy and industrious , but also fond of ease and indolence . I am generally quick in resolving , and equally so in executing . I have a peculiar esteem for the female sex . I am a very great admirer of painting , music , and poetry , and yet I have no skill in any of them . Me // chanics , natural history , and so forth , constitute my favorite studies . I am very fond of regularity , and of arranging and classifying , but my weak memory , added to constant employment , renders it difficult to me . I am given to planning and scheming , and yet endeavor , in my peculiar way , to do things in the best manner . I am a genuine soldier , but was more so before my bodily powers were so much weakened ; I was formerly anxious to be the foremost in danger , and the firmest in pain , but have now lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing and preponderating desire for a higher state of existence , and therefore a wish for death . I am the greatest admirer of military order and subordination , not however in a spirit of slavery , but of that noble and affectionate attachment which compels the coward to show courage , and the disorderly to be punctual . I feel no obstinacy or disinclination to yield to strong internal conviction , but on the other hand , a fervent heart-felt joy in yielding to both great and small , high and low , gentlemen and peasants , children and servants , and thence a willingness to listen , and an inclination to suffer myself if possible , to be convinced . But when I feel no conviction , I never think of yielding . I am humorous , and a little witty or satirical , but without intentional malice . ' After entering upon his eightieth year , Oberlin was obliged gradually to retire from all his active duties ; but he was able to exercise a general superintendence over his people , and devoted much of his time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of their baptismal registry . The vigor of his intellect remained , and he wrote several essays , amongst which was a refutation of Cicero de Senectute . His mortal illness attacked him on the 28th of May , 1826 , and with a calmness entirely accordant with his character , he resigned his being on the 1st of June , in his eighty-sixth year . The decease of the personage , who for nearly sixty years had presided over the destinies of their little world , and had guided them and their fathers from ignorance and wretchedness , to the blessings of intelligence and domestic comfort , excited inexpressible sensations in the community . They were at once deprived of their spiritual , intellectual , and social guide , who had led them from their infancy and provided for all the variety of their wants . The whole population crowded to view the beloved remains , during the four days that intervened between his death and interment . The procession at the funeral extended the distance of two miles from the parsonage to the // Foudai church . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled with the chanting of the school-children ; the burying-ground was surrounded by females of the Roman Catholic church , habited in mourning , and kneeling in silent prayer . The body was carried into the church , where a paper was read , which had been prepared by Oberlin in anticipation of the occasion , in which he gave an outline of his career , committed his children to the protection of his people , and concluded with a solemn exhortation to remember his admonitions . After other impressive exercises , the body was coinmitted to the earth . Respecting the present state of Steinthal we have no account , further than that a number of benevolent individuals in England and the continent have undertaken to raise a charitable fund to bear the name of Oberlin , and which shall be devoted to the support of the various seminaries he established . The compiler of the interesting and well-written biography , from which we have gleaned this article , is a female , who , by withholding her name , modestly declines the honor that is due to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustre in its annals . The philanthropy and piety are above suspicion , which animated a young man of ambition , possessed of talents which would have gained him a respectable eminence in the pursuits of literature , to consign himself to a life of labor in an obscure corner of the world , among a race whose manners and minds were destitute of refinement . It was in such a situation , unknown abroad , and with no resource but in himself , that he persevered for years in the ungracious contest against native prejudices . His persistence , however , was rewarded ; and insignificant as the peaceful region which sprung up under his reforming energies may be deemed by history , the example is colossal , and abounds in. lessons useful to the world.
