txt WE should be faithless to one of the first duties of a literary journal , did we not appropriate an ample portion of our pages to a notice of a volume like Mr. Bancroft ' * . A History of the United States , by an American writer , possesses a claim upon our attention of the strongest character . It would do so under any circumstances , but when we add that the work of Mr. Bancroft is one of the ablest of the class , which has for years appeared in the English language ; that it compares advantageously with the standard British historians ; that as far as it goes , it does such justice to its noble subject , as to supersede the necessity of any future work of the same kind ; and if completed as commenced , will unquestionably forever be regarded , both as an American and as an English classic , our readers would justly think us unpardonable , if we failed to offer our humble tribute to its merit . Many excellent , some admirable , works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverting to the ancient Spanish authors , writers like Robertson , // Hutchinson , Belkuap , Ramsay , Holmes , Marshall , Botta , Irving , Pitkin , Grahame , ( not to enumerate more of the local historians ) , are sufficient to show , that American history is by no means a neglected field . But no one of the writers mentioned , nor any other , has yet presented us , - no one in fact has attempted it , - what may be called a classical history of America or even of the United States . Such a work perhaps entered into the original plan of Dr. Robertson , and what he has left us is a splendid and beautiful treatise ; but as far as the United States are concerned , it stops with the foundation of the colonies , and relates even that period of their history but superficially . It is not too much to say , that a history of a country , capable of satisfying , in all respects , the requisitions of an enlightened national pride and patriotic feeling , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , as a general rule , obtain the knowledge of facts contained in contemporaneous publications , or embodied in traditions preserved on the spot . None but a native can easily acquire that accurate knowledge of localities , which gives life and distinctness to narration . None but a native can thoroughly comprehend the manners , habits , and institutions of a people ; and in reading the best accounts of the most intelligent foreigners , you are continually offended with a want of true insight and clear perception of matters of familiar notoriety . But these are not the great difficulties . No man can write the history of a foreign country , with a sufficient passion for his theme ; and it would be a degenerate people , who would leave to foreigners to write their history . We do not certainly deny , that works of great beauty and power may be written on the history of a foreign country . Who needs to be reminded of the history of Charles V. by Robertson , or of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and art , would satisfy a Spanish or a Roman patriot* ism . They evince the skill , the diligence , the sagacity of consummate writers ; but compare Gibbon with Livy . The writer , who would produce a classical history , must carry his heart to the task . While learning instructs and judgment guides him , a lofty patriotism must take possession of his soul . He must embrace his whole subject with an enthusiastic love ; and in this way , in the all but inspired language of Burke , his passions must instruct his reason ' // Let it not be thought , that we would turn history into panegyric , and have it a tissue of eulogies and apologies . Such it is true , it too often becomes , whether in native or foreign hands , but not more in the hands of natives than foreigners . it is too much the fault of historical writers , that , having been struck with the importance of some subject of history , and having for that reason , taken in hand to treat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance or merits ; and thus pursue the narration , through volumes of strained interpretation , flattery , and suppression . Or perhaps a man takes up a subject under an opposite feeling , and produces an entire work , conceived in a spirit of unfriendly construction . Mr. Mitford 's history of Greece , able and sagacious as he is , must , as far as the republican institutions of Greece are concerned , be set down as a specimen , - no doubt the most distinguished specimen , - of works of this class . But the classical historian , in composing the history of his own country , rises above either passion ; and devotes himself to his great work , both sine ira and sine studio . He is elevated above both , by the generous conception , which he forms of his province ; one of the most noble in the world of mind . He is the instrument of Providence , to award to good men , who in times past have served or adorned his native land , their just meed of praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Party prejudice was unjust to their merits ; fortune did not smile upon their efforts ; - they struggled nobly , but without success , against events too strong for their mastery ; - they had talents but wanted opportunity ; - some unhappy personalities narrowed their sphere of action ; - or they did all they could , all that man could do in their time , in their position , - but it was imperfect , it was a beginning ; - the co-operation of other agents , other generations , other ages was necessary , and they sunk clouded and care-worn to their graves . The faithful , the generous , the learned , the enthusiastic historian comes , and does them justice . He rises above party , and can see the worth of great men , who could not see the worth of each other . He does not , as the contemporary generation is too apt to do , withhold the tribute of applause from unsuccessful valor , or wisdom in counsel baffled by events ; - and where the fabric of national prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidated by years , and as venerable as firm , he points out the enduring zeal , the // open-handed liberality , the fortitude , and the heroism , with which , in the day of small beginnings , the first foundations were laid . None but the heart of a native can accomplish this ; no other can take up the theme , with that religious fondness which is required . The soil , on which he stands , must be his native soil , or he can not successfully evoke its peaceful tenants from their slumbers , to redress their wrongs , to give them beauty for ashes , and lead them forth , like the imagines of a Roman procession , crowned with their long delayed and richly merited chaplets . Look at Roger Williams , in his life-time , his natural life-time , - the days of his weary sojourning in the flesh ; - renounced by his religious brethren ,  --  suspended from his church ,  --  a vagrant in the woods ,  --  a pensioner of barbarians , - driven from this remote wilderness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colony to the solitude of a desert ,  --  exhausted with fatigues , worn with care ; - and then behold him in his new intellectual life , his earthly immortality , - arising in the pages of history the protomartyr of toleration , crowned with undying praise , - the founder of a little republic , which will be the shrine of his name , till another cataclysm shall submerge all that is America . If one would see the different spirit , in which a foreigner and a native write the history of a country , let him compare Mr. Bancroft 's account of Roger Williams with that of Grahame , an intelligent , fair-minded , and judicious historian. * The one presents you a truly great man , in advance of his times , and shows you his real character , through the thick mists of contemporary and traditionary prejudice . The other takes the character as he found it , in the popular sources . Kindly disposed toward the Puritan settlers of New England , Mr. Grahame sees Roger Williams , loaded with all the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust ; but he is incurious . He does not feel that tenderness and hearty attachment to his subject , which fill him with grief at seeing great virtues sadly maligned ; - which prompt the anxious inquiry , was not injustice done this great man ? and which induce a second investigation , a more penetrating search , a bolder canvass of the contemporary authorities , and a more philosophical criticism . Though we are proceeding , in advance of the plan of remark , // which we had proposed to ourselves , we can not better accomplish our main object , which is to call the reader 's attention to the characteristic merits of Mr. Bancroft 's work , than by comparing more minutely the accounts which it gives of Roger Williams , with that which is contained of the same remarkable man in other histories . Passing over the immediate contemporaries , as parties to the controversy , honest old Hubbard sees , in the foundation of the new Colony of Rhode Island , only an incident in the ecclesiastical affairs of New England , and in Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncharitable spirit . ' In recounting his pernicious courses , he falls over the first stumbing-block in his way , and puts at the head of his impeachment , that Roger Williams taught , that it was the duty of all the female sex to cover themselves with veils , when they went abroad , especially when they appeared in the public assemblies . ' It is curious to see the ingenuity , with which the reverend historian makes out the mischief of t ! lis practice , which , by the way , was introduced by Mr. Skelton and Governor Endicott , and acquiesced in by Roger Williams . The uncouthness of the sight , to see all the women in that congregation veiled , contrary to the custom of the English nation , would probably have drawn the eyes of the rest upon them , especially strangers , much more , than if they had attired themselves after the fashion of their neighbours But the enormity of this error was , in some degree , atoned for , by the ease with which its fair subjects allowed themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , that the very malignity of a heresy causes it to take the deeper root . Men cling to their peculiarities for their very extravagance . William Penn submitted to be disinherited rather than take off his hat before the king , and the Quakers in New England , while Roger Williams lived , went to the scaffold , rather than renounce their strange notions . Not so with the fair offenders at Salem . It is with poorly suppressed triumph , that Huhhard relates , that ' it is observable , that the reverend Mr. Cotton , taking occasion* about this time , to spend a Lordsday at Salem , in his exercise in the forenoon , so enlightened most of the women in the place , that it unveiled them , so a they appeared in the afternoon without their veils , - and that // discourse let in so much light into their understandings , that they , who before thought it a shame to he seen in the public without a veil , were ashamed ever after to be covered with them ! This , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sins , and the fifth is in the following terms set forth : That magistrates had nothing to do with the matters of the first table , ( religious affairs ) but only the second , and that there should be a general and unlimited toleration of all religions , and for any man to be punished , for any matters of his conscience , was persecution . ' This golden text , containing a divine philosophy and the wisdom of a far subsequent age , is thus huddled up with the whimsical and frivolous controversies , on points of taste and manners , with which our venerable fathers , in the early and critical periods of the colony , allowed their excited imaginations to be sadly worried . We pass over Mather , and come to Hutchinson , a lawyer , a politician , a man of sense , looking back with calmness over the interval of a century . He sees nothing extraordinary in Williams . His coming to Salem creates a great disturbance . " Hutchinson recites the charges against him from the old writers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just repeated , ought not to have been ranked as an offence with the former . He justifies , upon the whole , the proceedings against Williams , and his loyalty finds just occasion to the civil power to interpose , ' in his influencing Mr. Endicott to remove the king 's cross from the colors ; in which again Roger Williams did but acquiesce in the stern anti-catholic prejudices of Endicott , and in hich both were borne out by the opinion and practice of a subsequent a , e . The scruple , ' says Hutchinson , afterwards prevailed , and the cross was left out of the colors , and generally condemned as unlawful . ' He dismisses the settlement at Providence in a single line , and closes the account with a fair and candid , but wholly superficial estimate of the character of Williams . Let us now come down to Mr. Grahame , with whose account of Roger Williams we proposed , more particularly to contrast Mr. Bancroft 's , the publications being , so to say , contemporary ; the same materials substantially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice existing , to warp the mind of either in favor of or against Roger Williams . // We quote the passage from Mr. Grahame entire . He heads it , somewhat ominously , Williams 's Schism . The first religious dissension , that arose in the colony , was promoted by Roger Williams , who had come over to New-England in 1630 , and preached for some years to the inhabitants of New-Plymouth ; but not finding there an audience suitable to his purposes , he had solicited his dismission , and had recently been appointed Minister of Salem . This man was a rigid Brownist , precise , illiberal , unforbearing , and passionate . He began to vent from the pulpit , which he had gained by his substantial piety and fervid zeal , a singular medley of notions , some wildly speculative , some boldly opposed to the constitutions of civil society , and some which , if unexceptionable in theory , were highly unsuitable to the place , from which they were delivered , and the exercises and sentiments , with which he endeavored to associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unregenerate man to pray , nor for christians to join in family prayer with those they judged unregenerate ; that it was not lawful to take an oath to the civil magistrate , not even the oath of allegiance , which he had declined himself to take , and advised his congregation equally to refuse ; that King Charles had no right to usurp the power of disposing of the territory of the Indians , and hence the colonial patent was utterly invalid ; that the magistrate had no right to restrain or direct the consciences of men ; and that any thing short of unlimited toleration of all religions , was detestable persecution . These liberal principles of toleration he combined with a spirit so rigid and separating , that he not only refused all communion with any who did not profess every one of the foregoing opinions , but forbade the members of the church at Salem , to communicate with any of the other churches in the colony ; and when they refused to obey this prohibition , he withdrew from them and set up a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a select assembly of zealous admirers , composed of men in whose minds an impetuous temper , inflamed by persecution , had greatly impaired the sense of moral perspective ; who entertained disproportioned ideas of those branches of the trunk of godliness , for which they had endured such mighty sufferings , and had seen worth and piety so foully wronged ; and who abhorred every symbol , badge , and practice , that was associated with the remembrance and spotted , as they conceived , with the iniquity or their idolatrous oppressors . One of his followers , Mr. Endicott , a magistrate of the place , and formerly deputy governor of the colony , in a transport of zeal against superstition , cut the red cross out of the king 's colors ; and many of the trained bands , who had hitherto followed these colors without objection , caught // the contagion of Endicott 's zeal , and protested that they would follow them no longer , if the cross were permitted to remain ) * The riotous and violent conduct of Endicott was universally disapproved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disability for holding office for one year , but they were obliged to compromise the dispute with the protesters among the trained bands , and comply to a certain extent with their remonstrances . They were preparing to call Williams to a judicial reckoning , when Mr. Cotton and other ministers interposed , and desired to be allowed to reason with him , alleging that his violence was prompted rather by a misguided conscience than seditious principles ; and that there was hope they might gain , instead of losing , their brother . " You are deceived in that man , if you think he will condescend to learn of any of you , " was the prediction of the governor , and the result of the conference proving the justice of it , sentence of banishment from the colony was forthwith pronounced upon Williams . This sentence excited a great uproar in Salem , and was so successfully denounced as persecution , by the adherents of Williams , that the bulk of the inhabitants of the place were preparing to follow him into exile ; when an earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other ministers of Boston , induced them to relinquish their purpose , to acknowledge the justice of the proceeding , and to abandon Williams to his fortunes . He was not , however , abandoned by his more select adherents , whose esteem and affection he had gained in such a degree , that they resolved to incur every hazard , in order to live and die with him . Accompanying him in his exile , they directed their march towards the south , and settling in a place beyond the jurisdiction of Massachusetts , they bought a considerable tract of land of the Indians , and bestowed on their settlement the name of Providence . Had this man encountered the treatment , to which the publication of his peculiar opinions would have exposed him in England , he would probably have been driven to madness . The wiser and kinder treatment he experienced from the Massachusetts ' authorities , was productive of happier effects ; and Mr. Cotton and his associates were not deceived , in thinking that they should gain their brother . They gained him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphant issue of the conference would have been , t but much more beneficial to the interests of * The refusal was to follow the colors so defaced . Several trained bands , ' is extravagant . Several soldiers ' in Hubbard , and many of the militia ' in Hutchinson. j They gained him , because this illiberal , unforbearing. and passionate ' man forgave the banishment and other hardships he had suffered , at their hands // America . He concurred as we shall see , at a later period , in founding the State of Rhode-Island , and was one of its most eminent benefactors . He lived to an advanced age , and soon throwing off the wild and separating spirit with which his sentiments had been leavened , he regained the friendship and esteem of his ancient fellow-colonists , and preserved a friendly correspondence with Mr. Cotton and others of them till his death . The principles of toleration , which he had formerly discredited , by the rigidness with which he disallowed the slightest difference of opinions between the members of his own communion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences that distinguish christians are prevented from dividing them , and by cultivating that charity , by which even the sense of these differences is often melted down . The great fundamental principles of christianity , daily acquiring a more exclusive and absolute influence over his mind , he began* to labor for the conversion of the Indians ; and in addition to the benefits of which his ministry among them was productive to themselves , he acquired over them an influence , which he rendered highly advantageous to his old associates in Massachusetts , whom he was enabled frequently to warn of conspiracies formed against them by the savages in their vicinity , and communicated to him by the tribes , with whom he retained relation of friendship . ' This account , upon the whole , is neither unfriendly nor grossly unfair . Mr. Grahame has no malice against Williams ; he repeats without bitterness , the view of his character , taken by the opposite and the dominant party ; and leaves the schism ' of Williams , as he finds it in the popular authorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toleration principle of Williams a jewel , like the great Portuguese diamond , of inestimable value , which had till lately been sadly obscured , under the unsightly exterior and sordid crust of party prejudice and sectarian controversy . Carefully draxving to his aid , the numerous and respectable commentators of the present and the former days , he nevertheless goes to the fountainheads of authority , and derives his account of Roger Williams from the colony records , from the journal of Governor Winthrop , from the work of John Cotton , and the letters and other writings of Williams himself . From these materials , be l ; * : deduced the following noble and delightfiul sketch // While the state was thus connecting , by the closest bonds , the energy of its faith with its form of government , there appeared in its midst , one of those clear minds , which sometimes bless the world , by their power of receiving moral truth in its clearest light , and of reducing the just conclusions of their principles to a happy and consistent practice . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months after the arrival of Winthrop , and before either Cotton or Hooker had embarked for New-England , there arrived at Nantasket , after a stormy passa* , e of sixty-six days , a young minister , godly and zealous , having precious ' gifts . It was Roger Williams . He was then but a little more than thirty years of age ; but his mind had already matured a doctrine , which secures him an immortality of fame , as its application has given religious peace to the American world . He was a puritan , and a fugitive from English persecution ; but his wrongs had not clouded his accurate understanding . In the capacious recesses of his mind , he had revolved the nature of intolerance , and he , and he alone had arrived at the great principle , which is its sole effectual remedy . He announced his discovery , under the simple proposition of the sanctity of conscience . The civil magistrate should restrain crime , but never control opinion ; should punish guilt , but never violate the freedom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theological jurisprudence . It would blot from the statute book the crime of nonconformity ; would quench the fires , which persecution had so long kept burning ; would repeal every law compelling attendance on public worship ; would abolish tithes and all forced contributions to the maintenance of religion ; would give an equal protection to every form of religious faith ; and never suffer the authority of the civil government to be enlisted against the mosque of the mussulman , or the altar of the fire-worshipper ; against the Jewish synagogue or the Roman cathedral . It is wonderful , with what distinctness Roger Williams deduced these inferences from his great principle , the consistency with which , like Pascal and Edwards , those bold and profound reasoners on other subjects , he accepted every fair inference from his doctrines , and the circumspection with which he repelled every unjust imputation . In the unwavering assertion of his views , he never changed his position . The sanctity of conscience was the great tenet , which , with all its consequences , he defended , as he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old age , it was the last pulsation of his heart . But it placed the young emigrant in direct opposition to the whole system , on which Massachusetts was founded ; and gentle and forgiving as was his temper , prompt as he was to concede everything which honesty permib. // ted , he always asserted his belieg with temperate firmness and unyielding benevolence . So soon therefore as Williams arrived in Boston , he found himself among the New-England churches , but not of them . They had not yet renounced the use of force in religion ; and he could not , with his entire mind , adhere to churches , which retained the offensive features of English legislation . What then was the commotion in the cofony , when it was found that the people of Salem desired to receive him as their teacher ! The court of Boston " marvelled " at the precipitate decision , and the people of Salem were required to forbear . Williams withdrew to the settlement at Plymouth , and remained there about two years . But his virtues had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostle of intellectual liberty was once more welcomed to their confidence . lie remained the object of public jealousy . How mild was his conduct was evident from an example . He had written an essay on the nature of the tenure , by which the colonists held their lands in America ; and he had argued , that an English patent could not invalidate the rights of the native inhabitants . The opinion sounded , at first , like treason against the cherished charter of the colony ; Williams desired only that the offensive manuscript might be burned ; and so effectually explained its purport , that the court applauded his temper , and declared that " the matters were not so evil , as at first they seemed . " ' After stating , with candor and impartiality , the controversy between Williams and the magistrates , on the subjects of communion with the Church of England , the laws compelling the attendance of every man at public worship , the right of the government to enact laws to prevent the spread of religious error , and the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bancroft alludes to the insinuations thrown out against the soundness of Williams 's intellect in the following fine strain of remark The scholar , who is accustomed to the pursuits of abstract philosophy , lives in a world of thought far different from that , by which he is surrounded . The range of his understanding is remote from the paths of common minds , and he is often the victim of the contrast . It is not unusual for the world to reject the voice of truth because its tones are strange ; to declare doctrines unsound , only because they are new ; and even to charge obliquity or derangement on the man , who brings forward principles , which the many repudiate . Such has ever been the way of the world ; and Socrates , and St. Paul , and Luther and others of the most acute dialecticians , have been ridiculed as driv // ellers and madmen . The extraordinary development of one faculty may sometimes injure the balance of the mind , just as the constant exercise of one member of the body injures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one pursuit , politics for instance , or money , brushes away from conduct and character , the agreeable varieties of light and shade . It is a very ancient remark , that folly has its corner in the brain of every wise man ; and certain it is that not the poets only , like Tasso , but the clearest minds , like Sir Isaac Newton and Pascal , have been deeply tinged with insanity . Perhaps Williams pursued his sublime principles with too scrupulous minuteness . It was at least natural for Bradford and his contemporaries , while they acknowledged his power as a preacher , to esteem him " unsettled in judgment . " ' Notwithstanding the unpopularity of Williams 's views , the church of Salem elected him their teacher . This brought on the crisis . The ministers assembled , and declared any one worthy of banishment , who should obstinately assert , that the civil magistrate might not intermeddle , even to stqp a church from apostasy and heresy . ' * To punish the people of Salem , while a course of ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of public land was withheld from the inhabitants of the town . Roused by this act of practical injustice , Williams and his church addressed letters of admonition unto all the churches , whereof any of the magistrates were members , that they might admonish the magistrates of their injustice . ' This last act , ' says Mr. Bancroft , seemed flagrant treason ; and at the next General Court , Salem was disfranchised , till an ample apology for the letter should be made . The town acquiesced in its wrongs and submitted ; not an individual remained willing to justify the letter of remonstrance . The church of Williams would not avow his great principle of the sanctity of conscience ; even his wife , under a delusive idea of duty , was for a season influenced to disturb the tranquillity of his home , by her reproaches . Williams was left alone , absolutely alone . Anticipating the censures of the colonial churches , he declared himself no longer subjected to their spiritual jurisdiction . " My own voluntary withdrawing from all these churches , resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting light * The magistrate , of course , being the judge what apostasy and heresy are . It is painful to see , how promptly our fathers put themselves in the wrong , in the argument against the English hierarchy . // unto them , I confess it was mine own voluntary act , yea , I hope the act of the Lord Jesus , proclaiming truth , as with the voice of a trumpet . ' When summoned to appear before the General Court , he avowed his convictions in the presence of the representatives of the State , " maintained the rocky strength of his grounds , " and declared himself " ready to be bound and banished , even to die in New-England , " rather than renounce the opinions , which had dawned upon his mind , in the clearness of light . At a time , when Germany was the battle-field for all Europe , in the implacable wars of religion , when even Holland was bleeding with the anger of her vengeful factions , when France was still to go through the fearful struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intolerance , more than forty years before William Penn became an American proprietary , Roger Williams asserted the great doctrine of intellectual liberty . It became his glory to found a state upon that principle , and to stamp himself upon its rising institutions , in characters so deep , that the impress has remained to the present day , and like the image of Phidias on the shield of Minerva , can never be erased without the total destruction of the work . The principles , which he first sustained amidst the bickerings of a colonial parish , next asserted in the General Court of Massachusetts , and then introduced into the wilds of Narragansett Bay , he soon found occasion to publish to the world , and to defend as the basis of the relicrious freedom of mankind ; as the lark , that pleasant bird of the peaceful summer , " affecting to soar aloft , springs upward from the ground , takes his rise from pale to tree , " and at last surmounting the highest hills , utters his clear carols through the skies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to assert , in its plenitude , the doctrine of the liberty of conscience , the equality of opinions before the law ; and in its defence he was the harbinger of Milton , the precursor and the superior of Jeremy Taylor . For Taylor limited his toleration to a few christian sects ; the philanthropy of Williams compassed the earth . Taylor favored partial reform , commended lenity , argued for forbearance , and entered a special plea in behalf of each tolerable sect ; Williams would permit persecution of no opinion , of no religion ; leaving heresy unharmed by law , and orthodoxy unprotected by the terrors of penal statutes . Taylor still clung to the necessity of positive regulations , enforcing religion and eradicating error . He resembled the poets , who in their folly first declare their hero invulnerable , and then clothe him with earthly armor . Williams was willing to leave truth alone in her own panoply of light , believing that if in the ancient feud of truth and error , the employment of force could be entirely abrogated , truth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom of // mankind to award high honors to the successful inquirer into the laws of nature , to those who advance the hounds of human knowledge . We praise the man who first analyzed the air , or resolved water into its elements , or drew the lightning from the clouds ; though the condition of physical investigations may have ripened the public mind , at the time , for the advancement in science . A moral principle has a much wider arid nearer influence on human happiness ; nor can any discovery of truth be of more direct benefit to society , than that which establishes a perpetual religious peace , and spreads tranquillity through every community , and every bosom . If Copernicus is held in perpetual reverence , because , on his death-bed , he published to the world , that the sun is the centre of our system ; if the name of Kepler is preserved in the annals of human excellence , for his sagacity in detecting the laws of the planetary motion ; if the genius of Newton has been almost adored for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a balance , let there be for the name of Roger Williams , at least , some humble place , among those , who have advanced moral science and made themselves the benefactors of mankind . ' Roger Williams was banished , but not by a large majority of votes , in the General Court . The gravamen of his crime , was , that his doctrine , touching the illegality of the Freeman 's oath , threatened to subvert the fundamental state and government of the country . ' The punishment thus decreed was attended with sufferin s , which can not be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of those , who pronounced the sentence . Winter was at hand . Williams succeeded in obtaining permission to remain till spring , imitending then to begin a plantation in Narragansett Bay . But the affections of the people of Salem revived and could not be restrained . They thronged to his house to hear him , whom they were so soon to lose forever . It began to be rumored , that he could not safely be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were " many of them much taken , with the apprehension of his godliness ; " there was evident danger th ove contagious ; that the infec tion to at his opinions would pr would spread widely . It was therefore resolved to remove England , in a ship that was just ready to sail . A warrant was accordingly sent to him to come to Boston and embark . For the first time , he declined the summons of the court . A pinnace was sent for him ; the officers repaired to his house ; he was no longer there . Three days before he had left Salem , in winter snow , and inclement weather , of which he remembered the se // verity , even in his late old age . " For fourteen weeks he was sorely tost in a bitter winter season , not knowing what bread or bed did mean . " Often in the stormy night , he had neither fire , nor food , nor company ; often he wandered without a guide and had no house , but a hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same scrupulous respect for the rights of others , which led hini to defend the freedom of conscience , had made him also the champion of the Indians . He had already been zealous to acquire their language ; and knew it so well , that he could debate with them in their own dialect . During his residence at Plymouth , he had often been the guest of the neighboring sachems ; and now when he came in winter to the cabinet of the chief of Pokanoket , he was welcomed by Massassoit , and the barbarous heart of Canonicus , the chief of the Narragansetts , loved him as his son to the last gasp . " The ravens , " he relates with gratitude , " fed me in the wilderness . " And in requital for their hospitality , he was ever , through his long life , their friend and benefactor ; the apostle of christianity to them without hire , without weariness , and without impatience at their idolatry ; the guardian of their rights ; the pacificator when their rude passions were inflamed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invasion of their rights . He first pitched and began to build and plant at Seekonk . But Seekonk was found to be within the patent of Plymouth . On the other side of the water , the country opened in its unappropriated beauty ; and there he might hope to establish a community , as free as the other colonies . It was in June , that the lawgiver of Rhode-Island , with five companions , embarked on the stream . A frail Indian canoe con* tamed the founder of an independent state and its earliest citizens . Tradition has marked the spring near which they landed ; it is the parent spot , the first inhabited nook of Rhode-Island . To express his unbroken confidence in the mercies of God , Wil-. hams called the place PROVIDENCE . " I desired , " said he , " it might be for a shelter for persons distressed for conscience . In his new abode , Williams could have less leisure than ever for contemplation and study . " My time , " he observes of himself , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a writer on morals , " was not spent altogether in spiritual labors ; but day and night , at home and abroad , on the land and water , at the hoe , at the oar , for bread . " In the course of two years he was joined by others , who fled to his asylum .. The land , which was now occupied by Williams , was within the territory of the Narragansett Indians . It was not long , before an Indian deed from Canonicus and Miantonimoh made him the undisputed possessor of an extensive domain . Nothing displays more clearly VOL . XL. - NO. 86. // the character of Roger Williams , than the use which he made of his acquisition of territory . The soil he could claim as his " own , as truly as any man 's coat upon his back ; " and he " reserved to himself not one foot of land , not one tittle of political power , more than he granted to servants and strangers . " " He gave away his lands and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , until he gave away all . " He chose to found a commonwealth in the unmixed forms of a pure democracy , where the will of the majority should govern the state . Yet " only in civil things .

To their inc*re aristocratic neighbors , it seemed " as if these fugitives would have no magistrates , " for every thing was as yet decided in the convention of the people . This first system has had its influence on the whole political history of Rhode-Island . In no state in the world , not even in the agricultural state of Vermont , has the magistracy so little power or the representatives of the people so much . The annals of Rhode-Island , if written in the spirit of philosophy , would exhibit the forms of society under a peculiar aspect . Had the territory of the state corresponded in size to the importance and singularity of the principles of its early existence , the world would have been filled with wonder at the phenomena of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the founder of Rhode-Island , was his conduct toward his persecutors . Though keenly sensitive to the hardships , which he had endured , he was far from harboring feelings of revenge , toward those who had banished him , and only regretted their delusion , " I did ever from my soul honor and love them , even when their judgment led them to afflict me . " In all his writings on the subject , he attacked the spirit of intolerance , the doctrine of persecution , and never his persecutors or the colony of Massachusetts . Indeed , we shall presently behold him requite their severity , by exposing his life at their request and for their benefit . It is not strange , then , " if many hearts were touched with relentings . That great and pious soul , Mr. Winslow , melted and kindly visited me at Providence , " said the exile , " and put a piece of gold into the hands of my wife , for our supply . " The founder , the legislator , the proprietor of Rhode-Island owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife the means of sustenance to the charity of a stranger . The half-wise Cotton Mather concedes , that many judicious persons confessed him to have the root of the matter in him ; and his nearer friends , the immediate witnesses of his actions , declared him from " the whole course and tenor of his life and conduct , to have been one of the most disinterested men that ever lived , a most pious and heavenly-minded soul . " // We have made this long extract , because it is proper that we should give our readers a fair specimen of Mr. Bancroft 's work , and they could not have one fairer . It exhibits the merits , the strength , the beauty , the peculiarities , if you please the defects of his style . In the latter we count a little diffuseness , of a character rather too ambitious for a work of this kind , and an occasional want of precision in the use of language . But these are trifles , many times redeemed by the patient research , the accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fire and life which characterize his pages ; and which denote a powerful mind , exercised on a noble theme , kindling with its importance , excited by its interest , embracing it with a generous enthusiasm . Nothing else will enable the historian fully to perform his duty . Look at Gibbon , going about his Herculean task and with a giant 's strength , as it is said , originally for the purpose , to which the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters are devoted . What an object for a History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ! What a motive for a man of the requisite strength of mind and conscious power , and about to unroll that august and significant record ! What an object for a man about to call up from their imperial tombs , not the eight shadows of the dramatic vision , but the long line of the C*esars ! The result accords with the motive . The edifice is worthy of the spirit , in which it was planned , and the talent with which it was executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerless . You pace through its resounding halls , sad and unsatisfied with their splendors . You are fatigued with the soulless beauty of the history ; exhausted with its everlasting dreary learning ; and rise from the perusal of the twelve admirable volumes , without having experienced one thrill of virtuous excitement . Is it said , that if the historian be in love with his theme , he will run into extravagance ? Let it be remembered , that we would chasten this love with a sound philosophy , with a spirit of research , with a store of learning , and with a fund of common sense . Fortified with these , let the historian be extravagant ; he ought to be extravagant . But do not , gentle reader , hastily cavil at the word . We know what we say . We do not mean , that he should indulge in conscious extravagance , that he should deliberately overstate , or wilfully suppress , or knowingly misrepresent . To do this , scarcely excusable in historical romance , is altogether incompatible with the probity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conscientiously , with his whole heart , make his oblation on the altar of truth , is no historian . He does not know what history means . He is not prepared to engage in its first labors , its lowest drudgery , if any thing pertaining to truth can he called drudgery . No it is nothing but a religious , a superstitious reverence for the truth , which will give a man courage to steer his way through conflicting statements , to select , to condense , and to generalize ; which yet he must ( In , or instead of writing volumes of well digested and tasteful history , to be read and studied , he will write volumes of chronicles , to be preyed upon by worms . He only who loves , who idolizes truth , can ( liscriminate and compare truth . The extravagance which we plead for is that of the sound , the well-balanced , the well-instructed , and conscientious mind , warmed and exalted by love of its theme . It is the extravagance , which runs through all the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food iii the pathless xvild*rness , a million fold beyond the wants of all the tenants of the air , the forest , or the sod , who are to be nourished by it ; it is the extravagance of affection , which sees beauties in the blemishes of a loved object ; the extravagance of kindred blood , which leads the tender mother to love the very infirmities of her frail child . This extravagance , or enthusiasm , if it ended here , would of course be a weakness ; hut with the qualifications already stated , guided by judgment , checked by a sound philosophy and an intelligent criticism , taught by patient study , it is an indispensable ingredient in the historian 's character . It leads to no error ; it supplies in the narrative the want of life in the personages , and reality in the events . It gives animation and glow to the silent page ; and brings it somewhat nearer , in its effect upon the mind and heart , to the actual thing described . For after all , the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you will , - narrate facts , - pourtray characters , - sketch scenery , - and how far inferior is the impression made upon the mind to that produced by actual presence and inspiration ; - to the seeing of the eye and the hearing of the ear . To fill up this mighty interval hetxveen the two kinds of impression is the province of the master ; so to narrate the fact , as to make you the xvitnesses of the occurrence ; so to describe the spot , as to spread out its map before the imagination ; so to picture the acting spirits , as to make // them rise up , living and sentient , and repeat their ancient exploits in your presence . This can not be done by a timid adherence to xvhat is erroneously called truth ; - erroneously , because that representation can not be true , which inadequately and imperfectly reproduces the original . But as the sculptor gives to his hero a form of something more than mortal dimensions ; as the painter suffuses the cheek with a glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , or disease , or age has ploughed in the manly countenance , so the historian , kindling with the same passion for his subject , and aiming by his still nobler art , to awaken the illustrious dead into an immortality of fame , must so describe them , as to produce as nearly as possible on the reader 's mind , the effect of an actual presence . These remarks , it is true , do not apply equally to all history . rrhe history of the present times is best written by the severe and ample accumulation of facts . Posterity wants materials ; will make its own selection ; and xvill generalize , according to its tastes , its wants . The history of the past is like the view , which presents itself to the voyager , on board the vessel , which is bearing him from the shore . At first , and while he is yet in the harbor , lie beholds the streets , the houses , the men . They wave their hands to him , as he glides away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he does not yet feel himself departed from them . So our contemporaries in life and action have some of them disappeared ; they are motionless , - gone ; but their memory is fresh . We have not yet acted out the scene we began with them . We can not realize that they have left us , nor can we describe what has been done , without repeating their names as often as those of the survivors . The vessel recedes ; - the moving men dxvindle to the eye ; the streets run together ; the steeples sink into the clouds ; but a bold outline remains . There is the vast extent of brick , - the cloud of smoke above it reveals the city , - there are the mountains , - the silver thread between is the river on which a few hours ago , you fled before the breeze ; in a moment these too fade away , and a long dark wreath settles in the horizon . The history of our own times relates individual occurrences , anecdotes , personal character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutions which have shaken empires , back to the passions of a minister , the caprices of a favorite . The picture of the day contains // a place for the events of each hour . A little time elapses , and these first causes are lost , except where accident has preserved them ; - important facts , never committed to writing , perish with those , whose memory was their sole depository ; - of many events the secret history is forever lost . But larger sequences of action , - general results , - with a few prominent individuals , famous battles , and mighty revolutions ; - the effect of a thousand remembered and tens of thousands of forgotten causes , - remain . A century elapses ; and many of these individual incidents and characters sink in importance , in the succession of others not less important . Battles as momentous as that of Blenheim have been fought in abundance ; - treaties as important as that of Utrecht have been concluded ; and what filled the entire imagination of the contemporary world , fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . But the Reformation , the Discovery of America ; these are like mighty heaven-piercing mountains , which yet fill the back-ground of our horizon . But go back eighteen or twenty centuries . Describe the history , - the human history of the propagation of christianity . An octavo volume would more than contain all that is certainly knoxvn of the first hundred years . Gibbon has compressed all , that the general reader wishes to know of the history of the Roman law , into one chapter . It is not certain whether the laws of the twelve tal ) les were formed at home or imported from Greece . Carthage , the great rival of Rome , - stat magut nomuns umbra ; and in Rome herself , it is not possible , with any degree of satisfaction , to make out the constitution of that immortal Senate , which built up the city , from a little town on the Tiber to be the mistress of the world . As to the early periods of the Roman State , - the patriotism of the first Brutus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Numa , the conduct and valor of the great Founder himself , what they all are , xveighed in the golden scales of a philosophical criticism , will appear to him , who has studied the profound , but merciless pages of Niebuhr . And if these familiar events are torn from the grasp of autl1entic history ; - these names and exploits canonized in the ruhric of patriotism and fame ; - what shall we say of the Italia avasiti i Bomani , of the dark and austere generations , that preceded the Romans , and gave them their religious rites , their priesthood and aruspicy , and all the divinities of their sombre pantheon , their grand and massy architec // ture , the arch itself ; - in a word the mighty Etruscan race , which seems , as it were , by some incomprehensible fatality , to have been bli*hted and paralyzed , in the very noon-day of its progress , and to have sunk with its language , its arts , its institutions , and its power , into a strange , premature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history back a little farther , - arid but a little , than that of Rome . We soon reach its somewhat shadowy boundary , and then four or five great military ( or predatory ) expeditions and enterprises of colonization , are all that xve can find , to fill up a period of a thousand years ; and these belonging not so much to an historic , as to an bernie , not to say a fabulous age . One more step and we are caught up from the firm ground . We no longer deal with the actions of men ; but with man himself . The identity of the race is called in question . it passes over into giants , centaurs , satyrs , fauns , nymphs , and gods . Heaven and earth approach each other ; deities are driven from their thrones ; heroes ascend to Olympus ; - destiny is mixed up with life ; - false miracles with actions ; and it is the duty of the profane bistorian , out of this mass of fictions , fables , and idealizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the nations from the cradle of their being in central Asia , where they are left by the sacred record , till the dawn of authentic tradition rises upon them , in the various regions of their dispersion . From time to time , letters flourish in some favored spot , and every branch of knowledge , - and among others , the historical , - is cultivated . The annals of the past are then searched out and recorded , by gified minds ; either of the world at large , or of great periods of its duration , or of great states and confederacies , or of single countries . The power and skill of the historian will often decide from that time forward , how much shall be familiarly read and known of the people he describes . If his work is successfully composed , it will go down to after times , taking the place of the mass of contemporary and occasional pamphlets , and superseding ponderous tomes of more learned antiquarian collections . Strike Livy , and Plutarch , and Dionysius , and a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should know of the early history of Rome , might be printed on a single page of a newspaper . This consideration alone is sufficient to show how momentous and responsible is the task of him , who takes in hand // to write the history of his country . Mr. Bancroft appears to I ; ave eagaged in it , with a suitable impression of the importance of his office . I have formei , ' says he , in his dignified and elegantly written preface , the design of writing the history of the United States , from the discovery of the American continent to the present time . As the moment arrives for publishing a portion of the work , I am impressed more strongly than ever , with a sense of the grandeur and vastness of the subject ; and am ready to charge myself with presumption for venturing on so bold an enterprise . I can find for myself no excuse , but in the sincerity with which I have sought to collect truth from trust-worthy documents and testimony . ' A just conclusion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a responsible and momentous enterprise . If performed as Mr. Bancroft is able to perform it ; if carried on and completed as it is commenced ; if the same patience of research ; the same impartiality and love of truth ; the same discrimination ; the same sagacity in unfolding the true nature of disputed matters ; the same fertility of illustration ; the same rightness of moral feeling ; the same vigor , sprightliness , and beauty of diction , which appear in this first volume , shall equally characterize those which succeed , the history of the United States will probably , in this form , not be written again ; at least not till after the lapse of ages and great revolutions of states , manners , and languages , - the decline of much that is now grand and fair , the disappearance of much that is now in existence , the rise and growth of governments and races with their institutions and languages , as yet unconceived of , - and when the two centuries for which our republic has been in existence shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries from the establishment of annual archons at Athens to the battle of Marathon . Should this anticipation be realized of the rank , which Mr. I3ancroft 's work will take in American history , it may be considered in the nature of the last appeal of its subject-matters to the justice of the world . The first settlers of the North American states , the founders of our institutions , catholic , cavalier , or puritan , - the discoverers anti the explorers , - classes of men and individuals , - lights of church and of state , - persecuted sects , - generous but heart-broken adventurers , - will many of them appear to the latest posterity , to foreign nations , to the general reader of our history to the end of time , as they are represented in these pages . // The example of Roger Williams , already cited , proves the truth of our remark . We do not claim for Mr. Bancroft the undivided credit of having dragged up his bright arid worthy name , from the mud and rubbish of sectarian controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Bentley had formed a true conception of his character ; so had Dr. John Eliot in his New-England Biographical Dictionary , and Mr. Savage in his Notes to Winthrop , and Mr. Upbam in his most excellent Centennial Lecture , and especially Mr. Knowles , in his highly respectable Biography of Roger Williams . And yet see how inadequate a notion of his character had been conceived by Mr. Grahame , with all the original sources and half the recent comments at his command . Henceforward , as no man can well undertake to write on the history of the United States , without the work of Mr. Bancroft before him , he must either accept the delineation of Roger Williams therein contained , or show that it is erroneous . With the suifrages of the best writers on the subject in its favor , it is not likely that its accuracy will be disputed ; while its fullness and eloquence leave nothing to be desired , either in the way of detail or illustration . We do not go into an analysis of Mr. Bancroft 's work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the last number of the American Quarterly Review . Nor is it necessary , for our purpose , to engage more at large in the discussion of particular topics . Our readers may be assured , that from beginning to end , they will find it full of interest ; and the best instructed student of our history may read it with profit . Many considerable errors in the popular accounts are corrected ; new and original views of familiar subjects are presented , and every prominent topic is illustrated with animation and power . We might refer to the adventures of the settlers at Plymouth , to the expedition to Florida , to the description of the colonial life in Virginia , to Hooker 's emigration to the banks of the Connecticut , to the account of the Antinomian controversy , of the persecution of the Quakers , to the remarks on the insurrection in Scotland , to the general character of Puritanism ; - as specimens of the work , justifying , in various ways , all that we have said in its commendation . We rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume has met . It is well deserved , and should encourage him to persevere . Topics of stirring interest and VOL.XL. - No.S6. 16 // the bighest argument await him in the progress of the story . The character and fortunes of the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent ; the history of the Dutch in New York ; the character and labors of William Penn ; the early struggles with the Canadian French ; the political conflicts with the mother country , are noble chapters , which remain , even in the seventeenth century . The interest of the narrative will be amply sustained , in the curiosity of its incidents and the gravity of its discussions . It xvilL deserve the continuance of Mr. Bancroft 's laborious researches and conscientious and well weighed reflections , and it will amply reward him . If he pursue the work as he has begun it , he will , at the conclusion , stand in a position toward the American people , which the most gifted arid successful may envy ; and one as far beyond the prizes of an ordinary ambition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is beyond the breath of party favor . The work is vast , but not too great to be performed ; it is not beyond the compass of resolute , persevering , and well directed effort , which in itself does honor to man . The perseverance even of an humble capacity , in a good cause , is a spectacle to command approbation , though sometimes not wholly unproductive of saddening emotions ; but the high-hearted and indefatigable perseverance of a gifted mind , devoted to worthy ends , and inspired by pure principle , presents no mean image of that superior power , whose duration is as boundless as its intensity.
