txt Monday. - Read some remarks on Banking , addressed by a learned Professor in the University of Pennsylvania , to a member of Congress , from Philadelphia , and was delighted with them beyond measure . It is a common saying that colleges are half a century behind the rest of the world in practical information , but Professor Hare is evidently fifty years in advance of the present generation . Take his initial paragraph by way of example : " By the most zealous advocate of hard money , it can not be denied that , the cornpetency of specie to act as money is dependent altogether on its ability to create in // the mind of each successive holder , an expectation that it will pass as money at the value at which it may be received . They can not deny , that during a century in which a piece of coin may have been current , all those attributes which give it a value over other substances , have been inert . As a metal , it will have done nothing . Evidently its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confidence that it will pass in the market without depreciation . It follows , that whatever else may prove competent to produce a similar confidence , under like circumstances , must , as *noisey , be equivalent to coin . " Excellent ! The only utility of metallic money is its power of creating a confidence ! Excellent ! Excellent ! The conclusions at which the Professor arrives are worthy of his premises : " When the banks stopped specie payments in May last , every note which they had issued , and every credit given by them for deposits , , appeared to fall in value , relatively to gold and silver , from five to ten per cent . But is it to be inferred that there was an actual depreciation of their notes and credit to that amount i Was it not owing to a rise in the price of specie , which had become an object of demand for exportation , to pay the balance of trade with Europe , caused by a failure in the priceofourproduce ? * * * * * * Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power to redeem their notes or credits with specie , by impairing the credit of individuals , gave to hank notes and bank credits an unusually high value , so that the holder of them in lieu of being a sufferer , was a gainer by the change I Viewing the subject thus , would any thing have been more mischievous , absurd , and unjust , than to have forced them to resume specie payments , upon the plea of their legal liability , or to use the argument of Shylock , because IL it was in the bond . " Surely there is no wisdom like Whig wisdom . When banks suspend specie payments , their notes actually rise in value , and only appear to fall , just as the sun appears to revolve round the earth , though the earth actually revolves round the sun ! I am beginning to think that members of colleges are not as useless members of the community as some people suppose them to be . Certainly none but a Professor in a University could have discovered that the holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Saw a Loco-Foco passing by and called him in , hoping to convince him by the Professor 's logic . Found him utterly intractable . He said that money was not only a medium of exchange , but also a standard and measure of value , and that when it was metallic it had a value in itself independent of what it derived from its use as a commercial medium ; and that it was from want of a clear conception of this truth that so respectable a man as Professor Hare had uttered such strange paradoxes . Read to Loco-Foco the following passage from the Professor 's production , and asked him what he thought of it : " I do not consider a bank as the debtor of the note-holder or depositor , so long as their notes or credits are supported at the market price at which they were issued . The bank is virtually obligated to furnish a currency which will answer the purpose of money , so as to pass in the market without depreciation . Of course the bank ' stands in the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debtor , and becomes only so far liable as it may fail in its obligations . " // Loco-Foco was evidently puzzled by this distinction between debts and obligations . Indeed he confessed as much , for he said the whole of the Professor 's reasoning reminded him of a story 1*e had once heard , and which he would endeavor to repeat . A. certain Irishman went into a certain tavern and called for six pence worth of crackers . They were duly set before him , and after looking at them for some time , he inquired if the landlord would have any objection to exchange the crackers for six pence worth of brandy toddy . Certainly not , said Boniface . Paddy having finished his potation , was preparing to depart , when the landlord called out to him to pay for the toddy . " Pay for the toddy ! " ex .. claimed Patrick in amazement . " Did I not givt* you the crackers in pay I " " Well then , " said the landlord , " pay me for the crackers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! you unconscionable varmint ! Hav'nt you got the crackers ? " " You may go , " said the landlord , utterly confounded . " You have , in some way , diddled me out of six pence . I ca n't exactly tell how , but I am sure I have lost that much . You can go . " Now , said Loco-Foco , it has always appeared to me that the banks treat the people just as Paddy treated the tavern-keeper . They take two values from us , and give us one value in return . And in such a manner that few are able to discover the rationale of the process . Professor Hare , however , has laid the matter open , by shewing that the outstanding notes of a bank are no part of its debts . Tuesday. - Could not help laughing , in spite of myself , at the humor of a wag of a Loco-Foco from the country . I had bargained with him for five tons of hay to feed my carriage horses , and offered him bank notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book a note promising to pay me five tons of hay , and ordered his wagoner to drive off . " Now , " said he , " we are quits . You have given me promises to pay silver , and I have given you a promise to pay hay . Nothing can be fairer than promise against promise . " The rascal 's drollery diverted me so much that I paid him at once in gold . That old father to whom I sometime ago sold some of the best stocks in the market , came to me in great distress , complaining that the stocks were utterly worthless , and that lie was now left not only without property , but with a load of debts which he should never be able to discharge . Cheered him up as well as I could . Told him that this country was a fine field for enterprise , and that so far from repining , he ought to bless his stars , that in his long life of seventy-five years he had never failed before . What other business-man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance , could say as much ? I myself had failed not less than three times , but on no one of those occasions did I become disheartened . It // was true , indeed , that I always made such previous arrangements that my family were sensible of no change in their mode of living . I was duly impressed with the truth that " he who provideth not for his family , hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel . " Not willing to sink myself to a level with the wretched infidel LocoFocos , I always , before stopping payment , set my house in order , by securing to my wife , or infant daughter , a coach and countryseat , and such other little comforts and conveniences , as the usages of good society render indispensable . I did not , however , mention this to old father , for fear he should think I was reflecting on his want of Christian prudence in not having done likewise . We can not be too delicate in our treatment of the feelings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file of the National Intelligencer , I was forcibly struck with the following remarks by a dis . tinguished Senator from Kentucky , delivered by him on the twentyfirst of June , 1838 : " He had denounced a military aspirant , and denounced him in language which he was proud to have used , when he had exclaimed , send us war , pestilence , and famine , rather than curse us with a military rule : and if he could then have foreseen that this execrahie measure , the Sub-Treasury , would have been introduced by the influence which he then deprecated , he would then have denounced it as he did now , as not at all preferable to war , pestilence , and famine , and as not inferior to any one of them in its malign effects on the welfare and prosperity of the country . " Exactly my opinion . Give us war rather than the Sub-Treasury bill ! Neither the Senator nor myself will have any thing to do with the fighting . That must all be done as in the last war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy of the country : provided enough of them are left to do the hard work , I care not how many of them are killed . Besides this , a war would entail on the country a permanent national debt ; and every body knows that a national debt is a national blessing . Funding and banking being twin brothers , only give us a sufficient national debt , and our paper money institutions will live forever . With a large and permanent national debt , we might reduce the working-men of America into as complete subjection as their brethren in England . Give us pestilence rather than the Sub.Treasury ! Yes , give us pestilence ! In that event the Senator and myself would not be as far from personal danger as in the event of war . Yet we might venture on the risk . Pestilence generally spends its violence in the hovels of the poor . It might be almost as effective as war in ridding the country of those wretched vermin , the Loco-Focos . Give us famine rather than the Sub-Treasury ! Yes , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will have plenty to eat . As to the Loco-Focos , they are pretty well used to starving already , or , if they are not , it is quite time they should be . Give us war , pestilence , and famine altogether , rather than de . // prive the banks and speculators of the use of the public money . A. war is , above all , specially desirable . Smart men never do so well as in time of war . What with army and navy contracts , and contracts for loans , and fluctuations of currency , and irregularity in the supply of commodities , fortunes can be made with rapidity in times of public hostility , and the sooner such times commence the better for all the Grab-aIls and Gripe-ails and Grasp-alls in the whole country . This amiable and eloquent extract proves how truly worthy this distinguished statesman is of the confidence of the Whigs . Even in his prayers and figures of speech , he never forgets our principles . The evils of ivar , pestilence , and famine , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , would infallibly tend to make the rich richer , and the poor poorer , the cardinal maxim of our political faith . This renders it indispensable , in my opinion , that he should receive the nomination of the Harrisburg Convention . Thursday. - Heard to-day of the defeat of the Sub-Treasury bill . Glorious , glorious news indeed ! Not that I concur in opinion with those who think that the passage of the bill would destroy the banks . We should still be able to levy a tax on the whole commerce of the country ; and if the Loco-Foco absurdity of compelling the banks to pay specie is to be persisted in , why , perhaps , a Constitutional Treasury would only act as a balance-wheel in the machine . But then it would curtail our stock-jobbing and land speculations . Here is the rub . But even this is not the grand evil of the Sub-Treasury system . *y grand objection to it is , that it would increase executive patronage . I know not who it was that first discovered that giving the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some four or five Receiver Generals , and they , in their turn , to appoint some eight or ten clerks , would be conferring on the Executive more patronage than he would have , if he , or the Secretary of the Treasury under him , should have the selecting of some twenty-five banks , and thereby the power of directly influencing their numerous officers , and indirectly influencing their thousands of stockholders and debtors . I say I know not who it was first made this profound discovery . But , certainly , he must be a man of uncommon powers of mind . No one can fail to be convinced of this who reflects on the fact , that under the proposed system , the Treasury officers would be punishable as criminals if they lent or used a single dollar of the public money ; and that the President himself could not touch even the amount of his own salary except on warrant , duly signed , countersigned , and registered , according to law . Now , that such a system would increase executive patronage , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem rather like an increase of Executive responsibility , ' . // But there are , fortunately , some uncommon minds in the world , and to one of these we must be indebted for this discovery in political science , as great as the greatest of Franklin 's in natural philosophy . No doubt we shall see in time to whom this great honor is due ; or , as they say in French , nous verrons . Judge Johnson of West-Quoddy Head , came in , but instead of crying " Laus Deo " or " Victoria , " he shook his head gravely . As a man 's shaking his head is a sure indication that there is something in it , I resolved to pump it out , and at length I succeeded . The Judge doubted if the defeat of the Sub-Treasury bill was so great a victory after all . Banks ought to cease to be political machines and become commercial institutions . As such they would be useful to the community . As at present constituted and conducted , all the ad. - vantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were acting very impoliticly in keeping open the Sub-Treasury question . They ought to have suffered the bill to pass without debate . By the clamor they had raised , they were provoking inquiry into the general characteristics of the banking system , which was precisely what the Loco-Focos desired . Told Judge Johnson that I feared we had made a blunder , but it was too late to correct it now . Friday. - Like well enough a victory over the Government , but do not like one of the consequences that victory brings with it . There is now no longer any excuse for our not resuming specie payments , and with the general resumption of specie payments away go our great profits on exchanges , and may be our cotton monopoly will go with them . By an understanding with certain corporations in the South-West , our bank and certain other banks in this quarter have been doing a very snug business . Buying up Mississippi notes at a discount of thirty or forty per cent. , then buying cotton with these notes , thus creating a fund for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , was truly as pretty a mode of operating as reasonable men could desire . The profits were certainly not less than thirty per cent . per annum on the amount of capital invested . But our odious Government and the stupid people combined , are putting an end to all this . And this too , after our Whig editors and Whig orators and Whig collegians have proved as clear as day , that " the less gold and silver there is in a country , the richer that country is " - " that when the banks suspend payment their notes are actually more valuable than they were before , and only appear to fall in value , " with other truths equally recondite and equally well established . Saturday. - Banking and politics have , somehow , got so strangely commingled , that both for pleasure and profit , I spend my leisure in perusing the newspapers . To-day , I read and was much pleased , with an argument from an illustrious Conservative of Virginia going // 1S38 . Of a Certain Bank Director . to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , would give European powers a just cause of war against this country . The Loco-Focos say they can not see how this could be , inasmuch as we should honestly pay in cotton or other produce for such quantities of the precious metals as we should take from Europe . They add , also , that the whole amount of gold and silver in the world is , according to the estimates of the most able authors , equal in value to not less than ten thousand millions of dollars , and that as we should require only eighty or one hundred millions , in addition to our present stock , to enable us to dispense with paper money , they can not see how we should give offence to foreign powers by adopting this policy . But , they sub . join , as it is by gradual means that we propose to introduce solid money , if European powers object to letting us have it , we can at-. tam our end by detaining such amounts of gold and silver as will , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Ame .. rica . To all this , I have one short reply . The Loco-Focos are fools . None are wise but the Virginia Conservative and men of his way of thinking . An attempt to substitute metallic for paper money in this country , would undoubtedly give European powers just cause of war against us , though , for reasons already stated , I do not think war is to be deprecated . I know not to which to give the preference , to the illustrious Conservative from Virginia , or his equally illustrious brother from South Carolina , who has proved that the addition of five millions to our metallic medium which the Sub-Treasury system would make necessary , would sink the price of cotton so low in Europe , that the Southern planters would lose incalculable sums . Take it all together , I think Conservative wisdom preferable to even XVhig wisdom . It is deeper and more ingenious . McThwackem agrees with me perfectly in this . He says that the English language is too meagre for the expression of the thoughts of either Whigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and currency ought to be turned into Latin to give them their proper effect . But Conservative wisdom is so thoroughly transcendental that nothing short of Greek is adequate to its just expression . Sumday. - Did not go to church to-day . My clerical friends , the Rev. Matthew McThwackem L. L. D. and the Rev. Jeremy Diddler D. D. are both at a watering place , and I have no disposition to be bored , as I have been of late , by discourses from strange parsons about honesty , fair dealing , and all that sort of thing . When the pure gospel is preached , that is to say faith alone , without any reference to charity and good works , no person is more disposed than myself to pay due respect to the ministers of religion , or to be more attentive to the means of grace . No one shall ever // see my seat vacant when Diddler or McThwackem fills the pulpit . But I can not abide heresy . However , I trust I did not spend the day wholly without profit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Diddler , partly about things spiritual and partly about things world ly . I hope their religious zeal for the benefit of the poor giddy mortals at the watering place , will not induce them to relax their exertions for the promotion of the rail-road and other speculations in which we all three are so deeply interested . They have families to provide for as well as myself , and ought to recollect that coaches and country seats are great conveniences , or rather absolute necessaries of life . Nothng would grieve me more than to see these two patterns of piety and most excellent friends of mine , reduced to the necessity of trudging through the mud , after the manner of the wretched , infidel Loco-Focos . Monday. - The impudence of the Loco-Focos does actually exceed all bounds . This morning there was found pasted on our bank door the following advertisement : PROPO5AL5 Will be received for building a Sub-Treasury Office , and furnishing the same with sliding shelves , and hydrostatic balances . The building must be constructed of the best materials , and suitably provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vault must be divided into two compartments ; the first , or " Loco-Foco department , " for gold and silver : the second , or " Conservative department , " for the safe keeping of bank notes . Architects and others are invited to send in their proposals to Deacon Graball , who will , in due season , forward them to the seat of Government . The time when this advertisement appeared marks the depravity of the age . As it was found on the bank door early on Monday morning , it must have been put there on Sunday evening . And this is the way in which the Loco-Focos spend that sacred day ! The recent elections must have inspirited them , or they would never have had the audacity to get out such an advertisement . Tuesday. - Sorely troubled about my eldest son , Tom . He is sadly afflicted with fits of absence of mind . Though a leading member of our Temperance Society , and a rigid total abstinence man , he sometimes , in his fits of abstraction , gulps down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at much , for gin and water are so nearly of the same color that I am myself sometimes deceived by the similitude . But then he makes the same mistake with brandy . These fits come on him so often that his very horse seems to have caught them from him . This I had occasion to observe some short time ago , when I borrowed Tom 's horse and buggy to drive McThwackem some eight miles from town , to lay the corner-stone of a new church . The horse stopped , of his own accord , at the door of every tavern on the road , and would not move forward except on application of the whip . Sometimes when Tom is half way on his // road to church , these fits of absence of mind come on him , and he goes to houses of an indescribable **26;1102;TOOLONG , for example . Once the poor boy started to go to a camp-meeting , and never drew up till he got to a race-ground . The most troublesome symptoms of these fits of absence of mind have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's names to notes , and then raising money on them . I have often had to pay large sums on this account ; and the occasions have become so frequent of late , as really to prove very burdensome . Tom , when spoken to on the subject , laid all the fault on his Miss , who was always getting money from him . Asked Tom why he kept so expensive a Miss . Said he could not help it ; sposed it was predesti-. nated . ' Told Tom not to come over me in that way , for if it was predestinated that he should act the fool , it was also predestinated that he should suffer for his folly . The poor , innocent boy , ( he is " only thirty years old " ) was evidently affected at my treating him in a manner so different from my wont ; and my paternal feelings utterly subduing me , I gave him money to hush up the affair . Could not , however , help telling him that it was well he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the son of some wretched Loco-Foco , it might have gone hard with him . Finding myself much in want of consolation , I sent for old Parson Maultext , and told him of my griefs . But he , instead of healing my wounds , only tore them open afresh . He said if parents , by successful speculations , took away from their children the necessity for industry , it must be expected that , unless their education were carefully guarded , the children would run riot in all kinds of excesses . This was all the comfort I got . *y poor child 's misfortunes spoken of as downright profligacy-just as if he had been the son of some wretched Loco-Foco . Wednesday. - Turned a penny to-day in a way I am almost ashamed to narrate , but in these hard times one must not be over scrupulous about the ways and means one takes to get ways and means to pay one 's just debts . A poor , hardworking Loco-Foco , a boot and shoe maker , whose stock in trade , and house furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me some time ago for a loan of five hundred . From my anxiety to assist the poor , which has always been the leading passion of my life , I readily lent him the money , taking a bill of sale of all his goods and chattels , by way of collateral security . It so happened that I wanted the money back sooner than I had expected , and sooner than Loco-Foco was prepared to pay it . The consequence was , that all his stock in trade , and his furniture , became my property . His wife and children were much afflicted at the loss of their little all , and so should I have been too , // if the man had not been a hard money man in his sentiments , and , of course , an infidel . So far all was well . I got the boots and shoes , leather straps , lap-stones , and all , of Loco-Foco . To-day an opportunity occurred of disposing of them to advantage . Another Loco Foco , a flour dealer , applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I had it not to lend , but was willing to let him have my note for three thousand dollars , which I could insure him would be promptly discounted at our bank . Loco said fifteen hundred were all he wanted . Told Loco I could not think of engaging in so small a transaction ; but that if he would take his brother Loco ' s shoes and boots , and pots and pans , and beds and bedding , at a valuation of fifteen hundred dollars ( which I esteemed very low ) and would give me a mortgage on his own house for the remaining fifteen hundred dollars , he should have the note for three thousand instanter . Loco demurred to this . What could he , a flour dealer , do with boots shoes , lasts and lap-stones I Told him that no doubt , his brother Loco , the original owner of them , would be very glad to buy them of him on credit . However , I did not wish to press the subject on him . Loco Foco spent several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in some other way , but as all the banks had come to a resolution not to advance a cent to any person at all infected with the horrible doctrines of LocoFocoism , and as the brokers all knew that there was a negotiation then pending between him and me , and they did not like to offend me by interfering , he found his only chance of saving himself was in accepting my offer . He paid me the fifteen hundred dollars in hand for the shoe-maker 's stock and furniture , and the shoe-maker has got his lap-stones back , which rather pleases me , though he is a Loco-Foco , and , of course , an infidel . As for flour dealer LocoFoco , his house adjoins some property of mine , and when I get possession of it , I can make some valuable improvements there which I have long had in contemplation . It can not be long before the transfer will take place . The very means the flour dealer has taken to extricate himself from one difficulty will lead him into others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already the title deeds . Thursday. - Received to-day some very wrathful letters from a bevy of farmers who had wished to emigrate to the West , and to whom I had sold certain choice spots on Newcraft 's celebrated three mil . lion acre tract . They find the whole of the land they bought of me , ten feet under water . I can not help that . I sold it to them as I bought it . The law maxim , caveat emptor , let the purchaser be on his guard , ' plainly applies to this case . After all , they have got a good bargain . The alluvial which the western rivers deposit is // very rich ; and I have no doubt that in about fifteen years these lands will all be in a fit state for cultivation . Friday. - Well , there is one of my children , at least , with whom I have abundant cause to be satisfied . My second son , Bob , who set out a few years ago with nothing but a letter of advice ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with a fortune of at least half a million . To relate Bob 's story would be as good as to write a treatise on banking , for it illustrates all the art and mystery of our craft . When Bob arrived at his place of destination he had not one cent in his pocket , but he so ingratiated himself with his landlady and his washerwoman , that they made no demand for payment for a whole month , and by this time he had established so good a credit with the storekeepers and other substantial residents , that he found it easy enough to pay his board and incidental expenses . When those from whom he borrowed wished to be repaid , he always got the means by borrowing from others . Being an industrious , enterprising lad , he immediately set to work to establish a bank . He found some who were as needy as himself , but not half as knowing , easily persuaded to sign a petition to the Legislature for a charter . The substantial class of citizens he did not at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money to pay the ex penses of his journey to the State Capital , borrowed the money to sup port himself while there , borrowed the money to b'iy the Champagne with which he drenched the members of the Legislature , borrowed the money to pay for the sumptuous dinners and suppers with which he feasted them ; and , finally , after he had got a bill passed e*actly to his liking , borrowed the money to carry himself to his new home . It was amusing enough to hear him relate how he worked his way along-how by treating one member to a bottle of Champaigne , he thereby ingratiated himself with that member so as to borrow A. enough from him to treat another member , and so on , till he had treated them all round , and then begin again . When he got back to his new home , he had to borrow money enough to buy blank books , and pens and ink , wherewithal the Commissioners might receive subscriptions for the stock of the new bank . The number of shares being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coin borrowed for one half hour from various friends in the neigh borhood . Having the example of moral and religious New England before him , Bob had no scruple in swearing that the coin paid in was the property of the bank . At this crisis a difficulty occurred that was truly alarming . The engraver who had the bank notes pre pared , refused to deliver them up except for cash . But Bob whose resources of mind are equal to any exigency , got over this difficulty in a way he did not tell me , and then by buying desks and a counter // on credit , brought the bank into immediate operation . At first the more substantial inhabitants were shy about receiving the notes , and still more shy about touching the stock of the bank . By little and little , Bob dispelled their fears . By circulating his notes at a distance from the bank , he kept them out a long time . By various means , he contrived to accumulate a stock of specie , the whole of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be generally known how abundant specie was with him , he had his agents out who , under one pretext or another , used to request their friends as a matter of favor to go to the bank to get notes exchanged for them . As the silver thus paid out , came back the same day , Bob made a small sum effect a great many exchanges . By arts like this , the notes of Bob 's Bank became current in the whole country round , and he found one dollar in silver quite sufficient to support a circulation of twenty in paper . The more substantial citizens still showed little disposition to touch the stock ; but when at the end of six months , the bank declared a dividend of ten per cent. , they became so eager to bite , that Bob 's first impulse was to sell all out , and let them have the whole con. * cern to themselves . A little reflection convinced him that this would be folly . He , however , as a favor , parted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wealthy , and whose habits were such that he was sure that they would never interfere with his management . By these means he increased the anxiety of the others to buy , and inspired such general confidence in the bank that all the spare cash in the neighborhood was left with him for safe-keeping . Being a good Democrat-that is to say , a Democrat by trade ( heaven forefend that any son of mine should be a Democrat in principle ) - being a good Democrat by trade , he got a snug slice of the public deposits . Then commenced scenes of unexampled prosperity . The prices of property of all kind were doubled , trebled , quadrupled . Enterprises of all kind were invigorated . The whole style of living was changed . The young women forsook their spinning and knitting , to play upon pianos and dance cotillions . The young men laid down their mechanical tools and agricultural implements , that they might partake of the gentlemanly recreations suited to their age . The great increase of wealth , and the advance of refinement which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , equally gratifying and astonishing . It really did my old heart good , to hear that a son of mine had , while advancing his o*wn fortune , done so much towards promoting the prosperity of his country . But who can stand up against the atrocious experiments of our detestable Government . Even the " great financier** with his thirty-five millions of capital has sometimes quailed ; what wonder , then , that my son Bob 's bank which began business without any capital at all , should be brought into straits . // I do not allude here to its stopping payment in common with the other banks of the country : that was a blessing to both the banks and the community . But , through a series of disasters , the notes of Bob 's bank became greatly depreciated , till at length the other banks refused to take them at all , and then they became worth nothing . Bob was game to the last . lie saw the storm approach . ing when he was the principal debtor to the bank . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was indebted , by prevailing on the other directors to receive in their place , the notes of other men he had on hand , men , which his enemies say , were men of straw , but Bob , on his honor , assures me , they Were all first rate men , and equal at least to the Rathbuns , the Hermans , &amp;c. &amp;c. , up to the very day before that on which they stopped payment . Bob thus got payment of all the debts that were due to him , and paid all the debts that he owed , leaving him unencumbered productive property of the value of five hundred thousand dollars . He did , indeed , lose a little on his bank stock , but he does not regard this , having sold out the greater part of his shares at an enormous advance , and retained so many only as were necessary to qualify him for the office he held in the bank . I will pit my son Bob against any man 's son in the country , " the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any father 's heart . Saturday. - Devoted part of to-day to a tenth reading of the letters of the " great financier . " I have heard some who ought to know better , talk of this truly great man in rather disparaging terms-speak of him as a mere clerk with a pen behind his ear lending other people 's money , and instead of attending properly to his business , on the principles of commercial banking , engaging in stock-jobbing , wholesale pawabroking , and all kinds of political intrigue . " Where , " they ask , " is the evidence of his great skill as a banker ? With thirty-five millions of capital , and credit which gave him the command of at least as much more , he was one of the first to suspend specie payments . The cause which led the other leading banks in the country to stop payment , namely , the distribution of the public money among the States , did not immediately affect him , for he had none of that money on deposit . As for what he avers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Specie Circular and the Bank of England 's withdrawing its support from the American merchants in London , these commenced their operation . nearly a year before . As a " great financier " he ought to have foreseen their effects , and guarded against their disastrous consequences on his own institution . If he had maintained specie payments for only one month , after the other banks suspended , the Government would , under the existing laws , have been // compelled to employ his bank as its sole financial agent , and thus his triumph over the Government , which is the wish dearest to his heart , would have been complete . Over and above this , the art of a banker consists in his making every body pay interest to him , while he pays interest to nobody . The " great financier " has so managed matters that the amount on which his bank is paying interest seems nearly to equal the amount of its active investments beyond the capital paid in . It is ever thus : " Envy does ment as its shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of John Law , the illustrious founder of the Mississippi scheme , and of the equally illustrious projector of the South Sea bubble , in terms equally disparaging . Even Timothy Dexter did not escape reproach , and I have lately read a biography of Samuel Terry , the Rothschild of Botany Bay , in which that truly great and good man is spoken of in a manner anything but laudatory . The persons who speak in this way about the " great financier , * , may have a very adequate acquaintance with banking as a science , but they do not reflect sufficiently on the difference between the science and the art of banking . There can be no doubt that the " great financier ' * having no public money to transfer , and having the control of some seventy or eighty millions of capital , might , by taking due measures in due time , have avoided suspending specie payments . But , then , what would have become of the stock and other speculations in which his friends , to say nothing of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a banker 's duty to take care of his friends or himself ? And , after all , did not the bank gain largely by the suspension of specie payments ? And if our odious Government , and the stupid people , and the other banks had only let the " great financier " alone , the same blessed suspension might , according to a hint given in one of his letters , have been continued for twenty-four years , or for as long a period as payments were suspended by the Bank of England . Let the envious and the malicious carp as they may , the " great financier " is the very Napoleon Bonaparte of the times  --  the greatest man living . Who else but he could , besides managing seventy or eighty millions of capital , in various parts of the world , and in various branches of business , and managing it all well-who else but he , could find time to regulate the elections , afterwards regulate the members of the State Legislature when they are elected , keep Congress in due order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find leisure to illuminate the public on the subject of currency and finance ? In the multitude of his avocations , political , commercial , and literary , he more nearly resembles Mohammed Ali , Pacha of // Egypt , than any other gentleman of my acquaintance , but he goes far beyond Mohammed . Sunday. - As my two beloved spiritual guides are both absent from the city , I did not go to church to-day . I can not endure the Maultexts and the Mangletexts who supply their pulpits , and who are always prating about what they are pleased to call a good life as essential * religion .  --  but what a blessed institution the Sabbath is ! I know not how a poor creature like myself , busily engaged from morning till night on week days , could ever get along but for the intervention of this precious day of repose . On Sunday I always feel so tranquil and collected , that , between sermons , I review my transactions of the past week , and lay my plans for that which has just commenced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I devote the time of service to meditating on the best ways and means of increasing my riches , and consequently advancing the welfare of my poor fellow travellers to eternity . To-day , as I did not go to church I spent most of the time in posting my books . Posting books on a Sunday , as a general practice , I do not approve ; but works of necessity must be attended to . I should not exactly like my friends of the Journal of to know how I was employed , though I was so wary it is almost impossible that my conduct should bring any scandal on the cause of religion . Monday. - Rumors have of late been afloat that the " great financier " has turned Loco-Foco . They sorely trouble some of our friends , especially those in the Middle States , on whom he has been pressing heavily , in order that he may strengthen his means for bringing the South-Western States into complete subjection . But such reports do not affect me . I know the man too well to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that my son Bob became a Democrat . That such a change should take place in appearance is quite possible , for he has political as well as pecuniary objects to a ( lvance ; and , I have no doubt , would rather see himself President than either the " Hero of Tippecanoe , " or the " Orator of Ashland , " or even " the god-like man " of our American Athens . Still some of his movements were rather puzzlin g . But that tranquillity of mind which the blessed Sabbath always brings with it , has enabled me at length , as I think , to fathom his designs . He has already established one agency at London , and another at Liverpool . To these be probably means to add others in various parts of South America , at Canton , and other parts of Asia , to say nothing of Botany Bay and Van Dieman 's land . I hope sincerely he will embrace New South Shetland in his plan . By agencies thus numerous , and remote from one another , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will , by its magnificence , utterly astound the invent.prs of that noble art . He will draw a bill on Rio , and take that up by a bill on Valparaiso . This he will redeem by a bill // on the North West Coast , and then redeem that by a bill on Canton . When this is due , take it up by a bill on Botany Bay , ( there are several banks there already ) and that by a bill on Van Dieman ' s land , ( where there is at least one bank . ) The next step will be to New South Shetland , and then he can proceed round and round the globe . This system will come nearer the plan my excellent friend Newcraft* has for many years been trying to discover , than any thing I have ever met with . Neweraft 's grand object has been to mature a system of banking by which the disagreeable necessity of ever paying at all , may be avoided . Postponing payment indefinitely , by drawing and counterdrawing on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never paying at all  --  and if the " great financier 's " bank should chance to be bursted in bringing the system to perfection , why , then there will be only a verbal difference between postponing payment indefinitely and never paying at all . I sometimes think this maybe part of the " great financier*s** design . No greater evidence can be given of skill in the art of banking , than by now and then breaking a bank at the proper time . He is extremely fond of comparing banidug and steam-power , and I have often had occasion to think of the comparison , in reflecting on the fate of that noble steam-boat , the " Nick Biddle . " When that magnificent vessel first made her appearance in front of the orderly city of Yicksburg , where there seem to be more banks than churches , the multitude on the shore greeted her with loud huzzas. her name alone sufficed to inspire in that calm and Quaker-like population this hearty enthusiasm . But , in some few months after , the noble boat burst her boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McThwackem tells a story so pat to the point , that if I had any body to listen to me I would endeavor to repeat it. - As it is altogether too good to be lost , I must tell it to myself . In the western part of New York is the beautiful village of JackDowningsville , to which the *lickville Yankees go to finish their cdiication , before they venture to extend their benevolent labors to the inhabitants of " that great moral wilderness , ' * the valley of the Mississippi , just as certain Swiss go to holland to be polished before they repair to Paris . At this interesting little place a juggler was once exhibiting his powers , arid his skill was so great that he utterly astonished even that worthy people , to whom legerdemain , in some at least of its branches , is so easy , that it seems to have been born with them . He thrust swords down his throat till nothing but the hilts were visible , and yet remained unwounded . He swallowed prussic acid by the spoonful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pint-bottle , and yet retained his natural size and shape . Loud were the plaudits he received , which increased as the enter . tainment was prolonged , for each trick seemed more wonderful than that which had preceded it . At length , when the admiration of the spectators had reached a point it seemed impossible to surpass , he exclaimed , " Now , ladies and gentlemen , I will perform a feat greater than any you have yet seen . " Without more ado , he took a pistol and blew his own brains out . The company , having seen the wonders he had previously performed , waited for some time in silent expectation that he would collect his brains again , and stand before them a living man as at first . At length they became impatient , and loud cries of " go on l go on *-what next ? what next ? " resounded through the room . But the poor juggler could go no further . This wonderful feat was his last . By some of his operations the " great financier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juggler by his feats amazed the people of the little town in the ivest of New York . Is this magnificent system of exchanges to be his last , or are we to exclaim " WHAT NEXT ? " Ca*tera desunt. * * In a private note to us , Deacon Graball states that the line in Latin with which he closes , was presented to him gratuitously by his beloved pastor , the Reverend Dr. McThwackem , to whom he had applied for something pithy and pertinent to finish with . He adds , he was induced to wish for at least one classical quotation to adorn this part of his diary , from having observed how pretty the sprinkling of Latin appeared in the celebrated " black broth and iron money " speech of the illustrious Conservative from South Carolina . " I know not , " says the Deacon , " what may be the meaning of my Latin sentence , but I hope there is nothing wicked in it . " We must tell the Deacon that there is something very wicked in it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the last we are to see of his diary . so , the rising generation will be deprived of all that moral benefit they could not fail to derive from a perusal of other private memorials of so very pious a man , and so very patriotic a citizen . Is it not wicked in him to withhold from others a knowledge of the means by which he has acquired his wealth , and to which he owes his usefulness , seeing that he thereby prevents them from becoming as wealthy and as useful as himself i There is , however , another sense in which the Latin line may be taken , and this we hope is the right one . It may mean simply that the history of " the great finan*ier " is not finished . The preparations for the last great feat being but just begun , the catastrophe , of course , can not now be given.
