txt This book has been for some time before the public , and we have attempted to notice it before , but various circumstances have prevented . We regret this omission the less , however , since we have seen the success of this and the preceding work of the same writer . They are of a kind which have prejudices to encounter and overcome , before they can make way into that general use for which they were designed . But from what we know of their merits , and what we have seen of their circulation , we feel persuaded that the author will be rewarded , by knowing that he has been useful to thousands who desired to read the Scriptures with understanding , and have so often met with difficulties , that they have been almost in despair . There seems to us to be a little misunderstanding with respect to the pktinness of the Scriptures . In all that relates to the doctrines and duties of our religion , particularly the latter , they are plain as the light of heaven can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' truth on these subjects , ' can easily find it ; for , if he find difficulties at first , he moves in a path like that of the just , which shines brigbter and hrighter as lie advances . Undoubtedly many subjects may be suggested , even by the simplest passages of Scripture , which are not easily understood . But if any are disappointed thus , they must be aware that there exists no necessity , on their part , either to agitate or understand them ; for , so far as regards the formation of character , the knowledge of practical- truth , the right restraint of the passions , and the proper use and cultivation of all the immortal powers , no one is left in doubt or darkness by the written word of God . Moreover , every year that passes over us is throwing light cn parts that have been obscure , not only by direct theological investigation , but by the discoveries of science , the reseai*ches of travellers , the inquiries of historians ,  --  and , in fact , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are vigorously exerted . And in the main purpose which the Scriptures were intended to answer ,  --  that of preparing men for another state of existence , to which all , whether prepared or uot , must *o , // it is the chief glory of their inspiration , as it is the beauty of the holiness they inspire , that the same truth , which makes the archangel wonder and adore , stoops , with divine simplicity , to the unenlightened and even the infant mind . But it would not follow , that , because the Scriptures were plain as written , they should be plain as translated . Translation is always a difficult and delicate thing . The idiomatic expressions of one language can not be translated into another , because , in many cases , when they would convey any means Ing , so far from being the true one , it would he precisely the reverse of it . We see examples of this kind in the New Testament , where certain events fulfilled certain ancient predictions ; and it is said that such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they took place on purpose to fulfil the predictions ; whereas the wonder was , that the order of events should , without any direct and intended agency , have so directly fulfilled the prediction . By a similar inversion , our Saviour is made to thank his Father that thou hast hid these things from the wise ' of ages past , when the subject of his gratitude is that , having hid these things from the wise of ancient times , it has pleased God to reveal them in the latter days . Besides expressions and phrases , there are words which can not be translated for want of a corresponding English term . Thus the Greek verb to have , ' in some cases signifies use as well as possession , and can only be rendered by our American word Improve , ' which , in this active capacity , improving an estate , ' for example , has not the honor of being an English word . The common verb to be , ' also signified often continued existence* Thus Peter said , It is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for us to remain , or to live here . Some words have not merely chaiiged , but absolutely reversed their meaning since the days of King James . This is true of such terms as let , signifying to hinder ; and of the word prevent , as sometimes used in the Scriptures . It is true , that such things do not often occur where they would embarrass those who are searching for practical truth and duty , which are by far the most important purposes for which the Scriptures were given . Still it would be better that they should not exist ; for unless men can understand the sacred writings , they will not read them ; and difficulties of this kind might be serious obstacles to those not much in the habit of reading or thinking* where they would not even be perceived by the learned or the thoughtful . // It is neither our province nor our desire , to discuss the question respecting the necessity or advantage of a new trans-. lation of the Scriptures ; a question which has been before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of every party . On the contrary , we wish to recommend this work as one which may he equally acceptable to either side , and to show that those who maintain that a new version of the whole is unnecessary , will do well to encourage every attempt to throw light upon the several parts . For *ll agree that there are difficult passages in the Bible , which it is well to understa*d , for the reason given by the highest of all possible authorities , - that when a person reads the word x ithout understanding it , it easily perishes from his heart . That such passages are numerous , and important enough to require the substitution of a new version for the present , is denied by many religious men , who maintain that the present one is excellent , with the exception of a few words and phrases , which have lost their meaning in the lapse of years ; and that it is also recommended by many venerable associations , which should not be broketi without reasons of the most pressing importance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thrown upon the interpretation of the Scriptures in modem times ,  --  that those associations should attach themselVes to the truths revealed , and not to the accidental form in which uninspired men translated them from one lan-. guage to another ;  --  and that to contend , as earnestly as many do , for the present version , shows that they deem words more important than things , forgetting that words are the daughters of earth - things are the sons of heaven . ' Now it strikes us , that to answer the strong reasons of those who propose a sul ) stitution , the other party must encourage such works as this , that they may have it in their power to say that there is no need of such a substitution ; - for they certainly do not wish to plead for the mistakes and errors . They allow that there is much that might be altered for the better ; why not then give a welcome to works which respect and retain what is excellent , and only alter what requires alteration ? Why not patronize works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general good , and only change what all allow would be the better for alteration ? This work is founded upon the established version . It differs widely from the former work of the same author , and for good and substantial reasons . The Book of Job requires more of that ex-. // planation which a new translation affords , than any book perhaps in all the Scriptures . Its author is wholly unknown , so that no light can be thrown upon his probable meaning in any case , from what we know of his history , character arid opinions . The country where the scene is laid , is determined only by doubtful and imperfect conjecture ; so that , instead of explaining the local allusions by what we know of the country , we only know the country by the local allusions . The theology of the book has no reference to the Hebrew revelation , so that no knowledge of Jewish antiquities can aid in the interpretation . Under these circumstances , it is not surprising that the translation of this book in our Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor that Mr. Noyes , while he acknowledged the general excellence of the English version , and declared that no version ought to succeed , which did not resemble it , should have felt obliged to depart from it as freely and as often as he did . No thoughtful man of any party ever read it with*. out being troubled by difficulties at every step of his way ; and the simple endeavor to correct the errors in it was sufficient to lead to a version almost entirely new . The best way of answering the objections founded upon these errors is to confess that they exist ; but there are popular works within the reach of every one which will abundantly explain , so that it is not necessary to resort to the revolutionary process of substitution . In the work before us , Mr. Noyes , without departing from his principle , has departed less from the common version . We commend his judgment in so doing , wherever he found it consistent with his design . For the common version , so far from being , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owes its excellence in great part to the works of previous translators , whose language was followed in it , as the language of the common version is by translators of the present day . The English translation of the Psalms has passed into universal use , wherever the English language is spoken . Its simple , expressive , and peculiar dialect is music and inspiration to a million hearts . It has been for ages the chosen and sacred channel in which devotion pours itself out to God . Who can wonder , that such associations twine themselves round the tree of life in the soul ? They might possibly increase and gather , so as to injure its growth ; but so long as they only add to its beauty and verdure , and since they can not outlast the short season of mortal life , it seems like sacrilege to hew them away . // There are thousands of the most serious and intelligent readers , who admit alteration where it is necessary to throw light upon the page , but would not welcome it for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phrase gives a wrong impression , they would be willing to give it up ; but for a less reason they would hardly consent to its removal , even to replace it with a better . There are so many of the best men , in every religious party , who share this natural feeling , that the judicious translator treats it with the greatest regard ; and translators of an opposite description , who carelessly disregard it , find it impossible to gain a hearing ,  --  and thus defeat their own purpose , however good and proper it may be . But while we name as a recommendation of Mr. Noyes 's work , that he has respected the English version of the Psalms , and only departed from it where it was necessary to give the true meaning , it seems to us that his work is not less adapted on that account to the purpose of those who , like Bishop Lowth , are in favor of an entire substitution* For they are well aware that if ever that substitution take place , it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power Their opposers misunderstand their views , when they say , in favor of the present version , that a number of divines , collected like those in James 's days , would not he likely to make a bette.r* This is the last course which those in favor of substitution would think of adopting . They would choose that the wotk should be the slow result of critical interpretation . They would select translations , or parts of translations , on which solitary scholars had spent their lives of labor , not for the sake of profit or pride , but which they have eng*iged in , heart and soul , from a desire to understand the oracles of God ; and which they have published to the world that others might see what they saw , and admire what they udmired . And so far from establishing a new version in such a manner that no subsequent improvement could be made , they would enjoin it as a duty on all who come after them to welcome every improvement , however small , and from whatever quarter it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified with the medium through which it is conveyed ; and they would remove the dust of ages , that we may see in the glass clearly , and not darkly , the rubstantial truth of the word of God .. While , then , we readily confess ourselves incompetent to decide a question which has been ab ! y debated by other hands , // and think it needless to state the opinion which we have formed , we feel safe in saying , that there is no class of readers who are not interested to encourage such works as this . Those who know the difficulty of translating the Old Testament , arising from the language in which it is written ,  --  a language , of which we have nothing more than the mouldering remains ,  --  from the arbitrary meaning which the Jews affixed to various words , as if on purpose to put them out of the reach of interpretation , - 4rom the injuries which the writings themselves have suffered from the bands of time , which makes dogs ' ears that no human power can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been left by careless and ignorant transcrihers ,  --  those who can estimate the labor and qualifications which such an enterprise requires , will he aware that they are such as no encouragement can overpay . And those who are quite unable to comprehend either the difficuhics or the industry that surmounts them , well know that there are many passages which they do not understand , and which at present they have no means of understand* Ing , since the learning which throws light upon them is locked up in libraries , where it is utterly inaccessible to thousands who are deeply interested to know its results at least , if not the steps by which learned men have reached them . These things can never be within their reach , unless they extend encouragement to those who endeavor to supply their wants ,  --  and , casting aside all local and party prejudices , acknowledge that the efforts of such men are meritorious , and give them a hearty welcome and applause . No part of the Old Testament is easy to translate , even to the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ se visionary as to hope to satisfy all others , unless he hopes to accomplish more than ever vet was done . The Psalms present more difficulties than other parts , because they are not the work of a single hand . The 6reat object of the translator is to make himself familiar with the mind , character , habitual expression , and accidental peculiarities of his author ; and when he has ascertained these points to his own satisfaction , he proceeds with a rapidity and confidence which he can not have in other cases . When these things are unknown , he can not possibly determine in any doubtful passage xvhat would be the probable meaning of the author , which is an indispensable guide in choosing between different interpretations . The Psalms were divided into five books , collected at unknow // times and by unknown hands . Seventy*one of the Psalms were written by David ; and the knowledge we have of his character and history throws abundant light upon the obscure parts of his writings ; but no such light can be cast upon the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Asaph , who is to us nothing but a name , but of which the greater part are nameless and wholly destitute of internal evidence , which would help to determine who the writer may have been . Mr. Noyes represents the editor of the first book as collecting the Psalms of David alone ; the second , such psalms of David as were not in the former book , with some others by different hands . The three last were miscellaneous . But as the first collection contains some which appear to have been written during the captivity , it seems probable that even that was not made till after the return from Babylon . Poems , thus covering centuries of the Hebrew history , and abounding in allusions to circumstances and times , it is evident can not be easily translated ; beside that , in the trausmigratmon of the poetical spirit from one language to another , the beauty and power are very apt to be lost . We say , then , that every thing which tends to explain these writings should he encouraged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the detailed process ; for they come with but little pretension ; not many can be aware of the amount of exertion they must have cost and the translator sacrifices the display of his learning , which some would consider a loss of one of its best rexvards . The Psalms are cherished as a sacred treasure , by the simple and the wise ,  --  by Christi*mn , Mahometan , and Jew ,  --  we may even say by infidels , for cultivated sceptics always profess to admire the lofty poetry of the Old Testament , while they neglect the practical wisdom of the New . These writings are delightful to the cold eye of taste , and passionately dear to the glowing soul of devotion . They are full of the inspiration of genius , which , like the divine inspiration of the prophets , is a glorious gift of God . In truth , genius partakes of the nature of prophecy ; it has always something prophetic about it ; it is not bound down to its own country and its own time ; it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour . When it speaks , its audience is man , and the heart universal ' listens with rapture to its voice . It is heard beyond the boundaries of mountains ,  --  beyond the broad waste of oceans . Its sounds never die upon the air ,  --  *-. // they echo far down the lapse of time . This is eminently seen in the history of these writings . The sound of their inspiration , not loud , but strangely sweet , comes down to us over ages , which are passing away like the waves of a retiring sea . Mighty vessels of state have gone down , leaving no trace in the waters . Cities and kingdoms have perished , leaving no stone risin above the tide to show where they stood ; - but these poems , written by hands that have long been in the dust , are still heard , reverenced and loved , as fervently as in the palaces and halls of Jerusalem thousands of years ago . They are heard in the rolling anthem and the whispered prayer ,  - -  they float on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  beneath the arches of the cathedral and the rafters of the strawbuilt shed ; and they will be a monument to all future generations , showing what human power and heavenly inspiration can do . The illustrious men of the Hebrexv nation were the best of all possible examples tn show this prophetic character , this adaptation to all coming time ; for all their attachments were local ; they loved their country with even more than affection ,  - -  with strong and ungovernable passion ; every part of it ,  - -  mountain , lake and river , was distinguished by some remarkable tradition , and in their annals the simple truth was more wonderful , than any thing superstition could have invented . The hills round thc lake of Galilee were not more clearly reflected in its bosom , than the aspect of their country was reflected in their writings ; every thing that related to their own , their native land , was first and nearest to their hearts . We may trace this in the very sound of their inspiration . When they tell of battles fought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring loud and clear as the silver trumpets of the Temple ; when they foretell the inisfortunes of their country , the Temple sinking in flames , and the mountains melted in the blood of their inhabitants , they are mournful and affecting as the wail of a broken heart . And yet , such is the power of their inspiration , that their writings , local as they are in style , sentiment and description , are natural and welcome in every coming age ; they seem like the property , not of a single nation , but of the whole race of man . The most interesting of the Psalms are those of David , a man of extraordinary ability , which was displayed not merely in his poetry , but in the active engagements of a life as various // 481 and singular as the imagination ever drew . We know not whether injustice is doneto him by those who represent him as an example of religious excellence , or those who , in making up their judgment , remember nothing but his crimes . His life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and romantic adventure ; he lived in times which were essentially savage . How is it possible , that any should expect to find in him the evangelical virtue which Christianity alone can inspire ? And why should any one wonder , that he should speak of his enemies with bitterness , even in the presence of his God ? We see no immediate connexion between inspiration and excellence . Divine power employed those best suited to its purposes . There were many , who were approved for their fidelity in the particular work required at their hands , whether it was resisting idolatry , inflicting vengeance , or redressing wrongs ,  --  whose private life , tried by our standard of morality , would have received stern condemnation . But while we can not allow that there was any thing surprising in the faults of David , considering when and where he lived , we confess that we are inclined to wonder at his virtues . For example , at the generosity which he manifested when he was suffering under the heat of his burning climate , and three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , to bring him water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate . Feeling that he had no right to encourage such needless self-devotion , such prodigal waste of blood , he poured the untasted water on the ground , as an offering to his God . These are things , which none but a generous spirit could do . The advice which he gave to his son , when dying , has generally been thought to imply an atrocious spirit of revenge , when , according to our translators , he charges him to destroy the man whose life he had sworn to spare . But if , as commentators say , the words will bear a different construction , the connexion seems to require it ; for after telling Solomon that Shimei was a dangerous man , but that he had pledged his word that he should not die , he says , You are a wise man , and know what to do to him ; but his head bring not down to the grave with blood . This certainly seems more consistent with his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn not to injure Shimei , and then to direct his son to destroy him ; more natural , than to tell Solomon that he knows best what should be done , and after leav // ing all to his judgment , to charge him with his dying voice to take the pardoned offender 's blood . This great man was qualified to be a prophet of the human heart , by his familiarity with human life in every form . He was born in unambitious retirement , and , as a youthful shepherd , was acquainted with the cares and passions of humble stations . He had no preparation of experience for the duties and dangers of the throne ; but , when raised at once to that dizzy height , showed that he had ample resources , to fulfil the one and to resist the other . For years he led the life of an oppressed and anxious exile , suffering from the jealousy of Saul , who feared , respected and almost loved him . When he came to the throne , upon the death of his misguided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign . The wild natives of the country were successively defeated , and , from Egypt to the Euphrates , ' the whole region quietly submitted to his power ; and he established a fame more brilliant than victories can ever give , by securing the administration of justice in his empire ,  --  by extending the general prosperity from the highest to the humblest dwellings ,  --  by encouraging the elegant arts , poetry , music and architecture , with every thing which could refine the manners and feelings of the fierce Hebrew race . He secured the resources of other countries in addition to his own , by launching his peaceful navies upon the sea . But , at the moment when his glory and success were at the highest , the tide began to turn . The bark , which rode the waves so triumphantly was wrecked , and lay torn and helpless upon the shore . He gave himself up to the sway of his passions ; and the consequences of this guilt began to fall upon him . His house . was filled with mourning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became the prey of evil tongues , and a dark and melancholy cloud thenceforth hung over all the setting of his day . By means of these various and unexampled changes , he became intimately acquainted with life , in all its lights and shadows of joy and sorrow , of glory and of shame . Every one can find , in the feelings and circumstances of David , something that resembles his own . His inspiration is adapted in this way to the hall of the monarch , the soldier 's tent , and the hermit 's cell ,  --  to the solitude of the mourner ,  --  the desolation of the exile ,  --  the humiliation of the penitent , and the triumph of the great . It is welcome in the chamber of the sick , and at the bedside of the dying . It // is suited to every variety of fortune and feeling , and , in one word , to every human he*rt . For reasons like this , these admirable writings , even apart from their sacred character , must be valuable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they should be thoroughly understood . There are readers , who have no time nor opportunity to go to the explanations of commentators , and who are compelled to remain in ignorance of the meaning of many passages , on which light might be easily thrown by the alteration of one or two words . When they find that Mr. Noyes has respected their feeling in adopting the common version , and has made no changes simply for the sake of change , we are persuaded that they will feel grateful for his labors , and be ready to testify that he has done a good service , not only to the interests of general improvement , but to the cause of that religion , which he evidently has at heart . The amount of alteration which Mr. Noyes has found it necessary to make , may be judged by comparing his version of the twenty-third Psalm with that of our Scriptures . This beautiful Psalm is supposed to have been written , when David was driven out from the Holy City . In it he praises God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encamp beyond the river , where he was in danger of perishing , he is still supplied by Divine Providence , and can spread a banquet in the sight of his foes ; - for veteran soldiers flocked to his standard , and many , like l3arzillai , gave their wealth to sustain his army . We choose this , not because it is the happiest translation , but partly with a view to illustrate that prophetic character , by which the Psalms have overcome their first local application , and suited themselves to all persons and ages . The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want ! Lie maketh me to lie down in green pastures , He leadeth me beside still waters . lie reviveth my spirit ; He leadeth me in the right paths , For His name 's sake . When I walk through the darkest valley I fear no evils , for Thou art with me ; Thy crook and Thy staff they comfort me . Thou preparest a table before me In presence of my enemies . // Thou anointest my head with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy shall follow me all the days of my life , And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever . Any one may here observe , how easily the local and personal blessings forwhich David expresses his gratitude , take a figurative meaning , and supply a voice of thankfulness for every heart . The expression , valley of the shadow of death , ' is here changed into darkest valley , ' which is undoubtedly the true meaning ; for the writer was not speaking of the darkness of death , but a deathlike darkness , which prevailed in the vales of the wild region where he was . The original expression is best literally rendered valley of the shades , ' but the proper translation here is that which Mr. Noyes has given . The writer compares himself to a sheep wandering in those deserts , where sheep are in constant danger without the shepherd 's care . We give but one more example , to show how a Psalm , which has conveyed no meaning to most readers , resumes order and connexion when newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psalm may be compared with that in our Bible . Jehovah said to my Lord Sit thou at my right hand , Until I make thy foes thy footstool . ' Jehovah will extend the sceptre of thy power from Zion , Thou shalt rule in the midst of thine enemies ! Thy people shall be ready , when thou musterest thy forces in holy splendor . Thy youth shall come forward , like dew from the womb of the morning . Jehovah bath sworn , and he will not repent , Thou art a priest forever After the order of Melchizedek . The Lord at thy right hand Shall in his wrath crush the heads of kings ; He shall execute justice among the nations ; He shall fill them with dead bodies , He shall crush the heads of his enemies over extensive fields , He shall drink of the brook in the way ; Therefore shall he lift up the head . // If the reader of the common version find passages which convey no meaning to his mind , and if in this he find the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being clear , are harmoniously consistent with the spirit and sentiment of the rest of the Psalm , he has reason to believe , that the translator has faithfully discharged his duty . Let this test be applied to the work before us , and we believe it will be approved . There are one or two alterations , which we regretted to see but they are not very important , and we are confident that its solid merits will secure the favor of all , whose good opinion the author desires to gain .
