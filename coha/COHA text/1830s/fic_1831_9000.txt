Re-enter Susan , with a neatly folded paper in her hand . MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable Well-who is it ?  --  There 's Major Vernility , Never fails in his holiday call ; Gay O'Sage , too , the pink of civility Comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles significantly .

Susan casts an arch look at the paper . SUSAN . Susan Hang the fellow !  --  Whatever his title be , Here 's a clew for your finding it out . MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable Long or short as the trashy recital be , I must read his commission , no doubt ! SUSAN . Susan He nodded and squinted , and smilingly hinted ' T was handsomely printed , and warm from the press . MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable Then go , bid him dine o n't !  --  I see the design o n't , And wo n't read a line o n't  --  a newsman 's address ! With a slight curl of her ruby lip .

Here he says , that " the Carrier is dutiful , " Eager , ever , to serve you in haste . " MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable Such nonsense , I spurn it !  --  I tell you , return it , Or tear it , or burn it !  --  I 'm sick of their arts ! SUSAN . Susan ( reading . ) " With well-furnish 'd dishes , of loaves and of fishes , " For such are the wishes the MIRROR imparts . " Miss A. starts with pleasure and surprise MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable Ha !  --  what say you ?  --  the Mirror ! O give it me ! Takes the address Here 's a one-dollar bill for his pay ; Tell him always be careful and leave it me , None but he can produce such a lay . But , stay !  --  On reflection , I see no objection  --  A little refection would cheer him I think , This cold winter weather  --  so bid him come hither . SUSAN . Susan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to drink . Exit . Miss Affable sings from the address . " Ladies , gentlemen , masters , and misses , too , Husbands , bachelors , widows , and wives , Health and wealth , with a plenty of kisses , too , Peace and happiness sweeten your lives . May none , who would marry , be fated to tarry , Nor Cupid 's dart parry , when virtue approves ; May all be resign 'd to the fortune they find , too , And every girl join 'd to the man that she loves . " Re-enter Susan , with the Carrier . CARRIER . Carrier Servant , madam  --  a happy new-year to ye . Hope and pleasure attend you through life , Friends and lovers , and all that are dear to ye , Heaven preserves them from sorrow and strife ' MISS AFFABLE .

Gives another dollar , and exit , reading the address . CARRIER . Carrier Thank you , madam ; may years of felicity Ripen the beauties that blossom so sweet . Now , fair Susan , thou pink of pudicity , Cordials or " kisses ?  --  say , what is my treat ? SUSAN , Susan ( aside . ) These Mirror folks really , address us so queerly , I do love them dearly  --  they care not for pelf  --  But so fond of Misses ?  --  Sir , " perfect love , " this is , There 's " puffs , " and here 's " kisses "  --  so choose for yourself . CARRIER . Carrier Thus I choose , pretty  --  Enter Miss A. SUSAN . Susan Hush !  --  It 's Miss Affable ! CARRIER . Carrier Kisses , then , I am doom 'd to forego ? MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable This address is so witty and laughable  --  CARRIER . Carrier Here 's your health . ( Drinks . ) Why , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take this , for I owe it  --  a fee for the poet  --  Hush , Susan ! I know it  --  too little by far . SUSAN . Susan But then wo n't your mother be making a pother ? MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable He shall have another  --  We need n't tell Ma . Gives another bank note . CARRIER . Carrier Fare you well !  --  for my feelings of gratitude Words could never correctly express . Exit . SUSAN . Susan There 's a model for language and attitude ,  --  Now , Miss Affable , read the address . Does't treat with compassion the vot'ries of fashion , Or lay a sharp lash on to dandy and belle ? Does't praise little Roscius , with genius precocious , Who plays the ferocious crook 'd Richard so well ? Fill 'd , I 'll warrant , with blarney and flattory , Naming writers , and puffing them all ; Boasting what they have done for the Battery , Bridewell , Park , and the famed City-hall . MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable And well may they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of them critics severe ; In prose or in numbers , their fancy ne'er slumbers , Nor useless word lumbers or clogs an idea . SUSAN . Susan Tasteful Peale , with the Scudder and Cozens , too , Claim , of course , many flattering rhymes ; Meaner shows he dispatches by dozens , too . Then he gives us a " touch of the times ? " MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable He says , honest debtors , are doom 'd , by their betters , To shackles and fetters , and filthiness vile , While hoary aggressors , with pious professors , And ruthless oppressors , are living in style . SUSAN . Susan Boasts he not of its splendid typography ? Music , pictures , engravings , and cuts ? Old Dutch houses , with musty biography , Splendid churches , and mouldering huts ? MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable He modestly mentions his future intentions , Respecting inventions , in arts and in trades , And says the new college will propagate knowledge , Imparting a small edge to dullest of blades . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press is unshackled like ours , How young genius it strengthens and nourishes , Pluming its wings and directing its powers . Then follow two columns of new publish 'd volumes , For books are not all hums , as we have been told ! And let us not marvel if Harper and Carvil , And Carey ( not servile )  --  should revel in gold . Pelham , Waverly , Almack 's Revisited , Falkland , Devereux , Tales of the Seas , Cooper 's Water-witch  --  ne'er were elicited Brighter sparkles of genius than these . The Father Obdurate , the poor Country Curste , Paul Clifford , which you rate as morally vile , With the late celebration of French liberation , A faithful narration , and got up in style . Ancient , modern , and all kinds of history , Every possible subject and theme ; How they furnish so much is the mystery , Readers ought to peruse them by steam . A press so prolific , is truly grandific , To minds scientific , that come in its reach . SUSAN . Susan A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented author a copy of each . A knocking heard at the street door . MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable See who knocks , Susan .  --  Usher the Colonel here Enter Colonel O'Sage . COL . O'SAGE . Colonel O'Sage Praise St. Patrick !  --  the winter is o'er , Sure the saison , my darling , is vernal here , Pinks and roses are blooming once more . I just met M'Klisky , so airy and frisky ,  --  Sweet Susan , some whisky  --  I gave him the go : Assuming the stately , I cut him so nately , It bothered him greatly  --  he 's sentenced , you know ? MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable Sentenced , Colonel ! I 'm struck with astonishment , What 's his crime ? for I never have learn 'd . COL . O'SAGE . Colonel O'Sage May it prove to the world an admonishment , Taste and fashion are not to be spurn 'd . His crime , my dear creature , so foreign to nature , Must ruffle those features , so placid before ; The man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't take the Mirror  --  we " vote him a bore ! " Each aspirant for bright notoriety , All who move in an elegant sphere , Every member of genteel society , All subscribe for the Mirror , my dear . ' T is the touch-stone of merit , to know who inherit A true public spirit for science and art ; A chemical test for the demagogne 's breast , To determine who best love their country at heart . Knocking heard . Exit Susan Why has Turkey submitted to Nicholas ? Why has Charley absconded from France ? Why does Ferdinand act so ridiculous ? Why do n't Erin awake from her trance ? I 'll tell you the raison , without any treason , Perhaps the next saison it will not exit ; By wicked advisers , these despots and misers , Are not yet subscribers on Morris 's list . Enter Susan and Carrier . CARRIER . Carrier Pardon me , miss ; but your kind liberality Caused a trifling mistake in the fee ; Please excuse , sir , the want of formality  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COL . O'SAGE Colonel O'Sage Such honest proceeding ! and this shows the breeding Of all who are reading the Mirror , my doar . MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable The mistake you detected is what I expected , And may be corrected  --  another New-Year . FINAL . CARRIER . Carrier Joy attend us , each holiday festival ! MISS AFFABLE . Miss Affable May the press ever triumph and reign ! COL . O'SAGE Colonel O'Sage Do n't forget that the Mirror is best of all ! SUSAN . Susan Next New-Year you must see us again . CHORUS . All Then , the Mirror for ever , so racy and clever , We all will endeavour , with heart and with hand , Its freshness to nourish , and long may it flourish , The bane of the currish  --  the PRIDE OF THE LAND ! Exeunt omnes . For the Mirror .
