txt WHEN left to our own imaginations , we simpletons of New England fancy that we find very sufficient reason to he satisfied with our history , our condition , and one another . More than almost any other people , we are entitled to call our history our own . Almost as much as any other , we are a homogeneous race ; scarcely the Chinese more so . With the exception of a few Huguenot families who came over at the close of the seventeenth century , and who , from reliajous sympathy , and other causes , were easily grafted on the primeval vine , we are all descendants of English , established here within thirty years from the earliest settlement . We have not so much as a city , which is a colluvies of foreign and domestic elements . The interior feeds the seaports . In to e principal of these are a few Irish , mostly arrived since the war , hut not sufficient in humber to be of any account in estimating the cb racter of the popul tion ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not belonging to the original stock , we have almost literally none . This history of our soil and society , which is at the same time the history of our own progenitors , we should be utterly unwilling ( with all respect for the subjects of other bistories ) to exchange for any other which we read . Had our fathers come hither to secure a condition of more affluence or more ease , there would have been no fault to find with their enterprise . Had they come , because they had not succeeded in getting an honest living at home , this would have been no discreditable motive ; and other communities , founded in such a beginning , have risen afterwards to great respectability . But they came for a much better reason than either . They betook themselves to this " outside of the world , " to secure to themselves and theirs the liherty of thought and worship . Is there any nobler impulse , under which men can make struggles and sacrifices , and does history tell of another society , which may hoast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Plymouth and Massachusetts differed in some particulars ; the former being for the most part of the class of yeomen and artisans , while among the latter were many men of fortune , some belonging to noble families , and numbers educated in all the scholarship and refinements of the time . But , essentially , they were the same sort of men . They had been adherents at home of the same cause , and they came across the water under the same impulse . Arrived here , though independent of each other , both proceeded to build up a society in substantially the same manner ; for both went to work in the way which their AngloSaxon instincts prompted . They did not pitch their first tent in this chilly land of promise , till they had set up the safeguards of popular freedom . They had hardly looked to the necessities of life , when they provided for the necessities of learning and religion . Taking prudent care of the beginning , they looked steadily and hopefully on to the end . It is past a doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the establishment of an independent commonwealth . With this view they insisted on bringing their charter over with them , and neither they , nor their descendants , ever abandoned the design , till it was consummated by the war of the Revolution . The progress of their institutions was the developement of // the capacities of an intelligent , industrious , religious , heroic race . They won upon the aborigines by their fair and liberal dealing , rather than through the resources of their superior civilization . " I think I can clearly say , " said Governor Winslow , of Plyrnonth , in 1676 , " that before these present troubles broke out , the English did not possess one foot of land in this colony , but what was obtained by honest purchase of the Indian proprietors . " Always watchful of the great interest , and prodigal of every other , now they are seen opposing an undismayed front to the aggressions of the parent country , and now beggaring their treasury , and lavishing their best blood , in the boldest expeditions against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , for a moment , from the pursuit , at home , of all measures for building up a strong and prosperous commonwealth . Not only is a competent education provided for every child , at the public cost , but his guardians are compelled , under a penalty , to accept for him the advantage thus afforded . The higher places of education are fostered with a liberal patronage . The town corporations , covering with their several jurisdictions the whole territory , are charged with whatever may be done , by municipal regulation , for the security and comfort of a neighbourhood , and are strictly held to their responsibility by the higher powers . The ministers of the law are made independent of official dictation and of popular caprice ; and religion , by a sufficient but cautious provision for the maintenance of its institutions , is aided to enforce its sanctions on the public mind . Under such auspices , a state of things has grown up , which a man must be querulous to complain of . Dwelling " among our own people " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to dwell with . That Massachusetts , for instance , is not a decidedly ineligible home , might be partly conjectured from the fact , that it numbers eightyseven inhabitants to the square mile , while the Ancient Dominion , blacks included , counts but twenty-five , and the most populous State out of New England , New York , gives to the same space a census of forty-six , little more than half that of the Bay State . With no natural wealth for exportation , except what consists in granite and ice , - " absolutely nothing but rocks and ice , " as of late a distinguished southern statesman emphatically testified , - we yet make shift to keep the wolf , Want , from the door . We take good care // of those who can not take care of themselves ; but no one , among us , so he has but health , needs to fall into poverty . Most things that may be honestly done for a living , are done by one or another of us . We fish , we manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we trade , and we study . Our swapptrtg transactions sometimes employ no little c pital , and often carry us a long way from home . The commodore of a Russian exploring expedition lately fell into a fog , just as he had come to flatter himself that he had about reached the world 's end , and written his name for immortality with the Vancouvers and Cooks . When it cleared away , he found himself in a fleet of Yankee craft , the commander of one of which offered to pilot him to an excellent roadstead hard by , the old familiar haven of himself and his compeers . Our colleges are in that condition , that , in addition to the granite and ice above commemorated , we find ourselves able to send into other States a few professional men , who , we learn , find a market , and every year , about commencement time , an assortment of teachers in the different ranks , from intructers in the common schools , to presidents and professors in the higher institutions . Each having enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to interfere with one another , except in the way of mutual kind offices , or joint action for public objects . Each being able to depend on himself , there is no motive for servility , and arrogance is awed by the certainty of a prompt and effective rebuke . Men know whom they are dealing with , as they can not know in one of those recent communities , where a population is collected , not amalgamated ; and so escape the tendency to that mutual distrust , which if not a virtue , is a necessity , where there is any strange companionship . Wherever there is a combination of universal competence and moderate information , occasional wealth and habits of intellectual activity , it might be anticipated with confidence that there would grow up a taste for the elegances of art and literature , and all the refinements of the social state , even if the original stock were less propitious to such fruits than was that of New England . How we actually stand in these respects , it is clearly not for ourselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the subjects of favorable comparisons with our fellow-citizens of other sections of the country . Still it is certain , that comparisons of this kind which are actually made // by strangers who visit us , to tell what they find , are not such as to distress our vanity . Captain Hall does not mince the matter . " Since coming to Boston , " says he , " we have been more struck , and confessed ourselves to he so , with the degree of taste and luxury in all we saw , both in the external appearance of the houses , and in the good sense and good manners within , than with any thing we had before met in the United States . " Mrs. Butler and M. de Tocqueville are scarcely less complimentary ; and Captain Hamilton , well as he learned his lesson in some other respects , was fain to own that he found in Boston a circle of society , distinguished hy " much taste for literature , much liberality of sentiment , a good deal of accomplishment , and a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the population of any other mercantile city could supply . " All this looks very well on paper ; but still there is reason to fear , that the character of the New England population does not stand altogether well with the multitude of their brethren . How any existing prejudice of the kind arose , it might not be difficult to conjecture ; but it would be an inyidious inquiry , and we decline it . That , having arisen , it has been perpetuated , is a fact that requires no explanation . An error capable of producing a political effect bears a charmed life . If such things are tolerably well nursed , - and this they are very likely to be , - so notoriously are they beyond the power of mere contradiction , that report says , a political tactician in Pennsylvania , in the canvass of 1828 , observing what havoc was making among the votes of the foreign population by the story that the lady of Mr. Adams was a daughter of George III. , advised not to waste breath in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reporting that General Jackson had wedded two daughters of that monarch . But however originated or kept alive , the prevalence of the feeling in question , to some unhappy extent , is , we suppose , not to be denied . We learned as much from Captain Hamilton 's own book . " The whole Union , " says he , " is full of stories of Jonathan 's cunning frauds . " That traveller 's swallow is quick and capacious , and we would rather not rely on him exclusively for such a statement ; still its breadth and confidence attach to it a certain interest . Mr. Sprague , author of one of the addresses of which we have prefixed the title , ( the late distinguished Senator from Maine , ) knows better whereof he affirms , and he // goes so far as to say ; " It has become so common with our brethren of other States , to talk of New England cupidity and fraud , that it is taken by the ignorant abroad to be characteristic of our community . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the capital of South Carolina . His high station in society , accorded to him by the cordial respect of all to whom he is known , affords him the best opportunities for acquaintance with the state of prevailing sentiment . He too professes his endeavour to have been , in his address delivered on the anniversary of the disembarkation at Plymouth , " to rescue a section of our common country from unmerited reproach ; " and specifies the nature of animadversions which have been made , as of the following flattering character . " Yankees , it has been said , are like a rope of sand ; that they have no sympathy for one another ; that there is no adhesion among them , either at home or abroad ; that they are mean and selfish in their disposition , sly , cunning , apt to overreach ; in short , dishonest whenever they can get any thing by it ; and that their motto virtually is , if not the avowed principle of action , Every man for himself , and God for us all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compliments to ring on an honest people 's ear . One can not but hope at first , that there is some mistake in the representation , and that single petulant expressions of accidentally prejudiced persons have been taken , by individuals conscious of their own character and jealous for that of their birth-place , for indications of a prevailing sentiment . But we believe it will not do to lay any such flattering unction to our souls . Respecting the authorship of the " Memoirs of a Nullifier , " the second work of which we have prefixed the title , we have no knowledge nor ground for suspicion . We have never heard it ascribed to any one hut an aged gentleman , who , we are sure from internal evidence , did not write it . The author also professes to be a native of the South , which the individual referred to is not ; and that this is not a mere nom de guerre , appears from a few southern provincialisms , occurring in what is generally an extremely good style. * The work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the following sentences ; " I fourd that I would miss the planet by about fifteen inches , " and " I hoped that some time or other I would arrive at a stopping-place I saw ; " and the use of dear so as to rhyme with fair , and tear with repair , in a copy of verses on page 36 , indicating a well-known sectional peculiarity of pronunciaion. // lished at the Office of the Telegraph , " a journal of well-known ability and influence , edited at the seat of government of South Carolina . That the author has not made his observation* on New England men at home , is to he inferred from his small success in representing the peculiarities of their speech . The caricature is not absolutely a bad one , but not nearly as good as a man of so much shrewdness , had he travelled into New England , might be expected to produce . For instance , " I reckon , " is not Yankee , but Virginian cacology . " Stranger , " as a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belongs not to the Eastern , but to the Western dialect . Get along , when used at all , is used for , " to proceed , " and never in the sense intended to be attached to it in the following sentence ; " I calculate I 11 make a pretty tolerble considerable speck on what I ye got along . " . Mighty , we have supposed from Colonel Crockett 's works , to be a Tennessean , certainly it is not a New England superlative . And " does you , " wherever else it may prevail , we will answer for it , was never heard between the Hudson and the St. Croix . But wherever and however his studies into the New England character were prosecuted , the result is such as the following specimen may indicate . The work is in form an autobiography . The writer and hero , having occasion to visit the lower regions , falls in , on the way thither , with " the ghost of a Yankee pedlar , who was journeying to the other world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This personage directly joined him , " and showed himself to be fully as impudent and inquisitive as if he were still alive . " The passage of the party over the Styx is delayed half an hour , while the pedlar higgles with Charon for a reduction of the ferriage from twelve cents and a half , the usual fee , to ten cents ; " and again , by his plunging into the river after a " cooter , " from one of whose bones , when caught , he proceeds to make , with his penknife , an article , which he offers for sale , as " an elegant tortoise-shell comb . " Arrived before the judgment-seat of Rhadamanthus , they found him " seated with a great number of large account books before him . " Virgil Lioskins is your name , is it ? ' said he . Here it is , among the H 's , page 49,358 . Ah , Virgil ! there s a terribly long account against you . Let s see a few of the charges ' ( Reads. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 18- , To selling in the course of one peddling expedition , 497,368 wooden nutmegs , 281,532 Spanish cigars made of oak leaves , and 647 wooden clocks . " What do you say to that charge , Hoskins ? " Hoskins . Why , that was counted in our place about the greatest peddlin trip that ever was made over the Potomac . " Rhadamanthus reads : June 29 , 18- , To stealing an old grindstone , smearing it over with butter , and then selling it as a cheese . " Iloskins , in great surprise . Jimminny surely you would n't punish a man for that , would you ? " Rhadamanthus reads : December 13 , 1780 , To making a counterfeit dollar of pewter , when you were six years old , and cheating your own father with it . " Hoskins . Daddy was mighty glad when he found it out . He said it showed I had a genus . " Rhadamanthus reads : July 2,18 - , To taking a worn*out pair of shoes , which you found in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being actually the shoes of Saint Paul . " Hoskins , with exultation : I made four dollars and twelve and a half cents by that . " Rhadamanthus reads : - July 2 , 18- , To taking an empty old watch-case , putting a live cricket into it , and then selling it as a patent lever in full motion . " Hoskins . 1-Je , he , he , - th'at was one of the cutest tricks I ever played in all my life . " Rhadamanthus . It would occupy me a week , floskins , to go through all the charges against you . These few are sufficient . I really am getting entirely out of patience with New England , for it gives me more trouble than all the rest of the world put together . You are sentenced to be thrown into a lake of boiling molasses , where nearly all your counti*ymen already are , with that same old grindstone tied to your neck , and to remain there for ever . " - pp. 42 , 43 . Here is the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects in different parts of the story . We have no intention to represent the volume as a malignant libel upon the character of this portion of th2 country . It is not so . It is simply an easy jeu d'esprit , thrown off in the wantonness of " a few long days of summer leisure , " which the author says he " knew not how to employ better . " Whatever there is of bilious temperament apparent on his part , is vented as much on other characters produced in the nar // rative , as on those of Eastern origin ; and if there is any thing to choose between the Nullifier himself , his Southern friend , and his Southern mistress , on the one hand , and the Yankees Hooker , Phipps , and Hoskins on the other , it is not very clearly to the disadvantage of the latter triad . Could we regard the volume as a mere ebullition of personal or party spleen , we should look-on it much less seriously in its relation to the question now before us . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , to draw the Yankee character with poetical truth , as it was conceived by those for whom he was writing ; and accordingly the delineation shows what those readers were prepared to bear and to expect in the premises . He is no fool , so as to be writing at a venture , and his dedication of the work " to his Excellency James Hamilton , Jr. , Governor of South Carolina , whose chivalrous character has procured him the appropriate appellation of the Bayard of the South , ' " forbids the supposition that he supposed himself to he without sympathy in the highest quarters . Still the writing is anonymous ; and , in a matter of such import , it is natural to like to have names for vouchers . These , it might be supposed , would be difficult to get at , from the natural unwillingness of right-minded men to bring sweeping charges against a whole community , and , especially , from the impossibility ( except under circumstances of the highest excitement ) of such charges being made in the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied , that proof even of this kind is continually presenting itself , to that degree that he who should undertake to collect it in any one department , would find his undertaking to be no sinecure . Let us content ourselves , as to authorities , with the case of the wooden nutmegs , which appear in the van of the pungent extract given above , as well as , with racy repetition , in other parts of the work . Though , nian and boy , we have lived in New England nearly half a century , without having seen , or credibly heard , of an actually existing specimen of this fabric , we are obliged to suppose that in some places it is held to be the great result of New England industry ; - not salted , fish , nor cotton shirtings , nor brown paper spelling-books more so . For instance ; a recent number of the " United States Telegraph " is before us , in which we find the Rev. R. C. Postell , of Orangeburg , in South Carolina , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as becomes his profession , ) treating // " the art of making nutmegs and bacon out of wood , " as notoriously practised among our " country people . " Mr. Senator Preston , ( " cujus ab ore melle dulcior fluit oratio " ) lately came to New England , and left it , being a truly candid and generous man , agreeably impressed with some things which he saw . On his return , he had occasion to address a public meeting , convened to make arrangements for the Charleston and Cincinnati Rail-road , and he took the opportunity to do manly justice to some qualities and effects which had come under his observation . He addressed no rabble , but an audience of gentlemen of property and influence , as the occasion which brought them together implies ; but still it seems even the flavorous honey of his tongue would have cloyed , unless spiced with the ever-ready wooden nutrnegs . We can not deny ourselves the gratification of setting down his remarks . The taste of their general tenor was his own . The incident we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while it was a distinct recognition of the opinions , of his hearers . We extract from the " Columbia Telescope . " " Mr. Preston , in his speech concerning the Rail-road , on londay last , drew a very striking contrast between the difference of character of the people of the Northern and of the Southern parts of the Union , and the consequently opposite condition of the countries that they inhabit . " lie said that no Southern man can journey ( as he had lately done ) through the Northern States , and witness the prosperity , the industry , the public spirit , which they exhibit , the sedulous cultivation of all those arts by which life is rendered comfortable and respectable , without feelings of deep sadness and shame , as he reniembers his own ne* , lected and desolate home . There , no dwelling is to be seen abandoned , no farm uncultivated , no man idle , no waterfall , even , unemployed . Every person and every thing performs a part towards the grand result , and the whole land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals , and rail-roads , and public edifices , and towns and cities . Along the route of the great New York canal , ( that glorious monument of the glorious memory of De Witt Clinton , ) a canal , a rail-road , and a turnpike , are to be seen in the width of perhaps a hundred yards , each of them crowded with travel , or overflowing with commerce . Throughout their course , lands , that before their construction would scarcely command five dollars the acre , now sell for fifty , seventy-five , or a hundred . Passng along it , you see no space of three miles without a town or illage , and you are never out of the sound of a church bell . // " We of the South are mistaken in the character of these people , when we think of them only as pedlars in horn flints and bark nutinegs . Their energy and enterprise are directed to all objects , great and small , within their reach . At the fall of a scanty rivulet , they set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant a barren hill-side with broom corn , and make it into brooms at the bottom , - and on its top they erect a windmill . Thus , at a single spot , you may see the air , the earth , and the water , all working for them . But , at the same time , the ocean is whitened to its extremities with the sails of their ships , and the land is covered with their works of art and usefulness . " Massachusetts is perhaps the most flourishing of the Northerri States . Yet , of natural productions , she exports but two articles - granite and ice . Absolutely nothing but rock and ice ! Every thing else of her commerce , from which she derives so much , is artificial , - the work of her own hands . " All this is done , in a region with a bleak climate and sterile soil , by the energy and intelligence of the people . Each man knows that the public good is his individual advantage . The number of rail-roads , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closely-compacted mass , through which the productions of commerce and of the press , the comforts of life , and the means of knowledge , are universally diffused ; while the close intercourse of travel and business makes all men neighbours , and promotes a common interest and common sympathy . In a community thus connected , a single flash of thought pervades the whole land , almost as rapidly as thought itself can fly . The population becomes , as it were , a single set of muscles , animated by one heart , and directed by a common sensorium . " How different the condition of things in the South ! " &amp;c . We hope that Mr. Preston 's predecessor in the United States ' Senate had the opportunity of listening to these remarks . They would not fail to enlarge his conceptions of the New England mind . At the time of his famous debate with Mr. Webster , the relation of his party to the federal councils was critical , and he tried hard to do the civil thing by NewEngland , though the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its leaders . But the kindest intentions could carry him no further than to an acknowledgment of its " steady habits and hardy virtues , " while , speaking of other portions of the country , his fervor could luxuriate in such epithets as " the gallant West , " " great and magnanimous Virginia , " and the " noble disinterestedness , ardent love of // country , exalted virtue , and pure and holy devotion to liberty of the people of the Southern States . " The delusion we have referred to , there is too much reason to fear , has been conveyed , with the course of population , across the mountains . The most unambiguous expression of its existence there , which we recollect to have lately observed , in a respectable quarter , occurred on the presentation of the navy appropriation bill , at the last session of Congress . On that occasion , standing in his place among the representatives of the people , Mr. Hardin , of Kentucky , in debate with Mr. Cushing , of Massachusetts , is represented in the reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishery , wooden nutmegs , and tin peddling , and said that the gentleman from Massachusetts came from a section of country , where the people could see a dollar with the naked eye , as far as he could through a telescope . " Mr. Hardin is a man of unimpeached and unimpeachable veracity . His reputation for blunt frankness is implied in the very soubriquet by which he is best known . We are persuaded that the saving of his right hand would he no bribe to him to affirm what he did not believe . We are bound therefore to understand , that this is actually his opinion , concerning the population to which his remarks apply . It is his opinion , because he has lived where the doctrine was inculcatdd , and because , being guileless , he is unsuspecting , and easily practised upon . In ascribing his unfortunate error to credulity , we do no injustice to his understanding . He is not only an honest man , but an able . But all men are gullible . Not more true is it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this gentleman and his neighbours believe what they do of New England and its nutmegs , they might with the proper appliances , be brought to believe that the moon is made of green cheese . Let them take care that some Yankee does not , before long , beguile their simplicity into that error . We do not undertake to refute the doctrine of the nutmegs . There are no resources , in logic , to prove a negative . Accordingly , in reason and in law , the burden of proof is thrown on the other side , and we have never yet seen an indictment with specifications , to put the party accused on his defence . Dishonest men , we suppose , are the growth of every soil . We have no difficulty in allowing that such may have been // born in New England ; and on the other hand , if no fraudulent bargain was ever made by a native of Kentucky or South Carolina , it is time that those States asserted for themselves a place in the eye of the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we know , has ever yet ventured to lay claim . That dishonest men , of New England birth , should have practised their arts more freely abroad than at home , is also a very credible thing . The class of rovers is generally found to embrace a portion of those who were in no good esteem at their starting-place , and bad men never conduct themselves so ill as in places where they are but transient sojourners . Also , when a wrong has been committed by such foul birds of passage , there is always danger that it may be laid at some door where it ought not to lie ; for the injured has small opportunity to examine the baptismal record of him whom he finds occasion to revile ; and where , for instance , as in North Carolina , peddling is carried on by native citizens , if a fraud occurs , the sufferer , under his double stimulus of personal indignation and sectional patriotism , is extremely likely to impute to New En*land , what is , in fact , chargeable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ivill plead , then , to the nutmegs , whenever some case shall be presented ; saying nothing further about them meanwhile , than that the general charge of dishonest transactions would really have seemed to us antecedently more probable , if some other form of dishonesty had been allebed instead of this . For we know of no tree and no art existing in New-England , from and by which a tolerable counterfeit of the fruit nutmeg could be produced . It is neither one of the geometrical figures , nor a combination of two or more . We apprehend that the lathe which could shape its likeness is yet to be invented ; and though the Yankee penknife , like the Yankee axe , is a potent tool , it would for this use require an amount of time , which could not profitably be afforded . Further , we suppose that , all over the world , people , who buy nutmegs , buy then ) for their aromatic property ; and of this we never heard of any substance , which would afford an imitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends do us more than justice in one view , while in another they do us less . Wise as they give us credit for being , we are not equal to work like this . Of specific charges of mal-practice against our population , // we suppose that to which we have referred to be decidedly the most prominent , and to rest on the highest authority . There are others of a more general nature , referred to in the publications from which we have quoted , on two or three of which we would bestow a little attention . An impression has gone abroad , that the inhabitants of New England are an excessively frugal people . It ought better to be known why , when , and how far they are frugal . It is a point of honor with a New England man to maintain his family , and pay his debts . Is he any the worse for that ? and how shall he do it , living , as he does , in a country of harsh climate and penurious soil ? He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a methodical and prudent management of his affairs . If he is to be honest , he must be careful . Accordingly it is his custom , in pecuniary transactions , to avoid waste , and to stand for his rights . When he buys , he has first compared his wants with his means , and he does not intentionally give more for a thing than it is worth to him . What he has to sell , he has worked hard for , with a view to put it to some good use ; and when he parts with it , he expects to get its value . This , it must be owned , is , for a general rule , the habit of the country , and not merely the custom of the poorest . A load of wood is driven to your door by a person , who perhaps might turn out , on inquiry , to be a selectman of his town , possibly even a representative in the General Court . When you have paid your fifteen or twenty dollars for your uel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silver , which it cost him to have the wood surveyed . Why should he not ? It is his right . He paid the money to the licensed measurer , for your greater security . There is no meanness in his demanding it back ; there would be meanness in your grudging to refund it . There is no reason whatever , why he should give it to you . There is reason why he should keep it , to increase what he means to give in some other quarter . And if you follow him home the same day , it is very likely that you find him visiting some sick or aged neighbour 's house , with a present , ( the fruit of his expedition , ) or going into town-meeting to vote for or urge some liberal appropriation , a full share of which is to come out of his pocket , for schools , roads , or alms-houses . We should like , for the curiosity 's sake , to see some system of ethics , which should show it to be otherwise than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend and give . We should be gratified to see a set argument to prove , what in some quarters is so constantly taken for granted , that it is praiseworthy to he so thoughtless and easy in one 's money affairs , as to have nothing to bestow when some good object requires an appropriation . The New England notion of the honorableness and the uses of economy is different . Practical illustrations of it , as it is actually entertained , might he had in any plenty for the seeking . Let us see how things go on , in this respect , in Boston . We have no more convenient way of getting at a general idea of them , than by making an abridgment from the Appendix to President Quincy 's Address on the second centennial anniversary of the settlement of that city . President Quincy gives a list in specific sums of , 1 . " Amounts received from the liberality of the citizens of Boston towards objects of a moral , religious , or literary character , chiefly within the last thirty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given to the Massachusetts Hospital ; $222,696 to Harvard College ; $ 79,582 to the Female Orphan Asylum , and $75,000 to the Athenteurn. 2 . Contributions for the relief of sufferers in five northern towns by fire , amounting to $67,462. 3 . " Moneys raised within the time specified by various contributions , or by donations of individuals , for the patronizing of distinguished merit , or for the relief of men eminent for their public services ( testamentary bequests not included , ) $108,400. 4 . " Amounts collected for objects of general charity , or for the promotion of literary , moral , or religious purposes , by or under the influence of various religious societies in the metropolis ( not including the particular annual objects of expenditure of each society , ) $469,425 . The sum total of particulars thus collected is $1,801,273 . Mr. Quincy adds , that " The object on this occasion has not been completeness , which was known to be impracticable , but as near an approximation to it as was possible . How far short the statement in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered from this fact , that information was requested for the amount collected within the last thirty years ; yet more than half the sum stated in this item arose from collections made within the last ten years . As a further illustration , it may not he improper to state , that , within the last twelve yearsJlve citizens of Boston have deceased , whose bequests for objects exclusively of public // interest or benevolence , when united , amount to a sum exceeding three hundred thousand dollars , and that one of these during the last twenty years of his life , is known to have given away towards similar objects , a sum equal to ten thousand dollars annually . " this collection of facts was made in the autumn of 183O* If it were brought down to the present day , it would have to include , in a large variety of memoranda of the same kind , the munificent establishment of the Blind Asylum by a longtried public benefactor still livirib , and the institution , announced just before the time when we are writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an endowment of *250 , O00 , by a young Bostonian , who made the last arrangements for the execution of his plan in a distant city of Asia , whither he had gone for the purpose of enriching his countrymen with observations of his own mind . But this , it will be said , is Boston , the chief seat of New England wealth , and a place wrought upon by influences of its own . It is Boston ; and what then ? Boston is a mere abstraction of New England , and a large portion of the men who are there most public-spirited and useful , have brought thither the principles and habits , which make them so , from some interior place of their nativity . Let us see what economy means , and what it comes to , in the country towns . An extract from Mr. Emerson 's Centennial Discourse at Concord will serve us for that purpose ; we will pledge ourselves to multiply such collections of facts as long as our revilers will have patience to read them . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not depart from this pledge it had given . Its little population of 1300 souls , behaved like a party to the contest . The number of its troops constantly in service is very great . Its pecuniary burdens are out of all proportion to its capital . The economy so rigid , which marked its earlier history , has all vanished . It spends profusely , affectionately , in the service . Since , ' say the plaintive records , General Washington , at Cambridge , is not able to give but 24s. per cord for wood , for . the army ; it is voted , that this town encourage the inhabitants to supply the army , by paying two dollars per cord , over and above the General 's price , to such as shall carry wood thither ; ' and 210 cords of wood were carried . A similar order is taken respecting hay . Whilst Boston was occupied by the British troops , // Concord contributed to the relief of the inhabitants ? 70 in money ; 225 bushels of grain ; and a quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston were quartered by the Provincial Congress on the neighbouring country , Concord received 82 persons to its hospitality . In the year 1775 , it raised 100 minute men , and 74 soldiers to serve at Cambridge . In March , 1776 , 145 men were raised by this town to serve at Dorchester heights . In June , the General Assembly of Massachusetts resolved to raise 5000 militia , for six months , to reinforce the Continental army . The numbers , ' say they , are large , but this court has the fullest assurance , that their brethren on this occasion , will not confer with flesh and blood , but will , without hesitation , and with the utmost alacrity and despatch , fill up the numbers proportioned to the several towns . ' On that occasion , Concord furnished 67 men , paying them itself , at an expense of ? 622 . And so on , with every levy , to the end of the war . For these men , it was continually providing shoes , stockings , shirts , coats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the war , had not much exceeded ? 200 per annum , amounted , in the year 1782 , to *9544 in silver . The great expense of the war was borne with cheerfulness , whilst the war lasted ; but years passed , after the peace , before the debt was paid . As soon as danger and injury ceased , the people were left at leisure to consider their poverty and their debts . The town records show how slowly the inhabitants recovered from the strain of excessive exertion. " - pp. 37-38 . The spirit of the administration of the towns i , s referred to by the same writer , in a succeeding para0raph . It is the spirit , in New England , - as anybody may know , who will be at pains to inquire , - of whatever may appear to be distinctive in habits of public and private economy ; and , if there were more of it in the world , we are sure it would be all the better , both for individual character and the general well-being . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event . These soiled and musty books are luminous and electric within . The old town-clerks did not spell very correctly , but they contrive to make pretty intelligible the will of a free and just community . Frugal our fathers were , - very frugal , - though , for the most part , they deal generously by their minister , and provide well for the schools and the poor . If at any time , in common with most of our towns , they have carried this economy // to the verge of a vice , it is to be remembered that a town is , in many respects , a financial corporation . They economize , that they may sacrifice . They stint and higgle on the price of a pew , that they may send 200 soldiers to General Washington , to keep Great Britain at bay . For splendor , there must somewhere be rigid economy . That the head of the house may go brave , the members must be plainly clad , and the town must save that the State may spend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionary war , naturally suggest the thought of what is so largely said and sung , respecting the New Englanders being an unchivalrous people . Perhaps they are so . We hardly know whether to affirm or deny ; for the word chivalrous , in its recent use in some parts of the United States , is one of the most vague of Americanisms . We exceedingly desire to see a dictionary , in which the new application of the word shall be authoritatively explained . If to be chivalrous implies a readiness to fatal street broils , most unchivalrous are we , for the halter is our standing remedy for the propensity to assassination , once developed in the act . Nays our laws ( and we feel confident in saying , our juries too , though the case has not yet come up , ) make absolutely no difference between a murder after a challenge has been passed , and one gone about without that formality ; and our soil is almost literally unstained by blood shed in what has been fancifully called honorable combat . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race is not one of the most adventurous and indomitable courage , has little thought what stiff facts he undertakes to deal with , in their history . The account of the early contests with the natives is crowded with a succession of the most romantic achievements . From the period of the first collision between French and English on this continent , down to the taking of Quebec , the New England colonies were readiest for every sacrifice , and foremost in every danger . The capture of Louisbourg itself , in 1745 , is not chiefly an interesting fact because it was the only success obtained by the English arms during a long war , and gave peace to Europe , but because of the extraordinary developement of character , in the successful expedition of a few rebiments of colonial militia against a distant fortress , one of the strongest of the world both by nature and art . In respect to the extent of the part taken by New England , and especially // by Massachusetts , in the war of the Revolution , Mr. Sprague presents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeble colony , alone raised the note of defiance against the whole power of the British empire ; not on account of any actual oppression practically felt , which alone could have roused the phlegmatic , the sordid , or the selfish ; but for a principle , - a doctrine , - for the mere assertion that Parliament had a right to legislate over them . If they had been cold , calculating , and narrow-minded , if they had regarded themselves only , their ease , their safety , or their property , they would have submitted , and left future generations to battle for themselves . But they did not . They knew that the time had come , when they must relinquish their long-cherished visions of hope , their warm and glowing anticipations for their posterity , those free principles of government , which they had labored to establish for all future generations , for all mankind , or they must fight ; and , however unequal , however desperate the conflict , they could not hesitate . Their purpose was no ebullition of passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up and expired , or a spasm of disinterestedness exhausted by one convulsive effort ; but a continued and enduring enthusiasm and spirit of self-sacrifice , which has never been exceeded . " Exposed as she was on all sides , bordering for hundreds of miles on the territory of the enemy , and for hundreds more of seacoast open to every incursion of his invincible marine , still she did not confine her efforts within herself , but sent her sons wherever blows were to be dealt , or blood to be shed ; among the foremost in every battle field , from the northern borders to the confines of Georgia ; in every enterprise of danger , in every scene of suffering , whether from the violence of the elements in the untented field , or half clothed , half fed , marching against British veterans , staining the frozen earth at every step with their unshod feet ; or driving the western savages from their fastnesses ; or traversing the frozen wilds of Maine and Canada in a winter* s march , the most wonderful in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hannibal 's crossing the Alps . " And those , too , who remained at honie , scarcely less devoted and suffering , ever laboring in the same great cause , yielding up their property , parting with their last hoof , offering up their last bushel of grain , submitting to privation and want , and yet never faltering or doubting or hesitating in their course , until the work of absolute independence was accomplished . Would // that the records of every town and every association of New England could be inspected by the world . The public archives of the nation can do them but partial justice . By them , however , it is demonstrated that New England , and Massachusetts in particular , throughout the whole war , voluntarily furnished to the general cause contributions of men and money very far beyond her due proportion . As these facts are strikingly exhibited by the official documents , - and I am not aware that a comparative statement has ever been presented to the public , - you will pardon me in this for going a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other topic . " In the first year of the war , 1775 , the whole number of Continental troops was 27,443 , of which more than one half were from Massachusetts , then embracing the territory which now constitutes the State of Maine ; and only 2,475 were from States out of New England . " In 1776 , when a more general organization had been effected , Massachusetts furnished more than all the four Middle States , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Deleware united ,  --  and more than all the five States of Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia united . " In 1777 commenced a new era . In that and every succeeding year of the war , the quotas to be furnished from each State were prescribed by the Continental Congress . The requisitions upon Massachusetts and Virginia were always equal . But the liberality of the Bay State in complying with them far exceeded that of any other . " In each of the years 1777 , 78 , 79 , and SO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four States of New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Delaware ; or of the four States south of the Potomac , - Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia . " In each of the years 1781 , 82 , and 83 , her single contributions very far exceeded the aggregate of those of New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Delaware , as also the aggregate of those of Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia . " If we combine all these years , and take the aggregates of the whole war , from 1775 to 1783 inclusive , it will be found that Massachusetts furnished more troops for the Continental service than all the Middle States just mentioned , and more than all the five States of Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia ; and that , of the whole aggregate number from all the thirteen States , more than a fourth , approaching to indeed to one third , were from this Commonwealth alone ! " In pecuniary supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only contributed more than any other State , but the excess of her payments into the general treasury , over what she drew from it , far exceeded that of any other . Indeed , the balance in her favor was not only greater than that of all the four Middle States before mentioned , or of all the four States south of the Potomac , with Maryland in addition , but exceeded that of all the other twelve united . Of the whole excess , more than half was from Massachusetts alone " During the whole war of the revolution , her preeminence was n*ver questioned , then , in the day of trial and of terror , when the storm lowered and darkness covered our whole horizon , the first rank was freely conceded to her . " - pp. 19 - 22 . This extract brings into view another of the current charges against the New England population , - that of their coldness . For a cold people , they have unquestionably been apt to kindle in past time rather easily ; and that too sometimes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or abstract good or evil . Catitious and reserved , perhaps it may be truly said they are ; and these are qualities of manner , which , however objectionable in point of gracefulness and power of conciliating , are often fotind connected with qualities of character , of the substantial class of selfresl ) ect and love of consistency . But it can hardly be among a merely unfeeling , phlegmatic people , that so many of the great benevolent enterprises of the day have had their origin . With the wisdom of those enterprises , all or any , we have nothing now to do . But it is scarcely to be denied that they are enterprises of an adventurous and comprehensive sort , ln ( licating something of a sanguine temperament on the l ) al't of their projectors ; and the more indeed any of them can be shown to be of a visionary character , the less do they agree with the theory of their having proceeded from a people merely calculating and frigid . The truth is , there are certain traits , prominent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the habit of self-control , which hasty observers mistake for tokens of a want of earnestness . Was there ever a more sublime lage than the people within a day 's march of Boston were in , on the 19th of April , 1775 ? yet we lately heard an eminent Southwestern statesman amusing himself with the fact of their going to work , the day after , giving and taking ( lel ) ositions respecting the circumstances of the affray . Why not ? What // did this show , but their love of right , order , and law , not suspended by the sanguinary work of a revolution ? They had fought for a cause , and they wished to make that good cause appear . They were not a riotous people , ready to go to blows with or without reason . They owed it to their respect for themselves and others , to show that they had not unnecessarily shed blood , at the free rate they did . It wa no repenting of the conflict , or shrinking from its consequences or its prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country was pouring down its regiments of minute-men , under such epauletted justices of the peace , as could be spared , to seal up the invader hermetically within Boston neck . - Bunker Hill fight was a thing gone about with great deliberation and arrangement ; but never before had militiamen done such desperate service . Nor let any of the gentlemen whom we have quoted suppose that when we refer to the valor and constancy which have made that day immortal , we are but imposing on them a Yankee version of General Jackson 's exploit at New Orleans forty years later , with his Tennesseeans . If they doubt , we shall show them Southern authorities for the truth of the statement ; and if they will ever wander into that polar and barbarous region of the Atlantic coast , which lies about 420 of north latitude , their eyes shall behold the very spot , where the thing we are telling of was done . But respecting this attributed coldness in the New England character , we should do injustice to our readers to speak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quotation from his eloquent address , we dismiss the subject , for the present . There are other connected topics on which we intended to touch ; but our remarks have already extended themselves to an entirely unexpected length , and we have more than exhausted our space . " Enthusiasm was the characteristic of our fathers ; they transmitted it to their posterity , and , startling as the proposition may seem , it has ever been the basis of the New England character ; - not indeed exhibited externally , and rarely open to superficial observation . " The Puritans , before they left their native country , were surrounded on all sides by enemies , and subjected to violence and oppression from the arm of government , to which they opposed only caution , circumspection , and a fixed immovable // resolution , necessarily begetting much of sternness and severity in their external demeanour . Ever calm and self-controlled , they adopted a rigid system of education for their children , by which outward manifestations of internal emotion were forbidden and repressed . But the fire which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more enduring intensity within , the fountain of that restless energy of character which , whatever the object of pursuit , impels them forward with a boldness and activity equalled by no other people on earth . This is the great moral powers hich , however directed , is sure to produce the most striking results . From obvious causes , it has generally been directed to some branch of productive industry . Their poverty , their barren soil and ungenial climate , their laws of equal distribution of estates allowing no entailments or continued accumulations for posterity , have necessarily , in time of peace , thrown almost every New England man upon some gainful pursuit . He enters upon it with all his characteristic energy and perseverance ; and hence the opinion that he is peculiarly sordid and avaricious . Others see only a thirst for gain , in what , in truth , is but one developement of his constitutional enthusiasm . He is seen calm , cool , self-subdued , with no apparent ardor of temperament , with no pressing physical wants , impelled not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , yet going forward with an activity and inflexibility of purpose which outstrip all competition . He is seen upon the ocean , meeting the world on a fair field of equal competition , traversing every sea , penetrating every coast , daring every climate , everywhere producing greater results with less means than any competitor ; and whatever his object , whether it be drawing its treasures from the bosom of the deep , or pressing with gainful commerce its heaving surface , pursuing it with a bolder spirit , grasping with a stronger hand , striking with a more unerring aim , and spreading his sails for a more daring flight . The same phenomenon is seen on land ; whether it be as a hunter beyond the Rocky iViountains , or a pioneer in felling the forest , and subduing the soil , or in building up cities and constructing rail-roads , still there is the same untiring devotion of all his time and all his faculties . " But those who think that gain alone is the governing and impelling motive , if they will but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other pursuit , although neither gold nor gain can be hoped . In war with the aborigines , where no spoils were to be won , they obtained a superiority , not merely from civilized a'rts , but in those qualities which civilization is supposed to enfeeble , and for which the savage is most // distinguished . They made themselves more active in the race , more sagacious in the council , more watchful in the ambush , and more untiring in the pursuit . In civilized warfare , too , the same characteristics have ken displayed , whether with Paul Jones , and Isaac Hull , and Samuel Tucker , and David Porter , on the ocean , or at Louisbourg , or Bunker Hill , or Quebec , or Niagara . In the paths of Christian benevolence , what ruissionaries have exhibited a more fearless and devoted spirit , whether among the North American Indians , or at Indostan , or the Sandwich Islands , or at Sumatra , faithful even unto death ? " The effects of this pervading zeal and ardor and energy are seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast with cities and villages , and clothed our barren fields with ver ( lure ,  --  which has subdued the forest and spread far and wide the beams and the blessings of civilization . Other parts of our country have been peopled originally from other portions of Europe ; but go where you will , the effects of New England enterprise and skill and labor ate seen and felt . In every State of the Union , you will find that they have taken the lead in energy and activity , and wherever there have been the greatest advances , there you may be sure to find the sons of New England . The Puritan blood flows everywhere , swelling every vein of this great republic , diluted perhaps by intermixture , enfeebled perhaps , but still imparting something of its pristine strength and ardor.
