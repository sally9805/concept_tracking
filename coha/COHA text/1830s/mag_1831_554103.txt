txt The present century has no name in its annals of more enviable distinction than that of Walter Scott ; the victories of Napoleon were not so wide , nor his monuments so likely to endure . The works of his fine imagination have not only found , but created readers in regions xvhere nothing in the form of a book had ever found its way before . Many sagacious persons , like the countryman by the river-side , have been waiting for this tide of popularity to run by ; so far from this , it seems to grow broader and deeper , and bids fair to disappoint all calculations founded upon the usual changes of taste and time . No better test can be given to try the excellence of a work of fancy , than a second reading ; if the interest abate , alas for the writer 's fame ! It indicates a decline , which will go on from year to year , till the star , however brilliant in its season , will sink beneath the horizon , never to rise again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , and the work is laid down the second time with an impression as deep if not as stirring as at first , the author 's fame is secured . Our readers of mature age may apply this to the fame of writers much distinguished in their day . We can remember when the whole reading world shivered by reason of Mrs. Radcliffe 's fearful mysteries ; but a second reading , like the crowing of a cock , drove all her ghosts to their graves . When her gloomy procession had gone by , thousands of readers were surprised by the day-break , as they were devouring the Scottish Chiefs or Thaddeus of Warsaw ; but a second reading served only to destroy all the charm of the first . This is true even of Miss Edgeworth in a measure ; her Lord Oldborough , a character which undoubtedly made more impression than any other which she ever drew , will not bear a second reading ; but her substantial merits have secured for her a desirable and lasting fame . Now , the excellence of Scott appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but require a second reading ; without it , we can not realize the // wealth of his imagination , nor the reach and majesty of his power . The reputation of Scott is built upon his works of fancy . He has labored in other departments of literature with great vigor and success . His biographical sketches , particularly , have been distinguished by their manliness and candor , though , with the exception of Napoleon , they were written without much exertion of his strength . That great work has not satisfied the demands of the world , but we presume that no living writer could have given equal satisfaction ; and the truth is , that the gigantic character he describes is still t6o near us to be painted ; we must wait till the lights and shadows are blended into their right proportions by the effect of distance and time . There are those who are disposed to regret , that so great a character can be earned by one who , as they say , does nothing more than amuse the world , which they consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but let them vary their language a little ,  --  let them call it giving happiness to the world ,  --  and we hardly know how he could propose to himself a higher and happier end for the exertion of his splendid powers . We think that whatever makes men happier is apt to make them better ; and the union of these two purposes being the glory of divine inspiration , we know not why human inspiration should be ashamed to follow the example . Let any one point out a work of Scott in which moral sentiment and character are perverted as in the mighty Corsair of Byron , or the paltry pick-pocket Paul Clifford , and we will take down his statue at once from the high niche in which it stands ; but we can not find in all Scott 's writings a single page , nor a single character , in which shame is made glory , or glory shame , or in which any thing more is given to guilt , than the compassion united with aversion , which it ought always to inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can safely surrender itself to this enchantment , it is when the power is lodged in a conscientious hand like his . It is too late in the day to question whether works of imagination can be safely read ; read they certainly will be , and safely , by those who do not go to excess . Scott has done much to guard against this danger ; for with one sweep of his pen he has sent to forgetfulness whole armies of novels , which used to prey upon the time and feelings of the young . It is true , that some , like Buiwer 's , struggle up by dint of // brazen impudence , into a temporary notoriety , which we shall be compelled to blush for in a year or two , as for the Counsellor Phillips passion , which once prevailed in our land ; but this can not be prevented ; - when a tree throws a thick and deep shadow over a landscape , such pestilent weeds are most apt to grow beneath it . In this case the good is direct , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his writings are not true ? There is such a thing as truth to nature as well as truth to fact , and it often happens that one must be observed at the expense of the other . Who ever thought of objecting to the parables of scripture , that they are not true ? If instruction , information , or suggestion , can be communicated in this way more directly and impressively than in any other , it is folly not to adopt it . The work of fiction in such a case is only an extended figure , which illustrates the truth and deepens its impression . But it is only necessary to say , that the good and bad effects of such works have been greatly overrated ; they affect us more like the action and imagery of a dream , than like the real experience of our lives ; though we allow , that it is quite possible to become intemperately attached to this as well as to music or any other fascinating art . Any extraordinary zeal against it reminds us of John Newton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him laugh de profundis ' in his deepest gloom . We consider ourselves , then , as doing no injustice to the great name of Scott , when we speak of him in reference to his Waverley Novels ; or rather , we consider it but a proper tribute to one who has so delighted the world , to revive the recollections of our surprise and pleasure , when the bright visions of his imagination were first opened to our view . He has now thrown off his disguise , which was never more complete than that of a first rate actor dressed for his part , and easily known by his excellence , though his name is not in the play bill . Though there were some who , with remarkable folly , insisted upon ascribing these works to various persons , whose names were never heard of before , the world had sense enough to know , that they were written by a practised as well as an able hand . It does not readily appear , why Scott should have submitted to the inconvenience of this disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained the success of his experiment upon the public taste ; for besides that it protected him from no criticism , it laid him under // the necessity of denying the authorship when the question was plainly proposed . This he claimed a perfect right to do , and we shall give no opinion on the subject , further than to say , that a secret so defended ought to be well worth keeping . In the case of Junius , there was something gained by a disguise ; men wondered at the extent and accuracy of his information ; while his familiar knowledge of the characters and designs of men in power , and the mystery in which he wrapped himself , made his attacks appear more like the fierce vengeance of an evil spirit than the helpless rage of man . There was a reason why Junius should have made the disguise , which he wore while living , serve as a winding-sheet when dead ; because , even now , if the veil should be torn away , the name of the writer would labor under a reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the case of Scott , there was nothing of the kind to be gained by the disguise , nor lost by the detection ; and the reason of his wearing it probably was , that after first putting it on , for which he had sufficient cause , he never found a time when he could gracefully cast it away . He was spared this trouble by the bankruptcy of his publishers , which of course placed any longer secrecy out of his power . This event subjected him to heavy losses ; but perhaps it can not be regarded as a misfortune ; for few men can submit to severe mental exertion without the impulse of necessity , or equally powerful inducements pressing upon them in one form or another ; and in this point of view nothing can be regarded as a calamity , which drives men to intellectual labor . At all events , his misfortune is gain to the world , and perhaps it is owing to this , that he still perseveres in a work which he would have abandoned long ago , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by satiety of fame . We propose to take some notice of various criticisms which have been made on these remarkable novels , and we may as well say in the outset , that we consider them as poems . Many , who remembered what a charm there was in the first hearing of the words , The feast was over in Branksome tower , ' professed to be surprised that Scott , when his peculiar style was run down by imitators , could strike out a new path for himself , and walk in it with so much grace and power . But the truth was , that he did nothing more than throw off the incumbrances of rhyme , that being all of which his readers were weary , and the natural result was , that he took a wider range , and express void . xxxII. - No. 71. 50 // ed himself with more ease and freedom . He was still every inch a poet , and his works were as much poems as ever ; his apprenticeship to his art , and the familiarity which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as poetical as before ; so that the whole change , instead of amounting to a Pythagorean transmigration , was nothing more than an alteration of dress . Though many seem hardly conscious of this fact , . and various fine theories have been offered to explain , how he who succeeded so well in one department , could write so well in another , it has had an effect , which is even now more felt than seen . The moment the eminent poets of the day were convinced , that a mechanical arrangement of words was not essential to poetry , they rushed out with exultation from the circus to the broad highway . Southey , Campbell and Moore , tried their hands at prose-writing , and to many it seemed as if the whole poetical region was given over to desolation ; hut it soon appeaied , for the consolation of the lovers of the Nine , ' that whereas there is much prosaic verse in the world , there may he such a thing as poetical prose , of which Southey , Moore and Irving , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , or rather , like other reformers , he has pointed out to the world what progress they had already made ; for assuredly , Jeremy Taylor and Isaac Walton were poets many years ago , though they never had written a line of verse . But this is better expressed by the Antiquary . A man may be a poet , without measuring spondees and dactyles , like the ancients , or clashing the ends of lines into rhyme , like the moderns ; as one may be an architect , though unable to labor like a stone-mason . Dost think Paliadio or Vitruvius ever carried a hod ? ' These exemptions , and are to be tried by the same laws . Their lineal descent may be easily traced from the romances of which Mr. Ellis has given so many specimens . It is not a little surprising , that so many objections should have been made to the historical form . So lately as the last year , a writer in the Edinburgh Review repeats the suggestion , that the fancy is only embarrassed by maintaining this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that such works would do better without the support of history . He even refers to the historical portraits which Scott has drawn , for evidence of the truth of his assertion . But // most readers , we apprehend , will agree with us , that his adventurous and successful execution of a work so difficult , is one of th' best proofs of his power , and gives an interest and charm to his writings , which mere fiction could not possess . The critic speaks of Charles Edward , compared with the Baron or Fergus ; there to he sure , the Chevalier must have been over-drawn , in order to inspire interest , because his personal character was deficient in attraction . But Claverhouse , Richard , Mary and Elizabeth , all full length portraits , in which the poet , more by suggestion than enumeration , has contrived to embody all the many and various impressions of their originals , which prevail in history or imagination ; - originals , too , of which every one had already a distinct idea existing in his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced no likeness ,  --  all these , not to speak of the inimitable James in Nigel , form a gallery of more value , than any historians , or all put together , have drawn . And we may estimate the ability with which he has removed our old impressions , and supplanted them by his own , without breaking in upon our associations , by comparing these with the attempts made by such writers as Horace Smith ; or the Pelham manufacturer , attempting to raise Dr. Johnson , and seeming as much at ease as if the awful original stood before him . Both appear in as much perplexity and dismay as the witch of Endor , if the belief be true , that while she intended only an imposture , a real ghost came up from the dead . In this respect , Scott has but one rival , and if he be not inclined , as we presume he is , to yi*ld the prize to Shakspeare , they must , as historial portrait-painters , divide the crown . Moreover , there is an advantage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places ; there is an air of truth about representations of real things , which mere fancypieces never 4id and never can possess . We have no doubt that the Iliad would have been set down as pure fiction , were it not for its local descriptions ; and Virgil , who knew how to turn a good example to the best account , is as minute as MalteBrun , in fixing a sufficient number of land and sea-marks on his hero 's way . Traditions cling to the place where they were born ; to remove or dislodge them , is like the attempt to transplant the palm-tree ; the imagination can not bear any thing Utopian in its favorite descriptions ; in proportion to the reality of its visions , is the desire to attach them to some peculiar // spot ; and since fortunately we can stand in fancy , as well as by travelling , on the plain of Marathon or the ruins of lona , we are pleased to have the writer anchor his imagination to some real scene , even though it be one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that truth and fiction might ally themselves with mutual advantage ; while his real landscape has made us feel confidence in the reality of his persons and actions , it is equally true that the fiction has given a charm to the rocks and mountains of his native land , which will last till the mountains sink and the torrents cease to flow . It is no small distinction thus to patronize his native land , and to cast the light of his own glory on every city , castle and tower , from the Solway to the Shetland isles . A hundred years ago , the Highlands of Scotland were as little known as the Rocky Mountains , but his pen has thrown them open as completely as a thousand military roads , and travellers will wander over them in all generations to come . Like the dying Fergus , he has remembered the blue hills of his country , and they in return shall long remember him . The historical romance , then , in our opinion , is the best form of the novel ; and no serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which though an objection to writers in general , is a recommendation to a man of genius ; a word which we use for acquired as well as original power . If a weak hand undertake to manage this mighty enginery , it soon finds that it would have done better if it had measured its strength , and taken subjects to which it was equal ; but an able hand controls it with easy and gigantic strength , and then the tt*iumph is complete . We speak of acquired power , because it is perfectly evident that mere talent would be but a slender preparation for such a various adventure . Beside inventive faculties of the highest order , the poet must have a pervading and collected good sense , which knows how to give all subjects , and the parts of all sublects , their right place and proportion ; he must be familiar with life as it is at present , and as it was in past ages ; he must be as familiar with history , as with his own table-in the spirit as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and the arts of death , known in ancient times ; rivalling Meyrick in his knowledge of ancient armor , and Dugdale in his monastic learning ; with these , and a hundred other preparations , he must have a strength that smiles under its heaviest burthen , and a humor that plays over all , like the sun-beam on the sea . There are // few , indeed , in whom these attributes are found , and we do not believe that Scott could have possessed as many as he does , had he not devoted the first and best years of his mature life , to preparation , contented to wait for his harvest till life should come near its close . Like Cromwell , he began late , and therefore , like that most fortunate of all u*urpers , he seems likely to die in full possession of his power . The standing objection to Scott 's novels , is their want of a story consistent in all its parts ; as if plots were found in nature ; as if taking any passage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances tending to one conclusion . We have certain traditional notions of the unity required in a poem or novel , which are regularly insisted on by critics , and as often disregarded by every successful writer . In a play such unity may make the representation easier , and aid the dramatic effect ; bi1t even this seems not to be true with respect to Shakspeare ; at any rate , it is a matter of choice whIm writers , whether they shall enslave themselves to the classical forms or not , and then success alone can determine , whether they do wisely to observe or break them . In Old Mortality , Scott , like Shakspeare in the Winter 's Tale , leaps over a number of years ; for this the critics reprove him , and tell him that it would have been better to bring the narrative sooner to a close , or to give the annals of the lost years . He , however , is of a different opinion , and in such a case , his opinion is at least as good as theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the examining critic , and not to the interested reader ; and provided his readers are satisfied , we presume that he is not much oppressed by the critic 's displeasure . By putting together several admissions and disclosures in this late edition , we gather a curious piece of literary history , and have no doubt , that our conjecture is true . When Guy Mannering appeared , it was reviewed in the Quarterly it i the flippant and ungracious style , which was commonly reserved for American subjects . In 1817 , a review of Old Mortality followed , in which allusions were made to the first , as if it were hardly just , but with a salvo for the infallibility of reviewers . This last article brought forward the passages of history on which some of his scenes and characters were founded ; and it now appears , that the reviewer , Mr. Erskine , derived this information from Scott himself , who doubtless saw the paper ; for no friend to the author would have published criticism so severe , without // his permission , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public favor . This article contains most of the literary censures which have been thrown upon the novelist ; want of story and connexion among the rest ; and thus it appears , that Scott , by connivance if not direct agency , has supplied the critics with most of their charges against himself . The reviewer has shown some art in assuming the harsh and crabbed manner which once distinguished the Quarterly ; - we say once , because justice requires us to say of both the great British Reviews , that they have gained in moral loveliness what they have lost in intellectual power . Beside the loose construction of his stories , it is objected to him , that his heroes are inefficient and uninteresting . That they are uninteresting , every reader will testify , is not true ; they are certainly less marked and striking than other characters in the novel , but if this be charged upon him as a fault , then , as Johnson finely says , there is an appeal open from criticism to nature . The name hero usually indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to us from the times , when want of physical force and military success was want of every thing . But in the course of ages it has been discovered , that other less brilliant qualities are quite as likely to secure the happiness of social and domestic life ; and to have slain two hundred Philistines , would not be a passport to the favor of the fair of the present day . Still this impression , which is almost obliterated among the Sioux and Pawnees , and has been forgotten for centuries in every civilized land , is insisted upon as a rule essential to the interest of every perfect poem . If the hero must concentrate in his own person all the interest of the story , Achilles is not the hero of the Iliad , nor IEneas of the poem which bears his name . The Baron of Bradwardine certainly attracts more attention than Waverley , and Balfour of Burley more than Morton ; but it seems to us , that neither of those worthies would have figured to advantage in the character of a lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertram and Julia Mannering ; so that , according to this judicious criticism , the author had no alternative , but either to substitute the elder couple for the happy pair of the novel , or to cut down the peculiarities of those remarkable characters , so that they might not eclipse the younger . In short , lovers belong to ordinary life , and if an author binds himself to any such rule , he can only ring a new change on the low life // above stairs , which form the staple of the novels regularly imported from England , and which are enough to make the angels weep , if any there be , which have charge of the taste or morals of our country . We shall only mention one other special charge brought against the novelist-it is , that there is a sameness in his characters-one hears too much resemblance to another-thus , Helen McGregor , Meg Merrilies , and Norna , have been called , absurdly enough , copies from the same original , and other Macedon and Monmouth resemblances have been discovered , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little alteration from the other . But the author draws from nature , and there is a sameness in nature . One mountain resembles another , one valley resembles another , and we should argue ill of the success of the painter , who should endeavor to represent a hill or vale unlike any that ever existed , or were ever painted before . So the varieties of feature in the human race can not be very great either in face or mind ; the innumerable shades of difference that we see , depend upon expression ; and any hasty or unobservant eye , which does not notice this expression , will think that every man bears a wonderful resemblance to every other man . The more delicate touches which make up the expression of character , will wholly escape him . It is such observers , only , who have complained of the sameness of character in the Waverley novels ; the author has faults , doubtless , but this is not one of them . His later works are received with less enthusiasm , than the first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that he does not repeat his characters and descriptions ; for the earlier scenes of Waverley , Guy Mannering , and the Antiquary , came upon us with a freshness and a surprising charm , which the author could not from the nature of things , equal or renew , even if time had doubled his ability . We can not live upon luxuries , without losing something of our passion for them ; it is quite too hard to blame the author for the liberality with which he has dealt out his treasures , and so far as we can discover , the principal reason for complaining of his later works , is , that they are not the first . Before we dismiss this part of our subject , we must say , that nothing seems more groundless than the charge that historical romances make us indifferent to real history . This is easily answered . The introduction of real history either helps the interest of the work , or it does not . If it do not , we are indifferent // to real history already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it do , history must have some charm of its own , which gives to the novel much of its attraction . The common impression seems to be , that fiction is the same with falsehood ; so far from this , we apprehend that there is more truth in Scott 's Old Mortality or Shakspeare 's Richard III . than in so many pages of Flume . The poets choose the fiction , as the form which will give the most exact representation of the events and manners of the time ; they adopt it for the sake of a nearer approach to truth ;  --  and thus a reader of Waverley will get a far more just idea of the Pretender 's inroads in 1745 , than a hundred such books as Home 's Rebellion would afford him ; in fact all histories put together would not tell us half so much truth concerning the Highlands , a most curious and interesting subject , as we can gather in an hour from Waverley and Rob Roy . rrhe scenes as well as the characters represent , not individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to error than history ; still the highest praise we claim for it is , that it furnishes colors to fill up the broad outline , which the exact historian has drawn . As for its making us indifferent to history , it seems to us that ignorance is the great cause of indifference in all things . Make a man acquainted with a subject , and his indifference ends ; he inevitably becomes interested , more or less , in one way or another ; and we believe , that thousands who have been struck with detached portions of history , as exhibited in Scott 's magic lantern , have gone to the fountains of authentic information to learn more of what had so delighted them , and thus made themselves familiar with many chronicles , to which they had lived and died strangers but for him . But allow that the charge is true ; the novel is soon read  --  the novelist is mortalwe have evidence enough , that no living writer can make his place good , and in the natural course of things , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent in the same department , shall rise for many generations . Then those who have read history in his writings , will be driven by their famine to the sources from which his information was drawn . The interest once excited , can not easily go down ; - hut when its luxuries fail , will content itself with a meaner supply . Having thus answered as well as we are able , the objections to the form and character of these works , we shall not feel as if we were out of place in speaking of Scott 's peculiar qualifi // cations for this kind of writing ; a subject which has not been discussed in this Journal . We should certainly mention his good sense as tbe most remarkable of the original elements of his intellectual character ; for , improved as it has been by experience and acquaintance with human nature , he must have inherited an unusual share . We mean the power of judging , balancing and comparing ; the power of fixing a steady eye , and giving a rapid decision upon the creations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm hand the reins of a quick imagination , which , uncontrolled or misguided , whirls away its possessor to destruction ; but rightly managed and governed , bears him on eagles ' wings to the highest victories and glories of the mind . In the common walks of life this good sense is not uncommon , and appears in the easy confidence , with which its owner moves right onward to his object , wbere others hesitate and despair . But in the common walks of life there is not usually much imagination to control , and this good sense does not become a remarkable endowment , till we see its effect in ruling the fancies and passions of a gigantic mind . What such a mind will be without it , we see in Byron , whose passions , fired by imagination , were as wild and ungovernable as a rover 's crew ; of itself it will not make a man great ; hut no man can have any sure and lasting greatness without it ; and it is so apt to be wanting , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the chief distinction of this great author 's mind . In invention , he is generally thought to be wanting , and we suspect that here the common opinion would place Miss Edgeworth before him ; but without disparaging her admitted claims , we would suggest , that Homer and Virgil took advantage of national traditions ; Milt*n horrowed much of his subject from popular theology , though very little from the Scriptures . Shakspeare , as every one knows , made use of the penny tracts and novels of his day ; and if on this ground only we impeach Scott 's character for invention , we must allow , that all these other great names have worn a glory not their own . The supply of materials is nothing without the power to use them . Supply two architects with marble , and while one will make a lime-kiln , the other will build a temple for the wonder of ages , lifting up a front , which harmonizes with the calm sky , as if it were sculptured from a bright evei*ing cloud . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // his imagination . Never was a fancy more fertile , various and brilliant ; but there is nothing fitful about it ; it spreads a steady and never-failing brightness all round , while his late rival , Byron , might have said of himself , like Mahomet : When the lightning flashes we go on by its light ; when it vanishes into darkness , we stand still . ' It is this union of sense and sensibility , which gives the charm to Scott 's other writings ; let his subject be Demonology , or what it may , he never plunges into profound discussion ; he always keeps far within the limits of his power , and writes as if sensible remark , lively fancy , and playful humor were all that the subject required . Had he never written his poems or novels , he would have been thought too homely , and matter-of-fact for poetry ; and this proves that he brings to every subject , precisely that kind and degree of power , which it requires . This is the reason , why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not perceive , that as he was generally writing to illustrate some portion of history , the invention of character was more wanted than facts , which were every where furnished to his hand . A story requires no great consistency ; nothing can be more strange and wild than the romances , in which real life abounds ; but an invented character , to have the air of life , must be consistent in every part , and under all circumstances , into which it can be thrown ; and to describe it well , is one of the hardest enterprises of the mind . The character of Sir Waltcr Scott 's mind appears in his style , which though more careless in his later writings , is simple , expressive , and at times very eloquent in its flow . The style , where it is unborrowed , is always an index of the mind . The clearest minds express themselves most clearly ; and wherever we find a dim and hazy style , like that which is coveted by some writers of the day , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy as Ossian 's ghosts , instead of puzzling over it as many do , believing that it must be very fine if one could discover its meaning , we take it for granted that the obscurity is in the writer s mind , and that no light need be expected there . There are popular writers in prose and verse , who can express themselves with force and plainness in ordinary affairs ; but let philosophy or poetry be named , and , to use the words of the town clerk of Edinburgh , they are off and rip in the air a hundred miles above common sense and comprehension . ' We regard it as one of the proofs // of Scott 's ability , that he never subsides into this mysticism , or if he imagine unspeakable things , does not attempt to utter them . So far from such vain attempts , he generally keeps far within the ascertained limits of his strength , and thus gives the impression , particularly in his earlier poems , that however much the present effort may surprise the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's style with that of the children of the mist , Coleridge for example , and it is easy to perceive , that the superior clearness is not merely in expression , but in the mind . The fate of the subtle doctor , ' who , when he was old , wept , because he could not understand his own books , should be a warning to all such writers . Scott 's education , as well as his natural ability , qualified him admirably well for that enterprise , on which his fame is destined to rest . He describes his course of self-education in the studies of Waverley ; these were about as systematic and selfdenying , as what Peter Poundtext called his studies , viz. reading an ancient theological treatise , with a pipe in his mouth , and a small jug of ale beside him . ' It seems , that he cast himself into the sea of books without any thing but his own pleasure to guide him . He was master of Milton and Shakspeare , of the old English dramatic authors , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all manner of voyages and travels , and all the portions of literature , likely to interest a luxurious and vagrant mind . But he was not confined to the resources of his own language ; beside the classical authors required by a liberal education , he was familiar with the treasures of chivalrous learning afforded by the Spanish and Italian , and the endless variety of French memoirs and romances . At the age of fifteen , he had the misfortune to break a blood-vessel , and as some compensation for a confinement and starvation of several weeks , he was permitted to read at pleasure all such works as a large circulating library supplied . Had he not possessed the good sense of which we have spoken , such early excesses would have enervated his mind ; they would have entirely unfitted most men for success in literature or any profession , which requires any concentration of the intellectual powers ; but with him the case was different ; and to this miscellaneous reading is it owing , that he has now an anecdote or illustration at hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rubbish of the antiquary 's collections ; but with him , nothing is lost ; // he finds a way to convert them all into materials for the use of his mind . With a mind thus fitted to throw a romantic coloring* upon every thing , the time of Scott 's youth was eminently suited to cherish his peculiar taste . Children with this disposition take pleasure in listening to narrative old age ; and it so happened , that the veterans of the day were those who had been out in the Forty-five , ' as it was called , when the Scotch , with a generous self-devotion , however mistaken the cause , made a last effort to replace their own Stuarts on the British throne . It is true , the exiled family were wholly unworthy of this attachment ; but there was nothing in the characters of the Brunswick line , which could tend , by contrast , to throw them into deeper shadow ; and believing , as the Highland Chieftains did , that the Stuarts were wronged , their loyalty rose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest with which we thought of the exiled Bourbon race , till they and their allies contrived to change the sympathy of the world into scorn ; and may be able therefore to form some idea of the attachment of the Scotch to an unfortunate royal line , which sprang from the bosom of their own country . We learn from Scott himself , that he took every opportunity of gathering these traditions , from the actors in those scenes , or their children ; and though his prejudices were all in favor of the Protestant succession , his soul must have been on fire at the recital of the brutal revenge inflicted on his native land by Cumberland , after the battle of Culloden , and William , of glorious and immortal memory , ' at the massacre of Glencoe . The effect of this youthful influence is easily seen in his works ; his politics lead him in one direction , and his sympathies in another . He is not willing to declare Mary Stuart a murderess upon the testimony of men , who united the profession of saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to her case the maxim of the law , which presumes her innocent , or rather reserves his judgment till she is proved guilty , which she never yet has been . He defends the memory of the unfortunate Chevalier against disappointed friends and illiberal foes , and does not think it necessary to paint him as unworthy in his youth , because desperation afterwards drove him into debasing crimes . Thus prepared to be impressed by tradition , the history of his country , from early ages down to his own time , was full of inspiration ; and as GM Mortality restored the mossgrown // inscriptions on the tombs , he has engraven with an iron pen in the rock forever ' the triumphs and sorrows of his native land . In truth , we do not know where he could have found a region more suited to his taste and talent than the Highlands . When he was young , the civil storms had just swept away the clouds which had covered them for ages , and made them a mystery even to those who dwelt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disclosed scenery of unequalled wildness and grandeur ; to the poet , a display of character equally wild and imposing ; while the philosophical observer found there a social system so different from any thing modern , that to climb a few miles from the plain to the mountains , was like passing over ten centuries of time . There were gloomy and ferocious , or chivalrous and accomplished chieftains ; vassals at war with all the world , except their own clan , and so faithful to each other , that the bands grew the tighter , the more they were wet ' with blood . It seemed like a new world revealed on purpose for him to conquer ; and if the maxim of the law with respect to right to property be true , he has made the whole realm of Scotland his own . His natural good sense was enough of itself to save him from being misled in his judgments by romantic associations , but it was aided by the habits of his early life . Though descended from a family of distinguished name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend for advancement on his own exertions . He was compelled to begin the usual course of a pains-taking lawyer . Had his romantic enthusiasm been too strong , this would have been abundantly sufficient to tame it ; and it gave him an acquaintance with human character and the business of life , without which he never could have written his novels ; without which he would have made his Fergus like Miss Porter 's Wallace ; without which he would have made his heroes all virtue , and his villains all evil . Moreover , his acquaintance with the mysteries of the law has been turned to the happiest account in his novels ; without it he could have drawn neither Pleydell nor Saddletree . That he never has been enslaved to it , may be seen from the many instances of good-natured satire upon its statutes and provisions , which will doubtless do more than so many motions in Parliament to produce reform . Such is the allusion in the Antiquary to the subject of imprisonment for debt , the fugie-warrants ye ken , ' and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " It 's a beautiful thing to see how lang and carefully justice is considered in this country . ' His situation in Edinburgh in early life , made him acquainted with the distinguished men who were then the boast of Scotland , and among the rest with Burns , then in the blaze of his fame , and to appearance distant from the disastrous eclipse in which he at last went down . Little did he anticipate , that the boy who gazed upon him with respectful interest , was afterwards to be a shining light , beside which all others should grow dim . The character which was thus formed by nature , circumstances , and education , was admirably suited to the work in which he was afterwards to engage . There was not a particle of bitterness in his whole composition ; but though a sly and sharp observer of men , seeing through their weaknesses with an almost unerring eye , he always looked upon the bright side when it was possible , and thus was a gainer in accuracy as well as good feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of others is apt to be most just . Being fully conscious of possessing a giant 's strength , he felt no temptation to use it like a giant ; and thus was entirely free from those jealous passions , which make a literary life a life of warfare . He was also free from that nervous anxiety for the success of his productions , which often induces authors to correct and alter their works , till they have lost their peculiar beauties ; of which we have an in*stance in Mrs. Hemans 's fine lines on the death of Fergus , and Campbell 's Lochiel 's Warning . Without any ambition of wit , like Sheridan 's , for example , which is often as ungentle and surprising as an electric shock , and which carries more blood-stain than brightness on its edge , Scott has the easy and delightful humor of a good-natured man ; it reminds us of the archness of unlabored conversation ; and no man can doubt that the same wit , which forms the attraction of his own table at home , lights up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . On the whole , as is often said of great men , he seems made for the times , and the enterprise in which he was to engage . This is not a romantic age ; and the familiarity which he discovers with law , mercantile business , and the rule of three , has no doubt caused many to turn a moment from the Year-book and Ledger , who in all other cases treat the unprofitable art of poem-making , as the Scotch Presbyterians call it , with utter contempt and derision . The works , by which he acquired his earliest popularity-a // favor which the enthusiasm for his novels hardly transcendswere writings of a kind unfitted for the display of humor ; and their narrative being entirely romantic , excluded a large proportion of those characters , which he draws with most skill . Such characters as William of Deloraine , are but half revealed ; and such as Robin Hood and the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst-even such as Evan Dhu and the robber Bean Lean , though perfectly at home on romantic ground , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings . Roderick Dhu and Lord Marmion might remain ; but the poet was so fettered by the forms of his poem , that he could not possibly develope the character of the last , even so far as to show that his fraud and falsehood were perfectly consistent with his chivalrous character . In the novel , he writes without restraint , and tells all , or what is still better , allows his characters to tell all for themselves . He constantly seemed oppressed before , by the feeling that he was confined to a limited circle ; he crowded much antiquarian information into his notes , which to many were as interesting as the poem ; information , which in the novel can be wrought gracefully into the texture of the whole , instead of being trailed after it in court-dress fashion . It was to be expected , then , that after a time , those works would decline in public favor , as they did ; not so much because the world grew weary of them , nor because they were travestied by a rabble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employment was too youthful for a man of so much talent , and one in which he could not display to the world half the riches of his mind . No such objection could be made to the form of the novel . It will embrace all that man ever did , and all that man ever knew ; nothing is above it nor beneath it ; it includes with perfect ease and gracefulness all varieties of science , information , profession and character ; and as it ' does not restrain or oppress the writer , it is not likely to change , except by improvement ; an improvement which will appear , not so much in the form as in the taste , literature , and moral character of such productions . Such a change has taken place already , and it is to Scott that we are indebted in part for the progress already made , though we would not forget Miss Edgeworth , whose well-de-b served success , we are told , inspired Scott to finish Waverley , when the earliest part of the manuscript had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that both surpass such writers as // Fielding , as much in talent as in moral taste . The question is often asked , what rank will Scott take among our novelists , when time has set its seal upon the reputation of his works ? We have no hesitation in saying , that he will stand as much above him in durable fame , as he now does in interest and attraction . Fielding , no doubt , was a great genius , and in this respect , even Scott perhaps is not before him ; but native strength will go but little way in such an enterprise ; and Fielding was wholly destitute of the refinement and general cultivation , which any large view of life requires . Certain aspects of human nature , can no doubt he seen in a London policeoffice and prison , or in the lanes and inns of that vast labyrinth of crime ; but the very experience which fitted Fielding to describe these with such perfect truth and humor , not to say relish , rendered him utterly incapable of describing happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a misanthropic picture of a man . He rather describes England , than human life ; his best sketches are those of individuals , not of classes ; and like other painters of manners , he must give place to those who find their originals in human nature at large , rather than individual characters . We are not insensible to his grave humor ; for in solemn irony , even Swift does not exceed him ; nor are we sure that we do right to compare his works with those of Scott . This is a parallel like that between Hudibras and the Orlando . We are perfectly aware that Fielding was not what , with better principles and a happier destiny , he might have been ; but whatever offence we may give to those who are always ready to say of every thing , the old is better , ' we are quite resigned to the change of taste , which has removed Tom Jones and Amelia to the highest shelves . It is vain to plead the taste of the times for his indecency ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and if he thought proper thus to defile his pages , he has no one but himself to condemn . He is the suicide of his own fame . Of Smollett , we should hardly speak in this connexion , except to express our delight that he did not carry into effect a purpose he had formed , of making his native land the scene of some of his fictitious stories . He would certainly have peopled it with strange inhabitants , and would have extracted sufficient amusement from the subject ; but it would have been like Sir Roger de Coverley , in the hands of Steele ; the fine simplicity which Scott and Burns have identified with the // Scotch dialect and character , would certainly have vanished under the coarse caricature of his pencil ; and by thus forestalling the field , he might have prevented Scott in a later day , from spreading over it a mantle of venerable and pleasing associations . In one respect , he might perhaps have done it more ample justice than Scott ; the latter , through respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shameful cruelties committed by authority upon the Scotch nation , after their attempts to restore the Stuarts were put down ; and has paraded with too much exultation , one or two of those expressions of magnanimity on the part of the Brunswick line , toward their fallen rivals , which , inasmuch as they cost nothing , the victorious party can easily affo*rd to spare . The Scotch had undoubtedly laid themselves open to punishment , but the infliction should have been that of a civilized government , not a savage horde , such as under the authority of the Duke of Cumberland , overran the land . It is but justice to the Stuarts , and their supporters , to show that the spirit of the established succession was little , if any better , than their own . OC the early English novelists , Richardson deserves to be placed nearest to Scott . Most readers deny the justice of Dr. Johnson 's criticism , when he places him before Fielding ; but Fielding has an advantage over him , in the unchangeableness of the low life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation to generation ; no substantial change can take place in the fox-hunting squire , so long as the race endures ; and originals may even now be found , to test the truth of Fielding 's descriptions . On the contrary , Richardson , though he dealt much more with the human heart and character than Fielding , was minutely accurate in describing dress and manners ; things which in the changes of time and fashion become so grotesque , that the bodily presence of Sir Charles Grandison , whose bow was a curvation of the spine , would not be more fatal to the pathetic and sentimental in real life , than he now is in the novel . Still , Richardson was even more than Scott the reformer of his day ; he waged war upon the majestic old romances , enormous folios , any one of which might have been the book with which Dr. Johnson felled his bookseller , Osborne ; and which , with their brazen clasps and dull red edging , held the same place on the drawing-room table , which a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' present race of novels ; now , the reader is unpleasantly brought up by the // close of the book , a few hours after its interest begins , while the old romance would entertain him from day to day , and from year to year . It was no common power which encountered this heavy artillery , and silenced it forever . It is really surprising , that the literature of Britain should have furnished so few novels , till a very recent time , when they have broken upon us in a deluge , as if the stream had been dammed for ages . There have been very few novelists by profession , nor can the deficiency be accounted for , by saying , that they wrote in the poetical form ; for of epics , how few there are which have left even a name . The Vicar of Wakefield still stands foremost in popularity ; Rasselas , though the sentiments are philosophically untrue as well as depressing , is still read . It will be observed , that these two very successful works were written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home in verse than prose ; and in both expressed himself with that simple eloquence , which goes directly to the heart . Johnson , though not commonly regarded in this light , was distinguished by the poetical character of his mind ; much of the power of his argument depended on the bright light of his imagination . Unfortunately , his defect of sight prevented him from enjoying the grand and beautiful in nature , and his bodily infirmities made his fancy rise , except in short flights , with a heavy and flagging wing . We have slightly alluded to the novelists who stood before the public at the time of Scott 's appearance , and who , for a time , seemed to be breathless with amazement at the sight of the new phenomenon . Their satisfaction was not increased by the voices , which they heard from all sides , saying to them , like Sieyes to his associates , when Bonaparte came forward ; Gentlemen , you have a master . ' They retired x*vith one consent from the field , and for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length , some solitary voice was beard between the acts ; and now , novels of all descriptions swarm upon the reading world . There are few , however , of the vast uumnbers constantly imported from England , likely to endure ; our own country gives us a better supply . Of the British novels , published within the last few years , Cyril Thornton is by far the best ; it is a work of real power ; in Scotch character and Scotch humor , the writer may contend with the Au-* thor of Waverley , with his foot on his native soil , while the more pathetic parts make strong appeals to the heart . Were // it not for a case of seduction , which the author ascribes to his hero , we should have read it with unmingled pleasure , and we can not easily account for its attracting so little attention . One word to readers of the present day . There is a power in scenes and narratives , which implies no power in the writer ; and certain writers , without industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition . They go to lunatic asylums , and note in their tablets the ravings of the maniac in chains ; they study the Newgate Calendar , or write down the confession of some atrocious malefactor ; and with these genuine horrors , make a deep impression on the public mind . But the business is wholly mechanical ; some paltry wax-work , representing a bloody and ghastly form , may make the strong man start , and women faint away , while the pencil of Michael Angelo could not produce an effect half so striking ; but no one is so absurd , as to judge of a work of art from the shock which it gives ; if equal judgment were shown in respect to novels , the public taste would no longer be insulted by works , in which such narratives as any veteran knave can furnish , are paraded as splendid specimens of invention and descriptive power . The edition of Scott 's nov*Ms , which we have undertaken to notice , is one which has received the final revision of the author ; and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical facts , on which the incidents and charac* ters in his works are founded . We can well imagine that he did this with a sort of triumph ; for it shows that he drew from nothing but the ocean-spring of his own imagination . A few notes relative to matters of fact , are acceptable enough as illustrations ; but the traditions which he brings forward as containing the suggestions of such characters as Meg Merrilies , Madge Wildfire , and others , evidently would not help a poor fancy , and would do little more than embarrass a strong one . Altogether we think they might as well have been reserved ; for such an air of vivid reality attaches to his descriptions , that we think of all his events and characters as if they had really existed . We are rather vexed at being told , on the best authority , that they are nothing more than life-like fictions ; we almost say as Bentley did of Horace , Yea , if he were now here and swore it , I would not believe him. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the whole story , otherwise loosely constructed , is held together by // that thread of history which is known to all . The Chevalier is a historical character ; a young prince , who believed that his father had the same right to his kingdom that others have to their estates ; and who , if he had been told at the moment of invasion that the majority of the nation had a right , and were disposed to reject him , would have replied , that this question was the one to be decided . The author has painted the character of this young prince in bright colors , and the evidence of facts bears him out in so doing . It is not surprising that a dethroned and discrowned sovereign , or one who has seen that hope , which is brighter than a crown , deferred and destroyed , should fall into excesses in exile , poverty and humiliation , to which , in better days , he was a stranger . This was evidently the case with Charles Edward . In the days of Waverley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , so long as his prosperity lasted , possessed the attachment of all about him , but who , as usual , found enough to act the byiena as soon as he was fallen . The evidence of Dr. King against him , is that of a disappointed partisan , who deserted his cause . If he were as spiritless and enervated as he is often represented , it seems difficult to account for his return to England in 1759 , which seems to have been putting his head into the lion 's mouth . Historians do not mention this last and most hopeless endeavor ; but Dr. King testifies , that Charles Edward actually visited London in disguise ; and we remember a conversation in Boswell 's Tour to the Hebrides , in which a chieftain stated to Dr. Johnson , that the Chevalier was at that time in England . The romance of Redgauntlet is founded on this incident , which involved no serious consequences . We have no doubt , then , that Charles Edward , though afterwards miserably changed , was in youth what Scott describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aided by the history of the times , and it strikes every reader as precisely the one in which no such aid was needed . It might have been drawn by a very inferior hand . But the Baron of Bradwardine , with his pedantry and ancestral vanity , so oddly mingled with good sense , courage , and generous feeling ; Fergus , whose noble bearing on the memorable trial , makes us forget how fiery and unreasonable he had been ; Evan , whose attachment to his chieftain had become a part of his nature ; Baillie Macwheeble , who pauses in the moment of capture , to set down a sma ' minute ' to make matters sure ; the high-souled // and lovely Flora ; the equally lovely and gentle Rose , are all creations of the author 's genius . It seems to us , that the want of intefest complained of in the character of Waverley , arises from its truth to nature . What more natural , than that one educated as he had been , should be acted upon by the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think that such a character can not have much that is high and manly to redeem its failings and errors . Now it is not a little singular , that the Baron 's returning into danger to rescue his Titus Livius , and the stratagem by which Janet Gellatly , when on trial for witchcraft , routed her judicial persecutors , and also the stratagem , by which Davie misled the soldiers , who were in pursuit of the Baron , all which circumstances would , especially the first , be pronounced the most unnatural in the book , are incidents , which actually happened . And no doubt many a narrative might be drawn to the letter from real life , which critics would pronounce decidedly unnatural , for the same reason which makes a French connoisseur think a tragedy of Addison more natural than Shakspeare 's ; because he has an idea of what nature requires firmly fixed in his mind , and compares every thing with this in preference to real life , thinking that if it be not nature , it is something better than nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter he quoted as a curious piece of literary history . Inspired , as he tells us , by the recollections and traditions of the Forty-five , ' the author wrote , in 1805 , about one third part of the first volume of Waverley . It was advertised to be published under the title of Waverley , or t is Fifty Years Since , ' the latter part of the title having been afterwards altered . The author showed the manuscript to a friend , ( it had then reached the seventh chapter , ) whose opinion was unfavorable , and the work was thrown by into an old writing desk , where it lay forgotten till after his removal to Abbotsford in 1811 . Afterwards the fame of Miss Edgeworth , and an ambition to render Scotland as interesting as she had made her own land , induced him to search for the unfinished manuscript , which was no where to be found , till one day , in looking for some fishing-tackle , it came to light in the old desk aforesaid , which had kept Horace 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in // 410 Waverley Novels . its merits , but from want of a name in the title-page to induce them to read it . As soon as it gained a hearing , its success was brilliant ; the gale of popular favor , which has not since changed , beat upon it in a perfect storm . Guy Mannering followed Waverley , though with a considerable interval between ; for it was not till the success of Waverley was certain , that the author was induced to try his fortune again . In this new attempt he did not lean upon history , as in the other ; and the consequence has been , that , although incomparably beyond Waverley in its first impression , it is now generally thought inferior ; because Waverley not only abounds in historical fact , but breathes the living spirit of the times it describes ; while Guy Mannering describes nature and manners without reference to any particular age . Perhaps even now , any one reading these works for the first time , would give the preference to Guy Mannering ; such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , and the strong romantic interest attached to the scenes in which the gypsies appear . The author informs us , that he began with the intention of resting the interest of the story upon the acci* dental correctness of an astrological prediction . This accounts for the aspect of the earliest chapters . Happily he became aware of his mistake before he had gone too far , and now the astrology of the novel , without amounting to superstition , carries with it that slight degree of mystery , which recommends itself in an unaccountable manner to the most rational minds . It is now a story not far removed from ordinary life , and is remarkable for its containing the only decided failure of the author in his attempt to draw a heroine ; such is the common opinion with respect to Miss Mannering , and it is a verdict in which we entirely agree . When these works were in their height of interest and favor , various attempts were made to show the author 's want of originality , and traditions were brought forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes and characters were drawn . It now appears that the formidable person who brought the author to justice was no other than himself ; we have already mentioned the instance in the Quarterly Review . The appearance of Guy Mannering called forth anoth*ir in Blackwood 's Magazine . There it was stated , that the original of Meg Merrilies was a gypsy , named Gordon , a remarkable person , who resembled the fictitious character in her energy , // fidelity , and influence with her lawless tribe . The adventure of Dinmont with the robbers , and the part borne in it by Meg , were also historically true . In this last edition , we are told that Dominie Sampson was taken from one who was an original in every sense of the word ; a simple and faithful tutor , who supported his patron 's daughter by his exertions , and treated her with the same affectionate respect , when her father 's death had left her poor and dependent on him . We are glad of this , for the honor of human nature . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters were taken , such as Yarskins , a Dutch smuggler ; statiog by way of commentary , that he has been informed of this by creditable persons , though it was unknown to him till after the work appeared . The truth is , however , that these characters develope themselves in their conversation , which could not well have been copied from the living letter ; and with these few materials upon his hands , the author is like one to whom a subject is prescribed , somewhat more embarrassed than when left to choose his own . We are told that the funeral scene described in the novel , has had the effect to produce a reform in Edinburgh , in respect to the decency of such transactions . The character of Dandie Dinmont was assigned by common consent to Mr. James Davidson of Hindlee , who besides the points of honesty , bluntness and hardihood , had a family of dogs whose generic names were Pepper and Mustard . An English lady of rank , wishing to possess some animals of this distinguished line , took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which direction it reached Mr. Davidson , who failed not to appropriate the name , and grant the request . Two of the dogs now reside in the family of the author , and it is to be hoped , express themselves grateful by their services , for the gift of immortality . These little incidents are interesting , and show how strong is the persuasion of the reality of the story ; the historian may bless his stars , who is able to leave half as distinct an impression of the truth of his narrative on the minds of his readers , though he gives chapter and verse for every fact which he records . The Antiquary was the immediate su9cessor of Guy Mannering , and like Waverley , was more slow in making its way into favor ; but not for the same reason . The readers of that work could not relish it at first , because the manners it de // scribes were wholly new ; they made the same mistake with Waverley himself , when , from ignorance of the Highland manners , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor is it surprising that there was something fatal to all romance in the collectors of black-mail , and stealers of cattle ; when circumstances so slight are sufficient to quench all enthusiasm in common life , it is easy to account in this instance for the holding hack of general applause . But the fate of the Antiquary , which from being the least popular , is now as a whole , the favorite work of the author , is embraced in the usual destiny of great productions in all the arts ; not less in music and painting than poetry ; a destiny which promises the more enduring fame , to that which *s less relished at first . So well is this fact established and so generally known , that we at once apprehend , that there may be more finery than real excellence , in that which charms us at the first hearing . Works of genius reqmAre study and will bear it . Sir Joshua Reynolds tells us , that he was not struck with Raphael 's paintings till after long study and attention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to last , when that which pleased at once is forgotten . In admitting the public behind the curtain , we learn with respect to the Antiquary , that the character of Oldbuck was taken from real life . The original was a friend of the author 's youth , who resembled the Antiquary in learning , wit and quaintness of expression ; but excepting the scene with the owner of the stage-coach , nothing in the fiction bears any resemblance to the circumstances of the original . It seems that the likeness was striking enough to endanger the secret of the author ; for a person who knew this original and his intimacy with the family of Scott , declared himself satisfied , that he had discovered the Great Unknown . Edie the mendicant , is the representative of a class , and was drawn from two or three originals , each of whom had something in common with the beggar of the story . Beyond this it does not appear , that any thing was supplied by history or tradition . The common impression is , that Fairport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abbey of some note in the ancient history of Scotland ; but the author does not confirm this , and from his frankness in making all such admissions , we may infer , that it is not true . We believe that some regret is generally felt , that Miss Wardour was not more distinguished from other young ladies , and the false alarm at the close might have seemed a lame conclusion , // had it not been borne out by many similar scenes in this country and Great Britain during the late war , when , as every one remembers , the mistake was ludicrous , but the excitement was sublime . There are one or two ill-managed scenes , and the German weighs somewhat heavily on many parts of the story ; but what must those faults be , which the aged Elspeth and the funeral at the cottage fail to redeem ? In the preface to the Antiquary the author intimated , that his course was at an end , remembering probably , that his poetical works had declined in public favor , and wishing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled with indifference on the part of readers . But he must have soon discovered , that there was no such danger , and that there was no need of reasoning from one case to the other ; for if the time were ever to come , when the world would be weary of his productions , it was then as distant as any thing human could be . His purpose of silence must have been contingent , and he did wisely to break it , for no one of his works has fixed itself more strongly on the imagination than Rob Roy . This is partly owing to Diana Vernon , a bewitching vision , whose wildness , sense and beauty , inspired more interest for the time , than even Flora Mac Ivor . There were contrasts in her character frilly accounted for by her situation , but romantic in the highest degree ; and similar contrasts made the ground-work of the novel . A Highland robber is brought into intimate union with the most homely and practical person who could be found in Glasgow ; those who proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of nature and social life . The confusion is as striking as in Mr. Stewart 's congregation at the Sandwich islands , where the fashionable coat of the day stood side by side with a faded revolutionary uniform , a ruffled shirt by a frame which never felt the want of such a blessing , and a lady *of rank paraded in the latest style of Broadway , fully equipped with every luxury , excepting stockings and shoes . Here , Rob Roy , who gives the name and much of the interest to the work , is , except as far as his conversation goes , entirely drawn from history ; and the same is true of his wife , whose wrongs and vengeance are not overstated ; the tradition is , that she stood by his bedside when he was dying , with an exhortation similar to that of the wife of Job , and received a still sharper reply . The real history of this person is given by VQL. xxxll. - No. 71. 53 // Nicol Jarvie in the novel with exactness , and about the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looked upon in that day , with the same indulgence which is now *accorded to that of statesmen , and it was not to be supposed , that a desperate and broken-hearted outlaw , would become a teacher of morality and reform . If circumstances be weighed and balanced , he was no more guilty than many a citizen who passes for conscientious , because he confines his operations to that wide reach of dishonesty , which lies within the limits of the law . But we would say nothing in defence of any doubtful character , and allowing the Highlander to be as had as the most captious critics would make him , Scott has recommended him to our compassionate respect and not as our example . It is impossible ( as many moralists would have us ) to pronounce the same single sentence upon character , which we do upon persons ; if a criminal he brought to the bar , some traits of generosity are not allowed to excuse him , because there is no such retribution as that which Zoroaster saw , where a foot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving animal , while all the rest of the owner 's person was suffering in the flames . But with respect to character , there are some traits which we abhor , and others which we venerate and love , and so long as we have to do with mixed characters , we must regard them with mixed feelings . We shall not , therefore , when we pronounce Byron an unprincipled libertine , forget that he was a mighty genius and unfortunate in his early ' influences , nor shall we do the same with respect to fictitious character ; this wholesale condemnation is , no doubt , an easy process , hut beside being unjust , it throws the sympathy of the world into the wrong direction ; if the guilty he punished beyond reason , men inevitably take their part . The next work with which the author astonished the world , was the Tales of my Landlord , taken down by Peter Pattison , and given to the public by Jedediah Cleishhotham , after the decease of the said Peter . ' These introductions showed the unbounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust the invention of an ordinary mind ; and the novels themselves do not contain two characters better sustained , than the gentle and simple-hearted teaiiher , and his consequential superior and patron . The first of these tales is the Black Dwarf , the plan of which seems to have engaged the author , // without much consideration whether it was suited to a work intended to give pleasure . The original was David Richie , who , in person , and most points of character , is exactly described , but unlike the Dwarf , was humble and poor . He was bred a brush-maker in Edinburgh ; but the painful notoriety which his appearance gave him , and the insulting gaze to which he was exposed , induced him to leave the city . He found , after removing to various places , that he could not escape persecution without withdrawing from society altogether . He then built a small hut on a wild moorlaud , and afterwards held was little communion as possible with the world . But he could not get rid of his jealousy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance visiters of his retreat , fired him at once into insanity . It was evident , that such a story might admit of much powerful writing ; but pity and horror would be the feelings most naturally excited . Such a spectre would throw a gloom over the whole narrative , which no scenes of an opposite character could entirely do away . This is felt by every reader of the Black Dwarf ; and we can not but regret , that the author should have published it in its present unfinished form . It is so short , that the Dwarf casts his shadow entirely over it ; and in his character we find too little of the love of nature , which did much to soften the feelings of the original . The history is too interesting to be omitted . It seems that this attachment to the loveliness of nature sprang up in his heart like the diamond of the desert ; he found friends in the silent objects about him , which , without speech or language , breathed consolation to his desolate spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author was induced to crowd into one volume a story which was meant to occupy two , by the advice of a friend , who assured him that the idea of the Dwarf was of a kind too revolting for the purposes of a novel . This was true , but the difficulty was only increased by hastening to its conclusion , and the better course would have been , either to have carried out the original plan , or not have published it at all . But when a work has become distasteful to a writer , it is hard to go on and complete it ,  --  perhaps impossible for him to do it justice , unless he writes with all his heart ; so that if some other course had been preferable , he probably took the only one which was left him ; and we confess , that xve should have been sorry to lose the domestic scenes of the Elliots , though the work as a whole leaves a melancholy impression . // Fortunately for the Black Dwarf , it was leagued with the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter . The name is not descriptive of a single character or circumstance in the novel ; but it was borne by a person who is exactly described in the introduction to the work ,  --  a harmless enthusiast , whose mind had been unhinged by enthusiasm in early life ,  --  who , like David Deans , could not sit down contented with the carnal self-seeking times , ' which had followed the days of persecution and martyrdom . The only employment that suited his sorrowing spirit , was that of travelling through Scotland , with his chisel and hammer , to build , burnish , or repair , the sepuichres of the Cameronian righteous , whose memory had passed away , like the smoke of engagement from the field of blood . Scott himself saw and conversed with this person , whose name was Robert Patterson . He died in 1801 , leaving three sons , one of whom came over to Baltimore in 1776 . In this work the author is indebted to history for the main incidents with which the fiction is interwoven , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all for the character of Claverhouse , which is evidently a favorite with him , and whether in history or the fiction , is a most singular specimen of human nature . No one denies , that he was brave , and at times generous , with something lofty in his ambition , which contrasted strangely enough with the savage fidelity with which he discharged a trust , that would have been more properly delegated to an executioner than to a cavalier and man of honor . He was beautiful almost to effeminacy in his person , graceful and courtly in his manners , but one of the most ferocious leaders that ever thundered in the front of war . With him is contrasted another historical personage , Balfour of Burley , a ruffian who made use of one shred of religious enthusiasm to cover a thousand sins . Both these characters , with all their seeming inconsistency , are true to fact ; were it not so , critics would have long ago set them down as the most extravagant and unnatural the author 's pencil ever drew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestor ; but where the deeds are such as can neither b* denied nor defended , the advocate may as well be still . Most of the fanatics of the novel represent a class , and those who feel an interest in the annals of that day , are indebted to Scott for presenting them in a living and breathing form . Much // fault has been found with the author for holding up the Cameronians to abhorrence and derision ; but we know of no beings who ever deserved it more than a great proportion of their number . We honor their piety and self-devotion ; we respect the firmness with which they maintained their rights and principles ; but when enthusiasm rises to excess , it stands upon the verge of imposture , and it is wholly impossible to believe , that all , even of that which passed the furnace , was gold . We have no doubt that the author has given them credit for all they deserve , both of good and evil , though nothing which contains an admission of their infirmities can be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyrs . There is a certain point to which we can believe that mistaken zeal may go in all sincerity ; but when it begins to cry out for persecution and thirst for blood , we more than suspect , that without the enthusiast being conscious of it , his earthly passions are rising , and his religious feeling dying away . We do not believe that pure enthusiasm can lead a man to suppose himself released from the command thou shalt not kill ; ' yet the friendly historian of the Covenanters says , that Mr. Hamilton commanded at Drumclog , and some , contrary to his express command , ' gave quarter to their enemies , and let them go . This greatly grieved Mr. Hamilton , when he saw Babel 's hints spared , after that the Lord had delivered them into their hands , that they might dash them against the stones . ' The same wretch put to death a prisoner with his own hand in cold blood , and speaking of it some time afterwards said , I bless the Lord for it unto this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ants of the West Indies , which eat into the wooden frame of houses , and as fast as they consume it , fill up the cavity with stone . Beyond this the author is not indebted to history , t bough the spirit of history breathes through it all . Lauderdale indeed is described in the memoirs of those times , but the author might have invented a character for the purpose with less trouble . Serjeant Bothwell really existed  --  a descendant of the noble family of that name , whose habits had reduced him to the condition of a common soldier ; but the fiction has borrowetl from the original nothing hut his name . The tower of Tillietudlem is imaginary , but somewhat resembles the ruins of Craignethan castle . The greatest objection to this work is the close , when Lord Evandale , who has interested the reader so much throughout by his generosity , is so suddenly murdered ; // but estimable characters in real life are often removed quite as suddenly ; and no one says that it is not according to nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consistency of the narrative , but the characteristic conversations , and the rich display of portraits , representing the spirit and manners of the times . The simple and kind old lady , who had entertained his Most Sacred Majesty in her tower ,  --  the brave old Major , beginning to fight his battles over again under the touch of years ,  --  the admirable Cuddle and his mither ,  --  the miser Milawood and his house-keeper Mistress Wilson ,  --  the widow who sat in her red cloak by the road , and the little girl who guides Morton to the Black Linn , are so perfect in their kind , that the reader must be difficult to please , who can stop to criticise one or two faults in the story . Nothing has been more remarkable , and we dare say more gratifying to the author , than the obstinacy with which his readers insisted on being pleased , when critics made it as clear as the day that all was wrong . Faults were pointed out in vain ; still the readers kept on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beaten . We can imagine that some other cimclusion of the story would have been more agreeable to our feelings ; but after all , the effect of the work is the test ; this has been recorded , and now it can not be altered . The information now for the first time communicated by the author , with respect to the Heart of Mid Lothian , is full of interest . It is honorable to the public , as well as the writer , that a heroine in humble life , without education , beauty , or romantic feeling , and admired , if at all , for her energetic viitue alone , should have acquired more extensive popularity than any other of the wonderful images which have passed before the public eye . The original was named Helen Walker , and the facts were communicated in a letter to the author while he was yet unknown , by a Mrs. Goldie . She stated that she had met this person twenty-six years before in a place a few miles from Dumfries . She was then an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and expressive , living in a very bumble way , but looked upon by the neighbors as reserved and proud , because unwilling to speak of the circumstances which had brought dishonor on her name . in 1736 , the time described in the novel , her sister Isabella was condemned to die for the same crime with Eflie Deans . Helen was called upon to give evidence in court in the same manner with Jeanie // Deans , and , like her , stated to the counsel that she could not swear to a falsehood . The same day Helen procured a peti-. tion stating the circumstances , and the same night set out on foot for London . As in Madame Cottin 's Elizabeth , the difficulties she encountered are understated in the fiction ; for without introduction of any kind , she presented herself to the Duke of Argyle , and having by his means procured a pardon , returned with it on foot in time to save her sister . Isabella afterwards married her seducer . This is one of the cases in which truth puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply of Ledyard , when asked how soon he would proceed to Africu ; but here was energy and enterprise infinitely beyond it . Helen died in 1791 , and was buried in the church-yard of Irongray ; the daughter of Mrs. Goldie wished to place a monument on her grave , with an inscription by Sir Walter Scott ; he anticipated her wishes ; but brass and marble are too frail to bear the record of such deeds ; " he had raised a monument already , which will endure till the last eye that can read it is closed in death . The history of the Porteous mob might be tranferred to a history of Edinburgh , almost without alteration . The account of Robertson 's deliverance is given as it actually happened . A singular mystery still hangs over this transaction , which reminds one in some respects , of the destruction of the tea in Boston harbor . Scott thought himself at one time in a fair way of tracing out some of the actors , but the clue failed , and all again was dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transaction , that the whole population of the city was accessary , either by direct agency or encouragement ; so long as penalties hung over them none would dare to confess their own share in it , nor would the popular feeling allow any one to inform against another . When all the actors in the conspiracy were dead , their children , who had not been wrought upon by the same passions , must have viewed the matter in a different light , and it may readily be supposed , that they would not wish to make such an affair conspicuous in the memory of their fathers . In this way matters are often concealed from history , which are known to thousands . The Maniac was suggested by a harmless person , known by the name of Feckless Fanny ; but in order to avoid a resemblance to Sterne 's Maria , into which the original would have led him , he altered it so much , that no traces of the first conception // remain . The Toihooth , which makes such a distinguished figure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , the gateway and door of the ancient prison were presented to Sir Walter Scott . They now form the entrance of the kitchen-court at Abbotsford . There have been objections made to this work , and one is , as our papers say of the news , highly important if true . It is , that the moral effect is not good ; thevillain who caused all the misery of the story , and the unfortunate victim of his seduction , are transferred to a station in which they enjoy whatever wealth , rank and fashion can give . This is not the fact ; they are not represented as enjoying any thing , hut as leading a life made wretched by mutual reproach and self-upbraiding ; while their rank is hut the gilding of their woe , ' and the author makes it sufficiently evident that none can enjoy it without health at heart . But it would have heen easy to alter all this . By a single dash of his pen , the author could have brought them to justice ; hut he knew better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right aspect to vice , when he represents it as destroying the peace beyond the power of riches and honors to repair it ; and the right reward to virtue , when lie secures for it the universal applause of men . At some future time we may resume the subject , and if we do nothing more , may save some readers the trouble of picking out the information which Scott has given with respect to the materials which have suggested his scenes and characters . All such information only shows how little he needs to borrow , or rather how much he overpays ; for whenever he takes a scene from history , he repairs its faded colors , sets it in a proper light , and gives it a force and reality which it never had before . For this reason , among others , we are glad to see this edition . Such works should be in a cheap and accessible form ; families may read them with instruction as well as pleasure ; we lament the want of discrimination amounting to folly , which sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they came under the same description , and warns us against reading novels as if they were not as various in moral and intellectual character as all other productions of the mind . There are novels which have an extensive circulation among us , and are not a little admired by the very young , which aie vile as respects moral sentiment , and contemptible in their literary // pretensions ; those who degrade Scott to the level of such writers not only libel him , but they injure the cause which they profess to have at heart ; for some nov9ls will be read , and if they tell their children that such works are all alike , their children will be as likely to choose the worse as the better , believing that equal injustice is done to all by such sweeping condemnation . Such remarks as these may seem out of date in the nineteenth century ; but less than half a dozen years ago , a divine of respectable character and great influence lifted up his voice in warning against novels at large , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed hopeless to deprive diem . It is hard to say which were the most marvellous , his prohibitions or exemptions ; to us it seems better to discriminate ; this legal process castigat auditque seems better calculated for the region to which Virgil confines it , than for ours . It is like the French revolutionary practice of taking off the prisoner , and investigating the merits of his sentence at the next convenient time . One thing we would suggest to all concerned in publishing future editions of these novels . Nothing can be more unsatisfactory than the prints which they afford us . When we see a sketch of a scene , which has impressed itself on our minds like those of Shakspeare and Scott , we are sure to be disappointed ; for , however good in itself , it is not what we expected and wished to see . Let any one look at the prints of Nicol Jarvie with his red-hot couher , or Duncan of Knockdunder at the table , and he will feel that such attempts are provoking ; these poor efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginations . Any one who wishes to illustrate these novels , should give representations of the scenes described in them ; the sketch of the Grass-market in this edition , is worth all the rest of the prints put together ; it is not every one who can visit Rob Roy 's cave , and millions would be grateful to any artist who should furnish such views , to give compactness and unity in their minds to the author 's local descriptions.
