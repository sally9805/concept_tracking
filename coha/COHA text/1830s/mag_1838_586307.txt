txt PERSONS residing out of Pennsylvania can not properly appreciate the late election and its results , or the present position of parties within its limits , unless previously acquainted with the state of  |p0.  litical affairs existing in that State . The summing up of majorities , the boasts of success , and the character of the result , afford a very faint insight into the true state of affairs . PENNSYLVANIA , it is known , though inferior in numerical force to New York , has not been inferior to her in influence in the Union . She has been called the Keystone of the Federal Arch , and such has been her importance , that there have been constant and uninterrupted attempts to obtain possession of her by the minority , at one time by coaxing , at another by stratagem , and anon by force . She has always been Democratic and has never deserted from the ranks . Every possible method has been tried to seduce her yeomanry , but they have remained invariably true to the principles and practice of Democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to their independence and sincerity that she so universally bears the proud cognomen of THE KEYSTONE STATE . It is well known that Pennsylvania was among the first States that supported our late venerable President , and while the patriot Jackson wanted support , either for principles or measures , she was ready and never wanting . The veto of the bank charter in 1832 , 4 affecting as it did Pennsylvania more immediately than any other State , raised at once a party , powerful in money and talent , and unscrupulous in the use of its influence and means , which threatened to annihilate the Democracy of Pennsylvania , and to take the State by storm . All know the failure of the first attempt . The VETO was triumphantly sustained by the people . Andrew Jackson obtained the proud majority of twenty-five thousand over the united votes of Whigs and Anti-Masons , and the Democratic banner waved triumphantly at its home . Unfortunately there existed at this time , a divided state of feeling in the Democratic party in regard to the Executive , George Wolfe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the regularly nominated candidate of the party , and though no other Democratic candidate was started , be had a majority of only three thousand , and that too , within a month of the Presidential election , at which the majority was more than eight times that number . // Then it was that Joseph Ritner 's friends worked most industriously to sow the seeds of dissention in the Democratic ranks , and to lay the foundation of that temporary ( but to the Bank , vital ) success which they afterwards enjoyed . Ritner had been a Democrat , and as a member of the Legislature , was celebrated more for his unllinching opposition to State debt than any thing else . In 1828 , the in- tense excitement which the abduction of Morgan , by the Free* masons , occasioned in the western part of New York , spread to Pennsylvania , and extended itself so deeply among its citizens , that ( lesigning politicians found little difficulty in turning it into a new and powerful party engine . Ritner deserted to Anti-Masonry , and was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a POLITICAL evil . His efforts , at this time , assisted by a few kindred spirits were crowned with the success of creating in the State a new party called the Anti-Masonic . Many honest , but credulous Democrats were deceived and led into the ranks of this party , which they promptly abandoned when they saw the profligacy of its acts , and the destitution of principle which characterized its leaders . Ritner used it as an instrument of personal ambition . He run and was defeated , as a candidate for Governor in 1829 , and 183*2 . In 1835 , however , he again offered himself and met with better success . At this time the Democratic party had two candidates , Wolf and Muhlenberg , and this fatal division , causing many of the Democratic voters to take no part in the election , while Ritner received the vote of the whole Whig party in addition to that of his Anti-Masonic friends , he was elected Governor though at the same time in a minority of upwards of TWELVE ThOUSAND . From that moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be re-chartered at all hazards , and the Democracy of the State made to fall like Lucifer never to hope again . ' The same causes which produced the election of Ritner gave to the enemies of Democracy , the majority in the State Legislature , and among the majority , was one who had emigrated from New England , had all the Federal doctrines of the Hartford Convention , was a strong friend of abolition , and withal had sufficient address to acquire over-weening influence with Governor Ritner . It was under the auspices of this master spirit , that the brief period of equivocal party ascendency thus acquired , was employed to perpetrate the most stupendous and unscrupulous act of power , which Party had ever attempted in any of the States , and by which it was boldly designed to secure the perpetual ascendency of the faction that conceived it . This was no less a policy than the re-charter , by the State Legislature , of the vast political Bank , which the decisive voice of the nation , had already declared to be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic corporation was fa*tened upon the State , will ever be signalized , as tho most re // markable legislative fraud in the history of these States . The party in power , conscious of the deep distrust entertained by the people of their policy , and aware of their invincible repugnance to such a measure , so disguised , for the time being , their intentions that the act by which the Bank was re-chartered , actually omitted all allusion to such a measure in its title , and both in that , and in its preamble , was apparently designed to effect , simply , the ever popular objects of repealing the taxes , and promoting the internal improvement of the State . The subsequent clauses , however , showed that these desirable measures , were to be accomplished by rechartering the United States Bank , with thirty-five millions of capital , and giving it a duration of thirty years . Politicians who were willing , in this manner , to saddle a single State , already enjoying an ample share of banking capital , for their own purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States was not able to endure , were as little likely to stint it in the character , as in the extent of the privileges they conferred . Accordingly , the most salutary restraints of the United States law were removed , and the gigantic corporation was permitted to enter into competition with citizens in every branch of industry , in which the option of its directors might direct its overwhelming capital to be employed . In return for these unexampled privileges the Bank was to pay an immense bonus to the State ; and with this bonus the specific objects of the act were to be effected . In appropriating this sum by other clauses of the act , it was attempted to subsidize the whole State into an approval of its enormous provisions , by making liberal grants to local works in every section , which were thus to be created , as it were by magic , without burthening the people , while at the same time a perpetual party ascendency seemed to be secured over the State , by the network of internal improvements in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was artfully enlisted in favor of a system which seemed to promise benefits so vast , by means so simple . When the plan , however , became fully developed and understood , it met with the most strenuous opposition from the entire Democratic party . They possessed a decided majority in the Senate when the bill passed the House of Assembly , and the alarm with which they saw this majority rapidly diminish before the influence of the bill , and finally desert their principles , and assist the minority to pass it , had a salutary effect in knitting together their divisions , and inspiring a general distrust of all special and ultra legislation . The Governor had been strongly opposed to the banking system and increase of bank capital , and it was not without difficulty that he was politically persuaded , or perhaps frightened , into the approval of the bill . The same year chanced to be the time for districting the State , which was done with a view to subserve Whig interests and secure a majority in the next Legis // lature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct so unscrupulous had inspired , only partially succeeded . In the election of 1836 , the Democratic party triumphed throughout the State ;  --  the master spirit himself was left at home , though the Senate being divided into three classes , retained its former political complexion . The governing faction well knew that the Democratic party of the State consisted of a large majority of the voters , and they resorted to every means calculated to cripple the Democratic vote , and if possible , perpetuate their own power . As one of the means of effecting this object , a law was passed commonly called the Registry law , applying exclusively to Philadelphia , which had from twenty-five thousand to thirty-Thousand voters , one-half of whom at least , were Democrats , so that at all times , the Federal vote of that place could be powerfully contested and sometimes overcome . Every restriction , however , that could be thrown upon the right of suffrage , would , it was rightly believed , operate against the Democracy . The great mass of this party , composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would not and could not , it was supposed , afford the time to have themselves registered , and would thereby deprive their party of many votes , and thus give to Philadelphia such a heavy Federal preponderacy , as would be adequate to check the strengthening Democracy of the State . Other acts of a similar character and with a like purport were passed , and joy pervaded their ranks in supposing they had completely vanquished the " Hydra-headed Democracy . " The profligacy of the partisan leaders was unblushing and almost avowed . Their whole aim was political supremacy and selfish aggrandizement , all their plans were digested and matured with that view , and well pondered over , as to their effects , before carried into execution . These things being done and the Federal party , as they had reason to suppose , firmly and immoveably established in power , corruption and intrigue were rife among them , and a hard hand was meted out to their opponents . The recharter of the bank , as we have seen , was the first desperate act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the State was vetoed by Governor Ritner , because the Democratic canal commissioners were still in office ( the time of the election not having come round ) and they would have had the purchase of them . The locomotives , however , being indispensably requisite , a bill was passed changing the time of appointment of the commissioners : - new commissioners of the Whig stamp were chosen , the bill was again passed and met the approval of the man who had vetoed it but a few weeks previously , and this , merely because Democrats would have had the disbursement of a little money , which these patriots were determined should be used for political patronage . The whole route of the State improYements , under the direction // of the new canal commissioners , was filled with politicians , the heaviest prices paid for work , and the internal improvements funds were squandered in the basest political prostitution . Open war was waged by the Executive against the national Administration , illustrating the fable of " the gnat and the ox . " Ritner denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot his popguns at them , and the lo P*EAN5 of rejoicing among the faithful were frequent and loud . Nothing was too gross to attempt , and if possible , to execute . Inconsistencies were regarded as nothing ; at one session , bills increasing the capital of the Girard and Moya. mensing Banks were vetoed , while similar enactments as to other banks in Philadelphia were permitted to be made ; and this , merely because the two first named had committed thea unpardonable sin of becoming depositories of the public money , after its re moval by General Jackson from the Bank of the United States . A bill for internal improvements was vetoed in the spring of 1837 , because it contained appropriations to some companies to which Ritner and his men were hostile , though they had all approved the bill chartering the bank , which contained more numerous and more heterogeneous appropriations . The suspension of specie payments by the banks of the State took place within sixty days after this veto , and then arose huzzas and shouts for the foresight of Ritner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reasons , yet countenanced by these honest lovers of truth , took to himself the credit of so doing , on account of the troubled times . Low as the State credit had been brought by this horde , still it had not sunk so low , but that all the money for the purposes of bill , could have been obtained on demand . Ritner , indeed , never dreamed of any such difficulty , and it was strongly doubted by those well acquainted with the character of his intelligence , whether he knew any thing at all about the financial state of the country , and whether all his knowledge on the subject did not come through his confidential advisers . The banks by their suspension , had incurred liability to forfeiture of their charters . The Legislature ( which had just adjourned ) was Democratic and could have exacted the penalty . This Ritner well knew , and also the fact that public opinion , from circumstances connected with some of them , would have amply justified the enforcement of the penalty . He accordingly issued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Administration , and whitewashing the illegalities of the State banks , he declared his intention NOT to convoke the Legislature . The next sesssion ( 1837- ' 8 ) the Federalists still had the Senate , while the Democrats had a majority in the other house ; the Independent Treasury system was dreaded by the former , as initiatory to an exposure of the banks , and some few Democrats were worked upon to oppose the measure . Accordingly a resolution was adopted , urging Congress to postpone // all consideration of the question until the next session , and at the same time expressing " fall confidence in Martin Van Buren , and in the intelligence of our Democratic Senators and Representatives in Congress . " The resolution went on to say , " and our Senators are hereby instructed and our members requested to vote for such a mode of receiving , keeping , and disbursing the public monies , as will separate , as far as practicable , the banks from the Government . " This resolution was adopted and APPROVED BY JosEPH RiTNER ; he signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AcTUALLY RECOMMENDED THE INDEPENDENT TREAsURv ,  --  though , as in the former case , it is but candid to state , that it is doubtful whether he understood what he was signing . In the same year he approved a bill for Internal Improvements similar to the one he had vetoed , because it contained an appropriation for a sERPENTINE rail-road in Adams county calculated to benefit Thaddeus Stevens , and of course , advance Ritner 's own political prospects . A law was also passed permitting members of the Legislature to hold offices , ( from which they had heretofore been properly excluded ) and immediately upon the adjournment , Thaddeus Stevens of Adams , and John Dickey of Beaver , were appointed canal commissioners . The latter had been elected to the State Senate as a Democrat , but had gone for the bank , and in all things joined the Whig party , he here met his reward , and the State patronage was placed in charge of these men to be used to secure Ritner 's re-election . On the fourth of March , 183S , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PORTER as the Democratic candidate for Governor , in opposition to Joseph Ritner , who was announced as a candidate for re-election . Mr. Porter was a member of the State Senate , and as the Legislature did not adjourn for more than a month afterwards , every trap was set to catch him , but the unflinching Democracy of Mr. Porter foiled all their efforts ; they were " kicking against the pricks , " and his opponents saw that ordinary warfare was not likely to bring them victory . A system of personal attack was , therefore , organized against Mr. Porter , of the most profligate and disgraceful description . The Federal party have heretofore found their account in a similar mode of warfare . Democracy has not forgiven the infamous libels , which a thousand venal presses once made current against Jefferson . The denunciations of Jackson have hardly yet died upon the public ear , and it can not be forgotten that , every distinguished individual whom the People have delighted to honor , have as regularly been assailed with the blackest calumny and abuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been remarkable for the zeal and ardor with which each party has engaged in them , 50 that excesses committed during the canvass , whether of pen or tongue , must be virulent indeed to excite unusual remark . No parallel , however , can be found to the extent and malignity of this species // of persecution , which was directed against Mr. Porter . Detraction of the worst kind was employed to do its office . In early life he had been implicated in a partnership , which , through no fault of his , had been u**fortunate in business , and though he had settled with his *creditors in a manner that left the most honorable conviction of his integrity on their minds , he was paraded in the journals which assume to themselves all the decency , as a fraudulent bankrupt ; and executive tools were not wanting , who testified on oath to stories of embezzlement so utterly without foundation , that the principal deponent was proved to have been only five years old when the facts he had sworn to were alleged to have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , reiterated by the official cabal , and echoed by all their presses till the very day of election . Nor was this all ; his domestic character was assailed by charges of almost every species of licentiousness and vice , and it is much to be regretted that the constant assertion of these things , tended to reduce the old fashioned majority of twenty-five thousand , which belonged to the State , though the falsehood of the charges was so clearly and conclusively established as to defeat the objects of their invention , and to make many honest Whigs come forward to vouch for Mr. Porter 's unblemished character , who were warmly opposed to his politics and would not vote for him . Upwards of ten thousand non-resident voters were introduced , under the executive patronage into the State , and judiciously distributed on the various public works , so as to swell Ritner 's majority in the hour of need , while the arrangement of the districts had been managed in such a manner , that it was calculated the Demo* cratic party began the contest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had to be neutahized before their efforts could tell in favor of their own candidates . This was so well understood , that , when the election had commenced , and was apparently going for Porter , a letter , announced as from a high authority in the State , was published in the National Intelligencer , for effect upon the South , which declared that unless the Democratic candidate should be elected by fifteen thousand majority , the State could not be considered safe for Van Buren in the next Presidential election . Besides all this , falsehood and deception of every kind were at work . A new Constitution was to be submitted to the people , and in the eastern part of the State where the old Constitution was popular , Ritner was asserted to be its friend , while in other portions , where it was unpopular , he was as determinedly claimed as the friend of the amended Constitution . It is characteristic and illustrative of the popular intelligence , that , ( leception on part of their rulers , never fails to recoil upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect to disbelieve , or underate the sagacity of the people , can be successful only while undetected , and the popular distrust , when deeply rooted , can never // be overcome . The history of our parties and public men abound in pregnant illustrations of this great truth , which can not be to fully impressed upon all public men . Mr. Ritner 's ignorance of this great principle led him to commit a signal act of weakness and inconsistency for the purpose of throwing dust in the People 's eyes , and which not only recoiled injuriously upon its author , but as a political move , was almost too ludicrous for effect . The banks of New York resumed payment early in the spring of 1838 ; those of Pennsylvania prepared , and announced their intention to resume , on the first of August 1838 , and accordingly , just before that day , Ritner made haste to issue a proclamation , ordering them to resume on or before the thirteenth of August or he would visit upon them the penalties of the law . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended on the eleventh of May , 1837 , and the Governor exhibited the farce of finding out the fact FIFTEEN MONTHS afterwards , denouncing its illegality and orderino ' a resumption , and all this only after they had announced their readiness and intention so to do . The cause of the movement was not apparent until by the entire Whig press Mr. Ritner was proclaimed the friend of specie payments and it was heralded throughout the State that he had made the banks resume , which otherwise they would not have done , and ( to their shame be it spoken * the officers of the banks encouraged and promoted belief of what they knew was not true , with a view to aid his reelection ; more especially as his proclamation was filled with the usual quantum of abuse of the National Administration and praise of his own . The people , however , saw through the wretched trick , and the only effect it produced , was that of attaching to his administration , the discredit of such an arrant piece of political charlatanry . The election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , GENERAL DAVID R. PORTER has been elected Governor by the proud majority of above nine thousand votes . If to these be added at least ten thousand non-residents , brought into the State for the purpose of voting for Ritner , it will swell the FAIR majority to about twenty thousand . Proud may the Democrats of Pennsylvania be of such a triumph ! The party in power left no stone unturned , every engine was employed and every faculty exerted to secure its continuance in power , and they have sustained an inglorious and overwhelming defeat and most righteously . To no one political object have they been steadfast excepting ABOLITION ; and in that they have been . most consistent . The Ritner attorney general of the State is a strong abolitionist and so are almost all , down to the lowest State officers . Ritner in his first message , advocated the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia forthwith , and recommended discussion of the question in the State . Pennsylvania , it was probably intended , should be the head quarters of abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably of the Union , was to be identified with the abolition party . Whether recent events will occasion abandonment of this determination remains to be seen . Joseph Ritner was known ( or supposed to be known ) as the enemy of State debt , and yet he increased it upwards of THREE MILLIONs . He had avowed himself hostile to charters and yet there were more acts of incorporation passed during his Governorship than during all the previous years since Pennsylvania had been a State . He professed himself hostile to the banks , and yet he favored their views and acted pretty much as their agent and instruutent . He avowed himself an Anti-Mason and equally opposed to Whigs and Democrats , but soon gave himself to the embrace of the Whigs and did all the things he had most opposed in days of yore. * Such is the state of things with which the Democratic party had to contend , and such is the character of the victory they have achieved . The Governor elect is a gentleman of unbending and invariable devotion to republican measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is respected at home and wherever known , as one amiable and upright in all his relations . He has filled various offices without complaint even from his direst foes , and can be relied upon as one who will exert all proper means to keep Pennsylvania and her institutions free from improper influence , sustain her bright renown , and let no part of her importance be impaired by measures of doubtful policy or anti-republican tendency . The election was a memorable one and its effects will be sensibly felt throughout the Union . Pennsylvania was the battle ground of the Union . Had the opponents of Democracy succeeded there , it would have inspirited them to hope of success at the national campaign ; if defeated there , then they knew their chance would be utterly destroyed , and the warfare was waged with a reckless and exterminating spirit which showed their desperate situation . Fiercely was the battle fought , and gallantly was it won . A mutiny in the ranks had enabled the enemy to obtain possession of the citadel and the contest was , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other , determined and conscious of the justice of its cause . To such a victory too much praise can not be awarded , and to victors in such a struggle , should be given the plaudits and congratulations of the whole Republican party of the United States . The foe is conquered , and though it may again raise its arm to strike , it will again be conquered . The State has been delivered from the iron-handed rule of a despotic minority . Pennsylvania is erect , proudly and loftily as ever , proclaiming , as she did in 1776 , that her coat of arms is , ( and deservedly ) " VIRTUE LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE . " // THOUGH neither circumstances nor custom reuder it necessary for a periodical work to address its readers on the recurrence of the cycle at which its numbers become a volume , yet as we lay each successive book before our readers , the consciousness that we have gained another stepping stone in a new career , watched with some interest by our friends , renders the occasion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or information , as the character of our work affords no opportunity of saying in its regular pages . We have received repeated suggestions from various parts of the Union , that such a modification of our plan as would admit notices of current literature , and new books , would he an improvement ; and to these we reply , that we are sensible of the additional interest such a feature would give our journal , while it would he a con. genial duty to ourselves , yet we have been induced to withhold it for sufficient ren. sons . We feel that while our pages are too limited now-liberal , as we are in this respect , beyond the precedent of all our monthly contemporaries-even for the many important public questions which press upon our attention , and which treated as they ought to be , with argument and illustration addressed to the reasoseina faceelties of the reader , will ever possess a far higher interest ; it would be at the best but literary trifling to occupy a space , that can be so much better taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new works with the care , candor , and thorough acquaintance with their contents , which we could alone admit as requisites for the task  --  and which would be indispensable to rescue such a department of a prominent periodical from the contemnt or insignificance which so justly attach , generally speaking , to this branch of the press-would require a time and preparation that might be more advanta&amp;ously devoted to subjects of endurin* interest . Objections have been made to the style of the likenesses which accompany our Gallery of Political Portraits . These arise from a mistaken conception of what should be the character of popular etchin6s of this description . They are not presented as , nor intended to he finished engravings , or accurate portraits of the respective originals , hut outlines , spirited in conception and faithful in execution , of the individual , and such as might . , ive to our distant readers a correct impression of the actual , living character , as exhibited in ordinary life , of those whose public history and acts are familiar to the whole land , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle with whom they may he hrou*ht in contact .

They will be continued , from time to time , as occasion may serve . In our arrangements for the coming year , we do not contemplate any material deviation from a plan that has so fully received the sanction of the public ; that it would are ue a want of appreciation on our parts of an encouragement as generous as it has been kind , if we were not to meet it by inereased exertions to render the Democratic Review more worthy of its name , and of the great party whose principles it advocates .
