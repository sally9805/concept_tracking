txt Man is known to exist in no part of the world , without certain rules for the rcgulatioi. of Jiis intercoiir.se with those around him . It is a first necessity of his weakness , that laws , founded on the immutahle principles of natural justice , should be framed , in order to protect the feeble against the violence of the strong ; the honest from the schemes of the dishonest ; the temperate and industrious , from the waste and indolence of the dissolute and idle . These laws , though varying with circumstances , posi ? f jJS a common character , being fornaed on that consciousness of right , which God has bestowed in order that men may judge between good and evil . Governments have many names , which name , in all cases , are dependent on someone of the leading features of the institutions . It is usual , however , to divide governments into despotisms , limited monarchies , and republicks ; but these terms are too vague to answer the objects of definitions , since many aristocracies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been styled republicks. /z/ A despotism is a government of absolute power , in which the entire authority is the possession of the prince . The term " despot , " as appHed to a sovereign , however , is not properly one of reproach . It merely signifies a ruler who is irresponsible for his acts , and who governs without any legal restraint on his will . The word " tyrant " had originally the same meaning , though , in a measure , both have become so far corrupted as to convey an idea of abuses . A limited monarchy is a government in which the will of the sovereign is restrained by certain provisions of the state , that can not lawfully be violated . In its true signification , the word monarch means any prince at the head of a state . Monarchs are known by different titles ; such as emperors , kings , princes , grand dukes , dukes , &c.; &c.; ; but it is not now common to apply the term to any below the rank of kings . The title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning the same thing as that of monarch . A republick is a government in which the pervading acknowledged principle is the right of the community as opposed to the right of a sovereign . In other words , the term implies the sovereignty of the people , in lieu of that of a monarch . Thus nations which have possessed kings , dukes , and princes at their heads , have been termed republicks , because they have reserved the right to elect the monarchs ; as was formerly the case in Poland , Venice , Genoa , and in many other of the Italian states , in particular . Even Napoleon continued to style France a republick , after he had assumed the imperial diadem , because his elevation to the throne was sanctioned by the votes of the French nation . The term , in his case , however , was evidently misapplied , for the crown was made hereditary in his family , while the polity of a repub- ON GOVERNMENT . ll lick supposes a new election on the death of the last ruler , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people elected a dynasty , rather than a prince . Ill a republick the chief of the state is always elective . Perhaps this fact is the most accurate technical distinction between a monarchy and this form of government , though the pervading principle of the first is the right of the sovereign , and of the last the right of the community . The term republick , ( *rtspublica ) means the public things , or the common weal . Hence the term commonwealth , the word wealth , in its political sense , meaning prosperity in general , and not riches in particular . If these theoretical distinctions were rigidly respected , it would be easy to infer the real character of a government from its name ; but nothing can be less alike than governments ordinarily are , in their action , and in their professions . Thus despotism can scarcely be said to exist in truth , in any part of Christendom ; monarchs being compelled to govern according to established laws , which laws are formed on principles reasonably just , wliile they are resrrained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been created by the advanced intelligence of the age . Some kings are monarchs only in nane , the power having essentially passed into the hands of a few of their nominal subjects ; and , on the other hand , some princes , who , by the constitutional principles of the system , are deemed to be but a part of the state , effectually control it , by means of bribes , rewards , and political combinations , submitting to little more restraint than the nominal despots . Just at this time , Prussia is an instance of the first of these truths , England of the second , and Franco of the last . Prussia , though a despotism in theory , is governed /z/ as niildly , and , apart from political justice , as equitably and legally , as any other country . The will of the sovereign is never made to interfere , arbitrarily , with the administration of law , and the law itself proceeds from the principles that properly influence all legislation , though it can only receive its authority from the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of opinion , as well as of its power to check abuses . It was only the great grandfather of the present sovereign who caused tali men to marry tall women at his command , in order to gratify a silly desire to possess a regiment of the tallest troops in the world . The influence of opinion on governments has been greatly aided by the wars and revolutions of the last , and of the present century , in which privileges have been diminished , and the rights , as well as , what is perhaps of more importance , the knowledge of their rights among the people , have been greatly augmented . England , which is called a monarchy , is in fact a complicated but efficient aristocracy . Scarcely one of the powers that is attributed to the king by the constitution , and which were in truth exercised by his predecessors , is possessed by the present monarch in fact . By the constitution , the king of England is supposed to form a balance between the nobles and the people , whereas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance between parties , and this only in cases of a nearly equal force between contending factions . The extent of the authority of the king of England , at the present day , amounts to little more than the influence which he is permitted to use in minor cases , the aristocracy having devised expedients to control him on all occasions that are deemed of moment . As the mode in which this change has been eftected , illustrates the manner in which governmerits /q/ are made to take one character , while they profess to belono ; to another , a brief exposition will aid the reader in understanding- the subject . The king of England can do no wrong , but the ministers are responsible to parliament . As the country has no written constitution , and laws enacted by the king , lords and commons , have the force of constitutional provisions , a system has been established , by taking advantage of the necessities of different sovereigns , by which no executive act is legal , that is not sanctioned by at least one responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which his parliament is seriously opposed , since no minister will incur the risk of its displeasure . It is true that the nominal assent of the king is necessary to the enactment of a law , but the ministers being responsible for the consequences if it is withheld , and the parliament aloiie being the judge of these consequences , as well as of the criminals , while it has an active jealousy of its own power , no instance of the exercise of this authority has occurred for more than a century . The ri.glit lo witiijjold supy ) Iies has been the most efficient fificni of the parhament , in subduing the authority of the crown . By the theory of the IJrKish constitution , the king can declare war . Formerly this prerogative was exercised by different warlike sovereigns for personal motives . Now , the right exists only in name , for no minister would consent to give the declaration the legal forms , with the certainty of being impeached , and ) unished , unless acting in accordance with the wishes of parliament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ministers are permitted to perform most minor acts of authority unquestioned , so long as they have a party in the legislature to su  --  - /z/ tain them . This party , however , is necessary to their remaining in the ministry , and it follows that the majority of parliament controls the very appointment of ministers , the only important political function that the king- can now , even in theory , exercise without the intervention of a responsible minister . Were he , however , to appoint a minister in opposition to the wishes of parliament , that body would refuse the required laws . The first requisite , therefore , on the formation of a new ministry , is to enquire who can * ' meet parliament , " as it is termed ; or , in other words , what ministers will be agreeable to a majority of the legislature . ' Jhus , while the king of England savs who slial ! br his ministers , the parliament says who they shall not be ; and , in this instance , supported as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negatjve power is found to be stronger than the affirmative . Jn reabty , the ministers of Great-Britain are appointed b the parbament of the country , and not by the king , and this is virtually neutralizing , if not directly anniliilating , all the available authority of the latter . In theory , the government of France and that of Great-Britain have the same general character . In practice , however , owing to the greater political advancement of the last of these two countries , France , to-day , is not far from the point where England stood a century since . Then the king of England ruled through his parliament , whereas now the parliament rules through the king . On the other hand , with much of the machinery of a free state , the king of the French governs himself A dread of the people 's getting the ascendancy , causes the aristocracy to lend itself to the power of the crown , which not only dictates the law , but , in many cases , proves to be stronger than the law itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected in Prussia and Austria , both despotisms in theory , than in France , which has the profession of a Hmited monarchy . This difference is owing- to the security of the two first governments , and to the insecurity of the last . These facts show the necessity of distinguishing between names and things in governments , as well as in otlier matters . The institutions of no country are rigidly respected in practice , owing to the cupidity and passions of men ; and vigilance in the protection of principles is even more necessary in a democracy than in a monarchy , as their violation is more certain to aifect the interests of the people under such a form of government than under any other . A violation of the principles of a democracy is at the loss of the people , while , in a monarchy , it is usually their gain . ? mi /z/ Republics have been as liable to frauds , and to departures from their professions , as any other polities , though no government can properly be termed a republick at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler is acknowledged . In all republicks there must be more or less of direct representation , however much its influence is lessened by the duration and by the magnitude of the trusts . Poland was formerly termed a republick , because the kingly office was elective , and on account of the power of the Diet . At that time any member of this body could defeat a law by exclaiming in Latin , VetOj ( I forbid it , ) from which usage the word veto has been /z/ adopted as a substantive , in most of the languages of Christendom , to express the same power in the ditferent executive rulers ; which it is now common to term the " veto-power . " The exercise of this right v/as found so inconvenient in practice , that , at length , in cases of gravity , the nobles of the Diet would draw their swords , and menace the dissenting member with death , unless he withdrew his " veto . " As a negative authority often has the efficiency of that which is affirmative , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of a majority was less consulted than in this . The republick of Venice was an hereditary aristocracy , as , in a great measure , was that of ancient Rome . The term , in its true signification , perhaps , infers a free government , for it means a representation of the general interests of the state , but , as in practice , this representation became confined purely to the interests of the state , and the state itself was under the control of a few who did not fail to turn their authority to their private advantage , the system has oftener resulted in abuses than even that of monarchies . The profession of a free government , in which the facts do not frankly concur , usually tends to gross wrongs , in order to conceal and protect the frauds . In Venice , such was the jealousy and tyranny of the state , that a secret council existed , with an authority that was almost despotick , while it was inquisitorial , and which was removed from the usual responsibility of opinion , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary liabilities of common censure . This council consisted of three nobles , who held their office for a limited period , and were appointed by drawing lots , each person concealing the fact of the lot 's having fallen on himself , until he met his associates at an appointed place . It is an /q/ extraordinary fact , iliai the same expedient was devised to conceal the murderers , in the well knowji case orM ) r:ran , who fell a victim to the exajrireraiiou and weakness of some of tiie members of the Masonic Fraternity . By examining the ilifferent republicks of ancient and modern times , it would be found that most of tiiem had little more tha ) i the profession of liberty , though all substituted in thorn the right of the community for that of a monarch , as a primary principle . This featin-e , then , must be caken as the distinction between this form of government and that of kingdoms , or of the sovereignties in which one rules , or is supposed to rule . Republicks may be aristocratical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , as to render it matter of doubt to which class they properly belong ; for the political cfmibinations of communities , in a practical sense , are so numerous as almost to defeat accurate general definitions . mi ON THE REPUBI.ICK OF THE i ; jITEI /z/ The government of the United States , differs from all others that have preceded it , though some imitations have been attempted in the southern parts of this continent . Its novelty , no less tlian its complicated nature , arising from its double system , has given birth to many errors in relation to its principles and its action , even among its own citizens , as well as among strangers , /z/ The polity of the United States is that of a confederated republick , but the power of the federal goverrunent acting in most instances on liie body of the coranjunity , witlioul the intervention of the several states , 11 has been better styled a Union . This word , which is original as apphed to a political system , was first given to this form of confederation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations of the parties , than tliose of all previous examples . It exists in the constitiitiort , however , only as it is used in setting forth the motives for substituting that instrument for the old articles of confederation : the constitution bemgsilent astotlie particula.r polity of the country , except as it recognizes the general teiTO. of a republick . The word constitution , of itself , properly impHes a more identified form of government , than that which IS usually understood to exist under a confederation ; the first inferring a social compact , fimdamentai and predominant , the last a league between independent . sovereignties . These distinctions have a certain weight , though they are rather arbitrary than logical , since men may create any degree of allegiance , or of liability they may deem expedient , under any form , or modes of government . To deny this is to deny to bodies of human beings the right of self-government , a gift of nature . Though possessing a common end , governments are , in reality , subject to no laws but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States was formed by the several states of the Union , as they existed at the period when the constitution was adopted , and one of its leading principles is , that all power which is not granted to the federal authority , remain in the states themselves , or what is virtually the same thing , in the people of the states . This principle follows as a /q/ necessary consequence from the nature of the grants to the federal overnment , but it lias been clearly expressed in a clause of the instrument , that was introduced by way of amendment , in 1801 . This feature distinguishes this federal government from all the federal governments that have gone before it , as it was the general and ancient rule that liberty existed as a concession from authority ; whereas , here , we find 4iuthority existing as a concession from the ruled . Something like the same principle exists in the governments of the several states , and it once existed in the ancient democracies , though , in no other known system perhaps , as clearly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general maxim that governments should have all power , however much they may restrain themselves in its exercise . In the conflict of parties , the question by whom the federal government was formed , has been agitated with more seriousness than the point at issue merited , since , the fact admitted that the power which framed it did not exceed its authority , it is much more essential to know what was done , than to ascertain who did it . The notion that the people of the United States , in the popular signification of the word , framed the government , is contrary to fact , and leads to a wrong interpretation of many of the disrinctive features of the system . The constitution of the United States was formed by a convention composed of delegates elected by the different states , in modes prescribed by their several laws and usages . These delegates voted by states , and not as individuals , and the instrument was referred back to conventions in the respective states fur approval , or ratification . It is a governing principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power that possesses the autiiority in the last report Thus , treaties between independent sovereign- /z/ ties , are never valid until ratified by the high treatymaking powers of tie respective countries . As the several states of this Union first acted through delegates of their own appointing , and then ratified their acts , in conventions also chosen by constituencies of their own selection , it is not easy to establish any thing more plainly than the fact , that the constitution of the United States was framed by the states then in existence , as communities , and not by the body of the people of the Union , or by the body of the people of the states , as has been sometimes contended . In favor of the latter opinion , it is maintained that the several states were an identified nation previously to the formation of the government , and the preamble of the constitution itself , has been quoted to prove that the compact was formed by the people as distinct from the states . This preamble commences by saying that " We the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then set forth , have framed the instrument that follows ; but in respecting a form of phraseology , it , of necessity , neither establishes a fact , nor sets up a principle , and when we come to examine the collateral circumstances , we are irresistably led to regard it merely as a naked and vague profession . That the several states were virtually parts of one entire nation previously to the formation of any separate general government , proves nothing in the premises , as the very circumstance that a polity distinct from that of Great Britain was established by our ancestors , who were members of the great community that was then united in one entire nation , suflSciently shows that these parts can separate , and act independently of each other . Such a circumstance might be , and probably it was , a strong motive for forming a more identified government , but it can not properly be quoted as authority for , or against any of its provisvsions. /q/ The latter are a mere question of fact , and as such their construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The term " people , " like most other substantives , has its general and its specific significations . In its general signification , the people of a country , means the population of a country ; as the population of a country includes the women and children , notliing can be clearer than that the " people , " in this signification , did not form the American constitution . The specific significations of this word are numerous , as rich , poor , wise , silly , good and bad people . In a political sense , the people means those who are vested with political rights , and , in this particular instance , the people vested with political rights , were the constituencies of the several states , under their various laws , modifications and constitutions , which is but another name for the governments of the states themselves . " We the jpeop/c , " as used in the preamble of the constitution , means merely , " We the constifucncies of the several states . " It follows , that the constitution of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the entire country , as contended ; the term used in the preamble being used in contra-distinction to the old divine right of sovereisns , and as a mode of expressing the general republican character of the government . The states , by a prescribed majority , can also amend the constitution , altering any of its provisions , with the exception of that which guaranties the equal representation of the states in the senate . It might be shown , that states possessing a minority of all the people of the Union can alter the constitution , a fact , in itself , which proves that the government of the United States , though a republick , is not necessarily a popular government , in the broadest /z/ meaning of the word . The constitution leaves the real character of the institutions of the country , with the exception that it prohibits monarchies , to be settled by the several states themselves . On the other hand , too much importance is attached to what is called the reserved sovereignties of the several states . A community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted with all the great powers of sovereignty , such as the control of foreign relations , the authority to make war and peace , to regulate commerce , to coin money , keep fleets and armies , vith all the other powers that have been ceded by the states to the federal government . But , admitting that the rights reserved are sovereign in their ordinary nature , they are scarcely so in the conditions under which they are enjoyed , since , by an amendment of the constitution , a state may be deprived of most of them , without its own consent . A community so situated can scarcely be deemed sovereign , or even independent . The habit of drawing particular inferences from general theories , in matters as purely practical as those of government , is at all times dangerous , and the safest mode of construing the constitution of the United States , is by looking only at the instrument itself , without adverting to other systems , except as they may serve to give the proper signification of the terms of that instrument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was framed . Many popular errors exist on the subject of the influence of the federal constitution on the rights and liberties of the citizen . The rights and liberties of the citizen , in a great degree , depend on the political institutions of the several states , and not on those of the Union . Many of these errors have arisen from mistaking the meaning of the language of the constitution . /q/ Tims , when the constitution says tJiat no laws shall be passed abridging the rights of the citizen m any particular thing , it refers to the power which , under that particular constitution , has the authority to pass a Jaw at all . This power , under the government of the United States , is Congress , and no other . An example will better show the distinction . In art . 6th of the amendments to the constitution , we find the following clause : " In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right of a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury , ' ' ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this provision of the constitution , that , under the laws of the several states , the citizen shall be entitled to a public trial by jury , but that these privileges shall be assured to those who are accused of crimes against the laws of the United States . It is true , that similar privileges , as they are deemed essential to the liberties of their citizens , are assured to them by the constitutions of the several states , but this has been done by voluntary acts of their own , every state having full power , so far as the constitution of the United States has any control over it , to cause its accused to be tried in secret , or without the intervention of juries , as the people of that particular state may see fit . There is nothing in the constitution of the United vStates , to prevent all the states , or any particular state , from possessing an established religion , from putting the press under the control of censors , from laying restrictions and penalties on the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil restraints on the citizen , that are imposed under any other form of govjprnment . The guarantees for the liberties of the citizen , given by the constitution of the United States , are very limited , except as against the action of the government /z/ of the Union alone . Congress may not pass any law establishing a religion , or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press , but the provisions of the constitution relating to these subjects , have no reference to the rights of the states . This distinction is very essential to a correct understanding of the institutions of the country , as many are misled on the subject . Some of the states , for example , are rigid in enforcing respect for the sabbath , and a popujar notion has prevailed that their laws are unconstitutional , since the federal compact guaranties liberty of conscience . This guarantee , like most of the others of the same nature , is only against the acts of Congress , and not against the acts of the states themselves . A state may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sabbath , provided it do not infringe on the provisions of its own constitution , or invade a right conceded to the United States . It can not stop the mail for instance , or the passage of troops in the service of the federal government , but it may stop all who are not thus constitutionally protected by the superior power of the Union . This reading of the constitution is in conformity ' with all the rules of construction , but that it is right , can be shown from the language of the instrument itself . In article 1st , section 9th , clause 3d , v/e find this provision  --  " No bill of attainder , ov ex post facto law , shall be passed . " In article 1st , section 10th , clause 1st , which section is composed entirely of restraints on the power of the states , we find this provision  --  " ' No state shall pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , &c.; &c."; Had the provision of clause 3d , sect. 9th , been intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sect. 10th , would clearly have been unnecessary . The latter provision therefore , is one of the few instances , in which the power /q/ of the states themselves , is positively restrained by the constitution of the United States . Although the several states have conceded to the United States most of the higher attributes of sovereignty , they have reserved to themselves nearly all of the functions that render governments free , or otherwise . In declaring war , regulating commerce , keeping armies and navies , coining money , which arc all high acts of sovereignty , despotisms and democracies are alike ; all forms of governments equally controlling these interests , and usually in the same manner . The characters of institutions depend on the repositories of power , in the last resort . In despotisms the monarch is this repository ; in aristocracies , the few ; in democracies , the many . By the constitution of the United States , its government is composed of different representations , which are chosen , more or less directly , by the constituencies of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of these constituencies , their narrowness , or width , must depend on the fundamental laws of the states , themselves . It follows that the federal government has no fixed character , so far as the nature of its constituency is concerned , but one that may constantly vary , and which has materially varied since the commencement of the government , though , as yet , its changes have always been in the direction of popular rights . The only distinctive restriction imposed by the constitution of the United States on the character of the state governments , is that contained in article 4th , section 4th , clause 1st , which guaranties to each state a republican form of government . No monarchy , therefore , can exist in this country , as existed formerly , and now exists , in the confederation of Germany . But a republican fonn of government is not /z/ // necessarily a free government . Aristocracies are oftenerrepublicks than any thing else , and they have been among the most oppressive governments the has ever known . No state can grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oftener the consequence than the cause of narrow governments . Neither Venice , Poland , Genoa , Berne , ( a canton of Switzerland , ) nor most of the other narrow aristocracies of Europe , had any titular nobles , though some of these countries were afflicted by governments of great oppression . Any state of this Union , by altering its own constitution , may place the power of its own government , and , by consequence , its representation in the government of the United States , in any dozen families , making it perpetual and hereditary . The only guarantee against such an act is to be found in the discretion of the people of the several states , none of whom would probably part with power for such a purpose , and the check which the other states might hold over any one of their body , by amending the constitution . As this instrument now exists , however , there can be no reasonable doubts of the power of any one , or of all the states , so to alter their polities . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , which may be said to have both a theoretical character , and one in fact . In theory , this character is vague , and , with the immaterial exception of the exclusion of a monarchy and the maintenance of the representative form , one altogether dependent on the policy of the states , by which it may be made a representative aristocracy , a representative democracy , or a union of the two . The government , in fact , is a near approach to that of a representative democracy , thougli it is not without a slight infusion from a few mild aristocracies . So long as slavery /q/ exists in the country , or , it were better to say , so long as the African race exists , some portion of this aristocratic infusion will ijrobably remain . Stress is laid on the forejjoino ' distinctions , because the government of the Union is a compact between separate communities , and popular misconceptions on the nature of the institutions , in a nation so much controlled by popular opinion , not only lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of every citizen to acquire just notions of the terms of the bargain before he pretends to a right to enforce them . /z/ Distinctive American principles as properly refer to the institutions of the states as to those of the Union . A correct notion of the first can not be formed without keeping the latter constantly in view . The leading distinctive principle of this country , is connected with the fact that all political power is strictly a trust , granted by the constituent to the representative . These representatives possess different duties , and as the greatest check that is imposed on them , while in the exercise of their offices , exists in the manner in which the functions are balanced by each other , it is of the last importance that neither class trespass on the trusts that are not especially committed to its keeping . The machinery of the state being the same in appearance , in this country and in that from which we are derived , inconsiderate commentators are apt to /z/ confound their principles . In England , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has accidentally given birth . The power of thekins was derived from violence , the monarch , before the act of succession , in the reign of Queen Anne , claiming the throne in virtue of the conquest by William , in 1060 . In America , the institutions are the result of deliberate consultation , mutual concessions , and design . In England , the people may have gained by diminishing the power of the king , who first obtained it by force ; but , in ximerica , to assail the rightful authority of the executive , is attacking a system framed by the constituencies of the states , who are virtually the people , for their own benefit . No assault can be made on any branch of this government while in the exercise of its constitutional duties , without assaulting the right of the body of the nation , which is the foundation of the whole polity . In countries , in which executive power is hereditary , and clothed with high prerogatives , it may be struggling for liberty to strive to diminish its influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive is elective , has no absolute authority in framing the laws , serves for a short period , is responsible , and has been created by the people , through the states , for their own purposes , it is assailing the rights of that people , to attempt m any manner to impede its legal and just action . It is a general law in politics , that the power most to be distrusted , is that which , possessing the greatest force , is the least responsible . Under the constitutional monarchies of Europe , ( as they exist in theory , at least , ) the king , besides uniting in his single person all the authority of the executive , which includes a power to make war , create peers , and unconditionally to name to all employments , has an equal influence /q/ in enacting laws , his veto being absolute ; but , in America , the executive , besides being elective , is stripped of most of these high sources of influence , and is obhged to keep constantly in view the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his direct responsibilities , and on account of the force of public opinion . In this country , there is far more to apprehend from congress , than from the executive , as is seen in the following reasons :  --  Congress is composed of many , while the executive is one , bodies of men notoriously acting with less personal responsibilities than iridividuals ; congress has power to enact laws , which it becomes the duty of the executive to see enforced , and the really legislative authority of a country is always its greatest authority ; from the decisions and constructions of the executive , the citizen can always appeal to the courts for protection , but no appeal can lie from the acts of congress , except on the ground of unconstitutionality ; the executive has direct personal responsibihties under the laws of the land , ' for any abuses of his authority , but the member of congress , unless guilty of open corruption , is almost beyond personal liabilities . It follows that the legislature of this country , by the intention of the constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the power most to be distrusted . Still , all who possess trusts , are to be diligently watched , for there is no protection against abuses without responsibility , nor any real responsibility , without vigilance . Political partisans , who are too apt to mistake the impulses of their own hostilities and friendships for truths , have laid down many false principles on the subject of the duties of the executive . When a law ispassed , it goes to the executive for execution , through C ti /z/ the executive agents , and , at need , to the courts for interpretation . It would seem that there is no discretion vested inthe executive concerning the constitutionality of a law . If he distrust the constitutionality of any law . Tie can set forth his objections by resorting to the veto ; but it is clearly the intention of the system that the whole legislative power , in the last resort , shall abide in congress , while it is necessary to the regular action of the government , that none of its agents , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to interpret the constitution , in practice . The citizen is differently situated . If he conceive himself oppressed by an unconstitutional law , it is his inalienable privilege to raise the question before the courts , where a final interpretation can be had . By this interpretation the executive and all his agents are equally bound to abide . This obligation arises from the necessity of things , as well as from the nature of the institutions . There must be somewhere a power to decide on the constitutionality of laws , and this power is vested in the supreme court of the United States , on final appeal . When called on to approve a law , even though its principle should have been already pronounced on by the courts , the executive is independent . He is now a legislator , and can disregard all other constructions of the constitution , but those dictated by his own sense of right . In this character , to the extent of his veto-power , he is superior to the courts , which have cognizance of no more than each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president may approve of a law that the court has decided to be unconstitutional in principle , or he may veto a law that the court has decided to be constitutional in principle . The legislator himself , is compelled to submit to the interpretation of the court , however different his own views of the law may have /q/ been in passing it , but as soon as lie comes to act again as a legislator , he becomes invested with all his own high duties and rights . The court can not make the constitution , in- any case ; it only interprets the law . One court may decide difFerently from another , and instances often occur in which the same judges see reason to change their own decisions , and it would be , to the last degree , inexpedient , to give the court an authority beyond the necessity of the circumstances . Although the coiu't can render a law null , its power does not extend beyond the law already passed . Congress may re-enact it , as often as it please , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the balance of the constitution , which invites inquiry , the constituencies of the states holding a leal authority to render that constitutional which the courts have declared to be unconstitutional , or vice versa , by amendments to the instrument itself ; the supremacy of the court being merely temporary , conditional , and growing out of expediency and necessity . It has been said that it is a vital principle of this government , tjiat each of its branches should confine itself to the particular duties assigned it by the constitution , and in no manner exceed them . Many grave abuses have already arisen from loosing sight of this truth , and there is danger that the whole system will be perverted from its intention , if not destroyed , unless they are seasonably corrected . Of these , the most prevalent , the one most injurious to the public service , that which has been introduced the most on foreign and the kast on American principles , is the practice of using the time and influence of the legislatures , for the purpose of acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flections . The usage has already gained so much footing , as seriously to impede the course of Icffislation. /z/ This is one of the cases , in which it is necessary to discriminate between the distinctive principles of our own government , and those of the government of the country from which we are derived . In England , by the mode in which the power of the executive has been curtailed , it is necessary that the ministerial contests should be conducted in the legislative bodies , but , in this country , such a course can not be imitated , without the legislators ' assuming an authority that does not belong to them , and without dispossessing the people , in some measure , of their rights . He who will examine the constitution for the powers of congress , will jEind no authority to pass resolutions on , or to waste the time , which is the property of the public , in discussing the matters , on which , after all , congress has no power to decide . This is the test of legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that congress can not legally control , unless it be to ascertain its own powers . In cases that do not admit of question , this is one of the grossest abuses of the institutions , and ought to be classed with the usurpations of other systems . There is a feeling connected with this subject , that it behoves every upright citizen cautiously . to watch . He may be opposed to the executive , for instance , as a part ' - man , and yet have an immediate representative in congress , of his own particular way of thinking ; and it is a weakness of humanity , under such circumstances , for one to connect himself most directly with his own immediate candidate , and to look on his political opponent with distrust . The jealousy created by this feeling , induces unreflecting men to imagine that curbing their particular representatives , in matters of this nature , is curtailing their own rights , and disposes them to defend what is inherently wrong , on personal motives . /q/ Political systems ought to be , and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These principles can not be perverted , or lost sight of , without perverting , or rendering nugatory the system itself ; and , under a popular government , in an age like this , far more is to be apprehended from indirect attacks on the institutions , than from those which are direct . It is usual to excuse these departures from the right on the plea of human propensities , but human institutions are framed expressly to curb such propensities , and no truth is more salutary than that which is contained in the homely saying , that " law makers should not be law breakers . " It is the duty of the citizen to judge of all political acts on the great principles of the government , and not according to his own political partialities , or prejudices . His own particular representative is no more a representative of the people , than the representative of any other man , and one branch of the government is no more representative than another . All are to keep within their respective spheres , and it may be laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representative who exceeds his trusts trespasses 071 the rights of the people . All comparisons between the powers of the British parliament and those of congress are more than useless , since they are bodies differently constituted , while one is absolute , and the other is merely a special trustee for limited and defined objects . In estimating the powers of congress , there is a rule that may be safely confided in , and which has been already hinted at . The powers of congress are express and limited . That body therefore , can have no right to pass resolutions other than those which affect their own police , or , in a moral sense , even to make speeches , except on subjects on which they have a /z/ right to pass laics . The instant they exceed these limits , they exceed the bounds of their delegated authority . By applying this simple test to their proceedings , any citizen may , in ordinary cases , ascertain how far the representatives of the nation abuse their trusts . Liberty is not a matter of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its great safeguards , after placing its foundations on a popular base , is in the checks and balances imposed on the public servants , and all its real friends ought to know that the most insidious attacks , are made on it by those who are the largest trustees of authority , in their efforts to increase their power . The government of the United States has three branches . The executive , the legislative and the judicial . These several branches are independent of each other , though the first is intended to act as a check on the second , no law or resolution being legal that is not first submitted to the president for his approval . This check , however , does not render the first an integral part of the legislature , as laws and resolutions may be passed without his approval , by votes of two thirds . In most constitutional monarchies , the legislatures , being originally secondary powers , were intended as checks on the action of the crown , which was possessed of the greatest , and , by consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reversed in America , the executive using his veto as a check on congress . Such is the intention of the constitution , though the tactics of party , and the bitterness of opposition , have endeavored to interpret the instrument differently , by appealing to the ancient prejudices derived from England . /z/ The president " sees the laws faithfully executed . " Ill order to render this power efficient , he appoints to office and removes all officers , but the judges , and those whom they are authorized by congress to appoint , who form an independent portion of the government . As this has been a disputed authority , it may be well to explain it more distinctly . The president nominates to the senate , and with its " advice and consent , " appoints all the officers of the government , with the exception of those whose appointment congress has authority to vest , by law , in the heads of departments , or in the courts of justice . The functionaries appointed by the courts of law are not removable , either directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government being independent , and not executing but merely interpreting the laws . Although the president can not remove the officers who are appointed by the heads of departments , he can remove tliose heads of departments themselves , thereby securing a prompt and proper execution of their duties . In this manner all the executive agents are subject to the supervisory power of the president , as , there can be no just doubt , was the intention of the constitution . The right of the president to remove from office has been disputed , but on insufficient grounds . Unless the constitution shall be so interpreted as to give him this power , all officers must hold their places until /z/ removed bj death , or impeachment , as it is clear no other branch of the state , separately , or in connection with a second , possesses this authority . A brief examination of the instrument will demonstrate this truth , the reader bearing in mind that there is now question , only , of those officers who are appointed by the executive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , or the heads of departments . The language of the constitution is as follows :  --  " He ( the president ) shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the senators concur ; and he shall nominate and , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , appoint ambassadors , " &c.; &c.; and all the other officers of the government , with the exceptions already named . From this phraseology it has been contended that , as the senate has a voice in appointing , it ought to have a voice in removing from office , the constitution leaving the latter authority entirely to construction . In addition to the paragraph just quoted , we find that " he ( the president ) shall commission all officers of the United States . " All the direct provisions of the constitution on this subject , are contained in thee two parts of sections . The pretension in behalf of the senate 's voice in removals , is made under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no manner appoints to office . This is proved by the language of the constitution , which reads , by taking away the parenthetical part of the sentence , " he ( the president ) shall appoint , " &c.; &c.; In no other way , can grammar be made of the sentence . The president , therefore , and not the senate appoints to office , and by construction , the president decides on the removal . The consent of the senate , in the cases of treaties and offices . /q/ is a bestowal of authority on the president , alone , by which consent he receives a complete power to act in the premises , as he shall judge expedient . Thus a treaty is not ratified , because the senate approves of it , nor a citizen appointed to office because the senate consents to his appointment ; the authority granted in both cases being given to the president , and not to the instrument in the case of a treaty , or to the individual in the case of an appointment . The president may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a compact , or to commission an officer , which is his authority to act , after having received the consent of the senate , in both cases . The power of the senate is merely a negative power in appointments and in treaties , its dissent defeating the intention of the president , but its assent in no manner obliging him to adhere to his first resolution . Or , it would be better still to say , the senate has power to complete the authority of the president . In some countries a parent negatives the marriage of the child . This is a similar case in principle , for when the father consents , he does not marry , but permits his child to perform the affirmative act . The powers of the president are three-fold , in the cases of appointments . He " nominates , " he " appoints " and he " commissions . " To nominate is to propose , or name ; to appoint , is to determine in the mind , or , in this case to settle on consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last act , is the one by which the nominee receives his authority , and it would seem to be a just construction that the authonty which appoints and empowers should have the right to withdraw its commission . They who object to this reasoning , say that the power to " commission " is merely a ministerial power . No part of the cojistitution can be thus limited in its signification . All the powers of the executive /z/ named in the instrument , are strictly executive powers , and are to be construed solelj on the great principles that regulate all executive authority . This is ill conformity with the letter and spirit of the constitution , which has instituted this high office , not as a ministerial , but as an executive office . The distinction between an executive and a ministerial function is great and manifest . The last is positive , and limited by the provisions of the law to be executed ; the first has a wide discretion , and is always to be interpreted on as liberal and broad principles , as the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that high political considerations should have their due weight on the acts of such an agent . But a quotation from the constitution , itself , will show our meaning . The section which contains the power of the president to commission , is in these words : " He ( the president , ) shall , from time to time , give to congress information of the state of the Union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and eipedient ; he may , on extraordinary occasions , convene both houses , or either of them , and , in case of disagreement between them , with respect to the time of adjournment , he may adjourn them to such time as he may think proper ; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers ; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed ; and he sitall commission ( empower , in an executive sense ) all the officers of the United States Each and all of these high functions are executive , and are to be discharged on the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to " receive ambassadors and other public ministers , " as they shall present themselves , like a mere minister of state , when the act is contrary to the interests and character of the nation ; but he is the depository of /q/ that discretionary authority , to receive , or to reject them , which hy the usages of nations and in the necessity of things , must somewhere abide in all governments . Under the confederation this power resided in congress ; under the constitution it is in the president . Were this function merely a ministerial function , the ) resident would have no power to decline receiving a foreign agent , and the country would be destitute of a necessary means to protect the interests and dignity of the state . On the same principle , the right to commission ( or empower ) as an executive right , in the absence of any . specific fundamental law to the contrary , infers the right to withdraw that commission ; or in other words , to remove from office . All the ditlerent powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , " a duty than can be discharged in no otiier manner , than by displacing unworthy agents , and entrusting the authority to worthier ; he nominates , or originates the appointment ; with the consent of the senate , lie settles the matter in his own mind , or appoints ; and according to the true and technical signification of the word , he commissions , or empowers ; unless it be intended that all offices shall be held during good behaviour , he removes . That the constitution did not intend that officers should be irremovable , is to be inferred fiom the fact that duties are assigned the president , that can be discharged in no other manner than by displacing delinquents ; from the genera usages of governments ; rtnd from the fact tliat ceitain officers are named , in the way of exceptions , as ihose who are to hold their trusts during good An example will show the necessity of this power 's existing in the president . A collector is commanded /z/ to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great injury of the country . The executive is ordered by the- constitution to tc.ke care that this , as well as the other laws , be faithfully executed . He admonishes the delinquent , who pertinaciously adheres to his illegal course . In what manner is the president to enforce the law ? Impeachment is not in his power , in the first place ; and in the next place , it does not enforce the law , but punishes the oftender . He may , in some cases , order the law officers of the government to prosecute for penalties , perhaps , but the law officers may also refuse to do their duties , and thus the whole intention of the institutions would be set at naught . Errors have arisen , on these subjects , by misconceiving the meaning of the terms . " Nominate , " " appoint " and " commission , " are to be construed in their broadest significations , in an instrument as dignified and comprehensive as a constitution , and with strict reference to the general character of the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive and in no manner miniserial . This is the only statesmanlike view of the question , though the practice of permitting common-law lawyers to expound the great national compact , has had the effect to narrow and degrade the instrument , favoring the views of political factions , and not unfrequently disturbing the country without a commensurate object . The practice of the government has always been in conformity with this reasoning , though , it is believed that no commentator has ever given a sufficiently broad signification to the power to commission . If this power be strictly executive , as it is just to deem it , it must be taken like the power to receive ambassadors , or as a duty vested with high executive discretion* The president has consequently the same authority /q/ to withold , or to withdraw a commission , in the one case , as in the other , to receive or to decline receiving a foreiijn minister . It follows that all the affirmative ) ower in making treaties , in appointing to office , and in removing , is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aut'iorising the several acts , but merely completing the riirlit of the executive to perform these high functions himself . The president of the United States , besides his civil duties , is the military commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States , at all times , and of the militia of the several states whenever the latter is called into the field . He is the representative of the constituencies of the states , under a i ) eculiar modification , and for the purposes set forth in the constitution . He has no prerogative , which implies an inalienable and exclusive right or privilege , for his functions take the character of duties , and the states can legally , and under prescribed forms , not only modify those duties , but they can altogether destroy the office , at will . As a rule , there is far more danger that the president of the United States will render the office less efiicient than was intended , than that he will exercise an authority dangerous to the liberties of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are unnecessary ; that of dismissing military officers , for instance . But it is a greater evil to attempt red ucing them , except in conformity with the provisions of the constitution , than to endure them . Even these questionable pointsof power , have been seldom abused , and , as a whole , the history of the country shows ten instances of presidents ' evading responsibility , to one of their abusing power . A recent case is that of the executive 's assenting to an indirect law recognizing /z/ the independence of Texas , a measure that is purely diplomatick and international , and which , of course , ought to be regulated by treaty , and in no other manner . A step of this gravity , if referred to the proper authority , would have required the sanction of a two thirds vote in the senate , and consequently a deliberation and prudence that might do better justice , and possibly avoid a war . W/fi ON EqUAMTY . Equality , in a social sense , may be divided into that of condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompatible with civilization , and is found only to exist in those communities that are but slightly removed from the savage state . In practice , it can only mean a common misery . Equality of rights is a peculiar feature of democracies . These rights are properly divided into civil and political , though even these definitions are not to be taken as absolute , or as literally exact . Under the monarchies of the old world , there exist privileged classes , possessed of exclusive rights . For a long period the nobles were exempted from taxes , and many other charges , advantages that are still enjoyed by them , in certain countries . In England , even , the nobles are entitled to hereditary advantages that are denied to those who are of inferior birth . All these distinctions are done away with in principle , in countries where there exists a professed equality of rights , though there is probably no community that does not make some distinctions between the political /q/ privileges of men . If this be true , there is strictly no equaUty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , and is , a nearer approach to an equality of civil rights . By political rights we understand , the suffrage , eligibility to office , and a condition of things that admits of no distinction between men , unless on principles that are common to all . Thus , though a man is not qualified to vote until he has reached the age of twenty-one , the regulation does not effect political equality , since all are equally subjected to the rule , and all become electors on attaining the same age . With an equality of civil rights , all men are equal before the law ; all classes of the community being liable equally to taxation , military service , jury duties , and to the other impositions attendant on civilization , and no one being exempted from its control , except on general rules , which are dependent on the good of all , instead of the exemption 's belonging to the immunities of individuals , estates , or families . An equality of civil rights may be briefly defined to be an absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political rights is material , one implying mere equality before the administration of the law , the other , equality in the power to frame it . An equality of civil rights is never absolute , but we are to understand by the term , such an equality only , as is compatible with general justice and the relations between the different members of families . Thus , women nowhere possess precisely the same rights as men , or men the same rights as women . The wife , usually , can neither sue nor be sued , while the husband , except in particular cases , is made liable to all legal claims on account of the wife . Minors are deprived of many of their civil rights , or , it would be better to /z/ say , do not attain them , until they reach a period of life that has been arbitrarily fixed , and which varies in different countries , according to their several policies . Neither is equality of political rights ever absolute . In those countries where the suffrage is said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , or from that controlling policy which can never be safely lost sight of in the management of human affairs . The interests of women being thought to be so identified with those of their male relatives as to become , in a great degree , inseparable , females are , almost generally , excluded from the possession of political rights . There can be no doubt that society is greatly the gainer , by thus excluding one half its members , and the half that is best adapted to give a tone to its domestic happiness , from the strife of parties , and the fierce struggles of political controversies . Men are also excluded from political rights previously to having attained the age prescribed by law . Paupers , those who have no fixed abodes , and aliens in law , though their lives may have been principally passed in the country , are also excluded from the enjoyment of political rights , every where . Thus birth-right is almost universally made a source of advantage . These exceptions , however , do not very materially aifect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , and have been made solely with a reference to the good of society , or to render the laws less liable to abuses in practice . It follows , that equality , whether considered in connection with our civil or political rights , must not be taken as a general and absolute condition of society , but as such an equality as depends on principles that are equitable , and which are suited to the actual wants of men . OW AinERICAlV EqiJAMTY . Tlie equality of the United States is no more absolute , tliaii that of any other countr ' . There may be less inequahty in this nation than in most others , but inequahty exists , and , m some respects , with stronger features than it is usual to meet with in the rest of Christendom The rights of property being an indispensable condition of civilization , and its quiet possession every where guarantied , equality of condition is rendered impossible . One man must labor , while another may live luxuriously on his means ; one has leisure and opportunity to cultivate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his habits , while another is compelled to toil , that he may live . One is reduced to serve , while another conmiands , and , of course , there can be no equality in their social conditions . The justice and relative advantage of these differencies , as well as their several duties , will be elsewhere considered . By the inequality of civil and political rights that exists in certain parts of the Union , and the great equality that exists in others , we see the necessity of referring the true character of the institutions to those of the states , without a just understanding of which , it is impossible to obtain any general and accurate ideas of the real polity of the country . The same general exceptions to civil and political // equality , that are found in other free countries , exist in this , though under laws peculiar to ourselves . Women and minors are excluded from the suffrage , and from maintaining suits at law , under the usual provisions , here as well as elsewhere . None but natives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paupers , felons and all those who have not fixed residences , are also excluded from the suffrage . In a few of the states property is made the test of political rights , and , in nearly half of them , a large portion of the inhabitants , who are of a different race from the original European occupants of the soil , are entirely excluded from all political , and from many of the civil rights , that are enjoyed by those who are deemed citizens . A slave can neither choose , nor be chosen to office , nor , in most of the states , can even a free man , unless a white man . A slave can neither sue nor be sued ; he can not hold property , real or personal , nor can he , in many of the states be a witness in any suit , civil or criminal . It follows from these facts , that absolute equality of condition , of political rights , or of civil rights , does not exist in the United States , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in others , and in some of the states , perhaps , to as great a degree as is practicable . In what are usually called the free states of America , or those in which domestic slavery is abolished , there is to be found as much equality in every respect as comports with safety , civilization and the rights of property . This is also true , as respects the white population , in those states in which domestic slavery does exist ; though the number of the bond is in a large proportion to that of the free . As the tendency of the institutions of America is to the right , we learn in these truths , the power of facts , /q/ every question of politics being strictly a question of practice . Tliey wlio fancy it possible to frame the institutions of a country , on the pure principles of abstract justice , as these principles exist in theories , know little of human nature , or of the restraints that are necessary to society . Abuses assail us in a thousand forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , approachinjr perfection . The very necessity of a irovornment at all , arises from the impossibility of controlliujnr the passions by any other means than that of force . The celebrated proposition contained in the declaration of independence is not to be understood literally . All men are not " created equal , " in a physical , or even in a moral sense , unless we limit the signification to one of political rights . This much is true , since human institutions are a human invention , with which nature has had no connection . Men are not born equals , physically , since one has a good consthution , another a bad ; one is handsome , another ugly ; one white , another black . Neither are men born equals morally , one possessing genius , or a natural aptitude , while his brother is an idiot . As regards all human institutions men are born equal , no sophistry being able to prove that nature intended one should inherit power and wealth , another slavery and want . Still artificial inequalities are the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing principle for the social compact , the American legislators instituted new modes of difference . The very existence of government at all , infers inequality . The citizen who is preferred to office becomes the superior of those who are not , so long as he is the repository of power , and the child inherits the wealth of the parent as a controlling law of society . AJl that the great American proposition , therefore , can /z/ mean , is to set up new and jiister notions of natural rights than those which existed previously , by asserting , in substance , that God has not instituted political inequahties , as was pretended by the advocates of the Jus Divinum , and that men possessed a full and natural authority to form such social institutions as best suited their necessities . Tlire are numerous instances in which the social inequality of America may do violence to our notions of abstract justice , but the compromise of interests under which all civilized society must exist , renders this unavoidable . Great principles seldom escape working injustice in particular things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations of a community , for in them many great , and frequently conflicting principles enter , to maintain the more essential features of which sacrifices of parts become necessary . If we would have civilization and the exertion indispensable to its success , we must have property ; if we have property , we must have its rights ; if we have the rights of property , we must take those consequences of the rights of property which are inseparable from the rights themselves . The equality of rights in America , therefore , after allowing for the striking exception of domestic slavery , is only a greater extension of the principle than common , while there is no such thing " as an equality of condition . All that can be said of the first , is that it has been carried as far as a prudent discretion will at all allow , and of the last , that the inequality is the simple result of civilization , unaided by any of those factitious plans that have been elsewhere devised in order to augment the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no where laid down as a governing principle of the institutions of the United States , neither /z/ the word , nor any inference that can be fairly deduced from its meaning , occurring in the constitution . As respects the states , themselves , the professions of an equality of rights are more clear , and slavery excepted , the intention in all their governments is to maintain it , as far as practicable , though equality of condition is no where mentioned , all political economists knowing that it is unattainable , if , indeed , it be desirable . Desirable in practice , it can hardly be , since the result would be to force all down to the level of the lowest . All that a good government aims at , therefore , is to add no unnecessary and artificial aid to the force of its own unavoidable consequences , and to abstain from fortifying and accumulating social inequality as a means of increasing political inequalities . W/'fi /z/ Liberty , like equality , is a word more used than understood . Perfect and absolute liberty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condition . It is impracticable in a state of nature even , since , without the protection of the law , the strong would oppress and enslave the weak . We are then to understand by liberty , merely such a state of the social compact as permits the members of a community to lay no more restraints on themselves , than are required by their real necessities , and obvious interests . To this definition may be added , that it is a requisite of liberty , that the body of a nation should retain the /z/ power to modify its institutions , as circumstances shall require . The natural disposition of all men being to enjoy a perfect freedom of action , it is a common error to suppose that the nation which possesses the mildest laws , or laws that impose the least personal restraints , is the freest . This opinion is untenable , since the power that concedes this freedom of action , can recall it . Unless it is lodged in rhe body of the community itself , there is , therefore , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar , supposititious case will render this truth more obvious . A slave liolder in Virginia is the master of two slaves : to one he grants his liberty , with the means to go to a town in a free state . The other accompanies his old associate clandestinely . In this town , they engage their services voluntarily , to a common master , who assigns to them equal shares in the same labor , paying them the same wages . In time , the master learns their situation , but , being an indulgent man , he allows the slave to retain his present situation . In all material things , these brothers are equal ; they labor together , receive the same wages , and eat of the same food . Yet one is bond , and the other free , since it is in the power of the master , or of his heir , or of his assignee , at any time , to reclaim the services of the one who was not legally manumitted , and reduce him again to the condition of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts , while the other , though temporarily enjoying the same privileges , holds them subject to the will of a superior . This is an all important distinction in the consideration of political liberty , since the circumstances of the two countries are precisely the same , and all municipal regulations ought to have direct reference to the actual condition of a community . It folloAVS , that no /q/ country can properly be deemed free , unless the body of the nation possess , in the last resort , the leg-al power to frame its laws according to its wants . This power must also abide in the nation , or it becomes merely an historical fact , for he that was once free is not necessarily free always , any more than he that was once happy , is to consider himself happy in perpetuity . This definition of liberty is new to the world , for a government founded on such principles is a novelty . Hitherto , a nation Las been deemed free , whose people were possessed of a certain amount of franchises , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation may not be absolutely enslaved , but it can scarcely be considered in possession of an affirmative political liberty , since it is not the master of its own fortunes . Having settled what is the foundation of liberty , it remains to be seen by what process a people can exercise this authority over themselves . The usual course is to refer all matters of choice to the decision of majorities . The comjuon axiom of democracies , however , which says that " the majority must rule , " is to be received with many limitations . Were the majority of a country to rule without restraint , it is probable as much injustice and oppression would follow , as are found under the dominion of one . It belongs to the nature of men to arrange themselves in parties , to lose sight of truth and justice in partizansliip and prejudice , to mistake their own impulses for that which is proper , and to do wrong because they are indisposed to seek the right . Were it wise to trust power , unreservedly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they might , as occasion required , emanate from the will of numbers . Constitutions would be useless . /z/ The majority rules in prescribed cases , and in no other . It elects to office , it enacts ordinary laws , subject however to the restrictions of the constitution , and it decides most of the questions that arise in the primitive meetings of the people ; questions that do not usually effect any of the principal interests of life . The majority does not rule in settling fundamental laws , under the constitution ; or when it does rule in such cases , it is with particular checks produced by time and new combinations ; it does not pass judgment in trials at law , or under impeachment , and it is impotent in many matters touching vested rigths . In the state of New York , the majority is impotent , in granting corporations , and in appropriating money for local purposes . Though majorities often decide wrong , it is believed that they are less liable to do so than minorities . There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country " , are more capable of coming to wise and intelligent decisions in affairs of state , than the mass of a population . Thiir wealth and leisure afford them opportunities for observation and comparison , while their general information and greater knowledge of character , enable them to judge more accurately of men and measures . That these opportunities are not properly used , is owing to the unceasing desire of men to turn their advantages to their own particular benefit , and to their passions . All history proves , when power is the sole possession of a few , that it is perverted to their sole advantage , the jpublic suffering in order that their rulers may prosper . The same nature which imposes the necessity of governments at all , seems to point out the expediency of confiding its control , in the last resort , to the body of the nation , as the only lasting protection against gross abuses . /q/ We do not adopt the popular polity because it is perfect , but because it is less imperfect than any other . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is vain to expect an infallible whole that is composed of fallible parts . The government that emanates from a single will , supposing that will to be pure , enlightened , impartial , just and consistent , would be the best in the world , were it attainable for men . Such is the government of the universe , the result of which is perfect harmony . As no man is witiiout spot in his justice , as no man has infinite wisdom , or infinite mercy , we are driven to take refuge in the opposite extreme , or in a government of many . It is common for the advocates of monarchy and aristocracy to deride the opinions of the mass , as no more than the impulses of ignorance and prejudices . While experience unhappily shows that this charge has too much truth , it also shows that the educated and few form no exemption to the common rule of humanity . The most intelligent men of every country in which there is liberty of thought and action , yielding to their interests or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contested questions , thus triumphantly refuting an arrogant proposition , that of the exclusive fitness of the few to govern , by an unanswerable fact . The minority of a country is never known to agree , except in its eftbrts to reduce and oppress the majority . Were this not so , parties would be unknown in all countries but democracies , whereas the factions of aristocracies have been among the fiercest and least governable of any recorded in history . Although real political liberty can have but one character , that of a popular base , the world contams many modifications of governments that are , more or Jess , worthy to be termed free . In most of these /z/ States , however , the liberties of the mass , are of the negative character of franchises , which franchises are not power of themselves , but merely an exemption from the abuses of power . Perhaps no state exists , in which the people , either by usage , or by direct concessions from the source of authority , do not possess some of these franchises ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , as perfect and absolute liberty , neither is there any such thing , in practice , as total and unmitigated slavery . In the one case , nature has rendered man incapable of enjoying freedom without restraint , and in the other , incapable of submitting , entirely without resistance , to oppression . The harshest desposts are compelled to acknowledge the immutable principles of eternal justice , affecting necessity and the love of right , for their most ruthless deeds . England is a country in which the franchises of the subject are more than usually numerous . Among the most conspicuous of these are the right of trial by jury , and that of the habeas corpus . Of the former it is unnecessary to speak , but as the latter is a phrase that may be unintelligible to many , it may be well to explain it . The literal signification of Habeas Corpus* is , ** thou may'st have the body . " In arbitrary governments , it is much the usage to oppress men , under the pretence of justice , by causing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of subjecting them to long and vexatious imprisonments , by protracting , or altogether evading the day of trial . The issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus , is an order to bring the accused before an impartial and independent judge , who examines into the charge , and who orders the prisoner to be set at liberty , unless there be sufficient legal ground for his detention . * " Habeas , " second person singular , present tense , subjunctive mood , of the verb " Habere , ' to have ; " Corpus , " a noun , signifying " body . " /q/ This provision of the Enghsh law has been wisely retained in our system , for without some such regulation , it would be almost as easy to detain a citizen unjustly , under a popular government , as to detain the subject of a monarchy ; the difference in favor of the first , consisting only in the greater responsibility of its functionaries . By comparing the privileges of the Habeas Corpus where it exists alone , and as a franchise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provision of his own , against the abuses of ordinances that he had a voice in framing , we learn the essential difference between real liberty and franchises . The Englishman can appeal to a tribunal , against the abuse of an existing law , but if the law be not with him , he has no power to evade it , however unjust , or oppressive . The American has the same appeal against the abuse of a law , with the additional power to vote for its repeal , should the law itself be vicious . The one profits by a franchise to liberate his person only , submitting to his imprisonment however , if legaHty has been respected ; while the other , in addition to this privilege , has a voice in getting rid of the obnoxious law , itself , and in preventing a recurrence of the wrong . Some countries have the profession of possessing a government of the people , because an ancient dynasty has been set aside in a revolution , and a new one seated on the throne , either directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to assume the character of a popular decision . Admitting that a people actually had an agency in framing such a system , and in naming their ruler , they can not claim to be free , since they have parted with the power they did actually possess . No proposition can be clearer than that he who has given away a thing is no longer its master . 56 Ox LIBERTY . Of this nature is the present government of France . In that country the ancient dynasty has been set aside by a combination of leaders , through the agency of a few active spirits among the mass , and a prince put upon the throne , who is virtually invested with all the authority of his predecessor . Still , as the right of the last sovereign is clearly derived from a revolution , which has been made to assume the appearance of popular will , his government is termed a government of the people . This is a fallacy that can deceive no one of the smallest reflection . Such a system may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystification to call it by any other than its proper name . It is not a government of consultation , but one of pure force as respects a vast majority of Frenchmen . A good deal of the same objection lies against the government of Great Britain , which , though freer in practice than that of France , is not based on a really free system . It may be said that both these governments are as free as comports with discretion , as indeed may be said of Turkey , since men get to be disqualified for the possession of any advantage in time ; but such an admission is only an avowal of unfitness , and not a proof of enjoytnent . It is usual to maintain , that in democracies the tyranny of majorities is a greater evil than the oppression of minorities in narrow systems . Although this evil is exaggerated , since the laws being equal in their action it is not easy to oppress the few without oppressing ail , it undeniably is the weak side of a popular government . To guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the cases in which the majority shall decide , limiting their power , and bringing that they do possess within the circle of certain g-eneral and just principles . It will be els where shown that it is a great mistake for the American citizen /q/ to take sides with the pubhc , in doubtful cases aftecting the rights of individuals , as this is the precise form in which oppression is the most likely to exhibit itself in a popular government . Although it is true , that no genuine liberty can exist without being based on popular authority in the last resort , it is equally true that it can not exist when thus based , without many restraints on the power of the mass . These restraints are necessarily various and numerous . A familiar example w ill show their action . The majority of the people of a state might be in debt to its minority . Were the power of the former unrestrained , circumstances might arise in which they would declare depreciated bank notes a legal tender , and thus clear themselves of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent this , the constitution orders that nothing shall be made a legal tender but the precious metals , thus limiting the power of majorities in a way that the government is not limited in absolute monarchies , in which paper is often made to possess the value of gold and silver . Liberty therefore may be defined to be a controlling authority that resides in the body of a nation , but so restrained as only to be exercised on certain general principles that shall do as little violence to natural justice , as is compatible with the peace and security of society . /z/ The monarchical form of government has the advantages of energy for external purposes , as well as of simphcity in execution . It is prompt and efficient in attack . Its legislation is ready , emanating from a single will , and it has the means of respecting treaties with more iidelity than other systems . As laws are framed on general principles , they sometimes work evil in particular cases , and in a government of the will , the remedy is applied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monarchy , men are ruled without their own agency , and as their time is not required for the supervision or choice of the public agents , or the enactment of laws , their attention may be exclusively given to their personal interests . Could this advantage be enjoyed without the abuses of such a state of things , it would alone suffice to render this form of government preferable to all others , since contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed . As a monarchy recedes from absolutism , and takes the character of constitutionality , it looses these advantages to a certain extent , assuming more of those of legality . /z/ The aristocratical form of government , though in an unmitigated form one of the worst known , has many advantages when tempered by franchises . This latter is the real poHty of Great Britain , though it is under the pretence of a monarchy . No government , however , can properly he called a monarchy , in which the monarcli does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The king of England , by the theory of the constitution , is supposed to hold a balance between the lords and the commons , whereas he , in truth , may be said merely to hold a casting vote between the several factions of the aristocracy , when the forces of these factions neutralize each other . Aristocracies have a facility in combining measures for their interests that is not enjoyed by democracies . The power being in the hands of a few , these few can act with a despatch and energy , which , though unequaled by those of a monarchy , commonly have the material advantage of better agents . In an aristocracy , influence among the aristocrats themselves depending cliiefly on the manly qualities , history shows us that the pul ) lic agents are usually more chosen for their services than in a monarchy , wliere the favor of the ) rince is the cliief requisite for success ; it may therefore be assumed that the higher qualities of those who fill the p(d)lic trusts , in an aristocracy , more than neutralize the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficient form of government , for the purposes of conquest and foreign policy , that is known . Aristocracy has an absorbing quaUty , if such a term moy be used , by which the active and daring of conquered territories , are induced to join the conquerors , in order to share in the advantages of the system . Thus we find that almost all the countries that have made extensive conquests over civilized people , and who have long retained them , have been aristocracies . We get examples of the facilities of aristocracies to extend their influence , as well as to retain it , in Rome , England , Venice , Florence and many other states . An aristocracy is a combination of many powerful men , for the purpose of mahitaining and advancing their own particular interests . It is consequently a concentration of all the most effective parts of a community for a given end ; hence its energy , efficiency and success . Of all the forms of government , it is the one best adapted to support the system of metropolitan sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribed and neutralized , by admitting them to a participation of power . By this means it is rendered less offensive to human pride than the administration of one . The present relations between England and Ireland , are a striking instance of %vhat is meant . An aristocracy , unless unusually narrow , is peculiarly the government of the enterprising and the ambitious . High honors are attainable , and jealousy of rewards is confined to individuals , seldom eftecting ' the state . The tendency of the system , therefore , is to render the aristocrats bold , independent and manly , and to cause them to be distinguished from the mass ; In an age as advanced as ours , the leisure of the higher classes of an aristocracy , enable them to cultivate their minds and to improve their tastes . Hence aristocracies /q/ are particularly favorable to knowledge and the arts , as both grow imder patronage . It is nece.ssary lo distinguish , however , between a political and a merely social aristocracy . These remarks apply chiefly to the former , which alone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , applies properly to no other , though vulgar use has perverted its signification to all nobles , and even to the gentry of democracies . am /z/ The principal advantage of a democracy , is a general elevation in the character of the people . If few are raised to a very great height , few are depressed very low . As a consequence , the average of society is much more respectable than under any other form of government . The vulgar charge that the tendency of democracies is to levelling , meaning to drag all down to the level of the lowest , is singularly untrue , its real tendency being to elevate the depr ' ssed to a condition not unworthy of their manhood . In the absence of privileged orders , entails and distinctions , devised permanently to separate men into social castes , it is true none are great but those who become so by their acts , but , confining the remark to the upper classes of society , it would be much more true to say that democracy refuses to lend itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tendency to level those who have a just claim to be elevated . A denial of a. favor , is not an invasion of a right . /z/ Democracies are exempt from the military charges , both pecuniary and personal , that become necessary in governments in which the majority are subjects , since no force is required to repress those who , under other systems , are dangerous to the state , by their greater physical power . As the success of democracies is mainly dependant on the intelligence of the people , the means of preserving the government are precisely those which most conduce to the happiness and social progress of man . Hence we find the state endeavoring to raise its citiz.ens in the scale of being , the certain means of laying the broadest foundation of national prosperit If the arts are advanced in aristocracies , through the taste of patrons , in democracies , though of slower growth , they will prosper as a consequence of general information ; or as a superstructure reared on a wider and more solid foundation . Democracies beinsr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little violence is done to the sense of right by the institutions , and men have less occasion than usual , to resort to fallacies and false principles in cuhivating the faculties . As a consequence , common sense is more encouraged , and the community is apt to entertain juster notions of all moral truths , than under systems that are necessarily sophisticated . Society is thus a gainer in the greatest element of happiness , or in the right perception of the different relations between men and things . Democracies being established for the common interests , and the publick agents being held in constant check by the people , their general tendency is to serve the whole community , and not small portions of it , as is the case in narrow governments . It is as rational to suppose that a hungry man will first help his neif ! : hbor to bread , when master of his own acts , /q/ as to suppose that any but tliose who feel themselves to be truly public seiTauts ; , will lirst bethink themselves of the publick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of one , that one and his parasites will be the first and best served ; in a government of a few , the few ; and in a government of many , the many . Thus the general tendency of democratical institutions is to equalize advantages , and to spread its blessings over the entire surface of society . Democracies , other things being equal , are the ciieapest form of government , since little money is lavished in representation , and they who have to pay the taxes , have also , directly or indirectly , a voice in imposing them . Democracies are less liable to popular tumults than any other polities , because the people , having legal means in their power to redress wrongs , have little inducement to employ au other The man who can right himself by a vote , will seldom resort to a musket . Grievances , moreover , are less frequent , the most corrupt representatives of a democratick constituency generally standing in awe of its censure . As men in bodies usually defer to the right , unless acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracies pay more respect to abstract justice , in the management of their foreign concerns , than either aristocracies or monarchies , an appeal always lying against abuses , or violations of principle , to a popular sentiment , that , in the end , seldom fails to decide in favor of truth . , In democracies , with a due allowance for the workings of personal selfishness , it is usually a motive with those in places of trust , to consult the interests of the mass , there being little doubt , that in this system , the entire community has more regard paid to its wants and wishes , than in either of the two others . /z/ A ino . ARCHY . A monarchy is liable to those abuses which follow favoritism , the servants of the prince avenging themselves for their homage to one , by oppressing the many . A monarchy is the most expensive of all forms of government , the regal state requiring a costly parade , and he who depends on his own power to rule , must strengthen that power by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the favorites of an absolute prince , in connection with the charges of himself and family , frequently cost the state as much as its necessary expenditures . It is the policy of a monarchy to repress thought , a knowledge of human rights being always dangerous to absolute , or exclusive power . Thus the people of monarchies are divided into the extremes of society , the intermediate and happiest classes being usually small , and inclined to favor their superiors from apprehension of the brutal ignorance of those below them . Monarchies are subjected to the wars and to the policies of family alliances , the feelings and passions of the prince exercising a malign influence on the affairs of the state . In monarchies the people are required to maintain a military force sufficient to support the throne , the system always exacting that the subject should pay the troops that are kept on foot to hold him in subjection* /z/ Trutli is trammelled in a monarchy , the system dreadini collision with a ) ower so dangerous to all factitious and one-sided theories . Monarchies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominant power , discourage sincerity and frankness of character , substituting appearances for virtue , and flattery and deception for wholesome facts . Women often exercise an improper influence , and this from an impure motive , in monarchies , history tracing even wars to the passions of an offended mistress . The public money is diverted from legitimate objects , to those which support the personal views , passions , caprices , or enmities of the prince . Monarchies are subject to all those abuses , which depend on an irresponsible administration of power , and an absence of publicity ; abuses that oppress the majority for the benefit of a few , and which induce subserviency of character , frauds , flatteries and other similar vices . If , in this age , monarchies exhibit these results of the system in milder forms , than in other centuries , it is owing to the increasing influence of the people , who may control systems , though in a less degree , indirectly as well as directly . /z/ Aristocracy has , in common with monarchy , the evils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uttle less pomp under aristocrats , than under princes . It is compelled to maintain itself against the physical superiority of numbers also , by military charges that involve heavy personal services , and large expenditures of money . Being a government of the few , it is in the main , as a necessity of human selfishness , administered in the interests of the few . The ruled are depressed in consequence of the elevation of their rulers . Information is kept within circumscribed limits , lest the mass should come to a knowledge of their force , for horses would not submit to be put in harness and made to toil for hard taskmasters , did they know as much as men . Aristocracies partaking of the irresponsible nature of corporations , are soulless , possessing neither the personal feelings that often temper even despotism , nor submitting to the human impulses of popular bodies . This is one of the worst features of an aristocracy , a system that has shown itself more ruthless than any other , though tempered by civilization , for aristocracy and barbarism can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an aristocracy , the exactions are proportionably heavy , and this the more /q/ SO , as they who impose the burthens generally find the means to evade their payment : the apophthegm that " it is better to have one tyrant than many , " applying peculiarly to aristocracies , and not to democracies , which can not permanently tyrannize at all , without tyrannizing over those who rule . Aristocracies have a natural tendency to wars and aggrandizement , which bring with them the inevitable penalties of taxes , injustice , demoralization and blood-shed . This charge has been brought against republicks generally , but a distinction should be made between a republick with an aristocratical base , and a republick with a democratical base , their characters being as dissimilar as those of any two forms of government known . Aristocracies , feeling less of the better impulses of man , are beyond their influence , while their means of combining are so great , that they oftener listen to their interests than to those sentiments of natural justice that in a greater or less degree always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the love of money , which there is divine authority for believing to be " the root of all evil . " In modern aristocracies , the controlling principle is property , an influence the most corrupting to which men submit , and which , when its ordinary temptations are found united to those of political patronao ; e and power , is much too strong for human virtue . Direct bribery , therefore , has been found to be the banc of aristocracies , the influence of individuals supplying the place of merit , services and public virtue . In Rome this system was conducted so openly , that every man of note had his " clients , " a term which then signified one who depended on the favor of another for the advancement of his interests , and even for the maintenance of his rights- /z/ Aristocracies wound the sense of natural justice , and consequently unsettle principles , by placing men , altogetlier unworthy of trust , in high hereditary situations , a circumstance that not only offends morals , but sometimes , though possibly less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state . On this point however , too much importance must not be attached to theories , for in the practices of states a regard is necessarily paid to certain indispensable principles , and the comparative merits of systems are to be established from their general tendencies , rather than from the accidental exceptions that may occasionally arise : the quality in the J9fr50/z7iel of administrations depending quite as much on the general civilization of a nation , as on any other cause .. fJJJi Oy THE DISADVANTAGES OF /z/ Democracies are liable to popular impulses , which , necessarily arising from imperfect information , often work injustice from good motives . Tumults of the people are less apt to occur in democracies than under any other form of government , for , possessing the legal means of redressing themselves , there is less necessity to resort to force , but , public opinion , constituting , virtually , the power of the state , measures are more apt to be influenced by sudden mutations of sentiment , than under systems where the rulers have better opportunities and more leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movements of masses than in those of small bodies , except /q/ Hs design emanates from demagogues and politicEil managers . The efforts of the masses that are struggling to obtain their rights , in monarchies and aristocracies , however , are not to be imputed to democracy ; in such - cases , the people use their natural weapon , force , merely because they are denied any participation in the legal authority . When democracies are small , these impulses frequently do great injury to the public service , but in large states tliey are seldom of sufficient extent to produce results before there is time to feel the influence of reason . It is , therefore , one of the errors of politicians to imagine democracies more practicable in small than in large communities , an error that has probably arisen from the ffict that , the ignorance of masses having hitherto put men at the mercy of the combinations of the affluent and intelligent , democracies have been permitted to exist only in countries insignificant by their wealth and numbers . Large democracies , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this form of government , than smaller , are unable to scrutinize and understand character with the severity and intelligence that are of so much importance in all representative governments , and consequently the people are peculiarly exposed to become the dupes of demagogues and political schemers , most of the crimes of democracies arising from the faults and desi  --  ns of men of this character , rather than from the propensities of the people , who , having little temptation to do wrong , are seldom guilty of crimes except through ignorance . Democracies are necessarily controlled by publick opinion , and failing of the means of obtaining power more honestly , the fraudulent and ambitious iind a motive to mislead , and even to corrupt the common /z/ sentiment , to attain their ends . This is the greatest and most pervading danger of all large democracies , since it is sapping the foundations of society , by undermining its virtue . We see the effects of this baneful influence , in the openness and audacity with which men avow improper motives and improper acts , trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious influences are perhaps more admitted in other countries , than in America , in none are they so openly avowed . It may also be urged against democracies , that , nothing being more corrupting than the management of human affairs , which are constantly demanding sacrifices of permauent principles to interests that are as constantly fluctuating , their people are exposed to assaults on their morals from this quarter , that the masses of other nations escape . It is probable , however , that this evil , while it ought properly to be enumerated as one of the disadvantages of the system , is more than counterbalanced by the main results , even on the score of morals . The constant appeals to public opinion in a democracy , though excellent as a corrective of public vices , induce private hypocrisy , causing men to conceal their own convictions when opposed to those of the mass , the latter being seldom wholly right , or wholly wrong , A want of national manliness is a vice to be guarded against , for the man who would dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the latter is quite often wrong , however , is abundantly proved by the fact , that its own judgments fluctuate , as it reasons and thinks difl'erently this year , or this month even , from what it reasoned and thought the last . The tendency of democracies is , in all things , to mediocrity , since the tastes , knowledge and principles /q/ of the majority form the tribunal of appeal . Tliis circumstance , while it certainly ser'es to elevate the averaje qualities of a nation , renders the introduction of a nh standard difficult . Tlius do we find in literature , the arts , architecture and in all acquired knowlege , a tendency in America to G ; ravitate towards the common center in this , as in other things ; lending- a value and estimation to mediocrity that are not elsewhere o ; iven . It is fair to expect , however , that a foundation so broad , may in time sustain a superstructure of commensurate proportions , and that the influence of masses will in this , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should not be forGotten that , with the exception of those works , of which , as they appeal to human sympathies or the practices of men , an intellig-ent public is the best judfe , the mass of no community is qualified to decide the most correctly on any thiuLS which , in its nature , is above its reach . It is a besetting vice of democracies to substitute publick opinion for law . This is the usual form in which masses of men exhibit their tyranny . When the majority of the entire community commits this fault it is a sore grievance , but when local bodies , influenced by local interests , pretend to style themselves the publick , they are assuming powers that properly belong to the whole body of the people , and to them only under constitutional limitations . No tyranny of one , nor any tyranny of the few , is worse than this . All attempt3 in the publick , therefore , to do that which the y ) ublick has no right to do , should be frowned upon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be di'iplayed in a democracv . Democracies , depending so much on popular opinion are more liable to be influenced to their injury , through the munajrement of foreiirn and hostile na- /z/ tions , than other governments . It is generally knoAvn that , in Europe , secret means are resorted to , to influence sentiment in this way , and we ha , ve witnessed in this country open appeals to the people , against the acts of their servants , in matters of foreign relations , made by foreign , not to ? ay , hostile agents . Perhaps no stronger case can be cited of this weakness on the part of democracies , than is shown in t ! iis fact , for here we find men sufBciently audacious to build the hope of so far abusing opinion , as to persuade a people to act directly against their own dignity and interests . The misleading of publick opinion in one way or another , is the parent of the principal disadvantages of a democracy , for iu most instances it is first corrupting a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not for the counteracting influence of reason , which , in the end , seldom , perhaps never fails to assert its power , this defect would of itself , be suflicient to induce all discreet men to decide against this form of government . The greater the danger , the greater the necessity that all well-intentioned and right-minded citizens should be on their guard against its influence . It would be hazardous , however , to impute all the peculiar faults of American character , to the institutions , the country existing under so many unusual influences . If the latter were overlooked , one might be induced to think frankness and sincerity of character were less encouraged by popular institutions than was formerly supposed , close observers aftirming that these qualities are less frequent here , than in most other countries . When the general ease of society is remembered , there is unquestionably more deception of opinion practised than one would naturally expect , but this failing is properly to be imputed to causes that have no necessarv connection with /q/ democratical institutions , though men defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissively as they defer to princes . Aitliough trutlis are not smotliered altogether in democracies , they are often temporarily abandoned under this malign influence , unless there is a powerful motive to sustain them at the moment . While we see in our own democracy this manifest disposition to defer to the wrong , in matters that are not properly subject to the common sentiment , in deference to the popular will of the hour , there is a singular boldness in the use of personalities , as if men avenged themselves for the restraints of the one case by a licentiousness that is without hazard . The base feelings of detraction and envy have more room for exhibition , and perhaps a stronger incentive in a democracy , than in oth r forms of government , in which the people get accustomed to personal deference by the artificial distinctions of the institutions . This is the reason that men become impatient of all superiority in a democracy , and manifest a wish to prefer those who affect a deference to the publick , rather than those who are worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes of bodies of men . It influences our conduct and warps our judgment , in politics , religion , habits , tastes and opinions . We confide in one statesman and oppose another , as often from unfounded antipathies , as from reason ; religion is tainted with uncharitableness and hostilities , without examination ; usages are con-/z/ temned ; tastes ridiculed , and we decide wrong , from the practice of submitting to a preconceived and an unfounded prejudice , the most active and the most pernicious of all the hostile agents of the human mind . The migrator ' propensities of the American people , and the manner in which the country has been settled by immigrants from all parts of the christian world , have an effect in diminishing prejudices of a particular kind , though , in other respects , few nations are more bigotted or provincial in their notions . Innovations on the usages connected with the arts of life are made here with less dificulty than common , reason , interest and enterprise proving too strong for prejudice ; but in morals , habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , than this . America owes most of its social prejudices to the exaggerated religious opinions of the different sects which were so instrumental in establishing the colonies . The quakers , or friends , proscribed the delightful and elevated accomplishment of music , as , indeed , did the puritans , with the exception of psalmody . The latter confined marriage ceremonies to the magistrates , lest rehgion should be brought into disrepute ! Most of those innocent recreations which help the charities , and serve to meliorate manners , were also forbidden , until an unnatural and monastic austerity , with a caustic habit of censoriousness , got to be considered as the only outward signs of that religious hope , which is so peculiarly adapted to render us joyous and benevolent . False and extravagant notions on the subject of manners , never fail to injure a sound morality , by mistaking the shadow for the substance . Positive vice is known by all , for happily , conscience and revelation have made us acquainted with the laws of virtue , but it is as indiscreet unnecessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to expose ourselves to temptations that experience has shown we are unable to resist . The most obvious American prejudices , connected with morality , are the notions that prevail on the subject of mispending- time . That time may be mispent is undeniable , and few are they who ought not to reproach themselves with this neglect , but the human mind needs relaxation and amusement , as well as the human body . These are to be sought in the different expedients of classes , each finding the most satisfaction in those indulgences that conform the nearest to their respective tastes . It is the proper duty of the legislator to endeavor to elevate these tastes , and not to prevent their indulgence . Those nations in which the cord of moral discipline , according to the dogmas of fanatics , has been drawn the tightest , usually exhibit the gravest scenes of depravity , on the part of those who break loose from restraints so ill judged and unnatural . On the other hand , the lower classes of society , in nations where amusements are tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that denote cultivation and refinement . Thus do we find in catholic countries , that the men who in protestant nations , would pass their leLsure in the coarsest indulgences , frequent operas and theatrical representations , classes of amusements which , well conducted , may be made powerful auxiliaries of virtue , and which generally have a tendency to improve the tastes . It is to be remarked that these exhibitions themselves are usually less gross , and more intellectual in catholic , than in protestant countries , a result of this improvement in manners . The condition of this country is peculiar , and requires greater exertions than common , in extricating the mind from prejudices . The intimate connexion /z/ between popular opinion and positive law is one reason , since under a union so close there is danger that the latter may be colored by motives that have no sufficient foundation in justice . It is vain to boast of liberty , if the ordinances of society are to receive the impression of sectarianism , or of a provincial and narrow morality . Another motive peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mixed character of the population . Natives of different sections of the United States , and of various parts of Europe are brought in close contact , and without a disposition to bear with each other 's habits , association becomes unpleasant , and enmities are engendered . The main result is to liberalize the mind , beyond a question , yet we see neighborhoods , in which oppressive intolerance is manifested by the greater number , for the time being , to the habits of the less . This is a sore grievance , more especially , when , as is quite frequently the case , the minority happen to be in possession of usages that mark the highest stage of civilization . It ought never to be forgotten , therefore , that every citizen is entitled to indulge without comment , or persecution , in all his customs and practices that are lawful and moral . Neither is morality to be regulated by the prejudices of sects , or social classes , but it is to be left strictly to the control of the laws , divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice , and prejudice of a local origin too , more imperious than the institutions . The justice , not to say necessity of these liberal concessions , is rendered more apparent when we remember that the parties meet as emigrants on what may be termed neutral territory , for it would be the height of presumption for the native of New York , for instance , to insist on his own peculiar customs , customs that other portions of the country perhaps /q/ repudiate , within the territory of New England , in opposition not only to the wishes of many of their brother emigrants , but to tliose of the natives themselvcg. ms /z/ Station may be divided into that which is poHtical , or pubhck , and that which is social , or private . In monarchies and aristocracies the two are found united , sincf the higher classes , as a matter of course , monopolize all the offices of consideration ; but , in democracies , there is not , nor is it proper that there should be , any intimate connexion between them . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office , and , in a democracy , must embrace men of very different degrees of leisure , refinement , liabits and knowledge . This is characteristick of the institutions , which , under a popular government , confer on political station more power than rank , since the latter is expressly avoided in this system . Social station is that which one possesses in the ordinary associations , and is dependent on birth , education , personal qualities , property , tastes , habits , and , in some instances , on caprice , or fashion . Although the latter undeniably issomeiimes admitted to control social station , it generally depends , however , on the other considerations named . Social station , in the main , is a consequence of property . So long as there is civilization there must be the rights of property , and so long as there are the ; che righfs of property , their obvious consequences /z/ must follow . All that democracies legitimately attempt is to prevent the advantages which accompany social station from accumulating rights that do not properly belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shall have no factitious political aids . They who have reasoned ignorantly , or who have aimed at effecting their personal ends by flattering the popular feeling , have boldly affirmed that " one man is as good as another ; " a maxim that is true in neither nature , revealed morals , nor political theory . That one man is not as good as another in natural qualities , is proved on the testimony of our senses . One man is stronger than another ; he is handsomer , taller , swifter , wiser , or braver , than all his fellows . In short , the physical and moral qualities are unequally distributed , and , as a necessary consequence , in none of them , can one man be justly said to be as good as another . Perhaps no two human beings can be found so precisely equal in every thing , that one shall not be pronounced the superior of the other ; which , of course , establishes the fact that there is no natural equality . The advocates of exclusive political privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made differences between men , those institutions which create political orders , are no more than carrying out the great designs of providence . The error of their argument is in supposing it a confirmation of the designs of nature to attempt to supplant her , for , while the latter has rendered men unequal , it is not from male to male , according to the order of primogeniture , as is usually established by human ordinances . In order not to interfere with the inequality of nature , her laws must be left to their own operations , which is just what is done in democracies , after a proper attention has been paid to the peace of /z/ society , by protecting the weak against the strong . That one man is not deemed as good as another in the grand moral system of providence , is revealed to us in Holy Writ , by the scheme of future rewards and punishments , as well as by the whole history of those whom God has favored in this world , for their piety , or punislied for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are frail ; but , as compared with each other , we are throughout the whole of sacred history made to see , that , in a moral sense , one man is not as good as another . The evil doer is punished , while they who are distinguished for their qualities and acts , are iiltended to be preferred . The absK ) lute moral and physical equality that are inferred by the maxim , that " one man is as good as another , " would at once do away with the elections , since a lottery would be both simpler , easier and cheaper than the present mode of selecting representatives . Men , in such a case , would draw lots for office , as they are now drawn for juries . Choice supposes a preference , and preference inequality of merit , or of fitness . We are then to discard all visionary theories on this head , and look at things as they are . All that the most popular institutions attempt , is to prohibit that one race of men shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , which would be defeating the intentions of providence , creating a superiority that exists in neither physical nor moral nature , and substituting apolitical scheme for the will of God and the force of things . As a principle , one man is as good as another in rights . Such is the extent of the most liberal institutions of this country , and this provision is not general . The slave is not as good as his owner , even in rights . But in those states where slavery does not exist , all men have essentially the same rights , an equality , 80 ox STATION . which , so far from estabhshing that " one man is as good as another , " in a social sense , is the very means ot producing the inequahty of condition that actually exists . By possessing the same rights to exercise their respective faculties , the active and frugal become more wealthy than the idle and dissolute ; the wise and gifted more trusted than the silly and ignorant ; the polished and refined more respected and sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , birth is a principal source of social distinction , society being divided into castes , the noble having an hereditary claim to be the superior of the plebeian . This is an unwise and an arbitrary distinction that has led to most of the social diseases of the old world , and from which America is happily exempt . But great care must be had in construing the principles which have led to this great change , for America is the first important country of modern times , in which such positive distinctions have been destroyed . Still some legal differences , and more social advantages , are produced by birth , even in America . The child inherits the property , and a portion of the consideration of the parent . Without the first of these privileges , men would not exert themselves to acquire more property than vt'ould suffice for their own personal necessities , parental affection beinof one of the most powerful incentives to industry . Without such an inducement , then , it would follow that civilization would become stationary , or , it would recede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being absolutely necessary to impel men to endure the labor and privations that alone can advance it . The hereditary consideration of the child , so long as it is kept within due bounds , by being confined to a natural sentiment , is also productive of good , since /q/ no more active inducement to great and ilorious deeds can otii'er , than the deeply seated interest that man takes in his posterity . All that reason and justice require is effected , by setting bounds to such advantages , in denying hereditary claims to trusts and power ; but evil would be the day , and ominous the symptom , when a people shall deny that any portion of the consideration of the ancestor is due to the descendant . It is as vain to think of altogether setting aside sentiment and the affections , in regulating human affau 's , as to imagine it possible to raise a nature , known to be erring and weak , to the level of perfection . The Deity , in that terrible warning delivered from the mount , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers upon the children , unto the third and fourth generation , " does no more than utter one of those sublime moral truths , which , in conformity with his divine providence , pervade nature . It is merely an announcement of a principle that can not safely be separated from justice , and one tliat is closely connected with all the purest motives and highest aspirations of man . There would be a manifest injustice in visiting the offence of the criminal on his nearest of kin , by making the innocent man participate in the disgrace of a guilty relative , as is notoriously done most , by those most disposed to rail at reflected renown , and not to allow of the same participation in the glory . Both de ) end upon a sentiment deeper than human laws , and have been established for purposes so evidently useful as to require no explanation . All that is demanded of us , is to have a care that this sentiment do not degenerate to a prejudice , and that , in the one case , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , exalt the unworthy beyond the bounds of prudence . /z/ It is a natural consequence of the rights of property and of the sentiment named , that birth should produce some advantages , in a social sense , even in the most democratical of the American communities . The son imbibes a portion of the intelligence , refinement and habits of the father , and he shares in his associations . These must be enumerated as the legitimate advantages of birth , and without invading the private arrangements of families and individuals , and establishing a perfect community of education , they are unavoidable . Men of the same habits , the same degree of cultivation and refinement , the same opinions , naturally associate together , in every class of life . The day laborer will not mingle with the slave ; the skilful mechanic feels his superiority over the mere laborer , claims higher wages and has a pride in his craft ; the man in trade justly fancies that his habits elevate him above the mechanic , so far as social position is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes and sentiments , is superior to all Idle declamation on these points , does not impair the force of things , and life is a series of facts . These inequahties of condition , of manners , of mental cultivation must exist , unless it be intended to reduce all to a common level of ignorance and vulgarity , which would be virtually to return to a condition of barbarism . The result of these undeniable facts , is the inequalities of social station , in America , as elsewhere , though it is an inequality that exists without any more arbitrary distinctions than are indispensably connected with the maintenance of civilization . In a social sense , there are orders here , as in all other countries , but the classes run into each other more easily , the lines of separation are less strongly drawn , and their shadows are more intimately blended . /q/ This social inequality of America is an unavoidable result of the institutions , though nowhere proclaimed in them , the different constitutions maintaining a profound silence on the subject , they who framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilized society , as breathing is a vital function of animal life . mn ON THE BtJTIES OF STATION . The duties of station are divided into those of political or public station , and those of social , or private station . They are not necessarily connected , and shall be considered separately . /z/ By the duties of publick station , we understand those of the private citizen , as well as those of the citizen who fills a publick trust . The first lie at the root of the social compact , and are entitled to be first enumerated . On the manner in which the publick duties of the private citizen are discharged , in a really free government , depend the results of the institutions . If the citizen is careless of his duties , regardless of his rights , and indifferent to the common weal , it is not difficult to foresee the triumph of abuses , peculation and frauds . It is as unreasonable to suppose that the private servant who is not overlooked , will be faithful to his master , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be true to his trusts . In both cases /z/ a Steady , reasoning , but vigilant superintendance is necessary to the good of all concerned ; to the agent by removing the temptation to err , and to the principal by securing an active attention to his interests . The American citizens are possessed of the highest political privileges that can fall to the lot of the body of any community ; that of self-government . On the discreet use of this great power , depends the true character of the institutions . It is , consequently , an imperious duty of every elector to take care and employ none but the honest and intelligent , in situations of high trust . Every position in life has its peculiar dangers , men erring more from an inability to resist temptation , than from any morbid inward impulses to do wrong without an inducement . The peculiar danger of a democracy , arises from the arts of demagogues . It is a safe rule , the safest of all , to confide only in those men for publick trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . There is no quality that more entirely pervades the moral system than probity . We ofi ; en err on certain points , each man having a besetting sin , but honesty colors a whole character . He who in private is honest , frank , above hypocricy and doubledealing , will carry those qualities with him into publick , and may be confided in ; while he who is the reverse , is , inherently , a knave . The elector who gives his vote for one whom he is persuaded on good grounds is dishonest in his motives , abuses the most sacred of his pubhc duties . It is true , that party violence , personal malice and love of gossip , frequently cause upright men to be distrusted , and that great care is necessary to guard against slander , the commonest of human crimes , and a besetting vice of a democracy ; but the connection between the constituent and the representative is usually so close , /q/ that the former , by resorting to proper means , can commonly Icarn the trutli . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wlio gives his vote , on any grounds , party or personal , to an unworthy candidate , violates a sacred publick duty , and is unfit to be a freeman . Obedience to the laws , and a sacred regard to the rights of others , are imperative publick duties of the citizen . As he is a " law-maker , " he should not be a * ' law-breaker , " for he ought to be conscious that every departure from the established ordinances of society is an infraction of his rights . His power can only be maintained by the supremacy of the laws , as in monarchies , the authority of the king is asserted by obedience to his orders . The citizen in lending a cheerful assistance to the ministers of the law , on all occasions , is merely helping to maintain his own power . This feature in particular , distinguishes the citizen from the subject . The one rules , the other is ruled ; one has a voice in framing the ordinances , and can be heard in his ctforts to repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Democracies there is a besetting disposition to make publick opinion stronger than the law . This is the particular form in which tyranny exhibits itself in a popular goverinnent ; for wherever there is power , there will be found a disposition to abuse it . Whoever opposes the interests , or wishes of the publick , however right in principle , or justifiable by circumstances. , fiTids little sympathy ; for , in a democracy , resisting the wishes of the many , is resisting the sovereign , in his caprices . Every good citizen is bound to separate this influence of his private feelings from his publick duties , and to take heed that , while pretending to be struggling for liberty , because contending for the advantage of the greatest number , he is not helping /z/ despotism . The most insinuating and dangeroirs form in which oppression can overshadow a nity is that of popular sway . All the safeguards of hberty , in a democracy , have this in view , as , in monarchies , they are erected against the power of the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are their own worst enemies , " while false as a governing maxim , contains some truth . It is false to say that a people left to govern themselves , would oppress themselves , as monarchs and aristocrats , throughout all time , are known to oppress the ruled , but it is true to say , that the peculiar sins of a democracy must be sought for in the democratical character of the institutions . To pretend otherwise , would be to insist on perfection ; for , in a state of society in which there is neither prince nor aristocrats , there must be faultlessness , or errors of a democratic origin , and of a democratic origin only . It is , therefore , a publick duty of the citizen to guard against all excesses of popular power , whether inflicted by mere opinion , or under the forms of law . In all his publick acts , he should watch himself , as under a government of another sort he would watch his rulers ; or as vigilantly as he watches the servants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last resort , it is not so absolutely an irresponsible power as it first seems , coming from God , and to be wielded on those convictions of right which God has implanted in our breasts , that we may know good from evil . /z/ The private duties of the citizen , as connected with social station , are founded chiefly on the relations between man and man , though others may be referred to a higher source , being- derived directly from the relations between the creature and his creator . A regard for the duties of private station , are indispensable to order , and to the intercourse between different members of society . So important have they always been deemed , that the inspired writers , from the Saviour through the greatest of his apostles down , have deemed them worthy of being placed in congpicious characters , in their code of morals . The first direct mandates of God , as delivered on Mount Sinai , were to impress the Jews with a sense of their duties to their Heavenly Father ; the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of honor and obedience to their parents . Tlie fifth commandment , then , may be said to contain the first of our social duties . It is strictly one of station , for it enforces the obligation of the child to its parents . Nor is this all ; the entire extent of the family relations are included in principle , since it can not be supposed that those who precede our immediate parents , are excluded from the general deference tliat we owe to the greater experience , the love , and the care of our predecessors /z/ It is apparent throughout the code of cliristian morals , that a perfect reciprocity between the duties of social station is nowhere inferred . " Nevertheless , " says St. Paul , " let every one of you in particular , so love his wife , even as himself ; and the wife sec that she reverence her husband . " There is an obligation of deference imposed on the wife , that is not imposed on the husband . " Servants be obedient to them that are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in singleness of heart , as unto Christ . " By these , and many similar mandates , we perceive that the private duties of station are constantly recognized , and commanded , by the apostles , as well as by the Saviour . The old abuses of power , with the attendant reaction , have unsettled the publickmind , in many essential particulars , on this important point . Interested men have lent their aid to mislead the credulous and vain , until a confusion in the relations between the different members of society has arisen , that must , more or less , lead to confusion in society itself . After the direct family relations , come the private duties that are generally connected with station , as between master and servant . Whoever employs , with the right to command , is a master ; and , whoever serves , with an obligation to obey , a servant . These are the broad signification of the two words , and , in this sense they are now used . It is an imperative obligation on those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to use a due consideration in issuing their orders . The greater the duty of those , whose part it is to obey , to comply with all just and reasonable requisitions , or , in other words , to conform to the terms of their service , the greater is the duty of the master to see that he does not exact more than propriety will warrant . On the /q/ - ftthcr hand , they who serve owe a respectful and decorous obedience , sliowinij by their manner as well by their acts , tliey understand that witliout order and deference , the different social relations can never be suitably tilled . So far from republican institutions makin any difference in this respect , in favor of him who serves , they increase the moral duty to be respectful and assiduous , since service in such a case , is not the result of political causes , but a matter of convention , or bargain . The relations between the master and the domestic servant , are peculiar , and are capable of being made of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man or woman , fills a more honorable , because a much more confidential station , than the lower mechanic , or farm laborer . The domestics are intrusted with the care of the children of tliose they serve , have necessarily charge of much valuable property , and are , in a manner , intrusted with the secrets of the domestic economy . The upper servants of a considerable and well l ) red family , or of those who are accustomed to the station they fill , and have not been too suddenly elevated by the chances of ik , are often persons of a good education , accustomed to accounts , and , in a measure , familiarized to the usages of polite life , since they see them daily practised before their eyes . Such persons invarial ) ly gain some of the refinement and tone of mind that marks the peculiar condition of their emplovers . Tlie rule of most civilized nations , is for the master to treat the servant as an humble friend . In the more polished countries of Europe , the confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a long service , is commonly considered as an inferior member of the familv. /z/ It is a misfortune of America to admit so many of the dogmas of the country from which she is derived , while living in a state of society so very different . An attempt to treat and consider a domestic , as domestics are treated and considered in England , is unwise , and , in fact , impracticable . The English servant fares worse , in many particulars , than the servant of almost every other nation . France would be a better and a safer model , in this particular , the masters of France being usually much milder and more considerate than those of England , while the servants are altogetlier superior . The French servant is not as cleanly and thorough in his work , as the English servant , a difference in the habits of the country forbidding it ; but he is generally more attached , better informed , more agreeable as a companion , quite as serviceable , the exception mentioned apart , and more faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes ; the female domestics of France , while less tidy in household work than those of England or America , beincT altofrether superior to both , in moral qualities , tastes , general usefulness and knowledge . A beautiful instance of the effect of the duties of social station is before the eyes of the writer , even while he pens this paragraph ; that of an aged woman , who passed her youth in the service of one family , ministering to the wants of three generations , and is now receiving the gratitude which long and patient toil has earned . On the one side is affection , delicacy , and attention to the wants of age ; on the other a love little short of that of a mother 's , softened by the respect that has always marked the life of one in whom a sense of the duties of social station has never been weakened . Nothing still makes this venerable servant more happy , than to " be employed for those whom she has seen ushered into life , whom she first fondled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while these , airain , mindful of her years and increasing infirmities , feel it a source of pleasure to anticipate her little wants , and to increase her comforts . The conditions of master and servant are those of co-relatives , and when they are proi ) erly understood tliey form additional ties to the charities and happiness of life . It is an unhappy effect of the unformed habits of society in this country , and of domestic slavery , that we are so much wanting in this beautiful feature in domestic economy . The social duties of a gentleman are of a high order . The class to which he belongs is the natural repository - of the manners , tastes , tone , and , to a certain extent , of the principles of a country . They who imagine this portion of the community useless , drones who consume without producing , have not studied society , or they have listened to the suggestions of personal envy , instead of consulting history and facts . If the laborer IS indispensable to civilization , so is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his - kill to those arts which raise the polished man above the barbarian . The last brings his knowledge and habits to bear upon industry , and , taking the least favorable view of his claims , the indulgence of his very luxuries encourages the skill that contributes to the comforts of the lowest . Were society to be satisfied with a mere supply of the natural wants , there would be no civilization . The savage condition attains this much . All beyond it , notwithstanding , is so much progress made in the direction of the gentleman , and has been made either at the suffsestions , or bv the encourasfement of those whose means have enabled , and whose tastes have induced them to buy . Knowledge is as necessary to the progress of a people as physical force , for , with ur knowledge , the beasts of burthen who now toil for /z/ man , would soon compel man to toil for them . If the head is necessary to direct the body , so is the head of society , ( the head in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to direct the body of society . Any one may learn the usefulness of a body of enlightened men in a neiohborhood , by tracing their influence on its civilization . Where many such are found , the arts are more advanced , and men learn to see that there are tastes more desirable than those of the mere animal . In such a neighborhood they acquire habits M'hich contribute to their happiness by advancing their intellect , they learn the value of refinement in their intercourse , and obtain juster notions of the nature and of the real extent of their rights . He who would honor learning , and taste , and sentiment , and refinement of every sort , ought to respect its possessors , and , in all things but those which affect rights , defer to their superior advantages . This is the extent of the deference that is due from him who is not a gentleman , to him who is ; but this much is due . On the other hand , the social duties of an American gentleman , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conduct that are of the last importance to the country . One of the first of his obligations is to be a guardian of the liberties of his fellow citizens . It is peculiarly graceful in the American , whom the accidents of life have raised above the mass of the nation , to show himself conscious of his duties in this respect , by asserting at all times the true principles of government , avoiding , equally , the cant of demagogueism with the impracticable theories of visionaries , and the narrow and selfish dogmas of those who would limit power by castes . They who do not see and feel the importance of possessing a class of such men in a community , to give it tone , a high and fer sighted policy , and lofty views in general , can /q/ know little of history , and have not reflected on the inevitable consequences of admitted causes . The danger to the institutions of denying to men of education their proper place in society , is derived from the certainty that no political system can long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right : of a class so powerful . It is as unjust to require that men of refinement and training should defer in their habits and associations to the notions of those who are their inferiors in these particulars , as it is to insist that political power should be the accompaniment of birth . All , who are in the least cultivated , know how irksome and oppressive is the close communion with ignorance and vulgarity , and the attempt to push into the ordinary associations , the principles of ecuality that do and ought to govern states in their political characters , is , virtually , an effort to subvert a just general maxim , by attaching to it impracticable consequences . Whenever the enlightened , wealthy , and spirited of an affluent and great country , seriously conspire to subvert democratical institutions , their leisure , money , intelligence and means of combining , will be found too powerful for the ill-directed and conflicting efforts of the mass . It is therefore , all important , to enlist a portion of this class , at least , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times renders it a dangerous enemy . Liberality is peculiarly the quality of a gentleman . He is liberal in his attainments , opinions , practices and concessions . He asks for himself , no more than he is willing to concede to others . He feels that his superiority is in his attaitnnents , practices and princiciples , which if they are not always moral , are above meannesses , and he has usually no pride in the mere vulgar consequence of wealth . Should he happen to be /z/ well born , ( for birth is by no means indispensable to the character , ) his satisfaction is in being allied to men of the same qualities as himself , and not to a senseless pride in an accident . The vulgar-minded mistake motives that they can not feel ; but he , at least , is capable of distinguishing between things that are false , and the things which make him what he is . An em.inent writer of our own time , has said in substance , that a nation is happy , in which the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble . This was the opinion of a European , who had been accustomed to see the liberal qualities in the exclusive possession of a caste , and who was not accustomed to see the people sufficiently advanced to mingle in affairs of state . Power can not be extended to a caste without caste 's reaping its principal benefit ; but happy , indeed , is the nation , in which , power being the common property , there is sufficient discrimination and justice to admit the intelligent and refined to a just participation of its influence . mn /z/ We live in an age , when the words aristocrat and democrat are much used , without regard to the real significations . An aristocrat is one of a few , who possess the political power of a country ; a democrat , one of the many . The words are also properly applied to those who entertain notions favorable to aristocratical , or democratical forms of government . Such persons are not , necessarily , either aristocrats , or democrats in fact , but merely so in opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an aristocratical bias , and vice versa . To call a man who has the habits and opinions of a gentleman , an aristocrat , from that fact alone , is an abuse of terms , and betrays iinorance of the true principles of o ; overnment , as well as of the world . It must be an equivocal freedom , under which every one is not the master of his own innocent acts and associations , and he is a sneaking democrat , indeed , who will submit to be dictated to , in those habits over which neither law nor morality assumes a right of control . Some men fancy that a democrat can only be one who seeks the level , social , mental and moral , of the majority , a rule that would at once exclude all men of refinement , education and taste from the class . These persons are enemies of democracy , as they at once render it impracticable . They are usually great sticklers for their own associations and habits , too , though unable to comprehend any of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aristocrats in principle , though assuming a contrary pretension ; the ground work of all their feelings and arfjuments being self . Such is not the intention of liberty , whose aim is to leave every man to be the master of his own acts ; denying hereditary honors , it is true , as unjust and unnecessary , but not denying the inevitable consequences of civilization . The law of God is the only rule of conduct , in this , as in other matters . Each man should do as he would be done by . Were the question put to the greatest advocate of indiscriminate association , whether he would submit to have his company and habits dictated to him , he would be one of the first to resist the tyranny ; for they , who are the most rigid in maintaining their own claims , in such matters , are usually the loudest in decrying those whom they fancy to be /z/ better off than themselves . Indeed , it may be taken as a rule in social intercourse , that he who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most conscious of the doubtful position he himself occupies ; thus establishing the very claims he affects to deny , by letting his jealousy of it be seen . Manners , education and refinement , are positive things , and they bring with them innocent tastes which are productive of high enjoyments ; and it is as unjust to deny their possessors their indulgence , as it would be to insist on the less fortunate 's passing the time they would rather devote to athletic amusements , in listening to operas for which they have no relish , sung in a language they do not understand . All that democracy means , is as equal a participation in rights as is practicable ; and to pretend that social equality is a condition of popular institutions , is to assume that the latter are destructive of civilization , for , as nothing is more self-evident than the impossibility of raising all men to the highest standard of tastes and refinement , the alternative M'ould be to reduce the entire community to the lowest . The whole embarrasment on this point exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not themselves possess . We can all perceive the difference between ourselves and our inferiors , but when it comes to a question of the difference between us and our superiors , we fail to appreciate merits of wdiich we have no proper conceptions . In face of this obvious difficulty , there is the safe and just governing rule , already mentioned , or that of permitting every one to be the undisturbed judge of his own habits and associations , so long as they are innocent , and do not impair the rights of others to be equally judges for themselves . It follows , that social intercourse must regulate itself , independently of institutioiis , /q/ with the exception that the latter , while they withokl no natural , bestow no factitious advantages beyond those which are inseparable from the rights of property , and general civilization . In a democracy , men are just as free to aim at the Iiigliest attainable places in society , as to obtain the largest fortunes ; and it would be clearly unworthy of all noble sentiment to say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while that which enlists all the liberal acquirements and elevated sentiments of the race , is denied the democrat . Such an avowal would be at once , a declaration of the inferiority of the system , since nothing but ignorance and vulgarity could be its fruits . The democratic gentleman must differ in many essential particulars , from the aristocratical gentleman , though in their ordinary habits and tastes they are virtually indentical . Their principles vary ; and , to a slight degree , their deportment accordingly . The democrat , recognizing the right of all to participate in power , will be more liberal in bis general sentiments , a quality of superiority in itself ; but , in conceding this much to his fellow man , he will proudly maintain his own independence of vulgar domination , as indispensable to his personal habits . The same principles and manhness that would induce him to depose a royal despot , would induce him to resist a vulgar tyrant . There is no more capital , though more common error , than to suppose him an aristocrat who ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the majority , only , in matters of law , and not in matters of custom . The very object of the institution is the utmost practicable personal liberty , and to affirm the contrary , would be sacrificing the end to the means . /z/ An aristocrat , therefore , is merely one who fortifies his exclusive privileges by positive institutions , and a democrat , one who is wilhng to admit of a free con petition , in all things . To say , however , that the last supposes this competition will lead to nothing , is an assumption that means are employed without any reference to an end . He is the purest democrat who best maintains his rights , and no rights can be dearer to a man of cultivation , than exemptions from unseasonable invasions on his time , by the coarse-minded and ignorant . sm /z/ A demagogue , in the strict signification of the word , is " a leader of the rabble . " It is a Greek compound , that conveys this meaning . In these later times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances of the age . Thus , before the art of printing became known , or cheap publications were placed within the reach of the majority , the mass of all nations might properly enough be termed a rabble , when assembled in bodies . In nations in which attention is paid to education , this reproach is gradually becoming unjust , though a body of Americans , even , collected under what is popularly termed an " excitement , " losing sight of that reason and respect for their own deliberately framed ordinances , which alone distinguish them from the masses of other people , is neither more nor less than a rabble . Men properly derive their designations from their acts , and not from their professions . /q/ The peculiar office of a demogogue is to advance his own interests , by affecting a deep devotion to the interests of the people . Sometimes the object is to indulge malignancy , unprincipled and selfish men submitting but to two governing motives , that of doing good to themselves , and that of doing harm to others . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of the community possessing the power , the master he pretends to serve is best able to reward his efforts . As it is all important to distinguish between those who labor in behalf of the people on the general account , and those who labor in behalf of the people on their own account , some of the rules by which each may be known shall be pointed out . The motive of the demagogue may usually be detected in his conduct . The man who is constantly teUing the people that they are unerring in judgment , and that they have all power , is a demagogue . JBodies of men being composed of individuals , can no more be raised above the commission of error , than individuals themselves , and , in many situations , they are more likely to err , from self-excitement and the division of responsibility . The power of the people is limited by the fundamental laws , or the constitution , the rights and opinions of the minority , in all but those cases in which a decision becomes indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the majority ; else would a democracy be , indeed , what its enemies term it , the worst species of tyranny . In this instance , the people are flattered , in order to be led ; as in kingdoms , the prince is blinded to his own defects , in order to extract favor from him . The demagogue always puts the people before the constitution and the laws , in face of the obvious truth that the people have placed the constitution and the jaws before themselves . /z/ The local demagogue does not distinguish between the whole people and a part of the people , and is apt to betray his want of principles by contending for fancied , or assumed rights , in favor of a county , or a town , though the act is obviously opposed to the will of the nation . This is a test that the most often betrays the demagogue , for while loudest in proclaiming his devotion to the majority , he is , in truth , opposing the will of the entire people , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually sly , a detractor of others , a professor of humility and disinterestedness , a great stickler for equality as respects all above him , a man who acts in corners , and avoids open and manly expositions of his course , calls blackguards gentlemen , and gentlemen folks , appeals to passions and prejudices rather than to reason , and is in all respects , a man of intrigue and deception , of sly cunning and management , instead of manifesting the frank , fearless qualities of the democracy he so prodigally professes . The man who maintains the rights of the people on pure grounds , may be distinguished from the demagogue by the reverse of all these qualities . He does not flatter the people , even while he defends them , for he knows that flattery is a corrupting and dangerous poison . Having nothing to conceal , he is frank and fearless , as are aJI men with the consciousness of right motives . He oftener chides than commends , for power needs reproof and can dispense with praise . He who would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demagogue in a democracy . The elements are the same , though , brought into action under different circumstances , ordinary observers are apt to fancy them the extremes of opposite moral castes . Travellers have often remarked , that , Americans , who /q/ have made themselves conspicuous abroad for their adulation of rank and power , have become zealous advocates of popular suj ) remacy , on returnino- home . Several men of this stamp are , at this moment , in conspicuous political stations in the , having succeeded by the commonest arts of courti* rs . There is a larire class of political men in this country , who , while they scarcely mrit the opprobium of being termed demagoirues , are not properly exempt from the imputation of falling into some of their most dangerous vices . These are they , whose habits , and tastes , and better opinions , indeed , are all at variance M'ith vulgar errors and vulgar practices , but , who imagine it a necessary evil in a democracy to defer to prejudices , and ignorance , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction may be given to the publick mind . Such men deceive themselves , in the first place , as to their own motives , which are rather their private advancement than the publick good , and , admitting the motives to be pure , they err greatly both in their mode of construing the system under which they live , and in the general principles of correcting evil and of producing good . As the greatest enemy of truth is falsehood , so is the most potent master of falsehood , truth . These qualities are correlatives ; that Avhich is not true , being false ; and that which is not false , being true . It follows , as a pervading rule of morals , that the advancement of one is the surest means of defeating the other . All good men desire the truth , and , on all publick occasions on which it is necessary to act at all , the truth would be the most certain , efficient , and durable agency in defeating falsehoods , whether of prejudices , reports , or principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ground-work , of all institutions that claim to be founded in justice , /z/ is this high quaHtj . Temporary convenience , and selfish considerations , beyond a doubt , are both favored by sometimes closing the eyes to the severity of truth , but in nothing is the sublime admonition of God in his commandments , where he tells us that he " will visit the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth generations of their children , " more impressively verified , than in the inevitable punishments that await every sacrifice of truth . Most of the political men of the day belong to this class of doubtful moralists , who , mistaking a healthful rule , which admonishes us that even truth ought not to be too offensively urged , in their desire to be moderate , lend themselves to the side of error . The ingenuity of sophisms , and the audacity of falsehoods receive great support from this mistaken alliance , since a firm union of all the intelligent of a country , in the cause of plain and obvious truths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now enlisted in the support of the latter , following to the right side , as a matter of course , in the train of combined knowledge . This is the mode in which opinions rooted in the wrong have been gradually eradicated , by the process of time , but which would yield faster , were it not for the latitude and delusion that selfishness imposes on men of this class , who flatter themselves with soothing a sore that they are actually irritating . The consequence of this mistaken forbearance , is to substitute a new set of errors , for those which it has already taken ages to get rid of . On the subject of government and society , it is a misfortune that this country is filled with those who take the opposite extremes , the one side clinging to prejudices that were founded in the abuses of the feudal timesj and the , other to the exaggerations of impracticable /q/ theories . That the strurjgle is not fiercer , is probably owing to the overwhelmiiio- numbers of the latter class , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrinaire is the converse of the American demag-ogue , and , in his way , is scarcely less injurious to the publick . He is as much a visionary on one side , as the extreme theoretical democrat is a visionary on the other . The first deals in poetry , the last in cant . The first affirms a disinterestedness and purity in education and manners , when exposed to the corruption of power , that all experience refutes ; and the last an iiifalJibility in majorities that God himself iias denied . These opposing classes produce the efi'ect of all counter-acting forces , resistance , and they provoke each other 's excesses . In the doctrinaire or theorist of the old school , we see men clinging to opinions that are purely the issue of arbitrary facts , ages after the facts themselves have ceased to exist , confounding cause with effect ; and , in the deraagoine , or his tool , the impracticable democrat , one who permits envy , jealousy , opposition , selfishness , and the unconsciousness of his own inferiority and demerits , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of justice , to exclude the sight of positive things , and to cause him to deny the legitimate consequences of the very laws of which he professes to be proud . This is the dupe who affirms that , " one man is as good as another . " These extremes lead to the usual inconsistencies and follies . Thus do we see men , who sigh for titles and factitious and false distinctions , so little conscious of truth , as to shrink from asserting the real distinctions of their social station , or those , they actually and undeniably possess ; as if nature ever intended a man for an aristocrat , who has not the manhood to mainlain his just rights j and those , again , who cant of /z/ equality and general privileges , while they stubbomly refuse to permit others to enjoy in peace a single fancied indulgence or taste , unless taken in their company , although nature , education and habits have all unfitted them to participate , and their presence would be sure to defeat what they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerate , and modest , and just-minded man , of whatever social class , will view all this differently . In asserting his own rights , he respects those of others ; in indulging his own tastes , he is wilHng to admit there may be superior ; in pursuing his own course , in his own manner , he knows his neighbor has an equal right to do the same ; and , most of all , is he impressed with the great , moral truths , that flatterers are inherently miscreants , that fallacies never fail to bring their punishments , and that the empire of God is reason . Wi O REPKESExlTTATIOIV . Representation is the vital principle of all free governments , with the exception of those which rule over unusually small territories . A pure democracy infers institutions under which the people , in primary assemblies , enact their own laws ; a system of which the good is questionable under any circumstances , and which is evidently impracticable in large communities . The governments of the several states of this Union , with some slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government receives its rdistinctive character from the states , themselves , the /q/ latter is necessarily a confederated representative democracy . Representation , therefore , lies at the root of the entire American system . Conflicting opinions exist on the subject of the relations between the representative and his constituent , impracticable notions and contradictory errors being equally maintained . These notions may be divided into those of two schools , equally ultra , one taking- its rise in the sophisms and mystifications of English politics , the otlier arising from the disposition of men to obtain their objects , by flattering popular power . The subject is grave , and all important to a country like this . Willi the exception of a few popular boroughs , and a county or two , England has no free representation . In most of the counties , even , the control of the elections is in the hands of the great land-holders ; in far the larger number of the boroughs , the power of the landlords is so great , that they name the successful candidate , as openly as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contested elections , even , the struggle is really between the power of two or more great families , and not between bodies of the electors , seats for boroughs being bought and sold like any other commodity . Under such circumstances , it is quite apparent that instructions from a constituency , that is itself instructed whom to return , would be a useless mockery . We are not to look at England , therefore , for principles on this subject , the fundamental systems of the two countries being so dissimilar ; one giving power to property , the other to numbers . There is no doubt it is the intention of the American system , that the will of the constitutional majorities , to a certain extent , should be properly regarded by the representative ; and that when the latter , who has i06 ON REPRESENTATION . been elected with the express understanding that he is to support a particular measure , or a particular set of principles , sees reason to change his opinion , he would act most in conformity with the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts are made subject to certain predominant moral obligations , which are supposed to emanate from Divine Truth . Thus , a representative , conscientiously entertaining convictions in its favour , may give a pledge to support a particular measure , as a condition of his election , there being no sufficient reason to doubt that the doctrine of specific pledges is sound , the people having a free option to exact them , and the candidate as free an option to withhold them , as each may see fit . These pledges , however , must be in conformity with the spirit and letter of the constitution , and not opposed to good morals ; the first being a governing condition of the social compact , and the last a controlling principle of human actions . But , while this much is admitted in favor of the power of the constituency , great care must be had not to extend it too far . In the first place , no constituency has a right to violate the honest convictions of a renresentative . These are a matter of conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve conscientious scruples , the power of the representative is full and absolute . This freedom of conscience is an implied obligation of the compact between the parties ; therefore , in a case of importance , that admits of moral doubts , and one in which the will of the constituency is unequivocally expressed , it becomes the representative to return the trust , andtliis , too , in season , circumstances allowing , to permit the other party to be represented in the matter , agreeably to its own opinions . As there are so many governing circumstances of great delicacy , in /q/ all such cases , it is evident they must be rare , and that the rule exists as an exception , rather than as one of familiar practice . Great care must be always taken to see that the wishes of the constituency are actually consulted , before the American representative is bound , morally even , to respect their will ; for there is no pretence that the oblijijation to reofard the wishes of his constituents is more than implied , under any circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving him the entire master of his own just convictions . The instant a citizen is elected he becomes the representative of the minority as well as of the majority , and to create any of the implied responsibility that has been named , the opinion of the first , so far as their numbers go , is just as much entitled to respect , as the opinion of the last . Tiie power to decide , in cases of elections , is given to the majority only from necessity , and as the safest practicable general rule that can be used , but , it is by no means the intention of the institutions to disfranchise all those who prefer another to the successful candidate . The choice depends on a hundred considerations that are quite independent of measures , men judging differently from each other , in matters of character . Any other rule than this might be made the means of putting the government in the hands of the minority , as the following case will show . A , is elected to congress , by a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine hundred and ninetynine . He has , consequently , two thousand constituents , supposing all to have voted . The majority meet to instruct their representative , and the instructions are carried by a vote of five hundred and one to five hundred . If these instructions are to be received as binding , the government , so far as the particular measure is concerned , may be in the hands of five /z/ hundred and one electors , as opposed to fourteen hundred and ninety-nine . This case may be modified , by all the changes incidental to numbers . To assume that majorities of caucuses , or of ex parte collections of electors , have aright to instruct , is to pretend thai the government is a government of party , and not a government of the people . This notion can not honestly be maintained for an instant . Recommendations emanating from such a source may be entitled to a respectful consideration , but not more so than a counter-recommendation from an opposing party . In all such cases , the intention of the representative system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as judges at law are intended to settle questions of law , both being sworn to act on the recognized principles that control society . In the cases that plainly invade the constitution , the constituents having no power tliemselves , can dictate none to their representative . Both parties are bound equally to respect that instrument , and neither can evade the obligation , by any direct , or indirect means . This rule covers m.uch of the disputed ground , for they who read the constitution with an honest desire to understand it , can have little difficulty in comprehending most of its important provisions , and no one can claim a right to impose sophistry and selfishness on another , as reason and justice . As doubtful cases may certainly arise under the constitution , the right of the constituency to influence the representative in instances of that sort , may plausibly " be supposed to be greater than in those of constructions plainly proceedincr from the excitement and schemes of partisans . StiJl the power of the constituency to interfere , after an election beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to particular /q/ respect from their particular representative , is very questionable . The constitution contains the paramount laws of society . These laws are unchangeable , except as they are altered agreeably to prescribed forms , and until thus altered , no evasion of them is admissible . In the necessity of thing 's , every public functionary must be permitted to intei-pret this instrument for himself , subject to the liabilities and responsibilities , official and othersvise , of his station . In this respect , the legislator , by the nature of his trust , havingfull povrer to enact and to repeal , knows no other control than his conscience . The expressed compact between the representative and the constituent , gives to the first an absolute discretionary power , subject to this great rule , and , by the implied , no instructions can ever weaken this high obligation , since it is clearly a governing condition of the bargain between them . A judge is representative , in a government like this , in a general sense , since he acts for and through the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can instruct the courts how to interpret the constitution , although they can alter it , nor should it be contended that the constituency can instruct a representative how to interpret the constitution , when it involves a matter of conscience . The remedy , in the one case , is to alter the constitution ; and in the other , to send a new representative , with pledges given previously to the election , to interpret the constitution according to the conceptions of the right , entertained by the constituency . Of course such a pledge ought not to be given , unless given conscientiously . The constitution specifically guaranties the right of the citizens to assemble and petition congress , a provision that would be a mockery , did that instrument suppose a right to instructs /z/ It has been said that the representative , has the same relations to the minority , as to the majority of his constituents , when elected . In a broader and equally binding sense , he has the same relations to the entire country , as to his own immediate constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local interests , without a regard to justice or to general principles . If this be true , and it must be true , or all the fundamental governing rules of the social compact become of no account , the constituents of a particular representative can have no right even to request , much less to instruct him to support their local interests at the expence of others , and least of all can they have a right to violate the constitution , in order to do so . In this particular , the question has been involved in the same sophisms , and , to a degree , is to be settled by the same principles , as those which appertain to the relations between the accused and his legal counsel . Some latitudinarians in morals have contended that the legal adviser of an accused has a right to do in his defence , whatever the accused himself would do ; that he is an attorney , with full powers to execute all that the other 's feelings , interests and passions might dictate . This is monstrous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say nothing of the laws . The counsel , has a right to do no more than his client has a right to do , nor can the constituent , in any case , have a right to instruct his representative to do that which he has no right , in a moral or legal sense , to do himself , even admitting the general doctrine of instruction to be sound . Although the principle that the representative chosen by a few , becomes the representative of all , is sound as a general principle , it is not an unqualified rule any where , and still less so in the federal govern- ON REPRESENTATION . Ill inent . The constitution requires that the representative should reside in the state from which he is sent , expressly to identify him with its particular interests , and in order to prevent thfit concentration which exists in other countries . Half the French deputies are from Paris , and a large portion of the English members of parliament are virtually from the capital . Their systems are peculiarly systems of concentration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be questioned , therefore , how far the American representative ought to sacrifice the good of his particular state , in order to achieve the general good . Cases may certainly occur , in which the sacrifice ought to be made , but the union of these states is founded on an express compromise , and it is not its intention to reach a benefit , however considerable , by extorting undue sacrifices from particular members of the confederacy . All cases to the contrary should be clear , and the necessary relations between the good and evil , beyond cavil . In identified governments , the principle that a few shall be sacrificed to the general good , must always , in a greater or less degree , prevail ; but it is not the intention of the American compact that any one state should ruin itself , or even do itself any great and irreparable injury , that the rest of the Union should become more prosperous . In this sense , then , the member of congress represents his immediate constituents , or ) erhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he has no right to further its interests at the expense of the interests of other states , he is not called on to sacrifice them for the benefit of the sistere of the Union . This is one of the cases in which the doctrines of English representation do not apply to the American system . The difference arises from the circumstance that , in the one case , govern- /z/ merit is a compact between persons ; in the other , a compact between states . In a government like that of the United States , the executive is as much representative as the legislature . Will it therefore be pretended that the president is also bound to respect the instructions of the people ? Is he to appoint those whom the people will , remove those whom the people denounce , pardon those whom the people order , and approve of such bills as the people dictate ? Is he to command the army and navy , see that the laws are executed , and conduct the negotiations of the country according to the opinions and intimations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own conceptions of duty , and the light of his own knowledge and experience 1 If the representative is bound to obey the will of his constituents , all this must the president do , or prove false to the institutions . As the commander in chief , his own soldiers would have a right to instruct him in the mode of performing his military functions , as , indeed , they would have a right to tell congress , when and against whom to declare war ! If the representative of the executive functions is thus bound to respect instructions , a majority of the people might virtually repeal an unpopular law , by instructing the president not to see it enforced , and thus destroy the rights of third parties . Such a doctrine would throw society into confusion , leave nothing stable , and set up a dangerous and irresponsible power , that would be stronger than the institutions themselves . A principle reason for sending representatives to congress , is the impossibility of masses of men meetingto legislate with due knowledge and deliberation , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained by any expedient of law , method /q/ and arrangement , are to be expected from extra-legal , voluntary and immcthodical means . We ought not , consequently , to give an authority to those opinions of the people informally expressed , that the constitution would seem to show can not be rendered available , when formally expressed . The term representative implies full power to act , or , at least , full power to act under the limitations that environ the trust . A delegate is less gifted with authority , and is understood to act under instructions . These are ancient distinctions , and , existing as they did at the time the constitution was framed , they are entitled to respect , as explaining its intention . A representative is a substitute ; a delegate an ambassador . It is , moreover , an admission of imbecility to suppose that the institutions infer a right to instruct , when no such right is expressed . All the machinery of the state is opposed to it , while in other countries , as in Switzerland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state is framed to meet such an end . Upon the whole , when we take into consideration the received signification of terms , as they were understood when the constitution was framed ; the legal effect of legislative acts , which are binding , though the entire constituency instruct to the contrary ; the omission in the constitution to point out any legal means of instructing , and the practical difficulties in obtaining instructions that shall be above the reproach of being ex parte and insufficient ; the permanent obligations of the constitution ; the doubt and indecision instructions would introduce into a government , that was expressly framed to obviate these weaknesses ; the dangers that constantly arise from the activity of the designing , and the supinenessof the well-meaning ; the want of unity , and of fixed principles , it might /z/ give to a legislation that controls peace and war , and the foreign relations ; as well as the exposure to forign influence directly exercised over irresponsible men ; and the general character of deliberation and examination which is secured to congress , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself ; we are led to conclude that the doctrine of instruction is unconstitutional , whether as applied to the senate , or to the house of representatives , and that so far from being a doctrine that is adapted to secure the domination of real majorities , it is rather an invention of intriguing politicians to effect their own wishes , in opposition to those of the nation . Exceptions may occur , but governing principles are to be settled on general rules , and by general effects . It being established that the representative is placed beyond the control of instructions , as beyond doubt is , at least , his legal position , the importance of making careful selections , becomes apparent . There is no safer rule in selecting a representative , than that already named ; or that of choosing the man for public confidence , who may be relied on , in private . Most of all is the time-server and demagogue to be avoided , for such a man is certain to use power as an instrument of his private good . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the representative is the obliged party . The man who faithfully does his duty in congress , is a servant to whom a difficult task is assigned , with a very insufficient compensation ; and such a man should always be selected with care , and rewarded with a frank gratitude . It is a painful admission , extorted by truth , that in human institutions , the intention is never long respected . Representation may not be in practice , what it was intended for , in theory , but , still , it might be drawn much nearer to what it ought to be , than it /z/ actually is . If party be not necessary to this government as a good , it is , perhaps , unnvoidable as an evil . But no elector should ever submit himself so implicitly to party as to support a man whose private acts prove him to be unfit for a public trust . The basis of the representative system is character , and without character , no man should be confided in . In discriminating between candidates , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sheep 's clothing , " in character , as well as in other things . Personal vanity induces ordinary men to confide most in those who most flatter their frailties , but , it is a tolerably safe rule that he who is not afraid to speak the truth , is not afraid to act the truth ; and truths , moral , political and social , are peculiarly the aim of this government . 9m ON CAlDOR . Candor is a proof of both a just frame of mind , and of a good tone of breeding . It is a quality that belongs , equally to the honest man and to the gentleman : to the first , as doing to others as we would ourselves be done by ; to the last , as indispensable to the liberality of the character . By candor we are not to understand trifling and uncalled for expositions of truth ; but a sentiment that proves a conviction of the necessity of speaking truth , when speaking at all ; a contempt for all designing evasions of our real opinions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implication , deceives wilfullj. /z/ In all the general concerns , the publick has a right to be treated with candor . Without this manlj and tnjiv republican quality , republican because no power exists in the country to intimidate any from its exhibition , the institutions are converted into a stupendous fraud . Foreigners reproach the Americans with a want of directness and candor , in conducting their ordinary intercourse . It is said that they dissemble thoughts that might properly be expressed , in the presence of the parties interested , to express them openly and in a way to insinuate more than is asserted , behind their backs . It is to be feared that this is a vice of humanity , but , still , one people may be more under its influence than another . It would be a singular and a false eftei-t of freedom , to destroy a nation 's character for candor ; but we are not to be deceived by names , it being quite possible that a tyranny of opinion should produce such results , even in a democracy . America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the institutions . The want of large towns , the scattered population , and the abscnct of much marked inequality of condition , necessarily lend a provincial character to the population , a character that every where favors the natural propensity of man to bring all his fellows within the control of his own strictures . The religionists who first setded the country , too , have aided in bringing individual opinion in subjection to publick opinion , and , as the latter is always controlled by combinations and design , consequently more or less to error . There is no doubt that these combined causes have had the effect to make a large portion of the population less direct , frank , candid and simple in the expression of their honest sentiments , and even in the relation of facts , tiian the laws of God , and the /q/ social duties require . It is to this feeling that the habit has arisen of making cautious and evasive answers , such as " I guess , " " 1 conclude , " " I some think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said so and so , " when tiie speaker is the whole time confident of the fact . This practice has the reproach of insincerity and equivocation , is discreditable , makes intercourse treacherous and unsafe , and is beneath the frankness of freemen . In all these respects , a majority of the American ieople might take a useful lesson from the liabits of England , a country which though remarkable for servility to superiors , can boast of more frankness in ordinary life , than our own . Candor has the high merit of preventing misconceptions , simplifies intercourse , prevents more misunderstandings than equivocation , elevates character , inculcates the habit of sincerity , and has a general tendency to the manly and virtuous qualities . mja /z/ Language being the medium of thought , its use enters into our most familiar practices . A just , clear and simple expression of our ideas is a necessary accomplishment for all who aspire to be classed with gentlemen and ladies . It renders all more respectable , besides making intercourse more intelligible , safer and more agreeable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , a want of simplicity , and a turgid abuse of terms . To these may be added ambiguity of expression . Many perversions of significations also /z/ exist , and a formality of speech , which , while it renders conversation ungraceful , and destroys its playfulness , seriously weakens the power of the language , by applying to ordinary ideas , words that arc suited only to themes of gravity and dignity . While it is true that the great body of the A nierican people use their language more correctly than t ) ie mass of any other considerable nation , it is equally true that a smaller proportion than common attain to elegance in this accom ) Iishment , especially in speech . Contrary to the general law in such matters , the women of the country have a less agreeable utterance than the men , a defect that great care sliould be taken to remedy , as the nursery is the birth-place of so many of our habits . The limits of this work will not permit an enumeration of the popular abuses of significations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the student may possess a general clue to the faults . " Creek , " a word that signifies an inlet of the sea , or of a lake , is misapplied to running streams , and frequently to the outlets of lakes . A " square , " is called a " park ; " " lakes , " are often called " ponds ; " and " arms of the sea , " are sometimes termed " rivers . " In pronunciation , the faults are still more numerous , partaking decidedly of provincialisms . The letter w , soundecl like double o , or oo , or like i , as in virtoo , fortin , fortinate ; and ew , pronounced also like 00 , are common errors . This is an exceedingly vicious pronunciation , rendering the language mean and vulgar . " New , " pronounced as " noo " is an example , and " few , " as " /oo ; " the true sounds are " nw " and fu " the u retaining its proper soft sound , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pronunciation of the English language to a common rule , produces much /q/ confusion , and taking the usages of polite life as the standard , many uncouth innovations . All know the pronounciation of plough ; but it will scarcely do to take this sound as the only power of the same combination of final letters , for we should be compelled to call though , thou ; through , throu ; and t o u g h , tou . False accentuation is a common xVmerican fault . Ensign ( insin , ) is called ensi/ne and engine ( injin , ) engi/ne . Indeed , it is a common fault of narrow associations , to suppose that words are to be pronounced as they are spelled . Many words are in a state of mutation , the pronunciation being unsettled even in the best society , a result that must often arise where language is as variable and undetermined as the English . To this class belong " clerk , " " cucumber " and " gold , " which are often pronounced as spelt , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say " dark , " " co ? 7-cumber , " ( not cowcwmber , ) and " goold . " For loote/iaat. ( lieutenant ) there is not sufficient authority , the true pronunciation being " levtenant . ' ' By making a familiar compound of this word , we see the usclesness of attempting to reduce the lunguage to any other laws than those of the usages of polite life , for they who affect to say looteimnt , do not say " lootemxnXco-lo-nel , " but " lontcmuM-kwmeV* The polite pronunciation of " either " and " neither , " is " i-tlier " and " ni-ther , " and not " either " and " neether . " This is a case in which the better usage of the language has respected derivations , for " 6i , " in German are pronounced as in " height " and " sleight , " " le " making the sound of " ce . " We see the arbitrary usages of the English , however , by comparing these legitimate sounds with those of the words " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , in which language the latter word is called co-lo-nel . ' ' Some changes of the language are to be regretted , as they lead to false inferences , and society is always a loser by mistaking names for things . Life is a fact , and it is seldom any good arises from a misapprehension of the real circumstances under which we exist . The word " gentleman " has a positive and limited signification . It means one elevated above the mass of society by his birth , manners , attainments , character and social condition . As no civilized society can existwithout these social differences , nothing is gained by denying the use of the term . If blackguards were to be called " gentlemen , " and " gentlemen , " " blackguards , " the difference between them would be as obvious as it is to-day . The word " gentleman , " i ? derived from the French gentilhomme , which originally signified one of noble birth . This was at a time when the characteristics of the condition were never found beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualifications of nobihty , without that of birth , and the meaning of the word was extended . It is now possible to be a gentleman without birth , though , even in America , where such distinctions are purely conditional , they vrlio have birth , except in extraordinary instances , are classed with gentlemen . To call a laborer , one who has neithereducation , manners , accomplishments , tastes , associations , nor any one of the ordinary requisites , a gentleman , is just as absurd as to call one who is thus qualified , a fellow . The Mord must have some especial signification , or it would be synonymous with man . One may have gentlemanlike feelings , principles and appearance , without possessing the liberal attainments that distinguish the gentleman . Least of all does money alone make a /q/ pentleman , thouffh , as it becomes a means of obtaining the other requisites , it is usual to ive it a place in the claims ofthe class . Men may be , and often are , very rich , without havinthe smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinguished gentleman , and not possess as much money as his own footman . This word , however , is sometimes used instead of the old terms , " sirs , " " my masters , " 6cc.  --  fec. , as in addressing bodies of men . Thus we say " gentlemen , " in addressing a publick meeting , in complaisance , and as , by possibility , some gentlemen may be present . This is a license that may be tolerated , though he who should insist that all present were , as individuals , gentlemen , would hardly escape ridicule . Wliat has just been said of the word gentleman , is equally true with that of lady . The standard of these two classes , rises ns society becomes more civilized and refined ; the man who might pass for a gentleman in one nation , or community , not being able to maintain the same position in another . Tiie inefficiency of the effort to subvert th-ings by names , is shown in the fact that , in all civilized communities , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , as gentlemen ; who associate together freely and without reserve , and who admit each other 's claims without scruple or distrust . This class may be limited by prejudice and arbitrary enactments , as in Europe , or it may have no other rules than those of taste , sentiment and the silent laws of usage , as in America . The same observations may be made in relation to the words master and servant . He who employs laborers , with the right to command , is a master , and he who lets himself to work , with an obligation to obey , a servant . Thus there are house , or domestic /z/ servants , farm servants , shop serants , and various other servants ; the term master being in all these cases the correlative . In consequence of the domestic servants of America having once been negro-slaves , a prejudice has arisen among the laboring classes of the whites , who not only dislike the term servant , but have also rejected that of master . So far has this prejudice gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to the use of the word boss , which has precisely the same meaning in Dutch ! How far a subterfuge of this nature is worthy of a manly and common sense people , will admit of question . A si*milar objection may be made to the use of the word " help , " which is not only an innovation on a just and established term , but which does not properly convey the meaning intended . They who aid their masters in the toil may be deemed " helps , " but they who perform all the labor do not assist , or help to do the thing , but they do it themselves . A man does not usuall hire his cook to Jielj ) him cook his dinner , but to cook it herself . Nothing is therefore gained , while something is lost in simplicity and clearness by the substitution of new and imperfect terms , for the long established words of the language . In all cases in which the people of America have retained the tilings of their ancestors , they should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turgid expressions is gaining ground , and ought to be corrected . One of the most certain evidences of a man of high breeding , is his simplicity of speech ; a simplicity that is equally removed from vulgarity and exaggeration . He calls a spade , a " spade . " His enunciation , while clear , deliberate and dignified , is totally without strut , showing his familiarity with the world , and , in some degree , re tiecting /q/ the qualities of his mind , which is poHshed without being addicted to sentimentahsm , or any other bloated feeling . He never calls his wife , " his lady , " but " his wife , " and he is not afraid of lessening the dignity of the human race , by styling the most elevated and refined of his fellow creatures , " men and women . " He does not say , in speaking of a dance , that ' * the attire of the iadies was exceedingly elegant and peculiarly becoming at the late assembly , " but that " the women were well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to remark , " that the Rev. Mr. G gave us an elegant and searching discourse the past sabbath , " but , that " the parson preached a good sermon last Sunday . " The utterance of a gentleman ought to be deliberate and clear , without being measured . All idea of effort should be banished , though nothing lost for want of distinctness . His emphasis ought to be almost imperceptible ; never halting , or abrupt ; and least of all , so placed as to give an idea of his own sense of cleverness ; but regulated by those slight intonations that give point to wit , and force to reason . His language should rise with the subject , and , as he must be an educated and accomplished man , he can not but know tliat the highest quality of eloquence , and all subhmity , is in the thought , rather than in the words , though there must be an adaptation of the one to the other . This is still more true of women than of men , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people . All can not reach the highest standard in such matters , for it depends on early habit , and particularly on early associations . The ciiildren of gentlemen are as readily distinguishrd from other children by these peculiarities , as by the greater delicacy of their minds , /z/ and higher tact in breeding . But we are not to abandon all improvement , because perfection is reached but by few . SimpHcity should be the first aim , after one is removed from vulgarity , and let the finer shades of accomplishment be acquired as they can be attained . In no case , however , can one who aims at turgid language , exaggerated sentiment , or pedantic utterance , lay claim to be either a man or a woman of the world . rjm /z/ It would seem that providence , for some of its own great ends , has denied to man any particular blessing , which his own waywardness is not destined to lessen , if not entirely to neutralize . In nothing connected with human happiness , is this grave truth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotisms , where the weakness of the bodies of nations , is derived from an ignorance of their force , and from the want of means to act in concert , the press is the lever by which tbe thrones of tyrants and prejudices are the most easily overturned , and , under such circumstances , men often contend for privileges in its behalf , that become dangerous to the peace of society , when civil and political rights are obtained . In a popular government , so far from according an entire immunity from penalties to the press , its abuses are those which society is required , by its very safety , to visit with its heaviest punishments . In a democracy , misleading the publick mind , as regards facts , characters , or principles , is corrupting all that is dear to or ; THE PRESS . 125 society at its source , opinion being the fountain whence justice , honors , and the laws , equally flow . It is a misfortune that necessity has induced men to accord greater license to this formidable engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with loss important objects in view ; for the press , like fire , is an excellent servant , but a terrible master . It may be taken as rules , that without the liberty of the press , there can be no popular liberty in a*nation , and with its licentiousness , neither publick honesty , justice , nor a proper regard for character . Of the two , perhaps , that people is the happiest which is deprived altogether of a free press , since private honesty , and a healthful tone of the publick mind are not incompatible with narrow institutions though neither can well exist under the constant corn ... ting action of a licentious press . The governing principle connected with this interest , would seem to depend on a general law , which , under abuses , converts the most beneficial moral agents to be the greatest enemies of the race . The press is equally capable of being made the instrument of elevating man to the highest pomt of which his faculties admit , or of depressing him to the lowest . In struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not always paused to reflect on the influence of the agents they have employed , when those agents , from contending with a powerful enemy , shall have become conquerors , and have begun to look about them for the fruits of victory . The press , so efficient as the opponent of tyrants , may become despotic itself ; it may substitute new errors for those it has eradicated , and , like an individual spoiled by success , may generally abuse its advantages . Many false notions have been introduced into so ( ciety , in the desire to vindicate the rights of so powerful /z/ an agent . Of these , one of the worst is the admission of a claim in the press to interfere , in any manner , with private character . The good of such an interference , is at the best but doubtful , and the oppression , in those cases in which injustice is done , is of the most intolerable and irreparable kind . It would be a proper and a just , though an insufficient atonement , in cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts to compel the hbeller to pubhsh , for a series of weeks , or months , or even years , his own condemnation in his own columns , that the antidote might accompany the poison ; though it is to be feared , that the possession of popular rights is still too recent , to permit the majority of men to entertain correct notions concerning an instrument that , they rightly fancy , has been so serviceable in the conflict they have just escaped . It ought never to be forgotten , that the press , contending for natural but forbidden rights , is no more like the press when these rights are obtained , than the man struggling with adversity , and chastened by misfortune , is like the man flushed with success and corrupted by prosperity . The history of the press is eveiy where the same . In its infancy it is timid , distrustful , and dependant on truth for success . As it acquires confidence with force , it propagates just opinions with energy ; scattering errors and repelling falsehood , until it prevails ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all else that is estimable , until it becomes a serious matter of doubt , whether a community derives most good or evil , from the institution . /z/ What is called the liberty of the press , is very generally misconceived . In despotic , or narrow governments , persons , styled censors , are appointed to examine the columns of journals , before the latter are issued , with power to suppress all offensive or articles . This , of course , is putting the press under the control of government , and the press is not a free press , since it can not publish what its editors please . By the liberty of the press , we are to understand , only , an exemption from this restraint , or a condition of things which enables the citizen to publish what he please , as he can utter what he may please with his tongue . All men , in a civilized country , however , are responsible for what they say , or publish . If a man speak slander against another , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man publish a libel , he incurs the same liability . Some persons suppose that the press possesses privileges , in this respect , that are not accorded to individuals ; but the reverse is the fact , as a man may utter with impunity , that which he can not publish with impunity . The distinction arises from the greater circulation , and the greater power to injure , of a published libel , than of a spoken slander . The editor of a journal , therefore , does not . possess the same immunities as an editor , that he pos- /z/ sesses as a private citizen . Without such a distinction the community would possess a set of men in its bosom , who would enjoy a power to tyrannize over it , with impunity , through its means of puhlicity . The liberty of the press , in principle , resembles the liberty to bear arms . In the one case , the constitution guaranties a right to publish ; in the other , a right to keep a musket ; but he who injures his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who injures his neighbor with his musket may be punished . The constitution of the United States does not guaranty even the right to publish , except as against tiie laws of congress , as has been previously stated ; the real liberty of the press depending altogether on the provisions of the several state governments , in common with most of the other liberties and rights of the citizen . 3$9i ON TITE AinERICAIV PRESS . The newspaper press ofthis country is distinguished from that of Europe in several essential particulars . While there are more prints , they are generally of a lower character . It follows that in all in which they are useful , their utility is more diffused through society , and in all in which they are hurtful , the injury they inflict is more wide-spread and corrupting . The great number of newspapers in America , is a cause of there being so little capital , and consequently so little intelligence , employed in their management . It is also a reason of the inexactitude of much of the iews they circulate . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , to obtain correct information ; while , on the other hand , the great competition renders editors reckless and impatient to fill their columns . To these circumstances may be added the g-reater influence of vague and unfounded rumours in a vast and thinly settled country , than on a compact population , covering a small surface . Discreet and observing men have questioned , whether , after excluding the notices of deaths and marriages , one half of the circumstances that are related in the neMspaj ) ers of America , as facts , are true in their essential features ; and , in cases connected with party politics , it may be questioned if even so large a proportion can be set down as accurate . Tliis is a terrible picture to contemplate , for when the number of prints is remembered , and the avidity with which they are read is brought into the account , we are made to perceive that the entire nation , in a moral sense , breathes an atmosphere of falsehoods . There is little use , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread irj which ) ublick men and writers commonly stand of the power of the press lo injure them , has permitted the evil to extend so far , that it is scarcely exceeding the bounds of a just alarm , to say that the country can not much longer exist in safety , under the malign influence that now overshadows it . Any one , who lias lied long enough to note changes of the sort , must have perceived how fust men of probity and virtue are loosing their influence in the country , to be superseded by those who scarcely deem an affectation of the higher qualities necessary to their success . This fearful chatige must , in a great measure , be ascribed to the corruption of the publick press , which , as a whole , owes its existence to the schemes of interested political adventurers . /z/ Those who are little acquainted with the world are apt to imagine that a fact , or an argument , that is stated pubhckly in print , is entitled to more credit and respectthanthe same fact or argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this being true , however , in regard to the press of this country , it would be safer to infer the very reverse . Men who are accustomed daily to throw off their mistatements , become reckless of the consequences , and he who would hesitate about committing himself by an allegation made face to face , and as it were on his personal responsibility , would indite a paragraph , behind the impersonality of his editorial character , to be uttered to the world in the irresponsible columns of a journal . It is seldom , in cases which admit of doubt , that men are required to speak on the moment ; but , with the compositor in waiting , the time pressing , and the moral certainty that a rival establishment will circulate the questionable statement if he decline , the editor too often throws himself into the breach . The contradiction of to-day , will make a paragraph , as well as the lie of yesterday , though he who sees the last and not the first , unless able to appreciate the character of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor of a newspaper , as an abstraction , with no motive in view but that of maintaining principles and disseminating facts , it is necessary to remember that he is a man , with all the interests and passions of one who has chosen this means to advance his fortunes , and of course , with all the accompanying temptations to abuse his opportunities and this too , usually , with the additional drawback of being a partisan in politics , religion , or literature . If the possession of power , in ordinary cases , is a constant inducement to turn it to an unjust profit , ON THE AMERICAN PRESg. 131 it is peculiarly so in the extraordinary case of the control of a public press . Editors praise their personal friends , and abuse their enemies in print , as private individuals praise their friends , and abuse their enemies with their tongues . Their position increases the number of eacli , and the consequence is , that the readers obtain inflated views of the first , and unjust notions of the last . If newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a tyranny of their own . The press tyrannizes over publick men , letters , the arts , the stage , and even over private life . Under the pretence of protecting publick morals , it is corrupting them to the core , and under the semblance of maintaining liberty , it is gradually establishing a despotism as ruthless , as grasping , and one that is quite as vulgar as that of any christian state known . With loud professions of freedom of o ) inion , there is no tolerance ; with a parade of patriotism , no sacrifice of interests ; and with fulsome panegyrics on propriety , too frequently , no decency . There is but one way of extricating the mind from the baneful influence of the press of this country , and that is by making a rigid analysis of its nature and motives . By remembering that all statements that involve disputed points are ex parte ; that there is no impersonality , except in professions ; that all the ordinary passions and interests act upon its statements with less than the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , which ever accora ) anies power , one may come , at last , to a just appreciation of its merits , and in a degree , learn to neutralize its malignant influence . But this is a freedom of mind that few attain , for few have the means of arriving at these truths ! /z/ The admixture of truth and falsehood in the intelligence circulated by the press , is one of the chief causes of its evils . A journal that gave utterance to nothing but untruths , would loose its influence with its character , but there are none so ignorant as not to see the necessity of occasionally issuing truths . It is only in cases in which the editor has a direct interest to the contrary , in which he has not the leisure or the means of ascertaining focts , or in which he is himself misled by the passions , cupidity and interests of others , that untruths find a place in his columns . Still these instances may , perhaps , include a majority of the cases . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that every man should have a clear perception of the quality of the political news , and of the political opinions circulated by the press , for , he who confides implicitly to its statements is yielding himself blindly to either the designed and exaggerated praises of friends , or to the calculated abuse of opponents . As no man is either as good , or as bad , as vulgar report makes him , we can , at once , see the value thai ought to be given to such statements . All representations that dwell wholly on merits , or on faults , are to be distrusted , since none are perfect , and it may , perhaps , be added , none utterly without some redeeming qualities . Whenever the papers unite to commend , without qualification , it is safe to believe in either venality , or a disposition to defer to a preconceived notion of excellence , most men choosing to float with the current , rather than to resist it , when no active motive urges a contrarv course , feeding falsehood , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweeping , one may be almost certain it is exaggerated and false . /q/ Puffs , political , literary , personal and national , can commonly be detected by their as parfe statements , as may be their counterpart , detraction . Dishonesty of intention is easily discovered by the man of the world , in both , by the tone ; and he who blindly receives either eulogium or censure , because they stand audaciously in print , demonstrates that his judgment is still in its infancy . Authors review themselves , or friends - ire employed to doit for them ; political adventurers have their dependants , who build their fortunes on those of their patrons ; artists , players , and even religionists , are not above having- recourse to such expedients to advance their interests and reputations . The world would be surprised to learn the tyranny that the press has exercised , in our own times , over some of the greatest of modern names , few men possessing the manlmcss and moral courage that are necessary to resist its oppression . The people that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government of opinion in its stead , and which blindly yields its interests to the designs of those who would rule through the instrumentality of newspapers , has only exchanged one form of des ) Otism for another . It is often made a matter of boasting , that the United States contain so many publick journals . It were wiser to make it a cause of mourning , since the quality , in this instance , diminishes in an inverse ratio to the quantity . Another reason may be found for the deleterious influence of the American press , in the peculiar physical condition of the country . In all communities , the better opinion , whether as relates to moral or scientific truths , tastes , manners and facts , is necessarily in the keeping of a few ; the great majority of /z/ mankind being precluded by their opportunities from reaching so high in the mental scale . The proportion between the intelligent and whole numbers , after making a proper allowance on account of the differences in civilization , is probably as great in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the males ; but the great extent of the territory prevents its concentration , and consequently , weakens its influence . Under such circumstances , the press has less to contend with than in other countries , where designing and ignorant men would stand rebuked before the collected opinion of those who , by their characters and information , are usually too powerful to be misled by vulgarity , sophistry and falsehood . Another reason is to be found in the popular character of the government , bodies of men requiring to be addressed in modes suited to the average qualities of masses . In America , while the contest was for great principles , the press aided in elevating the common character , in im proving the common mind , and in maintaining the common interests ; but , since the contest has ceased , and the stiuiggle has become one purely of selfishness and personal interests , it is employed , as a whole , in fast undermining its own work , and in preparing the nation for some terrible reverses , if not in catling down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press of this country now exists , it would seem to be ex ) ressly devised by the great agent of mischief , to depress and destroy all that is good , and to elevate and advance all that is evil in the nation . The little trutli that is urged , is usually urged coarsely , weakened and rendered vicious , by personalities ; while tiiose who live by falsehoods , fallacies , enmities , partialities and the schemes of the designing , find the press the veiy instrument that the devils would invent to effect their designs . /q/ A witty but unprincipled statesman of our own times , lias said that " speech was bestowed on man to conceal his thouihts ; " judging from its present condition , he might have added , " and the press to pervert truth . " m ox PROPERTY . As property is the base of all civilization , its existence and security are indispeusable to social improvement . Were it possible to have a community of property , it would soon be found that no one would toil , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for the supply of their physical wants , since none would exert themselves to obtain advantages solely for the use of others . The failure of all attempts to form communities , even on a small scale , with a common interest , goes to prove this . Where there is a rigid equality of condition , as well as of rights , that condition must necessariJy be one of a low scale of mediocrity , since it is impossible to elevate those who do not possess the requisite qualities any higher . Thus we see that the societies , or religious sects , in which a community of property prevails , are content with merely supplying the wants of life , knowing little or nothing of its elegancies , refinements , or mental pleasures . These communities , moreover , possess an outlet for their idle and dissolute , by resorting to expulsion , a remedy that society itself can not apply . T'he principle of individuality , or to use a less Manning term , of selfishness , lies at the root of all voluntary /z/ human exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for houses , lands , and for property , in general . This is done , because we know that the fruits of our labor will belong to ourselves , or to those who are most dear to us . It follows , that all which society enjoys beyond the mere supply of its first necessities , is dependant on the rights of property . It is not known that man exists anywhere without establishing rules for the protection of property . Even insects , reptiles , beasts and birds , have their several possessions , in their nests , dens and supplies . So completely is animal exertion , in general , whether in man or beast , dependant on the enjoyment of this right , under limitations which mark their several conditions , that we may infer that the rights of property , to a certain extent , are founded in nature . The food obtained by his toil , can not be taken from the mouth of man , or beast , without doing violence to one of the first of our natural rights . We apply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bird , that preys on the aliment of another animal , as well as to the human thief . So long as natural justice is admitted to exist , the party assailed , in such cases , has a right to defend his own . The rights of property become artificial and extended , as society becomes civilized . In the savage state the land is without owners , property consisting in the hut , the food , and the arms used in war and in the chase . In pastoral , or semi-barbarous states , use gives claims , not to individuals , but to tribes , and flocks are pastured on grounds that belong to one entire community , but to that one only . Private property is composed of cattle , sheep , tents , horses , camels , with the common claims to share in the common fields . /q/ Civilization has established various , and in some cases , arbitrary and unjust distinctions , as pertaining to the rights of property . Tliese are abuses , the tendency of man being to convert into curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the ordinances of civilized society , that are connected with this interest , are founded in reason , and ought to be rigidly maintained . The lirst great principle connected with the rights of property , is its inviolability in all cases in which the laws leave it in possession of the proprietor . Every child should be taught to respect the sanctity of his neighbour 's house , garden , fields and all that is his . On those parts of another 's possessions , where it is permitted to go , he should go with care not to abuse the privilege , and from those parts which he is forbidden to use , he should religiously abstain . The child that is properly impressed in infancy , with the rights of property , is in little danger of committing theft in after life , or , in any other manner of invading that which is the just possession of another . The doctrine that any one " may do what he please with his own , " however , is false . One may do with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow , and no more . One may even respect the letter , and yet violate the spirit of those laws and Institutions , committing a moral , if not a legal offence , in so doing . Thus , he , who would bring his money to bear upon the elections of a country like this , abuses his situation , unless his efforts are confined to fair and manly discussions before the body of the people . In nations where the mass have no political rights , means have been found to accumulate power by the aid of wealth . The pretence has been that none but the rich have a stake in society . Every man who has /z/ wants , feelings , affections and character , has a stake in society . Of the two , perhaps , the necessities of men are a greater corrective of political abuses , than their surplus means . Both may lead to evil , beyond a doubt , but , as laws which are framed by all , must be tolerably impailial and general in their operation , less danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of the latter . When property rules , it rules alone ; but when the poor are admitted to have a voice in government , the rich are never excluded . Such is the nature of man , that all exclusive power is uniformly directed to exclusive purposes . Property always carries with it a portion of indirect political influence , and it is unwise , and even dangerous , to strengthen this influence by adding to it constitutional privileges ; the result always being to make the strong stronger , and the weak weaker . On the other liand , all who love equal justice , and , indeed , the safety of free institutions , should understand that property has its rights , and the necessity of rigidly respecting them . It is the right of the possessor of property to be placed on an equal footing with all his fellow citizens , in every respect . If he is not to be exalted on account of his wealth , neither is he to be denounced . In this country , it is the intention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . There are habits that belong to every condition of life . The man of hereditary wealth , is usually a man of leisure , and he little understands the true spirit of democracy , who supposes that such a man is not to enjoy the tastes and inclinations , which are the fruits of leisure and cultivation , without let or hindrance . Democracy leaves every man the master of his acts and time , his tastes and habits , so long as he discharges his dutv to the publick , and respects the /q/ laws . He who declaims against another for holdinf himself alooi " from general association , arrogates to himself a power of censure that he does not rightly possess , and betrays his own consciousness of inferiority . Men of really high social station never make this complaint , for they are above jealousy ; and they who do , only discover a feeling that is every way removed from the manliness and spirit of true independence . One may certainly be purse-proud , and of all the sources of human pride , mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen are almost invariably above this low feeling , and they who attribute habits , that have their rise in sentiment , tastes , knowledge and refinement , to such a cause , usually make the mistake of letting their own ignorance of the existence of motives so elevated , be known . In a word , if the man of property has no more personal legal immunities , than the man who has none , neither has he fewer . He is privileged to use his own means , under the general regulations of society , in the pursuit of his own happiness , and they who weuld interfere with him , so far from appreciating hbertv , are ignorant of its vital principles . If left to itself , unsupported by factitious political aid , but sufficiently protected against the designs and rapacity of the dishonest , property is an instrument of working most of the gootl that society enjoys . It elevates a national character , by afibrding the means of cultivating knowledge and the tastes ; it introduces all above barbarism into society ; and it encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other great good , its abuses are in proportion to its benefits . The possessor of property is not , half the time , as much the object of envy as the needy imagine , for its /z/ corrupting influence endangers eternal peace . Great estates are generally of more benefit to the community than to their owners . They bring with them anxiety , cares , demands , and , usually , exaggerated notions , on the part of the publick , of the duties of the rich . So far from being objects of envy , their possessors are oftener the subjects of commiseration ; he who has enough for his rational wants , agreeably to his habits and education , always proving the happier man . The possessions of new families are commonly exaggerated in the publick mind , while those of long established families are as commonly diminished . A people tliat deems the possession of riches its highest source of distinction , admits one of the most degrading of all influences to preside over its opinions . At no time , should money be ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives as if the acquisition of property were the sole end of his existence , betrays the dominion of the most sordid , base , and grovelling motive , that life oflers . Property is desirable as the ground work of moral independence , as a means of improving the faculties , and of doing good to others , and as the agent in all that distinguishes the civilized man from the savage . Property has been made the test of political rights , in two distinct forms . It lias been represented. , and it has been established as a qualijication . The representation of property is effected in two modes ; first , by giving the proprietor more votes than one , according to the number and situation of his freeholds ; and , secondly , by raising the test of qualification so high , as to exclude all but the affluent from the franchise . The first was the English system , previously to the recent changes ; the last , is the actual system of France , /q/ A gfovernment founded on the representation of property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a union of two of the most corrupting influences to which man is subject . It is the proper business of government to resist the corruptions of money , and not to depend on them . To a qualification of property , if placed so low as to embrace the great majority of Jie people , there is no very serious objection , though better tests might , perhaps , be devised . Residence , character , information , and tixed relations with society , ought to be added to this qualification ; and it might be better , even , could they be made entirely to supersede it . In local governments , or those of towns and villages , which do little more than control property , a low property qualification is the true test of the franchise , though even in these Cases , it might be well to add information and character . mss /z/ There is no more a literal universal suffrage , than a literal equality . All these terms must be received in a limited sense , their meaning amounting merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One half of every jjopulation is excluded from the suffrage on account of sex , and more than half of the remainder on account of age . From the class that these two great rules do not affect , another , but a small portion , is excluded for their extreme poverty , their crimes , a want of residence or as vagabonds , // or for some other cause . The most popularly governed of the American states admit these doctrines . The policy of adopting a suffrage as wide as that which is commonly called universal , has been much and plausibly contested . Better political tests , perhaps , might be apphed than those which now exist , and there can be little doubt that the present system is carried too far in its application and under the particular circumstances of the country , if not too far as a general principle . The governments of towns and villages , for instance , are almost entirely directed to the regulation of property , and to the control of local interests . In such governments universal suffrage is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of which shall be mentioned . Towns and villages having no legislative control over the greater interests , such as the general protection of life , the person , the character , and property , there is neither the same necessity for , nor the same justice in , letting in all classes to participate in power . The laws which control the great and predominant interests , or those which give a complexion to society , emanate from the states , which may well enough possess a wide political base . But towns and villages regulating property chiefly , there is a peculiar propriety in excluding those from the suffrage who have no immediate local interests in them . An undue proportion of the dissolute , unsettled , vicious and disorganizing , collect in towns , and that balance of society , which , under other circumstances , might neutrahze their influence , is destroyed , leaving , as a consequence , the power to control their governments , under a suffrage that is universal , in the hands of the worst part of community ; for , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevate men of their /q/ own class to office , they hold a balance between conflicting parties , uniformly act together , and commonly in favor of those who are most disposed to sacrifice principle to expediency . A system must be radically wrong , when tiie keeper of a tavern , or of a grocery , through his facilities in humoring one of the worst of our vices , can command more votes than a man of the highest attainments , or of the highest character . The great immigration of foreigners into the country , and the practice of remaining , or of assembling , in the large towns , renders universal suffrage doubly oppressive to the citizens of the latter . The natives of other countries bring with them the prejudices of another and an antagonist state of society ; or what is still worse , their reaction ; and it is a painful and humiliating fact , that several of the principal places of this country , are , virtually , under the control of men of this class , who have few convictions of liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are totally ignorant of its governing principles , and who , in their hearts and language , are hostile to the very people whose hospitality they enjoy . Many of these men can not even speak the language of the land , and perhaps a majority of them can not read the great social compact , by which society is held together . Whatever may be said , on general principles , of the necessity of giving to a government the broadest possible base , few will contend that circumstances like these , ought not to qualify the regulation in practice . Local and limited governments , like those of towns and villages , are best managed in the hands of men who have permanent and fixed interests within their boundaries , and there is little propriety in admitting the more floating part of the population to a participation of an aurliority that scarcely controls a single right which affects tranjieut persons . /z/ Universal suffrage , in the more extended sense , can not be received as a naked proposition , without reference to facts . Some nations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in others , it may be the best and most sure foundation of society . As a general rule it would be highly dangerous , though the communities that can safely bear it are to be envied and esteemed . Systems arc to be appreciated by their general effects , and not by particular exceptions . Principles also become modified in practice , by facts , and universal suffrage presents very different results in one state of society , from that which it presents in another . So long as the laboring classes of a country can receive high wages , the love of independence that is natural to man , will induce them to give their votes according to their own interests , pleasure , judgment , passions or caprices ; for these are equally governing motives of human actions ; but when the pressure of society shall become so great as to compel the man of small means to depend on the man of large for his comforts , or even for his bread , as is the natural tendency of all civilized society , the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that includes all , or as nearly so , as is practicable . It may then become necessary to liberty , itself , to limit the suffrage . The representative will necessarily have a direct moral relation to his constituency . In a community tliat contains many men of character and intelligence , the representation will be of a higher order , than in a community that contains few . We are not to judge of the general effects of the - American system , therefore , by the present condition of its representation , although those wlio have the best means of observation , are of opinion that it will even now sustain a favorable comparison with that of any other country . /q/ There are periods in the histories of all countries , in which entire nations may be said to be on their good behavior . These are the times of struggles and changes , when attention is drawn to the acts of publick men , and principles have unusual influence . Such was the case at the commencement of the American revolution ; at one period of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present state of the British parliament . At such periods , the same representative acts under impulses very diflerent from those which commonly influence him , and care must be had , in comparing systems , to take into the account all the facts that would be likely to aftect them . Universal suffrage is capricious and uncertain in its minor consequences , often producing results directly contrary to those which were expected . The transitory nature of the American population renders universal suffrage less advantageous and more injurious , than it would prove to be in a less vacillating condition of society . Thus it is , we see new men , and even strangers , filling offices in places that they entered a year previously , to quit the year that will succeed . The effect of this passing connection with a community is bad , on many accounts , but it becomes seriously so , when the floating and unstable members of society have sutffcient interest to unsettle its concerns with their own fluctuating interests . /z/ There is a disposition , under popular governments , to mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a matter of course , can only refer to that portion of the community that has cognizance of the particular circumstances it affects , but in all matters of law , of rights , and of principles , as they are connected with the general relations of society , the pubhek means the entire constituency , and that , too , only as it is authorized to act , by the fundamental laws , or the constitution . Thus the citizen who asserts his legal rights in opposition to the wishes of a neighborhood , is not opposing the publick , but maintaining its intentions , while the particular neighborhood is arrogating to itself a powxr that is confided to the whole body of the state . Tyranny can only come from the publick , in a democracy , since individuals are powerless , possessing no more rights than it pleases the community to leave in their hands . The pretence that an individual oppresses the publick , is , to the last degree , absurd , since he can do no more than exercise his rights , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , administered and interpreted by the agents of the publick . As every man forms a portion of the publick , if honest and influenced by right principles , the citizen will be cautious how he takes sides against particular members of the community , for he is both deciding in his own case , a circumstance under which few make /q/ impartial judges , and combining with the strong to oppress the weak . In this country , in which political authority is the possession of the body that wields opinion , influences tliat elsewhere counteract each other , there is a strong and dangerous disposition to defer to the publick , in opposhion to truth and justice . This is a penalty that is paid for liberty , and it depends on the very natural principle of flattering power . In a monarchy , adulation is paid to the prince ; in a democracy to the people , or the publick . Neither hears the truth , as often as is wholesome , and both sufter for the want of the corrective . The man who resists the tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those around him ; but he wlio opposes the innovations of the publick in a democracy , not only linds himself struggling with power , but with his own neiglibors . It follows that the oppression of the publick is of the worst description , and all real lovers of liberty , should take especial heed not to be accessaries to wrongs so hard to be borne . As between the publick and individuals , therefore , the true bias of a democrat , so far as there is any doubt of the real merits of the controversy , is to take sides with the latter . This is opposed to the popular notion , which is to fancy the man who maintains his rights against the popular will , an aristocrat , but it is none the less true ; the popular will , in cases that aftect popular pleasure , being quite as likely to be wrong , as an individual will , in cases that affect an individual interest . It ought to be impressed on every man 's mind , in letters of brass , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poivtr that is not expressly conceded by the institutioTU , and that this pouter , moreover , is only to be used under the forms prescribed by the constitution . All beyond thisy is oppression when it takes ths char- /z/ acter of acts and not vnfrequenthj when it is confined to opinion Society has less need of the corrective of publick opinion , under such a system , than under a narrow government , for possessing all the power , the body of the community , by framing the positive ordinances , is not compelled to check abuses by resisting , or over-awing the laws . Great care should be had , therefore , to ascertain facts , befow the citizen of a free country suffers himself to inflict the punishment of publick opinion , since it is aiding oppression in its worst form , when in error , and this too , without a sufficient object . Another form of oppression practised by the publick , is arrogating to itself a right to inquire into , and to decide on the private acts of individuals , beyond the cognizance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the publick invite invasions on their privacy , a course that has rendered the community less scrupulous and delicate than it ought to be . All assumptions of a power to decide on conduct , that is unaccompanied by an authority to investigate facts , is adding the danger of committing rank injustice , to usurpation . The practice may make hypocrites , but it can never mend morals . The publick , every where , is proverbially soulless . All feel wiien its rights , assumed or real , are invaded , but none feel its responsibilities . In republicks , the publick is , also , accused of ingratitude to its servants . This is true , few citizens of a democracy retaining the popular favor , without making a sacrifice of those principles , which conflict with popular caprices . The people , being sovereign , require the same flattery , the same humouring of their wishes , and the same sacrifices of truths , as a prince . /q/ It is not more true , however , tliat the people in a democracv , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ? common to all power , which , as a rule , is invariably as forgetful of services as it is exacting . The difference in the rewards of the servants of a prince , and the rewards of the servants of a democracy , is to be found in the greater vigilance of the first , who commonly sees the necessity of paying well . No dignities or honors conferred on a subject , moreover , can raise him to a level with his master , while a people reluctantly yield distinctions that elevate one of their own number above themselves . In America , it is indispensable that every well wisher of true liberty should understand that acts of tyranny can only proceed from the publick . The publick , then , is to be watched , in this country , as , in other countries kings and aristocrats are to be watched . The end of liberty is the happiness of man , and its means , that of leaving the greatest possible personal freedom of action , that comports with the general iood . To sup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those of an unauthorized publick , is to establish restraints without the formalities and precision of legal requirements . It is putting the prejudices , provincialisms , ignorance and passions of a neighborhood in the place of statutes ; or , it is establishing a power equally without general principles , and without responsibility . Altliough the political liberty of this country is greater than that of nearly every other civilized nation , its personal liberty is said to be less . In other words , men are thought to be more under the control of extralegal authority , and todefer more to those around them , in pursuing even their lawful and iimocent occupations , than in almost every other country . That /z/ there is much truth in this opinion , all observant travellers agree , and it is a reproach to the moral civilization of the country that it should be so . It is not difficult to trace the causes of such a state of things , but the evil is none the less because it is satisfactorily explained . One principal reason , beyond a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make concerning the rights and powersof the publick in a popular government . The pretence that the publick has a right to extend its jurisdiction beyond the reach of the laws , and without regard to the principles and restraints of the fundamental compact that binds society together , is , indeed , to verify the common accusation of the enemies of democracy , who affirm that , by substituting this form of government for that of a despotism , people are only replacing one tyrant by many . This saying is singularly false as respects the political action of our institutions , but society must advance farther , the country must collect more towns , a denser population , and possess a higher degree of general civilization , before it can be as confidently pronounced that it is untrue as respects the purely social . The disgraceful desire to govern by means of mobs , which has lately become so prevalent , has arisen from misconceiving the rights of the publick . Men know that the publick , or the community , rules , and becoming impatient of any evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them , they overstep all the forms of law , overlook deliberation and consultation , and set up their own local interests , and not unfrequently their passions , in the place of positive enactments and the institutions . It is scarcely predicting more than the truth will warrant , to say , that if this substitution of the caprices , motives and animosities of a portion of the publick , for the solemn ordinances /q/ of the entire legal publick , should continue , even those well affected to a popular government , wiW be obHged lo combine with those who wish its downfall , in order to protect their persons and property , against the designs of the malevolent ; for no civilized society can long exist , with an active power in its bosom that is stronger than the law . ON DEPORTinENT . Much of the pleasure of social communication depends on the laws of deportment . Deportment may be divided into tliat , which , by marking refinement and polish , is termed breeding ; and that , Avhich , though less distinguished for finesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is usually termed manners . The first can only be expected in men and women of the world , or those who are properly styled gentlemen and Ladies ; while an absence of the last is a proof of vulgarity and coarseness , that every citizen of a free state should be desirous of avoiding . Breeding is always pleasant , though often arbitrary in its rules ; but manners are indispensable to civilization . It is just as unreasonable to expect high breeding in any but those who are trained to it , from youth upward , as it would be to expect learning without education ; but a tone of manners , that shall mark equally self-respect and a proper regard for others , is as easily acquired as reading and writing . The gentleman should aim at a standard of deportment that is refined by sentiment and taste , without the sickliness of overstrained feelings ; and those be- /z/ Health him in condition , at a manly humanity , that shall not pretend to distinctions the party does not jomprehend , while it carefully respects all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the characteristic of all higk bred deportment , in every country , and a considerate humanity should be the aim of all beneath it . /z/ The people are superior in deportment , in several particulars , to the people of Europe , and inferior in others . The gentlemen have less finesse , but more frankness of manner , while the other classes have less vulgarity and servility , relieved by an agreeable attention to each other 's rights , and to the laws of humanity in general . On the whole , the national deportment is good , without being polished , supplying the deficiency in this last essential , by great kindness and civility . In that part of deportment which aflfects the rights of all , such as the admission of general and common laws of civility , the absence of social selfishness , and a strict regard to the wants and feebleness of woman , all other nations might be benefitted by imitating this . The defects in American deportment are , notwithstanding , numerous and palpable . Among the first , may be ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for age . The former vice may be ascribed to the business habits of the country , which leave so little time for parental instruction , and perhaps , in some degree , to the arts of polhical agents . /q/ who , witli their own advantage in view , amonjr the other expedients of their cunning , have resorted to the artifice of separating children from their natural advisers , hy calHng meetings of the young , to decide on the fortunes and policy of the country . Every advertisement calling assemblies of the young , to deliberate on national concerns , ought to be deemed on insult to the good sense , the modesty , and the filial piety of the class to which it is addressed . The Americans are reproached , also , with the want of a proper deference for social station ; the lower classes manifesting their indifference by an unnecessary insolence . As a rule , this charge is unmerited , civility being an inherent quality of the American character ; still , there are some who mistake a vulgar audacity for independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that , in thus betraying their propensities , they are giving the strongest possible proofs that they are not what their idle vanity would give reason to suppose they fancy themselves , the equals of those whom they insult by their coarseness . More of this class err from ignorance , want of reflection , or a loose habit of regulating their conduct in their intercourse with others , than from design . The following anecdote will give an instance of what is meant , and , as the circumstance related is true , the reader will perceive the ludicrous impression thai is left , by these gross improprieties of behaviour . A gentleman , who shall be called Winfield , perceiving a girl of eight or ten years of age , endeavoring to find an entrance to his house , enquired her errand . " I have some hats for W'nifields ? V/5 , " was the answer . Although shocked at this rudeness , Mr. Winfield told the child , that by going to a certain door , she would find a servant to receive her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bave already seen the Irish lady in the kitchen . " This Irish lady vv as the cook , a very good woman in her way , but one who had no pretensions to be so teimed ! Such a confusion in the ideas of this child , is a certain jDroof of a want of training , for the youngladies who were treated so disrespectfully , were not the less ladies , nor did the cook become more than a cook , for the vulgarity . Facts are not to be changed by words , and all they obtain , who fancy their language and deportment can alter the relations of society , is an exposure of their own ignorance . The entire complexion , and in many respects , the well being of society , depends on the deportment of its different men ) ! ers , to each other . It behoves the master to be kind to the servant , the servant to be respectful and obedient to his master ; the young and inexperienced to defer to the aged and experienced ? the ignorant to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respect the tastes and habits of the refined . In other countries , - where positive ordinances create social distinctions in furtherance of these ends , it is believed they can not be obtained in any other manner ; but it is to be hoped that America is destined to prove , that common sense and the convictions of propriety and fitness , are as yjov/erful agents as force . The servility and arrogance of a highly artificial social scale are not to be desired , but , having positive social facts , also , which can not be dispensed with , it is vain to resist them . Civility and respect , are the sure accompaniments of a high civilization , and the admission of obvious facts is an indispensable requisite of common sense , as their denial is evidence of infatuation and folly /q/ There is a moral obligation in every man to cor*-duct himself with civility to all around him . Neither are his particular notions of what is proper , to betaken as an excuse for his rudeness and insults . Refine ' - nicnt and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but none are so ignorant , m this country , as not to distinguish between what improper and what is improper in deportment . Some men imaoine tliey have a riifht to ridicule wliat are termed " airs , " in others . Ifit could be clearly established what are " airs , " and what not , a corrective of this sort might not be misapphed . But the term is conventional , one man expeiiencing disgust at what enters into the daily habits of another . It is exceedingly hazardous , therefore , for any but those who are familiar vith the best usages of the world , to pronounce any thing " airs , " because- it is new to ihem , since what has this appearance to such persons may be no more than a proof of cultivation and of a good tone of manners . On the other hand , many who have been thrown accidentally and for short periods , into the society of the more refined classes , adopt their usages without feeling or understanding their reasons ami advantages , caricaturing delicacy and sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient in themselves , are not deemed at all essential by men and women of the world . These affectations of breeding are laughed at , as the " silver-forkisms " of pretenders . To the man of the world it is unnecessary to point out the want of taste in placing such undue stress on these immaterial things , hut it may not be unnecessary to the novice in the usages of the better circles , to warn him that his ignorance will be more easily seen by his exaggerations , that by his deficiencies of manner . The Due de Richlieu is saiti to have /z/ detected an impostor by his 7iot taking olives with his fingers . But these are points of little interest with the mass , while civility and decency lie at the root of civilization . There is no doubt that , in general , America has retrograded in manners within the last thirty years . Boys , and even men , wear their hats in the houses of all classes , and before persons of all ages and conditions . This is not independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a blackguard , than the habitual attention of the former to the minor civilities established by custom . It has been truly said , that the man who is well dressed respects himself more , and behaves himself better , than the man that is ill dressed ; but it is still more true that the man who commences with a strict observance of the commoner civilities , will be the most apt to admit of the influence of refinement on his whole character . yWi 0 . PUBLICK OPIiIOBT . Publick opinion is the lever by which all things are moved , in a democracy . It has even become so powerful in monarchies , as , virtually , to destroy despotism in all really civilized countries , holding in check the will and passions of princes . Publick opinion , however , like all things human , can work evil in proportion to its power to do good . On the same principle that the rebound is proportioned to the blow in physics , there can be no moral agent capable of benefitting man that has not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed is ON PUBLICK OPINION . I5i1f the hifihest source of national virtue , as publick opinion , which has taken a wrong direction , is the surest means of serving the devil . In a democracy , as a matter of course , every effort is made to seize upon and create publick opinion , which is , substantially , securing power . One of the commonest arts practised , in connection with this means of effecting objects , is to simulate the existence of a general feeling in favor , or against , any particular man , or measure ; so great being the deference paid to publick opinion , in a country like this , that men actually yield their own sentiments to that which they believe to be the sentiment of the majority . In politics , however , and , indeed , in all other matters that are of sufficient magnitude to attract general attention , there are adverse sentiments , which , were it not for the absurdity of the phrase , might almost be termed two publick opinions . This is the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prejudices , notions and judgments of the particular faction to which they belong , often without examination , and generally with ; ut candor . When two men of equal intelligence , of the same means of ascertaining facts , and of the same general fairness of disposition , hold the opposite extremes of opinion on the character of a particular individual , or of a particular measure , v/e see the extent to wliich a bias may be carried , and the little value that those who wish only to support the truth ought to attach even to publick opinion , in matters that will admit of doubt . As no reparation can ever be made , in this world , to the individual wlio has been wronged by publick opinion , all good men are cautious how they listen to accusations tiiat are unsupported by testimony , vulgar report being more likely to be wrong than to be right . /z/ In matters that admit of investigation and proof , publick opinion in the end , when passion , prejudice and maHce have had their day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is often too Jate to repair the wrong done to the sufferer . In matters that , by their nature , can not be clearly established , artifice , the industry of the designing , and studied misrepresentations , permanently take the place of facts , history itself being , as a whole , but an equivocal relation of all the minor events , and a profound mystification as to motives . Publick opinion will be acted on in this country , by its enemies , as the easiest and most effectual mode of effecting their purposes , bodies of men never being sufficiently clear-sighted to detect remote consequences . It is said to be a common practice in Europe , for the governments to incite commotions , when they wish to alarm the country on the subject of any particular opinion , as the surest and promptest method of checking its advance . Tlie excesses of the French revolution are now attributed to the schemes of agents of this sort ; the opponents of liberty finding it impossible to stem the torrent , having recourse to the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word that , as regards the publick in a country like this , ought to be expunged from its dictionary . In full possession of the power , there is every motive for deliberation and enquiry on the part of the people , and every inducement to abstain from undue agitation . " Excitement , " may favor the vicAvs of selfish individuals , but it can never advance the interests of truth . All good citizens should turn a deaf ear to every proposal to aid in producing an " excitement , " as it is calling into existence a uniform enemy of reason , and the most certain agent of defeating the /q/ intention of the institutions , which are based on investigation and common sense . Whenever the government of the United States shall break up , it will probably be in consequence of a false direction having been given to publick opinion . This is the Avcak point of our defences , and the part to which the enemies of the system will direct all their attacks . Opinion can be so perverted as to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , and the friend , an enemy ; the best interests of the nation to appear insignificant , and trities of moment ; in a word , the right the wrong , and the wrong the right . In a country where opinion has sway , to seize upon it , is to seize upon power . As it is a rule of humanity that the upright and well intentioned are comparatively passive , while the designing , dishonest and selfish are the most untiring in their efforts , the danger of publick opinion 's getting a false direction , is fourfold , since few men think for themselves . Perhaps there is not , in all America , apart from general principles , a sentiment that is essentially just , and which is recognized as publick opinion ; a sufficient proof of which is to be found in the fact that publick opinion is constantly vibrating around truth , which alone is unchangeable . Publick opinion has got a wrong , if not a dangerous direction , already , in this country , on several essential points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press , which it sustains in its tyranny and invasions on private rights , violating all sanctity of feeling , rendering men indifferent to character , and , indeed , rendering character itself of little avail , besides setting up an irresponsible and unprincipled power that is stronger than the government itself . One of its consequences is a laxity of opinion on the subject of wrongs committed by the press , that amounts /z/ to a denial of justice . Another , and a still graver result , is to give an unrestrained supremacy to an engine that is quite as able , and perhaps more likely , to corrupt and destroy society than to reform it . This fearful state of things , which is better adapted than any other , to restrain good , and to prefer bold and bad men , has been brought about by the action of the press , itself , on publick opinion , and is an example of the manner in which this tremendous agent can be perverted to evil , in a popular government . It follows , that publick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias , as we would protect and overlook the first impressions of a child . Publick opinion in America is exposed to another danger , growing out of the recent colonial origin of the country . There is no question that the people of this country defer in an unusual maimer to foreign opinions , more particularly to those of the nation from which they are derived . The proof of this is ample , but one may constantly see quotations from English journals , in support of the pretensions of politicians , writers , artists , and all others , who are liable to the decisions of their fellow citizens for the estimation in which they are held . An opinion is seldom given in Europe , of any thing American , unless from impure motives . The country attracts too little attention in the other hemisphere , to be included in the ordinary comments of the civilized world . There are , and may be , an occasional exception , but this is the rule . As many of the interests of this country are opposed to the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion here , in favor of interests there . The doctrine of free trade , as it is called , has this origin , having been got up by English writers , to prevent other states from resorting to the same expedients to foster industry , that have so well /q/ succeeded in Great Britain . The factitious condition of ail thiiiirs in tliat great em ) ire , renders any deranireinejit liazardous , and while America trifles Avitli her welfare , like a vigorous youth who is careless of his health through reliance on his eonslitiition , England watches over every material concern , with the experience , vigilance and distrust of age . Hence it is that every means is resorted to , to extol men who have become the dupes of English sophistry , and to depreciate those who resist her schemes . We have lately seen , on the part of France , an open and a direct attempt to interfere between the people and the governmeni , in an aflair touching the character and highest interests of the country , and although the appeal injured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophistry and bad faith , it proves the reliance that foreign powers have on their ability to inlluence publick opinion , here , even in matters touching our own dearest interests ! Another familiar and recent iniitance of the efforts of forvHgners to influence American opinion , may be cited m connection with the late quarrel with France . It is known that the English government mediated to prevent a war . This mediation was accepted on the part of the American government , with the express reservation that France must comply with the terms of the treaty . In other words , we merely conditioned to delay acting , until the effort should be made to induce France to comply witli all we asked . France saw reasons to change her policy , and to comply with our terms , before the acceptance of the English mediation was known , and yet strong cftbrts have been made to persu/ide the American people that the accommodation was produced through English mediation , and that Fingland was pledged to see this accommodation efiected , in the character of an arbitrator . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last is opposed to all the principles of arbitration , as nothing was placed at the decision of the English government . The case is a recent proof of the vigilance that is necessary to V:eep pnblick opinion independent of foreign domination . Opinion is the moving power of this country , and it would be extreme weakness to suppose that other nations , which are ever ready to lavish their treasure and to shed their blood , in order to effect their ) urposes , would neglect means so sure , easy and noiseJess , as that of acting on the common mind . The danger of evil from this source will increase with the growing power of the country , or , as her policy will be likely to influence foreign interests , in a ratio proportioned to her strength and wealth . No nation can properly boast of its independence while its opinion is under the control of foreigners , and least of all , a nation with institutions dependant on the popular will . if /z/ Civilization means a condition of society that is the opposite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this term is more strictly applied to the arts of life , than in the English , in which we are more apt to associate with it the moral condition of a country . England stands at the head of modern civilization , as a whole , although many countries surpass her in particular parts . The higher tastes of England are not as refined and cultivated , perhaps , as those of Italy and France , but the base of society is infinitely more advanced . /q/ America occupies a middle place in the scale , warning most of the higher tastes , and excelling in that species of civilization which marks ease and improvement in the middling and lower classes . There is one feature connected with the civilization of this country that is peculiar ; for while the people have long been accustomed to the habits of England , they have not been possessed of those arts by which the different objects of the comforts they have enjoyed are produced . For a long time articles as humljle as hats , shovels and hoes , were not fabricated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Anglo-xlmericans were unaccustomed to their use . Although there is a difterence between the civilization of the towns , and that of the country , in America , it is less marked than in Europe . The disparity between the refinement , mental cultivation and the elegances of life , is much less apparent than usual , as between an American capital and an American village , though the localities , of course , make some distinctions . As a whole , civilization , while it is less perfect in this country than in the European nations , is more equally diffused throughout the entire community . Still it better becomes the American people to strive to advance their condition than to manifest a weak , unm.anly and provincial sensibility to the faults that are occasionally commented on , nations , like individuals , merely betraying a consciousness of their own demerits , by meeting admonition with insult and anger . The Americans are deficient on many points of civilization , solely for the want of physical force in given places , the practice of covering large surfaces unavoidably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of regret , than a matter of jeproach . They are almost ignorant of the art of /z/ music , one of the most elevating , innocent and refining of human tastes , whose influence on the habits and morals of a people is of the most beneficial tendency . This taste and knowledge are not only wanting to the people , but an appreciation of their importance . They are also wanting in most of the high tastes , and consequently in the high enjoyments , that accompany a knowledge of all the fine arts in general , and in much that depends on learning , research , and familiarity with the world . The Americans excel in humanity , in the ordinary comforts , though inferior to the English in this respect , in general civility , in the means of motion while confined to great routes , in shipping and most of the facilities of trade , in common instruction and an aptitude to ordinary pursuits , and in an absence of the sophisms that beset older and more artificial systems . It is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the struggle that created the ) resent system , the truths that came uppermost in the collision , are gradually yielding to a new set of sophisms , more peculiar to the present order of things . There is a familiar and too much despised branch of civilization , of which the population of this country is singularly and unhapp.ily ignorant ; that of cookery . The art of eating and drinking , is one of those on which more depends , perhaps , than on any other , since health , activity of mind , constitutional enjoyments , even learning , refinement , and , to a certain degree , morals , are all , more or less , connected with our diet . The Americans are the grossest feeders of any civilized nation known . As a nation , their food is heavy , coarse , ill prepared and indigestible , while it is taken in the least artificial forms that cookery will allow . The predominance of grease in the Amjerican kitclien , coupled witli the habits of hasty /z/ eating and of constant expectoration , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . The science of the table extends far beyond the indulgence of our appetites , as the school of manners includes healtli and morals , as well as that which is agreeable . Vegetable diet is almost converted into an injury in America , from an ignorance of the best modes of preparation , whih ; even animal food is much abused , and loses half its nutriment . The same is true as respects liquors . The heating and exciting wines , the brandies , and the coarser drinks of the laboring classes , all conspire to injure the physical and the moral man , while they defeat their own ends . These are points of civilization on which this country has yet much to learn , for while the tables of the polished and cultivated partake of the abundance of the country , and wealth has even found means to introduce some knowledge of the kitchen , there is not perliaj ) s on the face of the globe , the same number of people among whom the good things of the eartli are so much abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . National character is , in some measure , affected by a knowledge of the art of preparing food , there benig as good reason to suppose that man is as much affected by diet as any other animal , and it is certain that the connection between our moral and physical qualities is so intimate as to cause them to react on each other . /z/ The right of petition is guarantied to the American citizen by an amendment to the constitution , made in 1801 . By this clause , congress is prohibited from passing : any law to prevent the j9eo/ ? /e from peaceably assembling , in order to petition the government for a redress of grievances . This prohibition , like those on the subjects of the liberty of the press , liberty of speech and liberty of conscience , was perfectly supererogatory , the states having conceded to congress no authority to pass any law to the contrary . It is understood that all these provisions were introduced through the influence of Mr. Jefterson , who was desirous that the constitution should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of political faith , since foreigners did not comprehend the negative restrictions on the power of the federal government , that grow out of the fact of its being purely a government of deputed and defined authority . The right of petition is by no means an important political right in this country , where the constituents hold so strong a check on their representatives , and where no important laws can long exist without their approbation . In countries in which the people can not assemble to cause publick opinion to act on their rulers , and in which the great majority are disfranchised , or never possessed a vote , the right of petition is an all important right . Men confound the characters of the institutions of different nations , when they ascribe the same importance to it here . /q/ Although the people have a right to petition , congress is not bound to waste its time in listening to and in discussingthematter of petitions , on the merits of which that body has already decided . A discretionary power rests in congress to receive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right going no farther than the assembling and petitioning ; else would it be in the power of a small proportion of the people to occupy all the time of the national legislature on vexatious and useless questions . A state has no right to petition congress at all . The legislature of a state has its limited powers as well as congress , and , did the constitution of a particular state include this among the other powers of its legislature , the governing principle of the federal constitution is opposed to it . The right of petition as claimed by a state can do no legitimate good , and may lead to much evil , as a brief examination will show . The federal government acts directly on the people , through agents of its own ; for whenever it accepts the agency of a state , the agents of that state are in effect the agents of the general government . Now , the representation in one body of congress , is not a state representation , but it is a representation founded on numbers . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have the weight of another , whereas , in congress , one state has much more influence than another , as the following example will show . The senators of fourteen states may vote for the passage , or the rr ) ieal of a law , under the influence of petitions from their several state legislatures , and yet the veto of the representatives of the remaining twelve states shall dcfat the measure in the other house . It follows that the states , ) ijr ( ly ns states , are not Rt ) strictly constituents of conjrress ; is to claim ariffht petition . The danger of the practice is derived from /z/ the tenaencr of creating local feelings , through the agency of the local governments , and of thus endangering the peace of the Union . It would be difficult to show that a state has more right to petition congress , than congress has to petition a state . This interference of the different parts of a complicated and nicely balanced machine , might deransre its entire movement . njjin Commerce , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also usual to apply the word particularly to the traffick between nations . Navigation is not commerce , but a means of conducting commerce . Commerce is merely an incident of civilized society , though there is always a strong disposition in commercial communities to treat it as a principal . The interests of commerce , in a general sense , depend on certain great principles , which ought always to be respected ; but , as these interests , by their nature , are also liable to be influenced by the constant vicissitudes arising out of the fluctuations of trade , there is a strong disposition in those connected with commerce , to sacrifice all governing rules , to protect the interests of the day . This disposition is common to man , but it is more active in merchants , on account of the magnitude and precarious nature of the risks they run . The agriculturist who loses a crop , suffers an injury , more or less serious , that another year will repair ; but the merchant who loses his adventures , is usually ruined . /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , or which is materially influenced by men in trade , is governed without any fixed principles , every thing beiii g made to yield to the passing interests of the hour , those interests being too engrossing t/*admit of neglect , or postponement . It is a mistake to suppose commerce favorable to liberty . Its tendency is to a monied aristocracy , and this , in cftect , has always been the polity of every commuiiiiy of merchants . Commerce is an enemy of despotic power in the hands of a prince , of church influence , and of hereditary aristocracies , from which facts it has obtained its reputation of sustaining freedom ; but , as a class , merchants will always be opposed to the control of majorities . The true office of coi : fierce is to facilitate exchanges of articles betwtMi men , to the amount that their wants and interests require ; but as every transfer of property leaves a profit with the merchant , he has a disposition to increase his gains , by pushing his transactions beyond the just limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankruptcies , but , in a country like this , in which no such penalty exists , the consequence is to produce an unbroken succession of commercial reverses , that aftect the value of all the property in the nation , almost periodically . Commerce is entitled to a complete and efllcient protection in all its legal rights , but the moment it presumes to control a country , or to substitute its fluctuating expedients for the high principles of natural justice that onirht to lie at the root of every political system , it should be frowned on , and rebuked . The merchant who is the immediate agent in paying the duties on goods , has no more claims than another , as the moiiey eventually comes from the /z/ pocket of the consumer , and the factor is amply paid for his services in his profits . All legislation affecting the currency , commerce and banking , in a country like this , ought to be limited , as far as circumstances will allow , to general and simple provisions , the nature of the institutions forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar example will show our meaning . In all commercial communities there is a commercial mart , or a capital , where exchanges are effected , cargoes disposed of in gross , and where all the great interests of trade concentrate , as the blood flows to and from the heart . In identified governments , like that of England , for instance , legislation may respect this natural tendency to concentration in commerce , and enact laws for its especial benefit and protection . Thus an English law may have an especial relation to the interests of London , as the mart that regulates the entire currency of the kingdom . But , on the other hand , in a government like that of America , there is a principle of diffusion , which requires that the legislation should be general in its application . New York and New Orleans , for instance , regulate the currency and exchanges of the whole country ; but congress can not pass a law to aid these legitimate efforts of trade , since any legislation that should favor New York at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the controlling principle of the compact . It follows , that the interference of the government with all such questions , in this country , should be unfrequent and cautious , since it possesses a power to injure , with very little poAverto benefit . The real merchant is a man of a high pursuit , and has need of great general knowledge , much firmness of character , and of far-sighted views , to succeed in his objects . He is a principal agent in extending knowledge /q/ and civilization , and is entitled to a distinguished place in the scale of human employments . But the mere factor , uho is the channel of communication between the producer and the consumer , in what is called a regular trade , has no more claims to this character , than the clerk who copies a treaty has a claim to be considered a neirotiator. /z/ ON THE CIRCUI.ATING MEDIUiTI . Necessity has induced men to establish a certain standard of value , by means of the precious metals , to represent property . As it is desirable that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws have been passed rendering it illegal to receive more than a fixed rate of interest for money . There can be no question that these laws would be singularly useful , did not dealers find means to evade them , for a variation in the value of the representative of property , renders all contracts liable to the hazards of a fluctuation , in addition to that of the article purchased . It is to be feared , however , that nothing short of making usury criminal , will ever effect this object ; if , indeed , such a remedy be practicable . As the world does not contain a sufliiciency of the precious metals to represent any considerable amount of its debts , it has been found necessary to resort to a system of credits , for tho purposes of commerce , that is based on gold and silver . This system is so simple , that any one can understand it . The precious metals have a currency throughout Christendom , while the credit of an individual , or of a banking institution , is /z/ limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , is , that its paper should be redeemed in specie , as specie shall be wanted . In a country like America , a purely specie currency is utterly impracticable . Although money is not actually wanted for a tithe of the debts that are due , at any one moment , so much more is wanted than can be obtained in the precious metals , that a recourse to the credit system is unavoidable , as a single feature of the true condition of the country will show . America , in the states and territories , contains about twelve hundred thousand square miles . This immense country is in the course of settlement , and the transfers of real estate , are a hundred-fold what they are in FAirope , on the same extent of surface . A piece of land is frequently sold several times in the course of a single year , whereas centuries often elapse in older countries , without the sale of a given property . Every transfer of title causes an indebtedness , and consequently a necessity for a circulating medium to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiency of the precious metals , at their present value , to represent all the debts of this one country . ' On the other hand , notliing is easier than to abuse a system of credits . The unrestrained issue of papermoney , with its attendant contractions , keeps the value of property unsettled , creates pressures and bankruptcies , and otherwise produces the instability that so peculiarly marks the condition of American trade . Specie should be the basis of all currency . There should also be enough of the precious metals floating in the community , to meet its minor daily wants , the proper office of credit being to represent money in large sums , and not to represent money in small sums . For all the purposes of payments from the pocket , nothing is so convenient , or so safe , as gold and siU'er , fJN SLAVERY . /z/ : is all Yfho have tried it well know . Indeed , so palpable is the fact , tliat in Europe , men of wealth ahnost invariably use jold for this ) nrj ) ose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the standard of value in price , and it may be questioned if any j ) aper ouffht to b ( ! issued of a value less than fifty or a hundred dollars . In short , the precious metals are intended to circidate amonii those who have not the leisure nor knowledre to ascertain the credit of paper , while the credit system is to facilitate the operations of trade , and to supply the deficiency in jold and silver in the ) ayment of larger sums . Any to make paper do more than leiitimately belongs to its office , is an attempt to supjdant the interests of society by tserviag the interests of money dealers . JWi Domestic slavery is an institution as old as human annals , and probably will continue , in its spirit , through difterent modifications , as long as man shall remain under the different degrees of civilization that mark his actual existence . Slavery is no more sinful , by the christian code , than it is sinful to wear a whole coat , while another is in tatters , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy ease and plenty , while our fellow creatures are suffering and in want . According to the doctrines of Christ , we are " to do as we would be done by , " but this law is not to be applied to slavery more than to any other interest of life . It is quite possible to be an excellent christiaii - and a slave holder , and the xelatioiLs of master and /z/ slave , may be a meansof exhibiting some of the mildest graces of the character , as may those of king and subject , or principal and dependant , in any of the other modifications of human institutions . In one sense , slavery may actually benefit a man , there being little doubt that the African is , in nearly ail respects , better off in servitude in this country , than when living in a state of barbarism at home . But , while slavery , in the abstract , can no more be considered a sin , than most human ordinances , it leads to sin in its consequences , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an impolitic and vicious institution . It encourages those faults of character that depend on an uncontrolled will , on the one side , and an abject submission , on the other . It usually limits the moral existence of the slave , too , as there is a necessity of keeping him ignorant , in order that he may be held in subjection . Slavery is of two kinds ; one in which the slave is a chattel , and c ; in be disposed of as such , and one in which he is attached to the soil , hke a fixture , and can only be sold with the land . Tlie former is the condition of the American slave ; the latter the condition of the European serf . All Europe , formerly , had serfs , or slaves , of the latter class , though their existence is now confined lo a few countries in the north and east of that quarter of the world . Still , the consequences of the old system are , more or less , to be traced , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their people may as fairly be termed slaves in principle , as those of our own southern states . /z/ American slavery is of the most unqualified kind , considerinr the slave as a chattel , that is transferable at will , and in full property . The slave , however , is protected in his person to a certain extent , the power of the master to chastise and punish , amounting to no more than the parental X ) wer . American slavery is distinguished from that of most other parts of the world , by the circumstance that the slave is a variety of the human species , and is marked by physical peculiarities so difl'erent from his master , as to render future amalgamation improbable . In ancient Rome , in iwodern Europe generally , and , in most other countries , the slave not being thus distinguished , on obtaining his freedom , was soon lost in the mass around him : but nature has made a stamp on the American slave that is likely to prevent this consummation , and which menaces much future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American slavery shall cease , and when that day shall arrive , ( unless early and eltectual means are devised to obviate it , ) two races will exist in the same region , whose feelings will be embittered by inextinguishable hatred , and who carry on their faces , the respective stamy ) s of their factions . The struggle that will follow , will necessarily be a war of extermination . The evil day may be delayed , but can scarcely be averted . American slavery is mild , in its general features , and physical suflering can not properly be enumerated /z/ among its  --  vils . Neither is it just to lay too heavj stress on the personal restraints of the system , as it is a question whether men feel very keenly , if at all , privations of the amount of which they know nothing . In these respects , the slavery of this country is but one modification of the restraints that are imposed on the majority , even , throughout most of Europe . It is an evil , certainly , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is usually imagined . There is scarcely a nation of Euroje that does not possess institutions that inflict as gross personal privations and wronjis , as the slavery of America . Thus the subject is compelled to bear arms in a quarrel in which he has no real concern , and to incur the risks of demoralization and death in camps and fleets , without any crime or agency of his own . From all this , the slave is exempt , as well as from the more ordinarv cares of life . Slavery in America , is an institution purely of the states , and over which the United States has no absolute control . The pretence , however , that congress has no riglitto entertain the subject , is unsound , and can not be maintained . Observing the prescribed forms , slavery can be legally abolished , by amending the constitution , and congress has power , by a vote of two thirds of both houses , to propose amendments to that instrument . Now , whatever congress has power to do , it has power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral innovation on the rights of the states to discuss matters in congress , on which congress has no authority to legislate , A constitutional right , and expediency , however , are veiy different things . Congress has full power to declare war against all the nations of tiie earth , but it would be madness to declare war against even one of them , without sufficient ' Cause . It would be eua ! madness for congress , in. /q/ the present state of the country , to attempt to propose an amendment of the constitution , to abolish slavery altogether , as it would infallibly fail , " thereby raising an irritating- question without an object . sm Oi SLAVERY I. THE DISTRICT OF COEUiUBIA . Congress having all power to legislate for the District of Columbia , there can be no reasonable doubt of its power to legislate on slavery , as well as any other interest , under the limits of the constitution . A plausible question might even be raised whether the ordinary restrictions of the constitution apply at all to the legislation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular portion of the country , are not as absolute as the powers of parliament in Great Britain . Still the legislation for the District , in principle , depends on that general rule which ought to guide all just legislators . To pretend that a member of congress from Vermont , or a member of congress from Louisiana , is to respect the opinions of his own immediate constituents , in legislating especially for the District of Cqlumbia , is like pretending that the emperor of Austria , who is equally sovereign of both countries , should consult the interests of the people of the kingdom of Bohemia , in establishing laws for the kingdom of Hungary . The relation between the constituent of the member and the District , is altogether anomalous , and , on no just principle , can be made to extend to tiiis absolute control . /z/ All legislation that is especially intended for the District , should keep the interests of the District alone in view , subject to the great reasons for which this territory was formed , and to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the District is concerned , on the question of slavery , this legislation should be more in the interest of the slaveholding states , than in the interests of the non-slaveliolding states , as with the latter it is purely a negative question , whereas , with the former , it has a positive affirmative connection with their immediate interests , in more senses than one . Thus the slave-holder has a claim to be able to visit the seat of government , attended by his body servants , and this , too , without incurring any unpleasant risks of their loss merely to satisfy the abstract notions of right of the citizens of the non-slaveholding states . This claim may not be so great as to over-shadow those of the inhabitants of the District itself , should they demand a law for the emancipation of their slaves , but is quite great enough to overshadow the negative interests of the resident of a non-slave-holding state . In the management of this interest , in general , it ought 10 be remembered , thai to the citizen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstract principles , while to the citizen of the slave-holding state it offers a question of the highest practical importance , and one thai , mis-managed , might entirely subvert the order of his social organization . /z/ It is commonly said that political parties are necessary to liberty . This is one of the mistaken opinions that have been inherited from those who , living under governments in which there is no true political liberty , have fancied that the struggles which are inseparable from their condition , must be common to the conditions of all others . England , the country from which this people is derived , and , until the establishment of our own form of government , the freest nation of Christendom , enjoys no other liberty than that which has been obtained by the struggles of parties . Still retaining in the bosom of the state , a power in theory , which , if carried out in practice , would effectually overshadow all the other powers of the state , it may truly be necessary to hold such a force in check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America , in no respect , resembles this . Here , the base of the government is the constituencies , and its balance is in the divided action of their representatives , checked as the latter are by frequent elections . As these constituencies are popular , the result is a free , or a popular government . Under such a system , in which the fuiulamental laws are settled ) y a written compact , it is not easy to see what good can be done by parties , while it is easy to see that they may effect much harm . It is the object of this article , to point out a few of the more prominent evils that originate from such a source . /z/ Party is known to encourage prejudice , and to lead men astray in the judgment of character . Thus it is we see one half the nation extoIHng those that the other half condemns , and condemning those that the other half extols . Both can not be right , and as passions , interests and prejudices are all enlisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that both are wrong . Party is an instrument of error , by pledging men to support its policy , instead of supporting the policy of the state . Thus we see party measures almost always in extremes , the resistance of opponents inducing the leaders to ask for more than is necessary . Party leads to vicious , corrupt and unprofitable legislation , for the sole purpose of defeating party . Thus have we seen those territorial divisions and regulations which ought to be permanent , as well as other useful laws , altered , for no other end than to influence an election . Party , has been a means of entirely destroying that local independence , which elsewhere has given rise to a representation that acts solely for the nation , and which , under other systems is called the countiy party , every legislator being virtually pledged to support one of two opinions ; or , if a shade of opinion between them , a shade that is equally fettered , though the truth be with neither . The discipline and organization of party , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting managers in the place of the people ; it being of little avail that a majority elect , when the nomination rests in the hands of a few . Party is the cause of so many corrupt and incompetent men 's being preferred to power , as the elector , who , in his own person , is disposed to resist a bad /q/ nomination , yields to the influence and a dread of factions . Party pledges the representative to the support of the executive , right or wrong , when the institutions intend that he shall be pledged only to justice , expediency and tiie right , under the restrictions of the constitution . Wlicn ) arty rules , the people do not rule , but merely such a ) ortion of the people as can manage to get the control of party . The only method by which the people can completely control the countr- , is by electing representatives known to prize and understand the institutions ; and , who , so far from being pledged to support an administration , are pledged to su ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees that this pledge will be respected . The effect of party is always to supplant established power . In a monarchy it checks the king ; in a democracy it controls the people . Party , by feeding the passions and exciting personal interests , overshadows truth , justice , patriotism , and every other publick virtue , completely reversing the order of a democracy , by putting unworthy motives in the place of reason . It is a very ditferent thing to be a democrat , and to be a member of what is called a democratic party ; for the first insists on his independence and an entire freedom of opinion , while the last is incompatible with either . The great body of the nation has no real interest in party . Every local election should be absolulrly independent of great party divisions , and until this be done , the intentions of the American institutions will never be carried out , in their excellence . Party misleads the j ) ublic mind as to the rights and duties of the citizen . An instance has- recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States of America , the descendant of generations of Americans , has become the object of systematic and combined persecution , because he pubhshed a constitutional opinion that conflicted with the interests and passions of party , ahhough having no connection with party himself ; very many of his bitterest assailants being foreigners , who have felt themselves authorized to pursue this extraordinary course , as the agents oi party I No freeman , who really loves liberty , and who has a just perception of its dignity , character , action and objects , will ever become a mere party man . H  - -  may have his preferences as to measures and men , may act in concert with those who think with himself , on occasions that require concert , but it Mill be his earnest endeavour to hold himself a free agent , and most of all to keep his mind untrammelled by the prejudices , frauds , and tyrranny of factions . m /z/ Individuality is the aim of political liberty . By leaving to the citizen as much freedom of action and of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the institutions render him truly a freeman . He is left to pursue his means of happiness in his own manner . It is a curious circumstance , that , in endeavouring to secure the popular rights , an effect has been produced in this country totally opposed to this main object . Men have been so long accustomed to see /q/ oppression exercised in the name of one , or in the name of a few , that they have jnroi to consider the sway of numbers as the only criterion of freedom . Numbers , however , may oppress as well as one or a few , and when such oppression occurs , it is usually of the worst characttT . The habit of seeinjr the ) ublick rule , is fradually accusLominn the American mind to an interference with private riThts that is slowly undermining the individu. ' dity of the national character . There is getting to be so much publick right , that private right is overshadowed and lost . A danger exists that the ends of liberty will he forgotten altogether in the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man who has no other existence than that which he partakes in common with all around him , will never have any other than an existence of mediocrity. lu time , siich a state of things would aimihilate invention and paralyze genius . A nation would become a nation of conuuon ) lace labourers . The pursuit of happiness is inseparable from the claims of indinduality . To compel all to follow this object in the same manner , is to op ) ress all above the average tastes and information . It can only be done at the expense of that which is the aim of liberty . An entire distinct individuality , in the social state , is neither possible nor desirable . Our hap ) ine.ss is so connected with the social and family ties as to prevent it ; but , if it be possible to render ourselves miserable by aspiring to an independence that nature forbids , It is also possible to be made unhappy by a too obtrusive interference with our individuality . Of all Christian countries , indi iduality , as connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of all Cliristian countries this is the /z/ one , perhaps , in which there is the least individuaHty of the same nature . The latter fact would be extraordinary , could it not be referred to the religious discipline that so much influenced the colonists , and which in a measure supplied the place of law . In communities in which private acts became the subject of publick parochial investigation , it followed as a natural consequence , that men lived under the constant corrective of piiblick opinion , however narrow , provincial , or prejudiced . This feature of the American character , therefore , is to be ascribed , in part , to the fanaticism of our ancestors , and , in part , to the natural tendency in democracies to mistake and augment the authority of the publick. mss /z/ ' They say , " is the monarch of this country , in a social sense . No one asks " who says it , " so long as it is believed that " tliey say it . " Designing men endeavor to persuade the publick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designing men wish to be said , and the publick is only too much disposed blindly to join m the cry of " they say . " This is another consequence of the habit of defering to the control of the publick , over matters in which the publick has no right to interfere . Every well meaning man , before he yields his faculties and intelligence to this sort of dictation , should first ask himself " who " is * ' they , " and on what authority " they say " utters its mandates. /z/ The people of the United States are unusually liable to be imposed on by false rumours . In addition to the causes that exist elsewhere , such as calculated and interested falsehoods , natural frailty , political machinations , and national antipathies , may be enumerated many that are peculiar to themselves . The fjreat number of , and the imperfect organization of the newspaper establishments , as has already teen shown , is a principal reason ; necessity , in some degree , compelling a manufacture of * news , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , the comparative intelligence of the inhabitants , an intelligence that is often sufficient to incite inquiry , but insufficient for discrimination , the habit of forming opinions , which is connected with the institutions , the gr-eat ease of the population , which aftbrds time for gossip , and the vast extent of the surface over which the higher intelligence , that can alone rebuke groundless and improbable rumours , is diffused , are so many reasons for the origin and increase of false reports . Falsehood and truth are known to be inseparable , every where , but as rumour gains by distance , tliey are necessarily more mixed together in this country , than in regions where the comparative smallncss of surface renders contradiction easier . The frecpiency and all controlling character of the elections ke ( p rumours of a certain sort in constant circulation , bringing in corruption and design in support of other motives . /z/ The ability to discriminate between that which is true and that which is false , is one of the last attainments of the human mind . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse with mankind , But one may pass an entire life , in a half-settled and half-civilized portion of the world , and not gain as much acquaintance with general things , as is obtained by boys who dwell in regions more populous . The average proportion between numbers and surface in America , is about twelve to the square mile , whereas , it approaches three hundred , in the older countries of Europe ! On this single fact depends much more , in a variety of ways , than is commonly believed . /z/ As reason and revelation both tell us that this state of being is but a preparation for another of a still higher and more spiritual order , all the interests of life are of comparatively little importance , when put in the balance against the future . It is in this grand fact that we are to seek for the explanations of whatever may strike us as unjust , partial , or unkind in the dispensations of Providence , as these dispensations affect our temporal condition . If there is no pure and abstract liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things of the world that we are accustomed to fancy good , on remembering the speck of time passed in the present state , the possibility that what to us may seem a curse , may in truth be a blessing , the certainty that prosperity is more corrupting /q/ than adversity , we shall find the solution of all our difficulties . In a religious point of view , it may be permitted to endeavor to improve our temporal condition , by the use of lawful and just means , but it is never ) roper to repine . Christ , in the ) arable of the vine dressers , has tauoht us a sublime lesson of justice , by showing that to the things which are not our own , we can have no just claim . To this obvious truth , may be added the uncertaiiuy of the future , and the ignorance in which we exist of what is good , or what is evil , as respects our own wants . There ts but one true mode of viewing life , either in a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember it is a state of probation in which the trials exceed the enjoyments , and that , while it is lawful to endeavor to increase the latter , more especially if of an intellectual and elevated kind , both form but insignificant interests in the great march of time . Whatever may be the apparent inequalities here , and even they are less real rlian they appear to be , it is certain that we bring nothing with us into the world , ' and lliat we take nothing out of it . Every thing around serves to teach the lesson that , though inecpudity of condition here is as prol ) ably intended for some great end as it is unavoidable , we come from a state of being in which we know of no such law , to go to one that we have divine revelation for believing will render the trilling disparities and the greatest advantages of this life , matters of insignificance , except as they have had an **25;247;TOOLONG , characters anrl faith . It would be just as discreet for a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created with such a want , while others are feeding , as to repine that another enjoys advantages he can not possess . In this country , the aim has been to /z/ reduce all the factitious inequalities of station , condition , wealth and knowledge- , to a state as natural as comports with civilization , and beyond this it exceeds the power of man to go , without returning to the condition of the savage . Let him , then , on whom the world bears hard , seek his consolation in that source which is never drained , and where more contentment is to be found than shadows a throne , or smiles on riches and power . If it be a positive thing to be a gentleman , or a lady , and as much a follj to deny it as to deny that a horse is an animal , it is equally positive that we carry in us a principle of existence that teaches us , however good and pleasant may seem the outward blessings of the world , that there are still blessings of infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperishable . The limits and objects of this work neither require , nor admit of very profound dissertations , but a few words on the peculiarities of religion and of rehgious feeling in America , may not be misplaced . The causes which led to the establishment of the principal American colonies , have left a deep impression on the character of the nation . In some respects this impression has been for good , in others for evil . Our business is with the latter . Fanaticism was the fault of the age , at the time our ancestors took possession of the country , and its exaggerations have entailed on their descendants many opinions that are , at the best , ofa very equivocal usefulness . These opinions are to be detected by the contracted nations of those who entertain them , and by a general want of that charity and humility , which are the most certain attendants of the real influence of the meek and beneficent spirit of Christ . In America the taint of sectarianism lies broad upon vthe land . Not content with acknowledging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples in his honor , Avhcre all can bow down with reverence , tiie pride and vanity of human reason enter into and pollute our worship , and the houses that should be of God and for God , alone , where he is to be honored with submissive faith , are too often merely schools of metaphysical and useless distinctions . The nation is sectarian , rather than Christian . Reliction 's first lesson is humility ; its fruit , charity . In the great and sublime ends of iVovidence , little things are lost , and least of all is he imbued with a right spirit who believes that insignificant observances , subtleties of doctrine , and minor distinctions , enter into the great essentials of the Christian character . The wisest thing for him Avho is disposed to cavil at the immaterial habits of his neighbor , to split straws on doctrine , to fancy trifles of importance , and to place the man before principles , would be to distrust himself The spirit of peace is not with him . The institutions of the country , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have preserved the ordinances necessary to civilized society , have removed the factitious barriers from one particular vice , which , while it belongs to the nature of man , may be termed a besetting sin of this country . We shall conclude this article , therefore , by simply quoting the stern mandate of the tenth commandment : " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's house ; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife ; nor his nan-servant , nor his maid-servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing tliat is thy neiofhbor ' -s . " The inferences to be drawn from the foregoing reasons and facts , admitting both to be just , may be briefly summed up as follows . No expedients can equalize the temporal lots of men ; for without civilization and government , the strong would oppress the weak , and , with them , an inducement to exertion must be left , by bestowing re7ards on talents , industry and success . All that the best institutions , then , can achieve , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artisan of its own fortune , without always degrading demerit to the place it ought naturally to fill . Every human excellence is merely comparative , there beinof no ifood without allov . It is idle therefore to expect a system that shall exhibit faultlessness , or perfection . The terms liberty , equality , right and justice , used in a political sense , are merely terms of convention , and of comparative excellence , there being no such thing , in practice , as either of these qualities being carried out purely , according to the abstract notions of theories . The affairs of life embrace a multitude of interests , and he who reasons on any one of them , without consulting the rest , is a visionary unsuited to control the business of the world . There is a prevalent disposition in the designing to forget the means in the end , and on the part of the mass to overlook the result in the more immediate agencies . The first is the consequence of cupidity ; the last of short-sightedness , and frequently of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a democracy , as the first unsettles principles while it favors artifice , and the last is substituting the trarn sient motives of a day , for the deliberate policy and collected wisdom of ages . Men are the constant dupes of names , v/hile their happiness and well-being mainly depend on things . The highest proof a community can give of its fitness for self government , is its readiness in distinguishing between the two ; for frauds , oppression , flattery and vice , are the oirs ) ring of the mistakes . It is a governing principle of natm'e , that the agency which can produce most good , when perverted from its proper aim , is most productive of evil . It behoves the well-intentioned , therefore , vigilantly to watch the tendency of even their most highly prized institutions , since tliat which was established in the interests of the right , may so easily become the agent of the wrong . The disposition of all power is to abuses , nor does it at all mend the matter that its possessors are a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses , can not be trusted without positive limitations , men in bodies being but an aggregation of the passions , weaknesses and interests of men as individuals . It is as idle to expect what is termed gratitude , in a democracy , as from any other repository of power . Bodies of men , though submitting to human impulses generally , and often sympathetic as well as violent , are seldom generous . In matters that touch the common feeling , tliey are avaricious of ) raise , and they usually visit any want of success in apublick man , as a personal wrong . Thus it is that we see a dozen victories forgotten in a single defeat , an irritable vanity in the ) lace of a masculine ) ) ride , and a sensitivenes  - -  to opinion , instead of a just appreciation of acts . /z/ Under every system it is more especially the office of the prudent and candid to guard against the evils peculiar to that particular system , than to declaim against the abuses of others . Thus , in a democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is wiser to look into the sore spots of the only form of government that can do any practical injury , and to apply the necessary remedies , than to be glorifying ourselves at the expense ot charity , common sense , and not unfrequently of truth . Life is made up of positive things , the existence of which it is not only folly , but which it is often unsafe to deny . Nothing is gained by setting up impracticable theories , but alienating opinion from the facts under which we live , all the actual distinctions that are inseparitble from the possession of property , learnings breeding , refinement , tastes and principles , existing aswell in one form of government , as in another ; the only difterence between ourselves and other nations , in this particular , lying in the fact that there are no other artificial distinctions than those that are inseparable from the recognised principles and indispensable laws of civilization . There is less real inequality in the condition of men than outward circumstances would give reason to believe . If refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , the high consolations of religion , in which lies the only lasting and true relief from the cares and seeming injustice of the world , are equally attainable , or , if there be a disadvantage connected with this engrossing interest , it is against those whose lots are vulgarly supposed to be the most desirable .
