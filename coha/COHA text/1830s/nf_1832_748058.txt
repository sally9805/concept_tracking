txt IF it be true that the Arts are relished in proportion as they are understood , and encoursied as they become familiar ; it is surely the duty as well as the interest of every professor freely to communicate the principles of his art , and to make its practice generally intelligible . For these purposes the following Designs fir Rural Builcfings , accompanied by some practical observations , were presented to the public in the ** Repository of Arts/ ' under the title of Architectural Hints , during the successive months of the years 1816 and 1817. - The proprietor of that work having received such applications for the series of deagos , in a separated form , as induces him to re-publish them ; farther observations have been added to supply , in part , the many deficiencies which necessarily occurred from so desultory a manner of publication . /z/ There is much reason to believe that architecture in this country has failed to receive its proportion of public patronage , because the public has not distinguished it as a fine art , subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant fancy and sound judgment ; but has rather considered it as a mechanical operation , in which the mere builder is fully com- /z/ petent to all its duties : - thus the villas that surround London , the country residences of the most wealthy of its inhabitants , not being designed by the architect , are little more than mere cases of brick , in which a certain number of apartments are injudiciously arranged , presenting to the eye a continuity of illbestowed expense and tasteless absurdities , disgraceful to the proprietors and offensive to true taste . In London , also , the speculative builder has generally superseded the labours of the artist , for the architect is there rarely called upon , unless it be to remedy the errors , or supply some of the deficiencies as well of art , as of practical science . The result of this system of building is an obvious perversion of true architecture ; and , consequently , the modem streets of London present repetitions of the same vapid elevations of mere perforated walls , that disgust the man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreigners . Some noblemen , and other enlightened persons have , however , munificently encouraged architecture , by the erection of splendid dwellings ; and in several instances , the architect , engaged by the liberality of public bodies , has been afforded an elevated and dignified employment , by which he has , in some degree , rescued the architectural reputation of the country fix ) m that obloquy to which it would have been abandoned , by the apathy , or ignorance , which too generally prevails . Sir William Chambers very justly observes that it must not be imagined that buildings , considered merely as heaping stone upon stone , can be of advantage , or reflect honour either on INTRODUCTION . vil countries or particular persons . - Materials in architecture are like words in phraseology , which , singly , have little or no power , and may be so arranged as to excite contempt ; yet , when combined with art and expressed with energy , they actuate the mind with unbounded sway . A good poet can move even with homely language ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustre to the vilest materials , as the feeble efforts of an ignorant pretender must render the most costly enrichments despicable . The progress of other arts depends on that of architecture : - when building is encouraged , painting , sculpture , gardening , and all the other decorative arts flourish of course , and these have an influence on manufactures , even on the minutest mechanic productions ; for design is of universal advantage , and stamps a value on the most trifling performances ; the consequences of which , to a trading people , are too obvious to require illustration . With this conviction the following designs and observations were made , as an introduction to the threshold of art ; believing , in the extensive circulation obtained by the publication in which they first appeared , that they would afford useful information , and invite many to consider architecture as being less dependant on physical , than intellectual skill , and in some degree assist in removing the prejudices that obstruct the progress of that encouragement , by which alone it can maintain its power oif executing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to after ages , the prosperity , greatness , and talent of the country . /z/ To the architect , this little work neither affords , nor assumes to afford information ; but , in a humbler walk , it seeks to unite with the labours of many eminent men , in an attempt to instil into the public mind a real love for architeeture , by developing its principles and its practice . The Frontispiece , or Plate 1 , is a design for a bath and ornamental garden building . By an additional room in the rear it would be of sufficient size for the occupation of a labouring gardener , if the bath were wholly omitted . /z/ COTTAGES , &c.; /z/ 1 HE habitations of the labouring poor may be rendered ornamental , and the comforts of them increased , at a very trifling charge beyond the cost of common buildings ; towards this purpose the annexed plate is designed for four cottages , connected with each other , and under one roof ; a mode of building that admits a considerable saving of expense . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too simple ; the ornaments which iancy in her playful mood may suggest , ill associate with the modest and moderate claims of this respectable and useful class of society ; the symbols of ease and luxury are incongruous with the labourer 's busy life and frugal means , and ought therefore to be omitted ; but a gracefulness of form and proportion is as applicable to this edifice as to the mansion , and there are also genuine embellishments belonging to the cottage of the British labourer , which if denied , an important /z/ 10 labourers ' cottages . source of rural beauty has lost its best sentiment with its greatest charm : the broken casement , the patched wall , the sunken roof , the hatch unhinged , the withered shrub , are corresponding testimonies of the husbandman 's relaxed energies and broken spirit . The porch in which he rests after the fatigues of the day , ornamented by some flowering creeper , at once affords him shade and repose ; neatness and cleanliness connected with these and other means of external cheerfulness , bespeak that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce industry and cheerfulness , and demonstrate that peace and content at least , dwell with its inhabitants . The labourer 's cottage should be placed in a situation so raised above the common level of the ground , that the rains and meltings of the snow shall readily escape from it ; for , although the chambers should invariably be above stairs , some part of the family occasionally sleep on the ground-floor , which , notwithstanding it may be boarded , is often rendered unhealthful by the damps that are commonly concealed beneath it : the dryness of his habitation is among the foremost of the husbandman 's comforts . If it be possible , the lowest part of the wall should be higher than the level of the highest standing water in the ponds and ditches about its neighbourhood , or the foundation will partake of their contents ; and drains should be made from it that the water , which will from various sources collect there , may immediately be carried off . Without this precaution , the trench that is dug for the foundation becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is this water which , having no means of escape , too frequently rises by capillary attractions , as also by the absorbing nature of the materials of which the building is composed , to some feet above the floor of the lower apartments of a house , and damages the skirtings , dadoes , and plastering ; /q/ and to this stagnant water is often traced that corruption which causes the dry-rot in its floors and timbers . Where a drain can not be made from the foundation , owing to the necessity of building in a low situation , the capillary attraction should be arrested by a course of slates , lead , or other substance , placed all round the building the whole width of the walls , and immediately above the level of the ground . It may be readily conceived , that when the earth is wet on which a house is built , the consequent rarefaction of the air , produced by fires or by the mere inclosure , will cause an exudation of moisture from it , that will render the lower rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon bec ( Hne dry , and cease to issue these vapours , unless the wet is renewed by the progress of water through the substrata of the earth : when this circumstance is suspected , and it is one that must take place when the building is on the side of a hill , it is judicious to cut a channel or ditch several feet deep a few yards above the site of the house , and extending some yards on each side of it , so disposing the chainnel , that the water it collects may thence be conveyed to drains in the lower ground beyond the building itself ; if the channel be made narrow at the bottom , and large stones or brick rubbish be thrown in , to about two feet deep , these covered with bush-wood , and the ground filled in upon them , the drain will not be perceived , and large quantities of water may often be diverted from its natural course , that without some such remedy , would render the building uninhabitable . These observations may be considered as applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose name does not immediately occur , has built cottages for his work-people , and of necessity in a very damp situation , it being low , and near the current of the river Wandle : he has succeeded in intercepting the floor damps . 12 labourers ' cottages . by covering the area of the whole cottage , even including the walls , with the composition called tessera : it lies on the ground and on the walls , both being prepared for it , one step or six inches above the common level of the ground . The tessera being kept at a medium temperature by the continually wet earth beneath , fully answers this purpose : it is not , however , intended to bestow encomiums upon it for any other . It is desirable , that every situation adopted for a cottage should afford to it a piece of ground for a small garden : usually the policy as well as the humanity of the proprietor will suggest the necessity of such a disposition of a small part of his domain . There are moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard day 's toil , that the uncultivated mind of the husbandman can not afford to lose in idleness , and he has but little refuge from the temptations of the village alehouse , if the culture of such a piece of ground is denied him ; a . few fruittrees are planted at little expense ; they afford a produce to bis family of great value , and by the potatoes and herbage that he cultivates as substitutes for more expensive fare , he is enabled to save something for those little purchases which many cottagers feel the want of severely during the inclemencies of winter . The morals of the man are preserved , the example of a sober and industrious father is before his children , the wife is happy in the presence of her husband , and society rejoices that another of its members is an honour to his humble state . There is no important moral work so cheaply effected , perhaps , as thus amending the condition of the poor , in thus allowing them the exercise of so much of the natural pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of pride ; and happy indeed is he who feels its influence , and evinces it only by the neatness of his habitation , and by the quantity or quality of the vegetable which , by his care and industry , his little garden produces . /z/ gardener 's cottage . 13 /z/ ALTHOUGH the annexed design was made expressly for the residence of the gardener to a nobleman 's establishment , it is quite applicable to the purpose of a lodge ; and if a little simplified in point of embellishment , would also be proper for the cottage of the husbandman : in each of these applications it would afford convenience and comfort , and might receive suitable enrichment by the plantations which should surround the two former , or by the more free and open scenery suitable to the latter . The cottage of the gardener , in very many instances , is considered to be a legitimate embellishment of the grounds , being very properly situated near the forcing and successionhouses , that they may receive the attendance of the chief gardener , with as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in the decoration of his abode , he has the means of embowering it with shrubs , creepers , and flowering plants , by which he may render it highly interesting , provided the design is favourable , and the situation appropriate to its object . This building is proposed to be thatched with reeds , as the most rural and picturesque covering ; the brown tints of its surface oppose the various greens of the foliage by which it is accompanied , and give a neatness of effect that is very prepossessing , which may be improved by the colour given to the walls , should they be built of materials that do not harmonize with them . For the covering of such buildings , rough-cast is very proper . 14 gardener 's cottage . which is plastering finished by a coat of lime mixed with small stones about the size of a pea or small bean , and splashed upon it before the plastering is yet dry ; or by paretta work , so called from the French paroltre to appear , to be seen - or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the plastering has pebbles of a larger size pressed all over it , and which are not afterwards covered by lime-wash , or colour , but exhibit their own surfaces , and the whole becomes enriched by the white reticulation of the plastering in which they are set . The colours of the pebbles should be selected th taste , as much of the beauty of the whole will depend on their fitness to harmonize with those hues by which they are surrounded . Notwithstanding cottages of this description are usually built with brick , yet as the complexion of them is at variance with the green tints of the scenery , particularly if they are the red woodburned bricks of the country , the coverings before named are usually adopted for small decorative buildings ; and for this purpose also a finishing of a very novel and fanciful effect is produced by a sort of rough-cast composed of coarse sand and small pebbles of various sizes , mixed up with Roman cement , diluted to the consistency of common rough-cast , and thrown upon the walls in larger quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular and projecting forms of stalactUa , those concretions resembling icicles that are frequently found in natural grottoes ; and they may be coloured afterwards by tints representing them , or by others that seem to mark a lapse of time : this has hitherto been practised only in two instances . The materials of which a cottage is to be built depend greatly on the nature of the supply the county of its site affords ; wood , with brick pannels , covered with rough-cast . Brick , roughcasted or coloured , or stone , for the walls , is to be preferred ; and reeds , straw , or slates for the roof . A tasteful mind will gardener 's cottage . 15 readily select those materials which , when combined , shall make an agreeable whole . A cheap walling for cottages is made in some counties of the west of England , which the builders denominate cob-work : it is a compost of clay , small gravel , and straw , beaten well together , and applied of a substance sufficient to form the wall , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more scientific and durable walling has been some time adopted introduced to us by the late Mr. Holland , the architect . It is called pisS , and is in great repute in Italy and the south of France ; at this time it is well known in England . If seyeral cottages ' are to be built for the labouring class of men , it is on every account worthy to be adopted . A foundation of stone or brick must be prepared to receive the pis6 , about a foot and a half above the surface of the ground ; the native loam is then prepared , and a species of coffer or chest is applied to the foundation , and so arranged that the loam may be thrown into it , and compressed , by frequent beatings with a mallet , to form a portion of the wall the size of the coffer . When this portion is complete , the chest is moved forward to form the next portion , and so on until the wall is about two or three feet high ; upon this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pisS wall is high enough to receive the roof : the doors and windows are cut out after the wall is otherwise completed . The process at length will be found in the quarto volume of Communications y published by the Board of Agriculture about thirty years ago : a greatly improved operation of the p%s6 walling has since been separately published . In adopting this building for a lodge at the entrance of the grounds , the porch end on the right of the design should be presented to the road , as affording external shelter in its proper place , for servants to wait under , and other such purposes ; also because the effect would be more picturesque , and.tihe building 16 gardener 's cottage . appear of a size less than its real magnitude , a circumstance to be desired , for as residences to which such a lodge would be applicable are not large , the lodge should not assume to be a striking feature in the approach , but appear to be placed there rather as a matter of necessity or convenience than of ostentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked and neatly-laid pebbles , bordered and confined by stone margins , on which the pillars would stand , and with which the plinths of the walls would be surrounded . - The wood- work might be painted like dark oak , and the casements leaded in diamonds , sexagons , or other forms . The lean-to intended for a sort of wash-house or scullery , recedes from both the ends , and thus admits of sufficient planting effectually to conceal it , and yet allow the building , which is ample for a lodge , to appear as compact as can be desired . steward 's cottage . 17 /z/ ORNAMENTAL buildings of a rural character have been so generally adopted during the last twenty years , that the principles on which they are designed have become fully understood , and a sort of systematized disposition of their parts , as also of the materials with which they are composed , has taken place : the eye expects therefore to find in the humblest tenements a tasteful display of this order of rural architecture , if it may be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him , endeavour to trace the origin of regular architecture up . to that period when buildings of wood were the habitations of man ; the roofs being chiefly supported by trunks of trees , to which , in process of time , by an insensible prcess , succeeded the polished orders of Grecian and Roman architecture . ' ' Mankind , ' * says Sir William Chambers , " improving in the art of building , invented methods to make their huts lasting and handsome , as well as convenient . They took off the bark and other unevennesses from the trunks of trees that formed the sides , raised them probably above the dirt and humidity on stones , and covered each of them with a flat stone or slate to keep off the rain . The spaces between the ends of the joists were closed with clay , wax , or some other substance , and the ends of the joists were covered with thin boards cut in the manner of triglyphs . The roof was raised in the middle , to throw off the rains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the form of a gable roof , by placing rafters on the joists , to support the earth and other materials that composed the covering . " From this simple construction the orders of architecture took c 18 steward 's cottage . their rise : for when buildings of wood were set aside , and men began to erect solid and stately edifices of stone , they imitated the parts which necessity had introduced into its primitive huts ; insomuch that the upright trees , with the stone at each end of them , were the origin of columns , bases , and capitals ; and the beams , joists , and rafters , and strata of materials that formed the covering , gave birth to friezes , triglyphs , and cornices , with the corona , the mutules , the modillions , and the dentils . The architects of the present day , attempting to combine fitness and beauty in rural buildings , revert to the above practices in the infancy of art , and , forming their designs upon these simple models , gain some advantage by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by its legitimate , though distant , affinity with the ultimate perfection of Grecian architecture . The styles that have been introduced in small dwellings and rural retreats have not been numerous , notwithstanding many tastes have been consulted : sometimes it is formed from the simple model of frugality , whence it was originally taken , with a rigid adherence to its perfect simplicity ; at another , more ornament is introduced , but of a very rustic character , with no feature beyond what might have been the genuine effort of a tasteful husbandman . A third style has advanced a little farther towards art , and forms from Grecian or Gothic architecture have been adopted with a pleasing effect . In other instances , a more extended licence has been taken , and the model entirely neglected for farther efforts of the fancy to obtain the sentiment of rural or picturesque beauty . The cottage represented in the annexed plate is designed upon the earliest principle , and intended for the residence of the under-steward to a nobleman 's estate : it would be ornamental steward 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque feature to the adjoining country , as well as an agreeable residence . An out-house at a short distance , would contain the dairy and wood-house , which might be connected by a passage from the cellars beneath the building . The elevation , connected as it is with the fence , would be suitable to a small lodge , or as a decorative cottage in a park ; and being covered with thatch and the wood-work of oak , or painted to represent it , the cottage would have a simple and pleasing effect . In such buildings the neatness and durability of the thatch is an important consideration , and for these purposes reeds are greatly to be preferred to straw , as also for the advantages that reed-thatching has in point of colour . Straw affords by the grain that usually remains in the ear , even after the best threshing , a temptation to birds , mice , and many kinds of vermin , and accordingly they assail the roof often before the work is finished , for it is known that mice are frequently carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed ; thus in a short time it becomes damaged , and eventually destroyed as a perfect covering by the havoc that these little creatures make both on its surface and in its substance , and when once established in their comfortable quarters , they are not easily dispossessed : reeds on the contrary hold out no such temptations , and their rigid and sharp ends present insurmountable obstacles to all their attempts to burrow or displace them . The verges and ridges of reed-thatching , both in appearance and in reality , are more substantial , firmer , and neater than the best workmen can produce by means of straw alone ; and the colour which it obtains by lapse of time , becomes earlier in harmony with the foliage that usually accompanies such rural edifices. 20 stewaed 's cottage . In counties where reeds are readily obtained , the expense is a little more than straw ; but where labour and reeds are only to be had from a considerable distance , it is proportionably an expensive covering ; this circumstance is not however always fatal to the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than straw , in case of accident , either externally from the chimney tops , or internally from negligence , many persons willingly submit to the increased expense to obtain the additional security ; and although very few accidents of this kind occur either to straw or reedthatching , the sum on every account is usefully expended . The eaves should be amply substantial and cut so as to exhibit a portion of its thickness to the spectator , which is done by cutting off its sharp termination , and thus the eaves finish with two obtuse angles instead of an acute one . /z/ bailiff 's cottage . 21 /z/ THIS small and ornamental building would contain six rooms , three on the ground-floor , and three chambers above them : if needful , and the situation would admit of digging for under-ground cellars , they might be formed beneath one or more parlours , as the family to occupy it should require . The steward , bailiff , or farmer to an estate , would find this a convenient and comfortable building ; and being notwithstanding , small in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque accompaniment to rural scenery . Few embellishments of an estate are more interesting than those small buildings which compose the farm-oflSces and residences for the active , the superannuated , or other servants of the domain , particularly if they are designed in a manner conformable to the surrounding scenery , and distributed about the property with judgment . Such buildings , neat , clean , and in good repair , become testimonies of that liberality and care of his dependants that have always been distinguishing features in the character of a British gentleman . The walls are designed to be of brick-work , and the roof to be covered with rag-slating ; the ornamental parts being executed in the Roman cement , and the walls colour to match it . An useful and durable paint for such purposes is manufactured from the refuse materials in the preparation of other paints , and called the Roman anti-corrosive ; it is not more expensive than , paints in general , and possesses several very important properties suitable to outside painting . 22 bailiff 's cottage . The labouring class of agriculturalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the public attention is now so fully called to consider the condition of the poor , and particularly that of the cottager , and as so much speculation has consequently taken place on the means of increasing their comforts , and on lessening the demands for parochial and other aid , a relation of any successful means that has hitherto been employed for the purpose must be interesting : the following having borne the test of experience it will be the more acceptable , as it proves the advantages which result from giving the labourer the means of employing his surplus time . A commonable land belonging to a parish was inclosed , and an allotment , containing twenty-five acres , set out for the use of such of the poor as rented less than ten pounds a-year , to be stocked in common . Previous to the inclosure , there were some few cottages that had land let with them , to the amount of six or seven pounds a-year each . The occupiers of those cottages with land annexed to them , were remarkable for bringing up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose cottages were without land ; and it was this circumstance that led to the laying out of a plot of lands , besides the common before mentioned , to other cottages , and to add a small building sufficient to contain a horse or cow ; and likewise to the grafting of stocks to raise orchards . In some instances small sums of money were lent to these cottagers for the purchase of a cow , a mare , or a pig . The following good effects were the consequence of this proceeding : ' ' It has not in one instance failed in giving an industrious turn even to some of those who were before idle and profligate ; their attention in nursing up the young trees has been so much beyond what a farmer , intent upon greater objects , could bestow , that the value of the orchard increased bai.iff 's cottage . 23 to double its usual rent , and the poor s-rate fell from half-acrown to four-pence in the pound , when in some of the adjoining parishes they were at length so high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the means of bringing a much larger supply of poultry to the market . " By the feeling mind every increase of the means by which the comforts of the labouring poor are established , is sure to be promoted ; and it being now no longer doubtful that a full employment of his surplus time towards the cultivation of his vegetable and other food is the most effectual of these means ; it may be expected that not only the resident labourers to every estate will be afforded the indulgence of a small piece of ground for such purposes , but that the officers of parishes in the country will , in good time , endeavour to provide similar means for the poor , in lieu of the aid that is given to them in another way , when winter or want of employment subjects them to the necessity of appealing to their duty or their humanity . To the want of such means for the employment of the labourer 's surplus energies throughout the year , much of his time is wholly lost - much is abandoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad company - poaching and theft are his gradual steps towards greater vices : thse present strong claims to their active interference , and should induce the affluent to arrest this progress by adopting measures of prevention , particularly as the result must prove as beneficial to the opulent as to the poor themselves . These observations may not at first appear quite relevant to the matter of the architectural designs , but as the grounds about them are also a little under consideration , perhaps , on reflection , it may prove otherwise . 24 bailiff 's cottage . Cottagers suffer greatly by the expense of fuel , whether it be of wood or of coal , it is therefore highly important that the fireplaces should be so constructed that the apartments may be sufficiently heated with the least possible quantity of supply . To effect this , the fire-place should be so formed that the heat may readily pass into the apartment from the front , ends , bottom and top of the stove or grate in which the fuel is placed , and that the draught shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being at the same time so slow as to prevent the escape of the heat upwards ; this may be effected by judiciously forming the back of the chimney , and by allowing the mouth of the funnel to be no larger than is absolutely necessary for the escape of the smoke . The observations on these subjects , published by Dr. Franklin and Count Rumford , are important as practical and theoretical documents of their studies in the improvement of this branch of knowledge , and ought to be consulted for the above purposes . ' I'il /z/ 8cc. &c.; /z/ 1 HE cottage orn6 is a new species of building in the economy of domestic architecture , and subject to its own laws of fitness and propriety . It is not the habitation of the laborious , but of the affluent , of the man of study , of science , or of leisure ; it is often the rallying point of domestic comfort , and in this age of elegant refinement , a mere cottage would be incongruous with the nature of its occupancy . The lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polish that is given to the garden scenery , connected with such habitations , require an edifice in which is to be found a correspondence of tasteful care : perhaps it is essential that this building should be small , and certainly not to exceed two stories ; that it should combine properly with the surrounding objects , and appear to be native to the spot , and not one of those crude rule-and-square excrescences of the environs of London , the illegitimate family of town and country . It may be reasonably concluded , that many small dwellings , prior to the fifteenth century , were of the Gothic , and in the cathedral or conventu &l; church character : where there are remains of early cottages , we find some features similar to the large build- /z/ // ings situated near them . The master-workmen probably built for themselves dwellings upon the principles of the edifices on which they were employed ; so that Grothic embellishments were not uncommon in small buildings , and if we may judge of former by very common practices in the present day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the introduction of Grothic ornament in cottages may be supported even on the authority of early examples . Many ancient farm-houses and old manorial buildings present curious copies of the porches and other parts of the churches of the neighbourhood ; even the peculiarities in framing of the timbers are imitated , and the ornaments in many instances adopted , not immediately perhaps from the churches themselves , but from the buildings that followed those , coeval with their originals ; for , until a late period , when the great improvements of our roads made way for innovations of all kinds , architectural taste travelled at a very islow pace , and in those places that are far from cities and manufacturing towns , a very early character of building still exists favourable to the support of the apothesis . The plate annexed is a design for a small Grothic building . It consists of a parlour and dining-room , a kitchen , scullery , and larder , with four bed-rooms . The servants ' apartments are some steps lower than the other rooms , and being of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a sub-building to the principal one . The cellars are under the dining-room and parlour . Where the situation is favourable to this design , a comfortable habitation for a very small family would be obtained at a reasonable expense . The cottage ome , the casino , or the villa , should be designed with a studied reference to the spot on which either is to be erected ; for circumstances of combination will make some features to be desired and others to be avoided , that wholly COTTAGE ORNi. 27 depend on localities and surrounding scenery . There are also considerations respecting the situation desirable for a house that deserve the most careful attention as they are intimately connected with salubrity and comfort . Of these the foremost are , dryness of soil , with the conveniencies of drainage and the means for a plentiful supply of good water . A judicious writer on architecture , who , if not an ancient , is the oldest of the modem authors on that subject , urges forcibly and quaintly this doctrine : - " Be sure , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had freely , and where you can as freely get rid of it . " Notwithstanding the intelligibility and simplicity of this rule , it is not unfrequently neglected ; and , at this moment , there are many dwellings , otherwise desirable , that owe the want of occupancy to dampness and the scanty supply of perhaps even bad water . Buildings of this kind being insulated , require shelter from adjacent trees or rising ground , to protect them from winds that are most prevailing , powerful , or unhealthy . It is therefore desirable , that the house should be so placed as to be benefited by them , and also that the sun may visit the apartments according as his presence may be wished for at the different periods of the day . For the latter purpose , supposing the house to be square , and the comers presented to the chief points of the compass , the moming rooms may be on the south-east and southwest sides , the dinner room to the north-east , and the offices on the north-west . Thus the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moming and evening sun , and the dining-room is situated so as not to be inconvenienced on its decline , at which time it is usually occupied , and its coolness in a summer residence is a comfort well appreciated . A house thus placed , or within a point or two of this direction , will receive the advantage of the sun 's beams on every side , and be therefore rendered more dry than a different mode of placing it // admits ; for as no side is directly to the north , the sun may be said to travel round it . As a country residence , however commodious and tasteful , is dependant on the soil by which it is surrounded for beauty and external effect and embellishment , that of a good quality ought carefully to be selected ; and there are few criteria of this so demonstrative as the herbage , and its neighbouring trees and shrubs . A vigorous and luxuriant growth of plants speedily conforms to the proprietor 's wishes in the distribution and arrangement of his grounds , and yearly effects both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only mortification and disappointment to the possessor , if he hopes to find the creative images of his fancy realized , or a fair return for his care , expense , and labour . /z/ . &#9632; l COTTAGE ORNi. 29 /z/ THE four indispensable requisites for the situation of a country residence , its soil , water , escape of the latter , and the aspect of the building itself , being considered , it will be proper to notice other essentials , which though of a secondary nature , are of importance to its pleasurable intention . The roads by which it is surrounded , and the communication with a city , a town , or large village , should be such as will afford pleasant rides and walks , and allow the supply of necessaries , which small grounds can not produce in themselves , and for which there is frequent need . The casualties also , and indispositions to which the members of a family are subject , render it proper that it should not be far removed from medical aid ; and few proprietors would choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if situated beyond a mile ( unless a carriage is used for conveyance ) , too readily admits excuses for the neglect of religious duties . These considerations apply to every house , and notwithstanding all may not be of equal weight with every individual , no site should be adopted without giving to each a careful attention . The result being favourable , and the surrounding scenery afibrding those beauties which constitute the charm of the country , it will then be proper to determine on the character and form of the house itself ; its size being determined by the number and quality of the family , and by the nature of its appropriation : the peculiar features of the spot itself , or the natural character of the country , will properly give the style of the building to be erected . If the spot be low and secluded , overspread by large and embowering trees , and skirted by // shrubs that altogether divide the appearance of the ground into small parts , the thatched cottage will be in harmony with its compact and rural situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiring trees , particularly a mixture of the pine , larch , and fir , with the oak and elm , and the distant scenery composed of long ranges of lofty hills and the spires of towns or cities , the features of the architecture should be Grecian , as the prevailing lines of its character harmonize both with the broad base on which it stands , and the spiry forms by which it is surrounded , with all the advantages of proper opposition without the extremes of contrast , between which distinction lie all that taste requires towards the beauty of its linear composition . Upon similar principles , if the ground be part of a hill and the forms of the trees more round , or the situation broken and romantic , the Gothic of massive or delicate forms may be used : the former where the effect is rocky , bold , and prominent ; and the latter where its parts are polished and refined . As trees frequently operate as a scale by which we judge the size of objects connected with them , the magnitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected should be properly considered , and indeed drawn with the designs of the building on paper , tiiat a defect may not occur which sometimes happens when the sutrounding objects of the landscape are not sufficiently regarded . The plate annexed represents the elevation and plan of a cottage om6 : the apartments on the ground-floor are a hall , parlour , dining-room , and study , a store-room , kitchen , and scullery ; under the three latter are a larder , coal-cellar , ale and beer-cellar , and a moderate-sized wine-cellar : the stairs to these are under the best staircase , and commence at A. On the chamber-floor would be five bed-rooms and a closet . A verandah , /q/ formed by the roof , encompasses the principal apartments , affords shelter to them , and forms either a walk or a sort of open conservatory for plants . By permitting the parlour to have casements opening to the floor , and communicating to the verandah on each side , a very pleasant and pictorial summerroom would be obtained : and if in winter outside shutters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many persons , even at that season . The elevation exhibited is towards the garden , and is rendered picturesque by the arched interruptions to the otherwise level line of the verandah , and by the bay window which increases the length of the parlour ; the roof is supported by the stems of small trees , and an occasional trellis-work is introduced for the purpose of receiving ornamental foliage , which may be entwined about it : indeed , the construction of this cottage would allow so extensive an application of plants , that the lower apartments of the garden front might be completely embowered . The entrance front would be more simple ; here the verandah is abridged , the walls would be carried as high as the gable of the garden front , and a small porch introduced , covered with thatch and supported by plain octagon pillars . Trellis-work of the forms introduced to this design may be manufactured of iron , at a moderate expense , and also of copper , so as to make an elegantly light support to the foliage , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cottage of this description admits a great variety of rural embellishments that may be blended with its more polished feature vnthout impropriety , provided the arrangement displays the interference of taste , and so that , though the materials are rude , there shall be nothing vulgar or coarse in the disposal of them : it is on account of the mode and not of the materials adopted , in such cases , that the objection of incongruity is taken . // for it is in such buildings , and such alone , that fieuticy is at liberty to sport , and is subject only to just censure when there is an evident deficiency of ability and decorum . The grounds about this building should be laid out with small shrubberies , enclosing portions of lawn , in which , in some cases , insulated trees and shrubs should appear , and in others of greater size , small beds of flowers of various shapes may be properly introduced , and if the situation admits of distant prospects advantage should of course be taken of the circumstance , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without permitting the boundary of the property to be easily comprehended . /z/ COTTAGE ORxi. 33 /z/ THE plate which accompanies these observations exhibits a design proposed for a country uneven in its character , and where stone is to be had suited to the purposes of building : the plan is however , arranged for the more general construction in brickwork , consequently die walls would need to be of greater thickness if stone should be adopted . The neighbourhood of the lakes of Cumberland is admirably suited to buildings of this style , which partake of that mixture of parts , which we may conclude sometimes occurred in our domestic architecture , when the security of the sovereign and the subject began to depend less on the strength of fortifications and the force of arms , than on the equitable administration of the laws of the country . In scenery composed of those bold features which form a whole that we term romantic , small buildings in this mixed style are in perfect correspondence , and are indeed desirable ; for an awe is inspired by the grandeur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lakes , in combination with broken and rock scenery , that impresses the mind with the idea of solitariness and insecurity , and makes agreeable every feature of protection and . safety . Perhaps it is this selection from ecclesiastical and castle architecture that ought to be combined and adopted for romantic scenery , instead of either the one or the other only , as is now a very common practice . The cathedral style is not suited to domestic life ; the apertures are too large , and the general proportions of its architecture inapplicable to such purposes . The castle style , on the contrary , affords too little light and air , and is cumbrous in its arrangements . When /z/ // they are allowed to blend their peculiar forms and proportions , and these are modified and appropriated by a skilful hand , a style is produced capable of expressing all the beauties of each , affording at the same time the most convenient arrangements for domestic and polished occupation ; and the style is fiiUy authorized by the documents and the remains of those buildings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three first Edwards . This is , however , a style of architecture merely and best applied to small buildings ; for there is a native classical refinement in Grecian architecture , and a means of combining the features of intelligence with beauty and dignity in so extensive a variety of form and grace , that it is always to be deplored when other characters of architecture are substituted for it , unless some imperious circumstance of fitness which the situation or the purpose demands , that makes it necessary . The interior of the cottage represented in the engraving , admits of a very interesting style of decoration ; its litUe hail of entrance , having a door of oak studded over with nail-heads , may be formed into compartments , and painted in imitation of oakpanneling ; Gothic pillars at the comers may support ' a groined ceiling , ornamented with ribs , and with flowers at the intersections . The window being small , would subdue the light , so as to gve it a calm effect , and afford that to the eye which is always agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is also desirable , as it prepares it to receive with greater force the cheerfulness or the brilliancy of the best apartments ; very desirable oppositions are to be obtained by a proper arrangement of light in halls , vestibules , and corridors ; for the finest apartments gain very much of the favourableness of first impressions by the balance in their favour , which , in light and colour , the former are prepared to yield to them . The principal rooms of this cottage might be decorated in a COTTAGE ORNi. 35 more finished style , still keeping in view a perfect fitness and simplicity , the walls being coloured in warm or cool tints , according to the fancy of the occupier ; and embellished by tracery in Gothic forms , to combine with the windows , which might be enriched by stained or painted glass . The chimney-pieces , the skirtings , the architraves , all should be designed to form a con* gruous whole ; and although the inferior apartments would not be equally embellished , yet the forms and the colours should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these may be produced with quite as little expense as is usually bestowed on buildings of a common kind . This cottage would afford a tolerable number of apartments ; namely , two best bed-rooms , one being on the ground-floor , and two servants ' rooms , a parlour , a dining-room , a hall , kitchen , and pantry ; the larder being below : the cellaring would be made in the declivity of the ground , here assumed to be its natural shape . The real size of the building would be concealed by the screen virall , as it appears , of the entrance front , particularly if the room immediately behind it were covered by a metal flat roof ; those of the other part would be protected by a roof of rather a peculiar construction , which the thickness of stone walls readily admits , being formed with pannier gutters , which will not admit an overflow , so as to injure the apartments , proceeding either from excessive rains , or accumulated or drifted snows - a form very desirable in greatly exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been used for the purpose , is lead : copper and zinc are both objectionable , on reasonable grounds . Compositions of many kinds have been devised , but have failed in perhaps every instance ; the hard ones crack with the least settlement of the building , or the springing , swelling , or shrinking of the timbers connected with them ; the soft ones soon lose their tenacity by the operation // of the sun : and those that have been devised of a medium composition , become haid in winter and dry in summer , and consequently crack in both seasons . For small out- houses , smd such alone , a cheap and comparatively durable method of roofing is made by dipping sheets of coarse paper in boiling tar , and nailing them on boards or laths in the same manner as slates . The whole is then painted over with a mixture of pitch and powdered coal , chalk , As the roof is made to rise not more than two inches in a foot , the quantity of timber required is much smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the artificial slating manufactured by the late Sir James Wright , which , during the American war , was in great request in our West Indian colonies as a substitute for shingle , not then to be readily obtained . /q/ /z/ ' THIS building is suited to a small family , and would make a very convenient parsonage-house to a living of moderate income : it consists of a parlour , dining-room , and library ; a kitchen , scullery , larder , &c.; on the ground floor ; and of four chambers and a dressing-room on the bed-room floor . The design is picturesque in its ; and if executed with a judicious attention to the forms of the doors , windows , ceilings , &c.; it would become a very simple and neat example of domestic Gothic architecture . It is intended that the roof should be covered with tiles , but great care should be taken that they are from some other building , and have lost the offensive glare that red tiles always possess when new , for such a colour would be fatal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind need considerable care in the formation of the middle gutters , and lead only is suitable to the purpose : roofs are unquestionably made in some countries entirely flat , and secured by compositions , as those , for instance , at Malta , where they are used for walking upon , or for the performance of the common business of the day : but there the buildings are chiefly of stone , with very little timber about them ; the apartments are narrow , and arched over , and the covering is exceedingly thick , so that the little water that penetrates the surface is arrested by the substance it has to pass , until evaporated at the surface again . The form and nature of our buildings rarely allow of this construction , and the climate is not favourable to it , if they did . The chief objections to lead for gutters , or rather the difficulties that occur in the proper appli- /z/ cation of it , are , first , the contraction and expansion to which it is subject from cold and heat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one extreme to the other is very great in the short space of twelve hours , the sun most powerfully acting upon it at mid-day , when the succeeding night may be as intensely cold . Architects are therefore very careful that lead shall be put together in comparatively short pieces , and they never admit the too frequent practice of soldering lengths of it together , that the contraction and expansion may take place on as short surfaces as possible . The pieces of lead are connected with each other at a small step of about an inch and a-half high , the under sheet of lead rising upon the step and the other folding over it : and here commences the second difficulty ; for so soon as the water contained in the gutter ( its free escape being prevented by snow , leaves , or other impediment ) , is deep enough to cover this step , it finds a way under the covering sheet of lead , and thence into the wall or the apartments . This overflow of the water has never been wholly prevented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of the architect to remedy the evil , such as it is , in the best possible manner . A simple and novel contrivance for the purpose is here submitted , that , in the few instances in which it has been applied , has completely succeeded : - every step , or technically , every lap should be formed as usual , but the gutter-boards grooved , or hollowed , at the edge of the under lead , and perforated so as to let the overflow water pass readily into a small transverse sub-gutter , previously prepared immediately under every lap , and discharging itself upon the cornice , or from those masks or heads with which the building is frequently enriched . These gutters would be about a foot and a-half long , and at intervals of twelve , fourteen , or sixteen feet . The security is ample , and the expense inconsiderable : they are applicable in this way , however , only to the wall-gutters ; those to the valleys of the roof must have a sub trough-gutter also . /q/ In adopting this design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement would need to be made in the plan , which would readily present themselves according to the demands of the family to occupy it . To a building of this description casement or folding windows are properly introduced , but sashwindows are often substituted for them , because they usually afford a very imperfect security against wet , but this is only so because adequate precautions are not taken to exclude it , or that they are applied improperly . It is well known that so long as the folding sash-window is sufficiently at liberty to open and shut with ease , the air will pass freely , and in driving winds the water will of course pass with it , not only between the meeting stiles , but round the whole margin of the sash , and frequently in such quantities as to damage the carpets , and also the ceilings , walls , and furniture of the rooms beneath . In damp weather a condensation of vapours will often take place on the inside of the window , that runs down in streams , is equally injurious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily prevented in the first instance , and remedied without difficulty at any time ; to do both it is essential to direct the course of the water rather than to oppose it - to admit the water and air to a certain extent , and then to divert their progress , for combined , they are too powerful and insinuative to submit to direct opposition . When the sashes are made with a rebate at the meeting stiles , let two small grooves or hollows , a quarter of an inch wide and three-eighths of an inch deep , be made entirely round the edges of the folding or other sashes , one a quarter of an inch from the outside , and the other a quarter of an inch from the inside faces of the sashes , and make corresponding grooves in the heads , cills , and stiles of the sash frames - these grooves will intercept the water in its progress towards the apartment , and it will run along the top rail and down the sides very freely at the first groove , and any overflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down also , and small apertures should be formed in the cill to emit the water and the air that will form powerful currents in the grooves , and otherwise find their way into the apartments . To receive the water produced by the condensation of the vapours interiorly , a double fluting should be formed in the lower bead of the frame , and thence suffered to escape by small apertures through the cill to the outside , which might be covered by shields of lead to prevent the air from making its way into the apartment . These are in general ample securities when the sashes are well made and well fitted , and if otherwise , stops , or fillets at the joints , will remedy the evil entirely . /q/ /z/ PERHAPS no sort of building is more decorative to rural scenery than that which is designed in the ' ' cottage style . " Its fitness for the purpose is , however , wholly destroyed if adopted for such villas , as it lately has been , that from magnitude and cost might really be termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to small buildings , and the more polished and higher order of art should be employed in designs for spacious edifices ; indeed , the quantity of a building , as well as the purpose of its application , should be considered , and the style to be adopted would properly be the result of the deliberation . Another style has also been used for buildings of considerable extent , that , as yet , has no name descriptive of its character : it is composed of many parts , all selected from houses that have been built piecemeal , from the time of James I. to the present day , the more unaccommodating the parts are to each other , the more suitable to the style proposed , and if the several rooms have no other connexion but by stairs or passages the design is then approaching to perfection . Some ancient houses that have been added to , altered , and repaired from time to time , may present a variety of parts coming happily together , and forming a picturesque whole , that pleases principally from the curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist sits down to design a house , he is , surely , not governed either by fine fiemcy or sound judgment , if he selects such parts , and puts them together in this adventitious manner . Mr. Pope , in reply to the Duke of Buckingham 's description of his house , affects to describe that which he then inhabited , /z/ and it would suit exactly the style of building before alluded to . - " You must expect nothing regular/ ' says he , ' * in my description , any more than in the house ; the whole vast edifice is so disjointed , and the several parts so detached one from the other , and yet so joining again , one can not tell how , that in one of my poetical fits I imagined it had been a village in Amphion 's time , when the cottages , having taken a country-dance together , had been all out , and stood stone-still with amazement ever since . " The design annexed is for the residence of a small family , and would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , probably , as large as is consistent with that character of architecture : it consists of a parlour ( which would be also the chief entrance of the house ) , a library , drawing-room , storeroom , a kitchen , scullery , and also a small conservatory ; the cellars are beneath , and it would contain five chambers and a dressing-room on the upper floor . With a very little difference of arrangement , this design would make a commodious farmhouse ; and in form and embellishment it is well suited to its genuine character . The gables and porch would produce an interesting effect ; the sashes are of quarry glass , in metal diamond lights , with labels above them ; the roof is thatched , and the chimney-shafts of those varied forms frequently found in buildings of the seventeenth century , and which examples , it is to be lamented , are now but rarely followed in structures of this description . The picturesqueness which formerly prevailed in rural architecture , has long given way to that bare and bald style , evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is almost as manifest in the simple dwelling of the cottager , as in the closely-shorn and prim elevations of our London street-edifices , that so conspicuously betray the want of genius /q/ in the speculative builder , as well as a rigid curtailment of expense , seeming to imply that he had advanced his money on what he thought a forlorn hope ; the valuable blessing of a fair purchase being rather to be prayed for than expected . From such examples devoid of every external ornament , the impoverished and meagre character of buildings in the country of its neighbourhood might be expected , these would naturally become the models for structures farther removed from the metropolis ; and thus , with few exceptions , we find them adopted as examples , until the same vapid and monotonous character prevails in nearly every new building in every town and village in the kingdom . All this is to be regretted , particularly in such as are much elevated , for few subjects , the work of art , become more interesting in the view of a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed , and prevent its being wholly embowered in the intervening foliage . The spire of the church , - the sail of the mill , - the varied chimneys that here and there indistinctly present themselves , or are indicated by the ascending smoke , but which , on a near approach , give elegantly varied and picturesque forms in harmony with the surrounding scenery ; these are admired , and justly appreciated by every artist , and by every man of sensibility and taste . It appears by some bills of tradesmen for works executed little more than a century ago , that the chimney-top or shaft was then at least , an object of particular attention , and that the workmen so vied with each other in this ornamental ( for then it was so considered ) appendage to the house , that it was a custom in buildings of a small or moderate size , to give the workmanship of the " chimney device " as a present and testimonial of respect to the employer ; and the term * ' superior " usually preceded it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it may be presumed that an emulation existed amongst the /z/ apprentices and young men employed in such erections , working at ' ' over hours/ ' to surpass each other in these conspicuous testimonies of their abilities . It would be well if some such motive for industrious emulation existed in the present day , not as regards the object in view merely , but also that it might animate the conduct and conduce to the welfare of the working classes of young men employed in buildings , both in town and country . /z/ /q/ /z/ THE annexed design is intended for the residence of a cleiyman , and to be erected in a situation where the scenery is both rural and romantic . The parts of this design are supposed to be selected from the church itself , to which the vicarage-house belongs , and with which it should correctly assimilate , particularly if the building be intended to be placed in its immediate neighbourhood . The practice of designing the residence of a clergyman with reference to the characteristics of the church to which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such selections , is desirable , not only as relates to a tasteful advantage , but as it becomes another and visible link of connexion between the church itself and the pastor who is devoted to its duties ; and also leads the spectator very naturally from contemplating the dwelling , to regard the pious character of its inhabitant . This association has occurred to a poet , whose works indeed are nearly obsolete , but which will always be admired for taste and feeling , and is thus noticed by him : - " That simple dwelling sheltered by the wood , As courting now , now shunning solitude , With Gothic windows , and with open porch , In forms related to its nehbouring church , Seeming less modem than of happier age , Half hid by iyy - is the parsonage . /z/ Its piooB tenant , Terging &st; in yean . In grare bat unaffected guise appean . And blest with health , Inr 6ftj yean haTe shed No silver marks of Folly on his head : For though Time 's hand , with ready haste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folly , more forward , lavishly supplies All the much honoar 'd emblems of the wise. * ' It was a conviction of the propriety of adopting a similar practice that induced the late ingenious and tasteful Mr* James Wyatt to cultivate this kind of architecture , and afterwards to unite the castle style with that of the cathedral and conventual church Gothic ; for being about to make considerable additions to buildings containing very noble apartments , so disposed as to be inimical to Grecian symmetry , he reverted to the practice of the early architects of our own country , and surmounted the difficulties by aiming to produce grand and picturesque effects , rather than those of stately elegance ; and it is to the encouragement given to this effort of art that we are indebted to so extensive an adoption of many beauties in Gothic architecture . Gothic architecture merits all the admiration it has obtained ; its suitableness for buildings devoted to purposes connected with religion is generally confessed , and it may be considered as indigenous to the soil of Christianity , for from a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformation in our religion , Gothic architecture advanced with it , and was cultivated by the same zeal and talents that promulgated its holy doctrines . Constantine himself , and the devout of his empire , were anxious to abandon those systems of building which reminded the proselyte of early habits and practices : they therefore banished the forms and decorations of the heathen temples , and adopted for the foundation of their temporal church , a plan which was an image of their spiritual comfort and consolation ; for , notwithstanding /q/ the instrument used for the crucifixion was hitherto the type of disgrace and infamy , both with the Romans and the Jews , the cross speedily became the memorial of salvation , and was held in religious venemtion by the early Christians . The blow that was iatal to established art , elicited the spark of vitality in a new character of building : the style indeed was barbarous ; it was , however , great in feature and solemn in effect ; and being unlike the regular and systematic temples of the heathen , both in form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious rites of his forefathers . This plan and manner of building were adopted with avidity in all the countries where Christianity was established ; and were cultivated in proportion to the advancement of religion , and retarded by the persecutions it experienced . In England , so soon as these troubles were quieted , and the feudal system existed in its complete state , and before it was deranged by the Conquest , Gothic architecture received great encouragement from the spirit for building that prevailed among the clergy and the temporal lords . It also obtained a considerable impetus from the composition made by the bishops with the barons respecting the endowment of the first rural churches , which in a short time became numerous , and eventually produced the parochial division nearly as we find it in the present day , if we except some small alterations made in the metropolis during the reigns of Queen Anne and George I. The ecclesiastical laws of Edward the Confessor , in an eminent degree , protected and benefited the clergy and the church ; and the architecture of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William I. the debased vestiges of the Roman style became neglected for a more systematic art , and with the progressive improvement of religion and literature , ecclesiastical architecture improved also . The leisure of the monks , and the riches which flowed in upon the church , uniting with the emula- /z/ tion of the bishops and abbots to surpass each other in the magnificence and beauty of their establishments , tended to promote the cultivation both of design and construction , and enabled them eventually to execute the most daring works of the imagination . The clergy continued this protection to Gothic architecture through many ages , and reaping the advantages of dignified church and state preferments , impressed with a love of learning , and emulous to render it respectable and respected , they fostered with the tenderest care whatever conduced to its advancement , and by their zeal and interest with princes and governments , enriched those schools of literature , Oxford and Cambridge , that have proved splendid conservators of Gothic art , and noble cherishers of the human intellect . With the reformation in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its patronage of art ; the subsequent contests on particular tenets caused a rapid increase of its calamities , and the same motives perhaps , which had twelve centuries before induced the church to adopt the style that was now perfected under its protection , forcibly operated to banish it altogether , and to let in that perversion of the Roman and Italian style that was so prevalent in the reign of Elizabeth , to whom nothing that bore the relish of Catholicism was tolerable . It may be perceived , that works executed in the reign of Henry VII . promised a decline of Gk ) thic art , not more by the exuberance of its ornament , than by that infallible testimony of decay , which in art and science manifests itself , when the possible is substituted for the probable , and the fallacious for the true . /q/ /z/ THE plan of this rural building was arranged for the accommodation of two ladies , whose establishment consists of three female servants , and a gardener , his residence being at a small distance from the cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as it affords the view of a beautiful piece of water , bounded by luxuriant overhanging woods , and a country rich in cultivated scenery , the existing deficiency of ground belonging to it is the less to be regretted ; because these supply the effect of an extensive and well-arranged domain . The ground , in fact , is no larger than just to admit a moderate sized kitchen-garden , and a small lawn and shrubbery , which is separated from the road , passing near the site of the house , by a sloping fence , in the manner of a chevaux-de-frise . The ground-floor consists of a parlour , a small music-room , a dining-room , a book-room , a kitchen , larder , and ante-kitchen ; the scullery and cellars are below , the stairs of which commence at A , under the best stairs ; the chamber-floor contains five bedrooms , four of them having fire-places . As this cottage has been decorated with great care and some taste , a description of it will , perhaps , afford useful hints for similar embellishments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stems of elm-trees ; the little hall and staircase are decorated with trellising , composed of light lath and wicker basket-work , very neatly executed , and painted a dark-green : this is placed against the /z/ // papering of the walls and ceilings , which are of a deep buff colour . Flower-stands and brackets are attached at various parts , from the bottom to the top of the staircase . The railing of the stairs being also of basket-work , the strings , &c.; are painted buff or green , as the occasion required ; for every part is so arranged , that the green may be relieved by buff , or the buff by the green . The most elegantly beautiful flowering plants are selected as embellishments , and are tastefully disposed on the several flower-stands ; thus the walls are every where adorned with them , and some are trained over the trellis of the ceilings , whence they hang in festoons and unite their branches ; the plants are , however , introduced with a sparing hand , so as to allow each to be exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tasteful effect . On the outside of each step of the stairs a bracket is affixed , on which small and equal-sized green porcelain garden-pots are placed , containing specimens of the most beautiful plants . A small lobby connects the music-room , drawing-room , and parlour , so that they are en suite : in most cases it would have been preferred perhaps , that the two latter should have changed places with each other ; in this instance it was otherwise on account of the aspects . The parlour , the music - room , and the lobby , are very simply and neatly decorated by compartments coloured in tints resembling an autumnal leaf , the yellow-green of which forms the pannels , and its mellower and pinky hues compose a very narrow border and style that surround them . The draperies are of buff chintz , in which sage-green leaves and small pink and blue-and- white flowers prevail ; the furniture is cane-coloured . Upright flower-stands of basket-work are placed in each angle of the room , and the verandah is constantly dressed with plants of the choicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancifully ornamented with paper in imitation of bamboo and basket-work , in the colour of cane , upon a sky-blue gfround ; each side is divided into compartments by pilasters , which support a sort of roofing and transverse bamboo rods , to which seem to be suspended the most exquisite works of the Chinese pencil : these are the best that have appeared in this country , and consist of views of their apartments , representations of the costume of the people , and of the natural productions of China . A very able artist has farther decorated this room , by painting a variety of oriental plants , as supported by the pilasters , &c.; about which they entwine , and arriving at the ceiling , they terminate , after spreading a short distance upon it . The furniture and draperies are the same as in the parlour . The book-room is coloured a tea-green , which is relieved by blossom-colour and brown . The chambers are papered with a small and simple trellis pattern , and the draperies white , with a mixture of lavendercolour and buff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gilding ; the glasses are let into the walls and covered by the paper decorations ; and even the book-bindings are unomamented by gold , the lettering being merely stamped upon them . The decorations of apartments afford so great an opportunity for an exercise of ingenuity and taste , that it is to be lamented architects are not more generally consulted in the finishings as well as in the designs of the furniture proposed to be placed within them : - when this is not done , an incongruity is likely to occur , that readily borders on the absurd ; for nothing less // thaix strange anomalies can be expected , when nearly as many opinions are to be consulted as there are articles of ornament and furniture to be procured ; it thence naturally happens that fitness is lost sight of , the essential principle of combination is neglected , and it may be expected that all its precepts will be as necessarily violated and profiled . COTTAGE ORNi. 53 /z/ TO combine utility with picturesque beauty at a moderate expense in buildings of this description , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is aware that agreeable appearances must be obtained , but that it is improper to sacrifice to them the real conveniences of a dwelling , or to obtain both at a chai that should belong only to buildings of greater pretensions . This consideration has led to the devising of irregular plans for the cottage om6 , in which symmetrical arrangements of pure architecture are not observed , and the parts are then so disposed as to form pleasing combinations of form , in which , of course some intricacy occurs , and to produce varied effects of light and shadow . Additions to old buildings are sometimes made in this way , with great advantage to the convenience of the interior of the house , and to the beauty of the building externally ; for it not unfrequently happens , that concurring circumstances will effect a favourable peculiarity of character , that probably would not have been the result of premeditation . This mode of proceeding , however , in which the convenience of arrangement is made to govern the design , is not suited to regular architecture ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the several parts are adjusted by severities of rule , which make the contrary practice indispensable . The plan of the annexed design of a cottage orn6 departs but little from a simply oblong form , but it marks that no attempt has been made to complete it ; and in the elevation also , the forms are disposed with a very limited regard to a perfect symmetry of its parts . This building is arranged for a small family , // and consists of a hall , staircase , dining and drawing-rooms , closet for coats , &c.; a kitchen , scullery , and larder , on the ground-floor ; on the chamber-floor are five rooms and a closet : and on the under-ground story are proper wine , beer , and coalcellars , a cold-larder and store-room . Plans of this description have the advantage of losing no space by communicating passages , which too commonly increase the magnitude of buildings , and consequently the expense of them , without a corresponding benefit . The absence , or spare application of passages constitutes , perhaps , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) oms are approachable , independently of each other , from the hall , staircase , or vestibule ; and such simplicity of arrangement should always have a due consideration . The roof of this design is made to project beyond the walls of the house , and thus afibrds an opportunity of forming a gallery and double verandah , a very desirable appendage to a villa whose chief apartments are presented to south or to south-western aspects . However desirable very elevated situations may be , as afibrding pure air and extensive prospects , the difficulty of obtaining good water in such places makes it sometimes necessary to relinquish them , and seek for spots of ground better calculated for a pure and an abundant supply . Good water should be beautifully transparent ; a slight opacity is a certain criterion of extraneous matter . To judge of the perfect transparency of water , it should be put into a deep glass vessel , the larger the better , so that we can look down perpendicularly into a considerable mass of the fluid ; for by so doing , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done if the water be viewed through the glass horizontally , or held between the eye and the place whence the direct light proceeds . It should also be perfectly colourless , devoid of odour , and its taste lively and agreeable . It should send out air-bubbles when poured from one vessel into another ; COTTAGE ORNfe. 55 it should boil pulse soft , and fonn with soap an uniform opaline fluid . The liability of water to spoil by long keeping in close vessels , is by no means a criterion of its disqualification for the ordinary purposes of life , as is often imagined ; it merely proves the presence of organic matter . To acquire a knowledge of the general nature of water does not require much address ; it is only necessary to add to the water we wish to examine certain chemical re-agents , or tests , and , from the phenomena which they produce , a sufficient notion may be formed of the general constitution of the water . Thus , if tincture or solution of soap in spirits of wine , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water abounds in earthy salts , which are chiefly sulphate and super-carbonate of lime , and sometimes magnesian salts . Such waters are unfit for boiling peas , and all kinds of leguminous seeds , at least if they contain more than four grains of solid matter of these salts in a pint of water . They have usually a cool brisk taste , which renders them more palatable , and therefore are preferred by water-drinkers . Hard waters may , in general , be cured by dropping into them a solution of sub-carbonate of potash ; or , if the hardness be owing to the presence of super-carbonate of lime only , mere boiling will remedy the defect ; part of the carbonic acid flies off , and a neutral carbonate of lime falls down to the bottom : it is this that forms the stony crust , or fur , on the sides of the vessel in which it is boiled . This water ought to be exposed to the open air , that it may re-absorb a portion of carbonic acid gas and common air , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a vapid taste , and can not be used as a wholesome drink . Water which contains metallic matters , acquires a dark 56 OKsk. m colour by the admixture of liquid sulphuretted hydrogen ; and it is by this test that the presence of lead has been detected in waters kept in leaden cisterns . In waters that abound with earthy salts the oxalate of ammonia produces a white precipitate ; and if a few drops of muriate of barytes occasion a strong precipitate in boiled water , there is reason to believe that the lime is combined with sulphuric acid ; and from the quantity of the precipitate thus produced , when contrasted with good soft water , a sufficient notion may be formed of the comparative goodness of the water , or of such as is fit for the ordinary purposes of domestic economy . /z/ THIS building is designed to harmonize with garden scenery , and to afford a degree of embellishment by its verandahs and the variety of shadow which they project , that would be greatly desirable where the landscape is not composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist in this endeavour , as its overhanging eaves produce a picturesque effect , and give a considerable shelter to the house . On the pleasing variety of shadow resulting from this design , its pretension to notice would principally depend , for the parts themselves are perfectly simple and unaffected . The objections to this kind of roof , however , are not to be disregarded : the water falling from it is destructive to the plants or herbage that may be beneath the drip ; the walls are not only discoloured towards the ground , by repeated splashing , but become damp , and are eventually injured ; the windows also suffer from this circumstance , and they are not always accessible without subjecting the inhabitants to the inconvenience of receiving a portion of the wet that is dismissed by the eaves , even after the gentlest rains . Concealed or invisible gutters , as they are called , have been devised to obviate this unpleasantness . They are formed about a foot and a half above the eaves , and are so disposed as to arrest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roof , whence it is conveyed to pipes prepared at the end of the building to receive it . These gutters may be made very small , and they would answer the purpose tolerably well , if a material could be applied to form them not so subject to crack by its expansive and contracting nature as lead is found to be , /z/ // which , from this quality , renders the concealed gutter unadvisable , except to small buildings , or where they can be introduced in very short lengths : in other cases they can not be considered as affording security from the wet . The best means of preventing the inconvenience generally , is to form a wood gutter at the edge of the roof , so designed that it may appear to be the finish of the roof , rather than a gutter ; and by giving a fall for the water within its substance , the level line of the edge is preserved , and it may be adopted without injury to the lightness of effect that is desirable . The irregular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc , is always to be avoided . The centre of this design represents a roof projecting over a bow that forms part of the drawing-room , and as the wall also recedes , a spacious verandah is produced , which is well sheltered and affords a prospect-gallery , or a sort of open conservatory ; and balconies are formed on each side by the small verandahs which shelter the vnndows of the ground-floor : the whole is connected by a trellis roof , as described on the plan which represents the line of connexion on the level of the chamber-floor . The ground for which this design was in fact proposed , happened to be of a very peculiar form , although the general line of it was not undulating , and led to a very careful attention of the means for improving the site of a building variously circumstanced in this particular . The very ingenious observations of the late Mr. Repton can not but be acceptable for such purposes , particularly as they frequently occur . ** There is , " he observes , ' ' a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every house ; and though in the country there is not the same occasion as in towns , for placing offices under ground , or for setting the principal apartments on a basementStory , /q/ as it is far more desirable to walk from the house on the same level with the ground , yet there are situations which require to be raised above the natural surface/ ' This is the case at Welbeck , where the park not only abounds with bold and conspicuous inequalities , but in many places there are almost imperceptible swellings in the ground , which art would in vain remedy , fit ) m their vast breadth ; though they are evident defects whenever they appear to cut across the stems of trees , and hide only half their trunks , for if the whole trunk were perfectly hidden by such a swell , the injury would be less , because the imagination is always ready to sink the valley and raise the hill , if not checked in its efforts by some actual standard of measurement . In such cases , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the eye may look over , and of course lose , these trifling inequalities . All natural shapes of ground must necessarily fall under one of these descriptions , viz. convex , concave , plane , or inclined plane . Suppose it granted , that , except in very romantic situations , all the rooms on the principal floor ought to range on the same level ; and that there must be a platform , or certain space of ground , with a gentle descent from the house every way . If the ground be naturally convex , or what is generally called a knoll , the . crown of the hill must be taken off to form a platform , and the size of the house must be adapted to the size of the knoll ; for if it be too large it will not have sufficient platform , but rather stand on the edge of a steep bank . It therefore follows , that if the house must stand on a natural hillock , the building should not be larger than its situation will admit ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house in every other respect , it is sometimes possible for art to supply what Nature seems to have denied ; a circumstance that proves the absurdity of those who design and plan a house without any previous knowledge of the situation or shape of the - xj " " %ry-h ' J r ; ; : ; : : : " - /z/ Sec . Sec. /z/ A RESIDENCE may be considered under two points of view : first , as relates to its fitness for the purposes of the family , embracing the i ; pquisites of social life , which by education and habit have become necessary ; and secondly , as connected with external claims to respectability , including whatever tends to produce those impressions which are recommendatory to the tasteful and judicious . By the term Residence is implied , here , all that belongs to the mansion , its grounds , and plantations ; for the building is but a part of the greater whole . In general , cheerfulness , comfort , and a due proportion of elegance , are the prevailing features desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ought at least to be expected , and the sources which afford them should be simple and genuine ; for the British prefer realities to the professing assumptions of fancy , and in the arrangements where the arts are employed , care should be taken to do nothing that may seem a violence to Nature . Once , indeed , a style not so consistent had a temporary existence with us ; then also painted facades , mock bridges , churches , and even mock cathedrals , were ' ' quite /z/ in taste : " but these were soon exploded , and if the imitative powers of art are employed in the present day , it is generally in those things only that are ephemeral in their nature ; and here too the indulgence is not unlimited , being confined to interior decorations . The promise which a place of residence holds out to the visitor on his approach , should be of the agreeable kind ; and this promise should , immediately on his entering the gate , be followed up by the assurance , that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half exposed , should leave enough uncertain to allow the exercise of the imagination , but the objects should be so arranged that they may lead the visitor to expect something of what is eventually to be revealed ; for unless the fancy is directed , it is so rapid in fabricating images which can not be realized , that disappointment must of necessity enue , and with all the advantages of tasteful arrangement , it requires a practised hand to supply its expectations . Strong contrasts are not always favourable ; generally they are the reverse ; and certainly in small residences they ought not to be attempted . A general harmony , in progressive advancement to a beautiful climax , is compatible with variety and those effects of opposition which the judicious know how to cultivate with success ; and as there are situations which make one feature proper and fair material for the designer , that in another would be affected or absurd , it is therefore his duty to select only such as may be adopted consistently , and with reference to the peculiar characteristics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the most favourable example we have of the effects of strong oppositions all congenial to its character . The rocks , the fine dark heath and rugged ground which mark the approach , are quite in harmony with the ivy-bound and magnificent maiden towers that in /q/ former times so successfully guarded its fosse and bridge . They rise out of this spot like the sable guardians of some enchanted territory . But no sooner is the warden tower passed than the court of the castle presents itself ; its lawn dressed in the freshest verdure and planted with evergreens , manifesting the solicitous and peculiar care bestowed upon them , seems to tell how precious necessity made this little spot to the comfort and recreation of its inhabitants in less peaceful times . Three steps form the entrance to the great hall , on crossing which a noble prospect of forest scenery presents itself , exhibiting a vast domain , unquestionably an appendage to the castle . The spectator is surprised by the depth that is immediately beneath him : the rapid stream and the ruined bridge , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mill , upon which the eye speedily falls , seems to form a scale by which the magnitude of the castle and all around is displayed , and gives a sentiment to the picture that art alone would fail to produce . It is a beautiful emblem of power protecting industry . /z/ There are fine models existing , both of large and small residences , where the architecture is harmonized with the landscape with great judgment ; but there is yet much to be done towards the proper embellishment of the estates of many ancient families , and particularly of the country gentleman whose duties or whose pleasures do not lead him from his own domain . Many firm and substantial residences , surrounded by extensive land possessions , seem to promise only a bleak , damp , insecure , and comfortless dwelling , although they may contain every desirable requisite ; merely from the absence of those features that evince a tasteful care . It is not enough , that a fine growth of timber on the property manifests that the occupier 's predecessors cultivated it ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its every inhabitant has followed the laudable example , for the variety of young and progressively improving plants give , by /z/ their size , forms , and freshness , and by their colour and opposition to those of earlier growth , a charm that merits the highest cultivation . Where old trees only prevail , and are thinly scat* tered over the grounds , the near scenery is generally naked at the bottom , or towards the soil , and has a very impoverished effect . The building represented in the plate , is intended for the residence of a small family , and has its domestic offices situated in the rear of the principal apartments , which are thence approached by a door entering into the staircase at A. The diningroom is spacious , and is decorated by niches and statues , which would combine with the greatly projecting bay-window , to give the whole an appearance of architectural arrangement and classical finish . The drawing and music-room , communicating with a small conservatory , would form a very agreeable suite of apartments , wholly unconnected with the dinner-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books , and , as being a room of business , it is entered immediately from the small hall : this leads to the principal staircase , and to a corridor containing a closet , coat-room , store and china-room , &c.; and is the passage by which the house is entered from the servants ' apartments . . These consist of kitchen , scullery , and larder , servant's-hall , pantry , and housekeepers ' - room , with proper cellaring ; and above them are the servants ' bed-rooms . The chambers over the chief apartments are four in number , two of which have dressing-rooms . The lawn firont only would be architecturally decorated , the remaining sides being disposed for finishing in the simplest style , and for concealment by plantations ; indeed the offices might be nearly excluded from view by the shrubberies between them and the principal building . 4. f /q/ /z/ THIS building is designed to afford accommodation to a small family of moderate fortune ; it consists of a spacious dining-room and two drawing-rooms , a study , and five bedrooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irvanlii-hall and butler's-pantry under the front apartments : tro other offices would be removed from the basement of the house , to which there might be a communication by a passage or area , as the nature of the ground permitted ; the lawn in the present instance , is supposed to incline rapidly to the river 's edge , and allow altitude sufficient for the basement-floor and for proper drainage . Irregular surfaces of ground sometimes admit of dispositions and arrangements , of the lower rooms particularly , that are exceedingly desirable , and which could not be provided for in the design , unless the architect had an intimate knowledge of the spot selected for the purpose . It has been too common a practice to adopt plans without this exercise of judgment ; and hence many buildings are so disposed , that some of the principal apartments are properly above the surface of the ground , whilst others are beneath it ; so that , even in an elevated situation , parts of the house suffer the injuries consequent on building in a hollow , and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of the soil been judiciously considered , and the natural forms assisted by such artificial moundings as might be readily executed at a small expense , the whole would have been complete , and superior accommodation and effect /z/ i /z/ obtained , as well as healthfulness , and security from the result of damps and the ravages of the dry-rot . Few things in building so surprise an attentive observer as the prevalence of the fault just alluded to ; it is a common thing to find excellent houses so built in the ground , that it might seem as if the heavens were forbidden to us , and that every foot in altitude beyond the earth was a culpable trespass upon the skies . In the plan of this villa , the dining-room and library are increased by bays , which project beyond the general outline of the walls above them ; consequently so much of the upper waj are without substructure , and are dependant upon an artificial support , which is usually formed by beams of timber assisted by an arch spanning from side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the timber shrinks in its substance , and yields to the weight above it ; at all times , therefore , it is proper to help it by the introduction of columns , as in the dining-room , unless the apartment is so narrow as to allow the aid of transverse beams passing from the outside to the middle wall , as would be the case in the library of this design . The evidences of neglect in these means are seen in the cracks which take place in the walls above the projections ; in the broken ceilings and cornices of the rooms beneath ; and in the quantities of water which collect upon the flats of the bays , in consequence of an alteration in their currents , and thence it too frequently finds its way into , and damages the apartment . Much speculation has taken place on the subject of park scenery , a style of rural embellishment that marks a superior rank in the possessor , and is a dignified appendage to the domain . Within a few years many sites have assumed this pretension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground has been of corresponding extent , and the plantations /q/ numerous and of ample dimensions ; the latter is indispensible to the purpose , for single trees scattered over the spot does not afford the grandeur essential to the park character , but on the contrary produces an impoverished and meagre effect . The fashion for planting in clumps , now sparingly introduced , although its principle is invariably adopted , is said to have been thus produced : - Mr. Brown was pursuing the style which has always been considered as characteristic of park scenery , and planted many trees near to each other , that they might form a reciprocal shelter and obtain a more rapid growth , which is known to take place when trees are placed together in sufficient numbers . These were to be thinned , and the best selected for standing in the manner common to parks ; but the richness obtained by the concealment of the stems , and by the increased foliage and shadow of the branches , caused them to be preserved as clumps , and Brown did not object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same circumstance , and was planted for a similar purpose , of being judiciously thinned , when the number , the form , the strength of the plant , the colour , and the variety , were again to be taken into consideration . It was here that Mr. Brown expected to have exerted his talents for pictorial fancy ; but a new feature presenting itself , his works rarely had this devotion paid to them . Better times for art and taste have introduced that mixture of seemingly insulated trees , the spare aggregation of them , and the embowering cluster , that so strongly imitates Nature in her most agreeable forms , and leaves nothing of her grace to be desired . The effect of planting low shrubs near the house is invariable in its advantages : it is demonstrative of cultivation ; it affords a variety of breaks to the views around ; and assists in blending the upright lines of the sides of the house with the horizontal one of its base . If a house be viewed , as it usually is when some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed as a rule , that the base line should be in part concealed by intervening plantations . To the judicious arrangement of plantations , and a suitable selection of the trees and shrubs which compose them , a villa is indebted for many picturesque advantages , and to effect this object in the fullest extent , the architect should possess many qualifications of the painter and landscape gardener ; indeed , these accomplishments for the purpose are so necessary to his design , that few professors of architecture are now without considerable information upon the principles of both ; and applying them scientifically , they usually escape those errors which almost of necessity occur when the purpose is attempted upon no better authority than that of fancy , or of individual opinion . c- /q/ /z/ CLAUDE LORRAIN , Poussin , and other celebrated landscape-painters of the seventeenth century , introduced forms of buildings in their compositions that were well suited to the poetic feeling obvious in the works of those great masters ; the feature is common to the countries in which they painted , but it was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity with the chief subjects of their pencils , than could be expected to exist in buildings generally erected without other considerations than such as merely related to fitness and conveniency . From these artists our own painters have adopted a similar contour in their representations of buildings in pictures of ideal scenery , in which the higher or poetic class of landscape is represented , and at length , it may be termed , in consequence of its frequent use , the painter 's style of buildings ; thus the subject of the annexed plate being a design for the residence of one of our first artists , the forms have been selected from works of pictorial beauty . This villa is also suited to the man of literary study , or to the amateur of taste , as the apartments arranged for the painter 's accommodation are equally well disposed for a library , or for a collection of works of art . A , is the entrance , approached by a flight of steps from the carriage-road , and sheltered by a porch formed by a small building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ante-room B , or cabinet for small pictures : this room would /z/ also form the library , the books being contained in dwarf cases , over which the paintings would be suspended . C is the picture-gallery , lighted from above , and communicating with the painting-room D : this room is the whole height of the building , and receives its light from above the lean-to a , which contains a room for the preparation of colours and for the attendant . These rooms are separated from the domestic part of the house , except at b , by the entrance-hall A , from which the hall and staircase are approached : this communicates with the drawing-room F , and the dining-room G , which open to each other by foldingdoors : the differing forms and proportions of these rooms , aided by the symmetry of the other parts of it , would have a very pleasing effect , particularly if mirrors were placed over each of the chimney-pieces . A jib-door forms an entrance to the passage H , and is used for the service of dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L is the entrance for the servants , M is the kitchen , N the scullery , and O the larder . Cellar room would be obtained beneath the whole or any part of this building , provided it were so placed as to allow proper means of drainage from the parts excavated to form them . The staircase leads to the chambers , and also to an observatory , which would afford an agreeable study or secluded museum . The situation for this building should be of the most picr turesque kind , and well supplied by plantations ; and as the ground would probably be elevated and boldly undulating , a variety of prospect and scenery might be obtained necessary to harmonize with an edifice of this design : but as a good supply of water is of the first importance , such situations should be carefully examined , lest the expense or labour of procuring it should eventually prove that the spot ought not to have been selected . In valleys , and particularly in the neighbourhood of rivers . /q/ water is procured with ease ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elevated ground , springs are rarely found unless at excessive depths , their sources being dependant on the vapour and rain which fall and percolate tiie strata of the eairth ; these subterraneous streams or depositories are frequently so much below the surface of the ground that the wells made to intercept or reach them , must necessarily be so deep as to cause a vast expense , as well as the application of engines to raise the water , and then only by great labour . Where precautions have not been taken , the rain-water falling on the top of the house is usually collected in tanks or cisterns , but it is not suited to domestic use unless purified by filtration . The city of Venice being seated in the midst of the Adriatic , and chiefly built upon piles , there are no springs of fresh water - the inhabitants therefore collect and treasure up every drop that falls , and by an ingenious contrivance some of their tanks are made to perform , by art , that sort of filtration which is effected by Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be adopted with advantage in most situations where rain-water is needful for domestic use . The Venetians form a large reservoir , which is frequently the area of the court or yard belonging to each building , and the bottom of it is made to incline rapidly from the sides to their general centre - at this point a circular veiling is built , so as to make a small well , which being continued to the surface is so used ; - the remainder of the tank is filled with clean sand , of various granulations , and well rammed , becoming a compact mass , upon which the pavement is laid , and forming the court or yard , but first arched drains are built in the tank on every side , into which all the water that falls upon the premises is conveyed , and thence passing through the sand tovirards the well in the centre , the water becomes purified , and is excellently preserved in large quantities . /z/ An useful means of filtration is provided at a small expense by layers of ivory-black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslin , and enclosed in a box pierced with many small holes through both its bottom and its lid ; this box must be fixed in the bottom of a large vessel , so that the water placed in it may pass through the charcoal , whence it will become purified and clear ; for charcoal , when employed as a filter , acts in two ways : first , mechanically , as in the common filter ; and secondly , it possesses the power of acting chemically on the water , so as to deprive it of any taint or smell that it may contain - the charcoal of animal substances is to be preferred to that of vegetable , and it should be renewed every three or four months .   , AH tj ? A Cottage okree . /q/ PLATfi XVIII . /z/ THE elegancies of life are the results of prosperity in all countries , but in none are the means of comfort so much cultivated as in our own . Splendour and magnificence are made subordinate to the calmer enjoyments of domestic felicity , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the means of friendly intercourse and rational retirement . That our buildings should be designed with views peculiar to these objects , may be weU expected ; they beea . uecesefaily brought to accomplish this end , that all countries have acknowledged the superiority of our habitations for the purposes of life , and studiously imitate the arrangements of an English dwelling . There is within us , also , a native aversion to assume beyond the limits of our means and of our powers ; and every thing that seems to profess more than is warranted by its intrinsic merit , becomes repugnant to our feelings . The architecture of this country has very evidently been operated on by such impressions ; for the external parts of our buildings are too often neglected , even to reproach , although the internal arrangements are studied and executed with scrupulous discernment ; and there are few houses that do not surprise us by the size and number of the apartments , in proportion to the limited appearance of their elevations . The design is made to conform to this feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior claims . It is in- /z/ tended to effect the object of uniting architectural elegance with comfort , for an establishment within the confines of a moderate fortune . In forming this plan , care has been taken to avoid whatever experience has found to be objectionable relating to the domestic offices , , and to afford facility of conmiunication to the apartments , without subjecting them to inconvenience or offence . The door of separation in the hall completely divides the offices from the superior parts of the house . The pantry is near the dining-room , and commands the porch . The servants*-hall is beyond the door leading to the yard , and has the effect of being detached from the house , though really within it . The kitchen is arranged with the same advantages ; the door opposite the pantry is only in use for the service of dinner . The scullery is wholly removed from the house . The laundry and wash-house are yet more retired , and inunediately under the inspection of the housekeeper , who , in this arrangement , is considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - hall . The larder and dairy are farther removed from the inhabited parts ; and the offices on this side are approachable by a trellis colonnade , so that at all seasons they are accessible with safety . The minor staircase leads to the chamber-landings and to the cellars ; there is a stair to the cellar also , from the colonnade . The chambers contain three apartments for the men , three for the maid-servants , and a room for stores . From the porch , a hall of small dimensions communicates with a waiting-room , which is a receptacle for coats , hats , sticks , &c.; Water should be laid on to a wash-stand near the window ; this room contains a vter-closet . The dining-room entrance is from this hall , and is favourably situated for the service of dinner . The dining-room is unconnected with the retiring apartments ; but a jib-door communicates with the vestibule , /q/ and precludes the necessity of passing through the hall to the drawing*room or gallery . The niches to contain candelabra at the sideboard end , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an architectural decoration consonant Mrith the purposes of this room . The withdrawing-room , breakiiBust-room , and gallery or library , are approached from the vestibule , and from each other . The advantages of this arrangement are so obvious , that they are not treated of ; but in the general adoption of the connected drawing-room and library , the mind becomes highly gratified on contemplating the acknowledged influence of female intellect , and those charms of social loveliness , that have allured the apartment of study from its obscure retreat . The drawing-room is so formed as to avoid the dark shades which invariably collect in the comers of all rooms , and affords the means of a very elegant decoration . The gallery is lighted from the top , as its purpose is to contain pictures , marbles , bronzes , and books , and thus admit a beautiful variety of arrangements . The vestibule is always a most desirable appurtenance to a dwelling , and is here situated so as to afford additional ventilation ; it reaches to the top of the building , and is surmounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms the approach to the chambers . The vestibule opens to the staircase , and the staircase to this gallery . A water-closet is contained in the retired part of the staircase . The chambers above , are four , three with a dressing-room , and one without it . Simplicity of character has been the leading object of this design . It will be seen that the extent of the house is aimed to be defined by the pilasters , which are in number , four on the porch-front , four on the lawn-front , and two on the returning end ; the remainder being plain walls , would be planted against , and hid by shrubberies , as there are no windows of the offices looking outwards . /z/ The Palladian sashes of the dining-room , drawing-room , and the door of the breakfast-room , open to a stone terrace , which descends by two steps to the lawn . The terrace is so elegant in its character , and so useful as a promenade after wet weather , that it should be reluctantly , if ever , dispensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are distant from the building the width of the terrace : from the apartments they produce a beautiful contrast to the scenery ; to the front of the house they are a substitute for columns ; and , in connexion with the pilasters , they afford a portion of that variety which renders intercolumniations so fascinating by the change which is transferred by the moving spectator to the building . /z/ &c.; &c.; /z/ It will be perceived by this and the following design , that a cheerful and inviting character of scenery is suitable to them , being contrived to display it to advantage , and induce the traveller to desire a fisirther investigation ; but it requires a superior order of landscape excellence in other parts of the grounds , to fulfil the expectation that such a promise begets in the mind of every intelligent visitor . When , however , such means are in possession , it is very proper to give him at the entrance of the park so recommendatory a foresight of its qualities ; for the entrance of a property effecting the earliest impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some importance that it should be of the favourable kind ; because in this as in other instances oi Jirst impressions , it is not easily eradicated , and probably the mind will be more strongly operated on should it have the appearance of repulsiveness , or other objectionable features . /z/ This idea was some years ago oddly pursued by an old nobleman , whose summer recreation consisted in making extensive journeys through England , Scotland , and Wales : he amused himself with speculations upon the character of the individuals from the entrances to their several properties as he met with them upon the road ; and he insisted , that he had become so great a proficient in catching the predominant one of the entrance itself , that he rarely failed in pronouncing that of its owner ; until at length he declined to visit those with whom he intended to pass short spaces of time , during his tour , if he thought that he perceived characteristics objectionable to him in the entrances to their domains . ** It is very easy , ' ' said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which to the vain and conceited ; which to the liberal , the prodigal , the penurious , the courteous , the frivolous , the reserved , or the nervous ; and it matters not that they may have been made by the predecessors of the present occupiers ; had there been great differences of nature in them , the entrances would have been altered . " How far his Lordship 's theory might be practically correct , to so great an extent , may very properly be doubted ; but certain it is , it often happens that prejudices are formed at this early period of a visit , that are not readily removed even by manners the most liberal and conciliating . The lodge is not intended to be repeated at the other extremity of the railing and gates , being designed only for an estate of small dimensions ; but should it be desirable in a larger domain , to effect greater symmetry and convenience , it will be proper to increase the length of railing to which the gates are connected , or the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates are proposed to be chiefly of cast-iron , on account of economy and of durability . /q/ The manufacture of iron has been greatly benefited by improvements in the art of easting it , by which the embossed parts are relieved from the moulds with so much purity , that little labour is afterwards required to complete the richest ornamental work in this metal , which is therefore performed at a small expense compared with the execution of such work a short time sipce ; and as iron itself is now at a very reduced price , it may be expected that richly embossed works will come into frequent use , particularly as this metal is now so generally substituted for several other materials , that the century may not improperly be called another iron age . About ninety or a hundred years ago , superb works in iron , as gates and railings , were very ftushionable , and Mr. Adam , the architect , did his utmost to revive the richness of them in all his works ; but there was yet an error in connecting iron-railings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement so soon as the effects were discovered : in fact , two or more pieces of iron ought not to be placed together , so that their flat surfaces come in contact with each other , and the parts which join the several pieces should be as small as possible , for the rusting of the connecting parts speedily separates them ; the progressively accumulating rust effects this still farther , and the repairs by lead which the smiths supply , continue the advancement of the separation , until the height and width of the whole work far exceed its original dimensions ; and thus its own strength and fitness are destroyed , and the stone-work with which it may be connected , is torn to pieces . This circumstance has given some persons the false notion that iron grows when in a manufactured state , and increases in length and bulk by lapse of time . Curious examples of what has been stated may be seen at the south firont of the Bank of England , where the basement of the building is dilapidated to an extraordinary extent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing to the parapet of the terrace towards the river was in a similar ruinous state , and exceedingly dangerous . Architects now prevent these effects by correcting the error in the practice of the manufactory , and by fixing the whole as independently as possible of other parts of the building . /q/ /z/ AN entrance , whether it be to park or other property , should be designed in strict correspondence of character with the building to which it is the means of approach ; and also . bear a relative proportion to the extensiveness , or limitation of the estate . The lodge and facade are appropriate to the park and mansion ; the lodge and gateway to the villa and its plantations ; and to . the cottage om and its shrubberies , the ornamental gate alone is suitable , which may be designed to accord with the peculiar features of the building . The annexed design was intended to become an unostentatious entrance to a small property of the superior class ; it does not therefore comprise lodges which , in this instance , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mansion was supposed to be of moderate dimension , and the domain of no great extent : it was , however , intended that the residence of the porter should be in the immediate neighbourhood ; for without the certainty of attendance , a property with such an enclosure has an inaccessible appearance . The piers of this design are more decorated than usual ; those of the centre support Grecian vase lamps , and are embellished by bas-reliefs of figures supporting ornamental foliages . The gates are of iron , with iron standards supporting them independently of the stone*work , and they are chastely ornamented ; the side piers are made to receive the stone or brick wall with which the estate is surrounded , or to be repeated so as to form a facade of greater extent and importance . /z/ Whether the enclosures to parks are of stone , brick , or oak , they are capable of producing very picturesque effects from without , as they pass over the surface of undulating ground , or wind amongst the trees and coppices that usually blend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be occasionally displayed to advantage , for they bespeak the wealth or rank of the proprietor . This observation , however , refers only to the exterior ; for having passed the lodge , the boundaryfenc is no longer a desirable object , for there , every thing that produces the feeling of restraint , or subtracts from the idea of ample possession , is offensive . The fences of the interior should likewise be formed so as to avoid similar objections , and the utmost care should be taken that fences erected as sub-divisions of the property should not be mistaken for the actual boundary ; on the other hand , it is possible by the occasional substitution of a park-paling , in lieu of the brick or stone-work that forms the fence-wall , to give the appearance of a sub-division only , to that which is really the remotest enclosure of the park , and thereby to remove much of an objectionable feature . The sunk-fence , the ha-ha , and the invisible-fence , are all judicious means of separation for the several purposes to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter in iron , at a moderate expense , has given it an advantage over the other two that it will probably maintain for a long time , provided its merited reputation for superiority in many cases , be not tarnished by the inadequate substance that is frequently given to the standards and to the rods , for the purpose of saving a small additional expense , which saving is the cause of its becoming an inadequate barrier to cattle , who , therefore , injure or destroy it by the common pressure that all fences are subject to sustain . /q/ /z/ The approach , or road from the eatrance to the house , should appear the nearest and most eligible for the passenger to pursue , and as a straight line is the shortest possible from one given point to another , it would naturally occur in all cases ; but being objectionable in point of taste , the curved line is adopted with propriety when the causes of its deviation are natural , and do no violence to art . Trees , banks , or other obstructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily inclines to the curve of path that leads from it without materially swerving from the chief object of his pursuit . In grounds that are undulating , curved roads would form the natural lines of approach , for the foot insensibly seeks relief by lessening the altitude of the plane by which it mounts and descends , and seeks rather to go round the hill , than directly over it : thus we find that the inartificial foot-paths made over newly-ploughed fields are always curves or straight lines , as the grounds over which they pass are level or composed of hill and valley . On these principles the approach should be formed , giving the visitor a suitable display of the possessions through which he passes , taking care at the same time that nothing shall seem ostentatiously displayed , and nothing carefully concealed ; for , in the first instance , the mind is ofi*ended by the intrusive assumption of superiority ; and in the second , by the imagination , which , in such cases , readily supplies images less favourable than the real and objectionable thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said that approaches should not intersect the park or lawn ; neither should they skirt its boundary : the skilful artist will , however , so support his road by bankings , bridges , or plantations , that it shall neither be an undressed division-line. /z/ nor be constantly in danger of exposing the limits of the property . Foot-paths of gravel or other material , to permit the free use of exercise at all times and seasons , are absolutely necessary in decorative grounds , plantations , and gardens ; they demand the best skill of the designer , who employs them to lead the visitor to what is excellent , and to remove him from what is objectionable : - by foot-paths he produces the intricacy that delights by its rich variety , or , by a more simple disposal , gives effect to the lawns and shrubberies which accompany them , or to the landscape and distant scenery . Of foot-paths , it may be observed , that they should rarely cross each other at right angles , or when branching out into other or lesser paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lines continue to depart from each other so effectually that they shall not at any time be seen to form parallel lines . /q/ /z/ THE study of botany has long been added to the catalogue of rural amusements , it has provided an embellishment of the most agreeable kind to the garden , and also to the mansion ; for instead of being , as originally , in a removed situation , the conservatory is now placed in connexion with the house itself , with which it elegantly combines , and gives an apartment highly valuable from its beauty and cheerfulness . When the conservatory is included in the arrangement of the house on the first formation of the design , it is capable of affording a large addition to its architectural beauty ; and when it is joined to it as an appendage , it frequently becomes so , though in a less degree perhaps , unless circumstances are very favourable , as great judgment is required to connect it with the building so as to display its proposed forms without injury to those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive its character , and of which it should assume to be a part ; for , however agreeable variety may be , incongruity is always fatal to its charms with every well-cultivated and tasteful mind . Habit , perhaps , has lessened the ill impression which a conservatory makes upon us when formed without reference to the edifice to which it is attached ; for at first being merely a green-house placed against the building , which became gradually increased to architectural pretension in form , the violence that has since been done to fitness by strange mixtures of style , has been too much disregarded . The conservatory is distinguished fixm the green-house by the circumstance of its affording protecticm only to the plants ; /z/ whereas the latter is used for rearing them , and it has become an apartment in which they are arranged for display , merely allowing space for walks , or a promenade , and is frequently used as a breakfast or morning-room . When separated from the house , it forms a rural temple , or elegant central building ; when joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which it is properly applicable , both as it relates to the time of the day in which these rooms are in common use , and to the cheerfulness and health which plants afford at those times . It is attached occasionally , but improperly , to the dining and drawing-rooms ; because , as is well known , plants absorb in the evening a large portion of that quality of vital air that is essential to human existence , which in the ' day-time , and particularly in the morning , they assist to supply . Plants , like animals , consume a large portion of oxygen , and if this be denied to them they wither and die . Preparatory to some alterations of a conservatory a short time since , the plants were removed into other apartments , it being winter , and the weather severe , fires of charcoal were made at night , and placed amongst them in braziers : as the proprietor was not aware of the effects of charcoal on atmospheric air , he ordered the doors to be closed , intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but as a due proportion of fresh air was not supplied , in the morning they were found to have suffered , as it is probable animals so circumstanced would also have suffered . - The most tender were quite dead , some lingered a short time and died , and only a few of the strongest survived ; but they have not yet recovered their former vigour , although this is the second spring since the circumstance took place . The conservatory represented in the annexed plate is designed agreeably to the Gothic style , and is suited therefore to buildings of the same or of the castle character . The ground-plan is divided into three compartments : that attached to the house /z/ forms the entrance . The centre would receive the highest stages for the plants , and it would be covered with a roof of glass . Small aviaries might be made on each side of the third space , which would complete the avenue formed fixm the entrance of the apartments of the house . The interior framing of the centre part might be constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of our ancient baronial halls and churches , which , springing from slender pillars , would ramify with great elegance , combine with the grouping of the plants , and very properly harmonize with them ; for their fonns are so like rows of trees uniting their branches , that it has not been unaptly imagined that avenues of trees gave the first idea , not only of the pointed arch , but of the groins and vaultings that since decorated our beautiful Gothic cathedrals . The close groined ceilings of the extreme compartments would give force and variety to this arrangement , which would have a very novel and ornamental effect . The glass of the centre part to the south is intended to be removed at certain seasons of the year , and the whole is surrounded by a low stone terrace , approached by two steps , and terminated by small jets d'eau . This platform would be an agreeable promenade , particularly if plants and flowers were tastefully arranged in groups , forming its surface into a diversified parterre . Ingenious stoves and apparatus have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green-houses by steam , some of which have been employed with great advantage ; particularly that possessing the means to create at pleasure an abundant vapour , which it disperses over all the plants , and is an occasional substitute for watering them individually . For this purpose , the steam tube that imparts the heat , is fixed above a shallow and open trough , into which cold water is /z/ turned when the vapour is desir ; the heated tube acting upon the surface of this water it is speedily converted into vapour , which may be continued during any length of time , and when no longer desired , the water is let out of the trough , when of course the operation ceases . The whole of this apparatus may be placed beneath the level of the floor , so as to cause no interruption to the arrangement of the stages ; and the stove and boilers may be placed at a convenient distance from the building . r 1 =LJ-Lij /q/ /z/ WHEN the fashionable amusements of the town are relinquished for those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind as the dairy . Perhaps the poets have given a sentiment to all that belongs to pastoral life , or in its own nature the means of supplying pleasurable ideas , may have a real existence : indeed , it is probable , that nature and the poet may have combined to give a relish for an amusement that is equally engaging and healthful , and taste has not failed to add its influence in favour of this subject ; for there are few residences , whose possessors have been acknowledged to lead in the walks of polished fancy , or pictorial beauty , where the dairy has not formed an agreeable feature in the order of its rural offices . The design is of a rustic character , suited to the purpose for which it is intended , yet not so simple in its form as to be mistaken for a cottage ; its entrance is more elevated and more embellished , and the windows of a superior description . The eaves of the roof appearing to be low , the lofty interior has a proportionably increased effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dome , into which the octagon plan resolves itself , after forming four spacious niches , which it obtains from the square basement of the walls . The glass-door , opposite to the entrance , communicates with a passage , in which flowers of peculiar beauty and fragrance may be preserved , and terminates with the servants ' - room , used for the cleansing of the vessels , churning , and other business of this department of rural economy . /z/ The folding-door of entrance to the dairy would be of glass , the pavement of marble , and the tables for the vessels are designed to be composed of the verd antique Mona marble , supported by terms of the same material surmounted by China vases ; the dado and pilasters to correspond , finishing the walls by a verd antique architrave : it is proposed to fill up the compartments , formed by these means , with glazed tiles of a tone of colour harmonizing with the marbles . The niches are designed to contain tripods , or urns , dedicated to the pastoral deities , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spring , as their lively , sparkling motion , joined with the coolness they impart to the air in warm seasons , make them fit ornaments for this species of building ; and the variety of gently splashing sound which they produce , adds considerably to the interest created in their favour . The dome would be divided into trellis compartments , each rib being supported by a pilaster that forms the subdivision of the side walls ; and the heads of the niches are intended to be ornamented to correspond with the dome . The windows are designed to be of the oriel kind , formed with oak muUions , and embellished with painted glass , which would throw over the whole a variety of brilliant and coloured light , greatly improving the general effect . This plan permits a considerable portion of the whole building to have hollow walls , and the roof would be double also ; a contrivance very essential to the dairy , but not of itself sufficient to preserve that temperature which is desirable during the excessive heats of summer ; but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been created through the double walls and roof , this is completely effected . Care should at the same time be taken , that this circulation may be retarded , or wholly prevented , by means of regulators easy of access , whenever a change of circumstances may make it necessary . The servants ' - room should be well supplied with water and with /q/ cisterns , for keeping the vessels , immersed in it , cool when out of use , and , of course , with coppers and other necessary apparatus ; and it is of the first consequence that the whole should be well drained , and be built upon a dry soil , or so constructed as to be free from damps . The dairy is always a pleasing object : the situation in which it should be placed , is , therefore , worthy of consideration , as far as it relates to ornamental effect . As it is an office of domestic use , it should be near to other offices of a similar nature , and should not obtrude itself into the plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as retiring from that embellished scenery , of which it merits to form a part , but to which it asserts no claim . The dairy may be thatched with reeds ; and in this design the projecting roof protects it from the sun . It should always be well sheltered , and placed where its use will not be injured by the extremes of temperature ; but it ought not to be too closely surrounded by trees and shrubs , as many of them impart a flavour to milk , and the fermentation of decaying leaves is most detrimental to it : and although wood and trees afford shade , and break the violence of the winds , and after rain , or snow , they produce cold , from the evaporation which takes place on the leaves ; yet the moisture is often impregnated with injurious matter . It has been said , that the best trees for shelter are spruce firs , which , from the resinous quality , as well as the linear form of their leaves , do not retain much moisture : hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , and sinks into the surface soil , consequently little evaporation takes place ; and perhaps from this may be deduced the chief reason why the spruce delights in a moist soil . Very pleasing combinations may be formed at the back of the dairy , by means of the cowhouses , pheasantry , poultry-houses , apiary , and pigeon-house , /z/ connected with a small grass paddock , and shrubs tastefully arranged . The dairy is usually built on a damp spot of ground ; is often a vault or apartment under ground ; and in all cases the foundation and soil on which it is Jaced are made damp by the water that is used in them , and not sufficiently drained away . All this is done or permitted erroneously ; for the vapours caused by the stagnant damps , as they may properly be termed , contain the principles of fermentation , and consequently of corruption . It should be built on the driest soil possible , and the extraneous water speedily be conveyed away by proper drains : then , and then only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which a desirable coolness is always imparted : the importance of this observation , towards the perfection of the dairy , will be an apology for its repetition . /z/ i .. - ' , - Tr , r : . i , Ciwr.w. - . ' . fflT-j'r. - , ' /q/ /z/ THIS building is planned for the convenience of small parties engaged in the amusement of angling , and other sports of the - wBter , where accommodation can not be obtained in its neighbourhood . The cottage would also afford that temporary retirement , which so often becomes delightful from the difficulty there is to ensure it amidst the gay and bustling scenes of social or fashionable intercourse . The neighbourhood of the Lakes , the margin of some river , or an island , would afford a proper situation for this building ; and should it be placed near other property belonging to its possessor , the kitchen and a sleepingroom might be the permanent residence of the woodman , the shepherd , or other married servant of the estate , whose wife would keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would consist of a parlour , a kitchen , a room for the fishing apparatus , two closets , a staircase ; and above , of two bedrooms , and a store-closet . Should it be desired as an ornamental cottage merely , the room for the tackle would supply convenience for the larder , wine , and beer-cellars ; and , if properly situated , the design would become an useful embellishment to extensive grounds . The front is ornamented by pilasters , and the sides by verandahs , formed by the projections of the roof . This dwelling may be executed in stone , brick covered with stucco , or wood-framing and brick-work mixed , the framing being filled up with brick-nogging , and the surface of the timbers covered bv tiles , which , if the brick-work is allowed to project an inch before the timbers , makes a good foundation for /z/ stucco . This composition may be made of Roman cement , unless where lathing is used , and then it may be covered by any of those stuccoes that are chiefly composed of lime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected from wet . In this case the Roman cement is not applicable ; it needs a firmer ground-work than lathing affords to it , and it very soon cracks , and becomes disengaged from the tie it at first received by means of the interstices between the laths . The Roman cement , when used upon brick-work , forms a durable composition : it is prepared from a stone not uncommon in several parts of the kingdom , but not usually found in quantities sufficient for the consumption of a building . This is calcined and reduced to a fine powder ; it is then mixed , in small quantities at a time , with clean sharp sand and water ; and it requires some dexterity to work , as it sets , as it is technically termed in a way similar to plaster of Paris . A notion has obtained very generally amongst country working people , whether masons , bricklayers , or plasterers , that the Roman cement may be very properly and usefully mixed with lime for stucco , or with mortar for common purposes ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it " go farther ; " that is , to make a certain quantity at a less expense than if cement and sand only were used . These practices are fatal to the intention ; the cement is destroyed by any mixture of lime , and when used with it for a stucco , it will remain on the walls but a very short time . If compositions or stuccoes are formed with good stone lime and clean sharp sand in several degrees of granulation , mixed with a small quantity of water , and well beaten together , instead of using a large quantity of wter to save this labour , a very excellent stucco is produced , of a near resemblance to Portland stone , which is a compound of a due proportion of carbonate of lime , silex , and alumine . The stucco should be /q/ made as IcNng as convenient before it is used , and time will give it considerable hardness , provided it is well covered by copings on the tops of the walls . In this design , as in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building is covered by lead , and entered upoa from the chamber-floor , by folding casements , or glassrdoors . In the execution of such works , great care is necessary to be taken , that a very usual inconvenience does not occur from the external wet , which will often make its way into the house , at the spot in which the flat terminates at the window ; and there are several causes for this circumstance , all arising from the means taken to finish the lead at the aperture ; none of which would exist if the lead works were completed before the sash-frame was put into its place , and so formed as to be a trough-like receptacle for the sill afterwards to be placed within it , allowing the trough to be ample enough to receive any water that may overflow the sill , or run down the glass on the inside of the apartment , caused by a condensation of the vapours which sometimes takes place in the chambers . - From both these causes it happens , not unfrequently , that large quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it is supposed that the lead is itself imperfect on the outside of the building ; consequently much time is lost in useless search , and the evil left without a remedy . The injury sustained by the appearances of wet or damps , is not all the consequence . of the very common error in this part of a building , for it has very often occurred that the breastsummer , or beam , that is the support of the wall over bay-windows , or similar projections , becomes rapidly decayed by the frequent admission of water , and the dry-rot has often here taken place , so as to destroy the timber in a very short time , causing an incalculable expense to restore the parts necessarily damaged in its removal . /z/ Such lead flats should be laid with greater currents than is usual , and then should invariably be from the house , for if towards it , the water readily enters at the little cracks which commonly take place at the spot most used , and which , of course , is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellars have not been provided , but if situation would permit a sufficient depth for them , without a liability to damp , they might be approached by a continuation of the staircase described in the plan . /z/ Dl- /q/ /z/ A COMMAND of heat and cold is so valuable towards a full possession of the innocent enjoyments of life , that the cultivation of them as luxuries might be expected in a degree much greater than we find them even among the affluent , or those most studious of health or comfort . Baths , that in other countries , and from early times , have been considered as essential parts of healthful economy , are not in common nor in frequent use with us , being resorted to merely as restoratives to health , rather than as preventions of disease , or as the means of occasional refreshment ; and this is the more extraordinary , as our country is subject to such variations of temperature , that the warm and cold baths , if used properly , must become delightful resources and means towards correcting the injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change as frequently occur with us , and which are attended with no little violence to our constitutions . We possess also the means of preserving a certain degree of cold , and though it does not afford benefits parallel with the importance of those we obtain by a command of the more active element , fire , yet it is worth an extent of cultivation that it has never obtained with us : for in this country there are but few conservatories of ice , except in the metropolis , from which the public can be supplied ; and the few that are possessed by noblemen and others of fortune , are not sufficiently spacious , nor sufficiently used , to give the advantages they are otherwise capable of affording . Beyond the common uses of assisting in the department of the /z/ confectioner , the ice-house forms an excellent larder for the preservation of every kind of food that is liable to be injured by heat in summer ; thus fish game , poultry , butter , &c.; may be kept for a considerable time : indeed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal largely in either fish or venison ; and for the table , where coolness is desirable , the use of ice in summer is a great luxury . By the proper introduction of ice into apartments in close and sultry days , streams of cool and refreshing air are produced that no other means can obtain ; for the air that is cooled by the ice being urged forward by the warm air , continued currents are created , that prove as salutary as agreeable . The preservation of ice is by no means difficult ; coolness , dryness , and a confinement from external air , are all that are required ; and in some varm countries , and in Italy particularly , great use is made of chafi* towards the preservation of ice . The ice-house for this purpose is then only a deep hole dug in the ground on the side of a hill , from the bottom of which a drain is made to let out the water that is occasioned by the partial melting of the ice . If the ground is tolerably dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fill the pit with pure snow , or with ice taken from the purest and clearest water ; because they do not , as is customary with us , set the bottles in the ice , but really mix it with the wine itself . They first cover the bottom of the hole with chaff and then lay in the ice , not letting it any where touch the sides , but ramming in a lai bed of chaff all the way between ; thus they carry on the filling to the top , and then cover the surface with chaff , making a farther covering of thatch to preserve it from the weather , and in this manner it will keep as long as they please : when they take any out of it for use , they wrap the lump up in chaff , and it may then be carried to a considerable distance without waste /q/ or running . The best situation for the ice-house is the side of a hill , and the best soil is chalk or gravel ; its aspect should be to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porches are more pernicious than warmth , and the morning sun will expel them . The design contained in the annexed plate is for an ice-house , calculated for an embellishment to the grounds of a nobleman , and contains in its plan and section all the requisites to the construction of an ice-well . It shows the double wall for drainage of surrounding water or damps ; the porches a and b to exclude the external air ; the air-traps and drain c c , to carry off the meltings of the ice , and to prevent the passage of air up the drain , which would prove fatal to the purpose ; and d represents the mouth of the drain terminating in a pond , to which an iron grating should be afiixed , to prevent the ingress of rats and other veiinin , that frequently destroy an ice-well without exhibiting the cause , which admits a concealed passage of air into the cell , or chief apartment of the building . Small ice-wells may be executed at a very moderate expense , provided the means of drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , they would be formed without difficulty in the vaults , without much additional excavation , and here they would probably be more used , but that the impression which prevails as to the enormous expense attending the formation of an ice- well in London , has prevented it - this impression has arisen from the wells made for confectioners , which , from the demands of their trade , are necessarily very spacious , and the formation proportionably expensive ; for such large buildings , amidst the various impediments and obstructions opposed by the pavements , vaults , water-pipes , common-sewers , and contiguous buildings , must amount to a large sum ; and in several cases , where the site and other circumstances have been unfa- /z/ vourable , the expense of one of these depositories of ice has been almost incredible . In the country these difficulties do not occur , and beside the luxuries which the various use of ice aiSbrds , the building to preserve it may there be made usefully ornamental . /q/ /z/ WHEN the style that prevailed in gardening seemed to depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the parterres were disposed with all the formal accuracy of the line and compass , it was considered that stone terraces , ballustrades , facades , and temples , were very suitable embellishments to such scenery ; they were profusely employed to decorate every garden that professed the least pretension to tasteful cultivation , and they certainly formed the chief attraction in them . Much of this fashion being abandoned for one in which the mason only was less employed , and where the gardener yet pursued his linear and symmetrical notions of grace and elegance ; vases , and groups of figures in fjtastical shapes , were occasionally introduced for " eye-traps , " as they were called , and continued to promote the encouragement of our lead-mines , if not of true taste , until the simple , yet varied beauties of rural nature obtained their well-merited imitation . The business of the landscape-gardener was now to disencumber the ground of such objects , and to give strong effect to particular points of view composed of distant scenery , which led to the present greatly improved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet perhaps a little " unfurnished , " if the term may so be used ; and partakes , therefore , too much of the b &re; and bald that has long been complained of as prevailing in all the constituent parts of our residences . Rusticseats , bowers , root-houses , heath-houses , and such small buildings , now , though certainly very sparingly , decorate our gardens , when propriety would admit something in substitution for them . /z/ more corresponding with the character of the place and of the scene , and more analogous to classic art . Entertaining this opinion , but falling in with the general practice , the designs of garden-seats are presented to our readers , as claiming a share of novelty , that perhaps may be allowed to them , both on account of the designs themselves , and the peculiarity of their construction . The form of the upper design is an imitation of those buildings in India that were frequently erected for monumental or devotional purposes , and very nearly resembles an umbrella : the stem and beams of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the roof filled in with copper sheeting . The stem being fastened firmly into the ground , the wind would have very little efiect upon it , particularly as it would possess a certain degree of flexibility ; and with very little trouble the whole might be removed from one spot to another , and there fixed as in the first instance . The design beneath this is of the marquee character , and the covering is supposed to be of such cloth as is generally used for them , the devices being either woven in the cloth itself , or painted upon it . Thi is supported upon an iron framing fi-om which it is farther extended by cords . By preparing sockets in several parts of the grounds , so fitted to the stem or the upright as to receive it , the whole might be removed and fixed in a few minutes ; and in winter it could be put away , as the ribs of the top might be prepared to fold into a small compass , and the covering packed up as is usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanies this article , represents a verandah adapted to a balcony , as an useful and ornamental appendage to a London dwelling . No decorations have so successfully varied the dull sameness of modem structures in the metropolis , as the verandah , the lengthened window , and the balcony ; they have produced an intrinsic elegance , and have done much to overcome the architectural prejudice supported in this country , which very unphilosophically adopts the proportion of windows applicable to a clear and warm climate , in one not quite so liable to the effects of light and heat . The verandah would long ago have taken a substantial and architectural character , but that an Act of Parliament is more than impliedly fatal to the erection of them in streets and squares ; but the magistrates , and indeed the surveyors of the districts , with much good sense , have hitherto permitted them to be projected in the light manner in which this design bespeaks them to be executed . They are sometimes made of metal in this character , and it would be incongruous to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support could not be erected from beneath . It is not improbable , that at some future day the verandah and piazza will form a considerable architectural beauty in this metropolis , and that they will be constructed in a way suitable to the nature of our climate . No colour is so proper for this sort of verandah as the bronze , as it assumes a substantial , though light appearance ; every /z/ other colour bespeaks it of wooden construction , and is offensive to the eye of taste . The verandah is of Eastern and of very ancient origin . Whether the verandah be formed chiefly of wood or iron , its smaller ornamental parts , such as frets , scrolls , or golosses , may be made of lead , with great advantage , and at a small expense ; not by casting it into those forms , but simply by cutting it out of thick sheet lead , and applying it by nails or rivets . - This method of executing similar ornaments will be found very expeditious , useful , and of general application . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be erected in the park of a nobleman whose mansion is in the same style of architecture , and whose family are too far distant from the parish church to ensure regular attendances at Divine worship . Every nobleman , who respects the advantages resulting from piety and order , and weighs well the influence of example , and public testimonies of respect for religion upon the manners and conduct of society , will be ready to afford a similar means for Divine service when other opportunities are absent ; for it is alike his duty to the Almighty , and his dependants , to provide this source of instruction , comfort , and consolation : - to which the rich and the poor are equally directed by the Founder of our religion , and to which the privilege and claim of the poorest man is not lessened by an inferiority of wealth or birth . - In the service of the church all stations are equalized ; the same font is the threshold of Divine favour to the infant of the meanest as of the highest rank ; at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor and by the rich ; and here , without distinction , they kneel and offer up to Heaven , in equal communion , that purity of heart which is its only acceptable tribute ; and , when the grave is prepared to receive its alikeregarded tenants , the same service consigns them to the dust . The plan represents the arrangement of the pews and seats , the pulpit , reading , and clerk 's desks . A is the principal pew ; B the steward 's pew , or for the servants of the second table ; the seats are for the other domestics , and the agricultural servants upon the estate . C is the pulpit , D the reading-desk , o /z/ and E the situation for the clerk . It will be observed that the principal pew is elevated and approached by several steps , and is separated by a small passage from the steward 's pew , which is also elevated , but in a less degree ; and the seats are upon the floor of the chapel . This building might be erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement or stucco , and the inside finished with oak . If this were done with taste , and the windows decorated with stained glass , it would form a very interesting edifice , and be highly decorative to the property .
