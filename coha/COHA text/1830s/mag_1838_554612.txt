txt DOCUMENTARY history is to our merchants no unaccustomed thing . The careful man of business keeps a record of every transaction . Not a penny is received or expended , without a memorial ; not an ounce of sugar , not a grain of coffee is imported , but the history is preserved of the harbour where it was freighted , of the ship in which it sailed , of the port where it came to hand ; and should a millionaire who has kept his files of papers amuse himself with considering the sources of his wealth , he might trace it back to its feeblest springs ; might know what sums he had derived from lending , and what from profits in exchanges ; might follow his operations not merely into the bank or the counting-house , but to those primary elements of increase , the workshop and the field . Or look at the navigation of the country , where already a larger public interest exists . There is not a ship built upon any portion of our seacoast , on any little river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and character , and owners , are made the subject of registry ; and not a share in a sloop can change its proprietor without becoming chronicled . If we turn to the great agricultural interest , the case is the same . The history of the ownership of every foot of land is carefully preserved ; and , with the exception of a very few litigated cases , every farm and every building in the country can be traced back to its earliest occupant and its builder . Thus careful are we of every thing which relates to our material interests . Books are kept by double entry , that not a cent may stray into the obscure limits of conjectural reasoning ; ships are registered in public offices ; and deeds of lands and wills are saved from seizure or loss by becoming a matter of public record . The muse of history is charged with keeping the number of fishing smacks that go out for cod or herring , and will be denounced as false to her trust , if a cornfield changes owners without a deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indifferent to a documentary history of // our freedom . If noble thoughts have risen in men 's souls , and filled them with an enthusiasm which would not rest , till it had infused their conceptions into the fundamental legislation of the country , let us trace those conceptions to the statesmen in whose minds they sprung up , and to the moving causes which called them into being . When the farmers and mechanics of New England rushed to Bunker 's Hill , and bade defiance to all the means , which monarchy and feudalism , and the European commercial aristocracy , could bring against them , they have a right that we should be curious to investigate the causes of so strange an event ; that we should trace their activity to their farms and firesides , to the hum of village politics , to the aspirings of the great agricultural class , to the doings of their modest , unpretending committees , to the resoluteness of their uncelebrated Hampdens , to the vigorous daring of their rural captains . Let us look really into the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very truth , how the great deeds which make our land the hope of the nations , were generated and matured . History has hitherto haunted the recesses of palaces , has pryed into the mysteries of cabinets , has studied the jealousies of king 's wives and king 's mistresses ; let us send her now into the country to study man in his simplicity , to seek the earliest and humblest expressions of natural principles and feelings . Our freedom in the days of our struggle was safe ; for it had struck deep ; let us know into what soil its roots have penetrated , and how deeply and how widely they extend . New England people , especially those of Massachusetts and Connecticut , have always been a documentary people . Here we have our records that go back to the meetings of our fathers at Mr. Cradock 's in London ; and our first governor kept a faithful diary of the great events , of which he in part comprehended the greatness . Excellent WINTHROP ! In him , a yielding gentleness of temper was secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune and health in the public service , and , for the welfare of Massachusetts , cheerfully encountering poverty and premature age , his lenient benevolence could temper , if not subdue , the bigotry of his times . An honest royalist , averse to pure democracy , yet firm in his regard for existing popular liberties ; in England a conformist , yet loving " gospel purity " even to Independency , in America mildly aristocratic , advocating a government // of " the least part , " yet desiring that least part to be " the wiser of the best " ; disinterested , brave , and conscientious ; his character marks the transition of the reformation into avowed republicanism ; when the sentiment of loyalty , still sacredly cherished , was gradually yiblding to the irresistible spirit of civil freedom . Nor was Winthrop alone anxious to retain the memory of the past . The General Court , and our public men of old time , always cherished the desire , that the wonderful kindness of Providence to our people , in the days of their weakness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have seen Winthrop , and known Hubbard well ; the younger Mather kept up the zeal of research till the better days of Prince ; and the enlightened critical curiosity of Prince was followed by the histories of Hutchinson , Trumbull , and Belkuap . The fate of Hutchinson was a strange one . He loved his native commonwealth ; but , unhappily for himself , was at once ambitious of power and distrustful of popular influences . The only monument of his mind is his History of Massachusetts , written with lively inquisitiveness and a lawyerlike criticism though without a glimpse of the great truths , which were the mighty causes of the revolutions he describes . He was philosophic , if to know somewhat of the selfish principles in man be philosophy ; otherwise he was blind , except to facts . He felt himself that he had not solved the problem of the causes , which gave being and progress to Massachusetts ; and it is said that tears used to gush from his eyes as he reflected on his career , and yearned for the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next in character , if not in time , came the History of Connecticut by the accurate , pains-taking , scrupulous Trumbull . It excels Hutchinson in spirit , and equals it , nay , surpasses it in research . Its author lived in the scenes which he describes ; his heart was with the fathers of his commonwealth ; he held with them one faith and one hope ; he revered them as they appeared in the trainbands of the militia , or in the meetinghouse ; at their village toils , or in their rural legislature . A true Connecticut feeling tingled in all his veins , and animated all his thoughts . He read all sorts of records ; he picked up and tested traditions ; he was wise in the theology of Hooker and Stone ; he knew the hills and the valleys , the towns and // the villages of his commonwealth , and in fact he got Connecticut by heart before he hegan writing its histoi'y . Europe he knew hut little of ; and in reference to it he makes mistakes or betrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the name , birthplace , and career of every minister that had preached a good sermon , and every militia-man that had done a notable thing . Not a savage was overcome , not a hackslider censured by the church , hut he knew it all . His History is Connecticut put into a book ; and done , not hy a philosopher with wise arrogance , not by a heretic scoffing at men who followed somewhat the laws of Moses , not hy a lawyer showing with what indifference to precedent the New England fathers were perpetually entering upon untried experiments ; but by an honest , true-hearted Connecticut man . The exact accuracy of Trumbull , always excepting his references to European matters , merits the highest encomium . He that thinks of contradicting one of Trumbull 's statements , will do well to consider twice before publishing his thought . On two points his statements have been questioned . One relates to witches ; of whom he insists strongly , not one was ever hanged in Connecticut . Winthrop hints the opposite Hutchinson quotes Goff 's journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witch was in those days a great event , likely to create the widest interest , to he repeated by Cotton Mather , and to hrand itself indelibly on the popular mind in the town where it happened . We have taken a good deal of pains to find any sufficient ground for distrusting Trumbull ; not forgetting to examine the records in the State House ; and we are inclined to adhere to his opinion . A fact which knocks at the gate of history must show its passport , before it ought to get in ; and the tales of witches hanged in Connecticut are not duly authenticated . It may possibly have been so ; there is no evidence of any thing , but that once upon a time such a rumor reached Boston , and upon another time , a like rumor reached the poor fugitive at Hadley . Both rumors appear to have been unfounded . On one other point Dutch honor was testy ; and honest Knickerbocker cavilled loudly at Trumbull for insisting , that during Cromwell 's war with Holland , the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massacre of the people of New Haven . Both parties in the controversy are very positive . Had either examined the records at Albany // they might have found there the positive instructions of the Dutch West India Company to Stuyvesant , charging him to set the savage trihes upon poor Connecticut . Reason enough , such instructions , for all the shrieks of the historians . How far negotiations with the tribes proceeded , their belts of wampum tell not ; but the proposition itself was quite enough to startle men who loved their wives and children . The common reader would be repelled from Trumbull 's book by the diffuseness with which he details the church histories of his villages . All knotty controversies in theology are duly canvassed ; the half-way covenant and the inroads of sectarianism ; the momentous incidents of church reproof and discipline ; the merits of ministers ; these are all considered with elaborate monotony . But then the subject required it . Will you trace Connecticut liberties and laws and courage to their source ? You will ascend directly to Puritan churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old papers to find accounts of ridiculous things , that were said and done in the past days of piety and steady habits . We join not the scoffers . In the constitution and laws of Connecticut , as much as in any legislation , the wisdom and tolerance and freedom of that day culminated ; and we are none the less disposed to admire , because these great results were achieved by ministers who could feed their own cattle , or by legislators who in quiet times knew how to hold the plough . After all , the petty religious controversies of Connecticut had intrinsically as much grandeur as the palace imbecilities of the court of Louis the Fourteenth ; we respect Davenport more than we can Archbishop Laud ; and know no cardinals of that day so worthy of reverence as Hooker and Stone . Moreover , this ministerial , orthodox coloring was necessary to a faithful picture of Connecticut . In the first large group of emigrants to Hartford , Hooker the minister is the prominent figure . Or look at the colonists of the New Haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . Without straining your eye , you may see a gathering of every soul under a large tree ; and may hear a minister take for his text , " Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to he tempted of the devil " ; and the members of the young commonwealth which listened , agreed that they too were come into the wilderness to be tried . So with one heart they resolved to obey the Bible . The Bible was their constitution and code // of laws , as well as rule of faith and practice . What is the next thing to be seen there ? The farmers fell trees ; erect shelters ; and lo ! the frame-work of a barn is raised . The sight awakens to activity the innate love of constitution-making which the transcendentalists ascribe to man ; and forthwith the followers of him who was cradled in a manger hold their constituent assembly in a barn . The minister preaches " Wisdorn bath builded her house ; she bath hewn out her seven pillars " ; and straightway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric that was to be reared ; the seven men proceed to constitute the church ; and out of the sermons , and the seven men , and the church , the spirit of liberty passed forth to embody itself in a constitution . These were great men ; great in their purity ; great in their aspirations great in their singleness of purpose . They raised a noble building near the sea-side at New Haven ; God be praised , the pillars are standing yet . Next to he named is the amiable Belknap , who was cut short in his career at an earlier age than Trumbull . His History of New Hampshire* would do credit to the literature of any nation . Such was his resoluteness at research , such the accuracy of his critical judgment , that he has left few errors for the severe skepticism of Savage to detect , and but few facts for the persevering industry of Farmer to supply . His style is neat , and flowing ; not adorned , yet not barren ; always clear and always appropriate . The tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; national , yet candid . He knew how to exhibit the faults of our ancestors without impairing admiration for their virtues . In his writings the new spirit in literature , which naturally grew out of our revolution , began to appear ; and he united happily the earnestness of old times with the liberal purposes of free inquiry . It would not be easy to name any local history in any European language , superior to the History of Belknap . Of the separate states of Germany , of the separate cantons of Switzerland , we doubt if one so good has been produced . He has done his work so well , that thus far the public seems satisfied with a few additional notes , and a few corrections by his editor . But Belknap did more than write a good book . When he made Boston his place of residence , he carried there into a fruitful soil his love of historic research ; Minot was already imbued with the taste for such pursuits , and snatched hours // from his profession to finish the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical Society , confessedly the most industrious of all in the country ; and in Holmes a natural fondness for history was quickened into activity by the sympathy which surrounded him . The name of Holmes ought not to be mentioned without a tribute to his memory . No student of our history , hut owes him gratitude . The accomplished annalist feared no labor ; he was indefatigable in his love of truth . He had seen much of the country ; his correspondence was wide ; his zeal untiring . A slight bias from his religious prepossessions is some tunes , yet not often apparent ; he sometimes , when doubt was not excited , repeats an error , giving the authority on which it rests . But when his skepticism was aroused , he was unwearied in his pursuit of the right solution ; and reasoned closely and candidly . The inequality of his work resulted not from himself ; what relates to the South is not always well told , nor developed with equal fulness ; hut for that we must chide our southern friends , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it all in all , the " Annals of Holmes constitute a work , which in its kind has never been equalled among us , and has few parallels anywhere . It was but the other day , that the admirable annalist ceased to be mortal . He , in connexion with the exact editor , the interesting and copious annotator , on the New England Memorial , who we trust may for yet many years he detained from the sky , is the link that connects the men of an earlier generation , Belknap , Hutchinson , Stiles , Trumbull , and the rest , with the scholars of our own . To the editors of Winthrop and of Morton , the common voice , by a unanimous suffrage , awards the highest praise . Snatching intervals from active pursuits , in the spirit of friendly emulation and mutual support , they have contributed materially to advance the study of New England history . For resolute accuracy Savage is introuvable ; his like * will not soon he found ; as we read his notes , we * Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor of the " Journal of the First Provincial Congress of Massachusetts . " Mr. Lincoln loves historic science . It is to him , what the arts of design were to Michael Angelo . He gives his heart to it . Mr. Force includes the journal among his papers ; but in the monograph Mr. Lincoln is able to apply greater critical skill and exact attention . We venture in advance to ask the public regard for his edition of this most interesting // sometimes wish he had hated fanaticism a little less , and been a little more tolerant of bigotry . But on that matter opinions will be divided . The editor of Morton gives his whole heart to the fathers of the Old Colony , as with a pious hand he reverently deepens the lines on their monument . He knows the . people of whom he writes , as one knows his own family ; and conducts us through the halls of the Old Colony , as familiarly as a hospitable man would open his chambers to a cherished guest . Not that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reconciles , in a most pleasing manner , the full sincerity of the critic who disguises nothing , with the reverence which we all cherish towards the Pilgrims . And he enjoys his reward . The pursuit of letters is an honor to manhood , and a solace to old age ; in him the Scripture promise is beautifully fulfilled . He has honored his ancestors ; and his days are long , may they be verylong , in the pleasant land of his heritage . Thus was historic criticism , coeval with New England , never without its votaries . To-day its service is thronged . In each of our older New England States , the last years have seen many diligently exploring every form of ancient records , gleaning hints from minutes of trials , extracting a fact from the registry of a will , tracing measures to their primary sources in the journals of our towns , or collecting the inscriptions in grave-yards . Among the crowd of honored names , there are two , to whom , above all others , the public gratitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , under the auspices of our Massachusetts legislature . But Mr. Lincoln must not stop there . He must perfect his collections of all that was said and done and written in our New England villages , in revolutionary times . Let us have the votes of our towns ; let us know , town by town , what spirit they were of ; what moneys they contributed ; what men they furnished . Give us the inner organization , which sustained the revolution . Let us trace the spirit of life as it circulated through all the veins of the community . Mr. Lincoln is able to give a collection , which would brand with infamy the man that should dare to insult New Eng . land ; he can present to the world materials more minute , more various , more touching , more lively , than those which made John von Mflller so famous with regard to Switzerland . Could we hope our remarks would reach the Executive Council , we should respectfully but earnestly urge the furtherance of publications , which the public curiosity demands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt and a duty ; and which a wise order of the legislature has provided the means of effecting at the pleasure of the executive . It is not in reference to the honor of their fathers , that the yeomanry of Massachusetts demand severe economy . They love a liberal expenditure to protect the fame of their ancestors . // No living authors have done so much to advance the science as the Historian of the United States , and the Editor of Washlngton . To the excellence of Mr. Baneroft 's great work , still in progress , we bore our testimony , at length , on the appearance of its first volume. * The voice of scholars , and of the public , at home and abroad , has confirmed the judgment then expressed , of its rare merit . The completion of this work , which will take a permanent place among classical histories , is looked for with impatience by every lover of the country and of letters . To judge of the service which Mr. Sparks has rendered the country , we must compare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now possess . All that is contained in Marshall is meagre and incomplete in comparison with the copious details and ample illustrations with which we are at present furnished . We have Washington to the life , from hoyhood to the last hour ; narrating his own career ; explaining himself the formation of his own character ; and promulgating his views on every question of his day . And these letters are not left unexplained . The editor has gathered collateral aid from every quarter ; and sparingly yet clearly and admirably illustrated the whole work by researches of the deepest interest . As a critic , the mind of Mr. Sparks seems to know no bias . He pursues the truth , and is enamoured of inquiry ; and , where explanation is needed , he does not rest satisfied , till he has exhausted every source of information . The great merit of Mr. Sparks , giving him the first rank among the critical students of our history , consists in his candor and his completeness . In the selection of documents he appears ever to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But more than all , he perceived clearly , that the history of our revolution , the life and character and influence of Washington , could not be derived from American sources alone ; and with a wide grasp , which proves his mind to be enlarged not less than accurate , he has sought materials in England and on the continent of Europe . He saw clearly the momentous importance of the diplomatic connexions of our country ; and would not rest satisfied , till , at a vast expense of time and fortune , he had culled the most interesting memoirs from the archives of London and Paris , and , through North American Review , Vol . XL . p. 99. // friends , from the papers of the Spanish court . And he has in consequence been able to accomplish a great work . He has published such an edition of Washington 's works , as is never likely to be excelled ; thus winning a claim to regard by his zealous care for the remains of our greatest benefactor , and permanently connecting himself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic information which Mr. Sparks has acquired , and holds in his own mind , ought not to rest unemployed . It would take an apprenticeship of many years for a new critic , - and a critic of equal natural endowments is a rare phenomenon , - to attain the position which Mr. Sparks occupies . His judgment is disciplined ; his acquisitions , such as to save him from imperfect conceptions or undue estimates of the importance of new documents ; familiar with the relative merits and activity of the men of the revolution , we can not too strongly desire , that his mind may continue to be bent upon illustrating the history of his country . The works to which we have alluded , were executed by individuals single-handed and unaided . It was chiefly the energy of his own character , which sustained Mr. Sparks in a course of investigations , more varied and thorough , than had been undertaken by his predecessors . The work which particularly engages our attention , and which may in some measure be ascribed to the honorable emulation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under national auspices . During the administration of General Jackson , by the particular codperation of the gifted Livingston , Congress entered upon the magnificent design of publishing a documentary history of the American Revolution . The volume which is before us , is the fourth of the intended series ; and is published partly as a specimen of the work , partly as evidence of the sincerity and diligence with which its materials are preparing . The former clerk of the House of Representatives , Mr. Matthew Sm . Clair Clarke , was joined in the commission with Mr. Peter Force . It is however the latter , to whom the editorship of the present volume is mainly , almost exclusively to be ascribed . The American Revolution is rightly esteemed one of the greatest events in the history of man ; the dawn of a new era . On us , who inherit the benefits of that popular freedom which // it generated , devolves the duty of gathering together every thing which can illustrate it . We therefore rejoice that Congress has been true to its duty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that purpose . We trust nothing will be wanting towards its perfect accomplishment . The volume before us , a folio of nearly nioeteen hundred columns , extends from March 2 , 1774 , to May 2 , 1775 , a period of fourteen months . It includes all the debates in the En*lish House of Lords and in the Commons , with examination of witnesses , documents , bills , and resolutions during the whole period ; a most interesting collection , where the eloquence of Burke , and Fox , and Barr6 , the Bishop of St. Asaph , and hox* many others , appear in contrast with the policy of North and the invectives of Wedderburn . It is a documentary history , such as never before existed , where the greatest minds of the age wern brought into collision , and tnet to discuss the doctrines and the rights , which were effecting a change in the destiny of the race . It embraces , moreover , the most important political pamphlets , published in England during the year ; as , for example , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Dr. Johnson , as well as a few memorials of Wilkes . In connexion with the journals of the English parliament , we have the doings of our American colonial legislatures ; but here , alas ! the reports of speeches were imperfect ; and the accounts that have been preserved are meagre in comparison with what we could desire . They are perhaps too diffuse for the careless ; hut they are less copious than will he desired by the inquisitive . Mr. Force has , we presume , gleaned every thing that could he found ; his collections include every thing of moment ; we could wish for more details only to increase the life of the picture , and to stamp individuality upon its character . The results of public bodies are always accessible ; great as are the merits of bringing them conveniently together , the chief value of this volume does not , in our opinion , lie there . Mr. Force has gone out into the streets and villages ; he has looked for meetings of merchants , for meetings of mechanics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; has entered the halls of petty committees , and has endeavoured to sweep the land for every document of a public nature , that tended to prepare the revolution . It is the rich // ness of his collection of these small things , that constitutes in our judgment the chief historic attraction of his enterprise . It is the analysis of the country ; the exposition of all the primary elements which composed the mind of the people and prepared it for resistance ; the gathering together of the mass of individual facts upon which a safe generalization can he founded . Nor let it detract from the generous praise to which Mr. Force is entitled , that most of the documents which he has collected , had one day appeared already in print . They never before have been published in a form accessible to the student . He who before this must have wandered over our whole land in quest of materials , may now quickly turn alchymist in his closet , and extract truth from the documents which the judicious industry of Mr. Force is heaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives at least were necessary to gather together the materials of history ; here are the clay , and the straw , every thing necessary but the forming hand here are the sand and the ashes , and all that is needed for the pure crystal , save only the creative fire which is to fuse the base m*iterials into beauty , transparency , and harmony . If any should undertake to stop the gathering together of these memorials of the revolution , may their minds be haunted by the hobgoblins of imperfect conceptions ; may their midnight slumbers be disturbed by the ghosts of the heroes of 76 , clamoring for just honors to glorious deeds ; and when they come to die , may oblivion hide their shame , and their names perish from among men . The point of view , from which this work should be estimated , is , the degree in which it advances the science . And we must say , that the advance is exceedingly great . Doubtless some things remain to be discovered and introduced . The work of Mr. Force is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , is full of the richest and most pregnant and interesting materials , and , if executed with equal diligence , will , when completed , form a series of folios to which we look forward with anxiety and hope ; and for which we would cheerfully exchange any folios in our library . Yet why do we say , with anxiety ? Let us not admit a fear for the patriotism of Congress . Let us not doubt , that they will persevere in the enterprise which they have thus far shown a disposition to encourage most liberally . Our Independence // was the fruit of centuries ; the whole previous civilization of the world was the condition , under which the glorious event was possible . Let us gather up every fragment of its history ; let us allow nothing to be lost . Beautiful was the dawn of freedom upon our hills , when the nations of the earth sung for joy at the promise of a new civilization . Let us not allow the light of that morning , as it made the sky brilliant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us fix indelibly on enduring monuments a fit representation of even the most evanescent hues . Let us count every sunbeam that quickened , every drop of dew that refreshed the immortal tree , which our fathers planted . Let us encourage our own hearts , and cheer our children , by the bright examples of every one among the crowd of messengers , who announced to mankind the glad tidings of the separation of our country from the forms , the superstitions , and the compacts of the Past.
