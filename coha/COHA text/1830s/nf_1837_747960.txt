txt /z/ The atonement which the Lord Jesus Christ by his death gave to the divine government , is a subject of stupendous interest to every sinner . It concerns him personally : it is a matter of life and death to him . No man can be innocently indifferent to the doctrine of the gospel concerning the atonement . By its dignity and authority , it deserves and demands the most serious consideration of every man who hears of it . It is extremely difficult to make this subject plain to a careless enquirer , or to a captious disputant . Should this book be read by a convicted offender , whose eternal life depends on the answer to the question , " How shall a man be just with God ? " I should regard the task of unfolding this doctrine as comparatively easy . On the contrary , should the /z/ offender think lightly of the evil of his offence , he will caxe proportionably little about the means of his acquittal . It is always found true , that slight thoughts of the atonement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil of sin . " What is an atonement ? " This is a question rarely if ever pondered , either by those who deny the atonement as an absurdity , or by those who wrest it for licentiousness . Yet a distinct and well-defined conception of the nature of an atonement is indispensably necessary to a successful inquiry into the design , the aspect , and the extent of the atonement . What , then , is an atonement ? An atonement is any provision introduced into the administration of a government , instead of the infliction of the punishment of an offender - any expedient that will justify a government in suspending the literal execution of the penalty threatened - any consideration that fills the place of punishment , and answers the purposes of government as effectually , as the infliction of the penalty on the offender himself would ; and thus supplies to the government just , safe , and honourable grounds for offering and dispensing pardon to the offender . This definition or description may be more concisely expressed thus ; atonement is an expedient substituted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to supply to the government just and good grounds for dispensing favours to an offender. /q/ Let this definition of atonement be fairly tried by the usage of the word in the administration of civil justice ; and let it be compared with the sense of all the passages of holy scripture in which the word , or the doctrine of the atonement is introduced . It will not wrest one text of scriptinre : it mil not torture one doctrine of Christian theology . In the administration of a government , an atonement means something that may justify the exercise of clemency and mercy , without relaxing the bands of just authority . The head of a commonwealth , or the supreme organ of government , is not a private person , but , public officer . As a private person he may be inclined to do many things which the honour of his public oflGice forbid him to do . Therefore , to reconcile the exercise of his personal disposition and of his public function , some expedient must be found , which will preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clemency and favour . For want of such an expedient , a public organ of government must often withhold his favours . This principle is practically adopted every day in the discipline of children in a family , as well as in the civil administration of public justice . I will endeavour to illustrate this definition of an atonement by two remarkable instances , one borrowed from the holy scriptinres , and the other firom profane history . The first instance is that of Darius and Daniel , in Dan . vi . 14 , 15 , 16 . King Darius had established a b2 /z/ royal statute and made a finn decree , and signed the writing , that whosoever should ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days , save of the king himself , should be cast into the den of lions . Daniel , one of the children of the captivity of Judah , was found to be the first offender . " Then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down of the sun to deliver him . Then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , * Know , O king , that the law of the Modes and the Persians is . That no decree or statute which the king establisheth may be changed . ' Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the lions ' den . " Here is an instance of an absolute sovereign setting his heart on the deliverance of an offender , and labouring to obtain it ; and yet prevented from exercising his clemency , by a due sense of the honour of his government . Could not Darius at once have pardoned Daniel ? Yes ; Darius could , as a private person , forgive any private injury ; but he could noty as a public officer , privately forgive a public offence against the authority of his office . - Could not Darius have repealed the law which he himself had made ? Yes ; but not with honour to the laws of the Modes and Persians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and such a fickleness and uncertainty in the administration of his government might encourage any disaffection or /q/ treason among the presidents , princes , and satraps of the provinces . - Could not Darius have banished or silenced all the abettors of the law , and enemies of Daniel ? Yes ; but such a deed would have told his folly , imbecility , and injustice , in every province of his empire : ii &; folly in enacting a law which he found it unreasonable to execute : imbecility in want of due authority in his own council , and of due firmness to enforce his own edict ; and his injustice in protecting and favouring an offender at the expense of the loyal supporters of the throne . What , then , is to be done ? Can not some means be found which will enable the king to keep the honoin : of his public character , and yet save Daniel ? No : the king labomred till the going down of the sun to deliver him . He pondered , and thought , and devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently , the very personage who had set his heart to deliver him , with his own lips " commanded " that Daniel be brought forth , and thrown into the den of lions . Why was this done ? Not because the king had no mercy in him , but simply and only , because no expedient could be found which would at once preserve the honour of the government , and allow the exercise of clemency towards the offender . Daniel was cast into the lions ' den merely because no atonement was found to vindicate and to " show forth " the public justice of the governor in his deliverance . /z/ Here , then , is an instance of mercy being withheld , merely from the want of an honourable ground or medium for compressing it . The other instance to which I alluded , is from profane history . In this instance also there was a strong disposition to save the offender , and yet there was a difficulty , almost insurmountable , in the way of his honom-able acquittal . His deliverance , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor himself . I allude to the case of the son of Zaleucus. * Zaleucus , the king of the Locrians , had established a law against adultery , the penalty of which was , that the offender should lose both eyes . The first person found guilty of this offence , was the king 's own son . Zaleucus felt as a father towards his own son , but he felt likewise as a king towards his government . If he , from blind indulgence , forgive his son , with what reason can he expect the law to be respected by the rest of his subjects ? and how will his public character appear in punishing any future offender ? If he repeal the law , he will brand his character with dishonour - for selfishness in sacrificing the public good of a whole community to his private feelings ; for weakness in publishing a law whose penalty he never could inflict ; and ior foolishness in introducing a law , the bearings of which he had never contemplated . This * See iElian , V. H. 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6 . ; Cic. ad Attic . 6 , 1 . /q/ would make his authority for the future a mere name . The case was a difficult one . Though he was an offended governor , yet he had the compassion of a tender father . At the suggestion of his unbribed mercy , he employed his mind and wisdom to demise a measure , an expedient through the medium of which he would save his son , and yet magnify his law and make it honourable . The expedient was this , the king himself would lose one eye , and the offender should lose another . By this means , the honour of his law was preserved unsullied , and the clemency of his heart was extended to the offender . Every subject in the government when he heard of the king 's conduct , would feel assured that the king esteemed his law very highly ; and though the offender did not suffer the entire penalty , yet the clemency shown him was exercised in such a way , that no adulterer would ever think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact would say , that the king spared not his own eye , that he might spare his offending child with honour . He would assert that this sacrifice of the king 's eye , completely demonstrated his abhorrence of adultery , and high regard for his law , as effectually , as if the penalty had been literally executed upon the sinner himself . The impression on the public mind would be that this expedient of the father was an atonement for the offence of the son , and was a just and honourable grouiiid for pairdoning him . /z/ Such an expedient in the moral government of God , the apostles asserted the death of Christ to be . They preached that all men Tre " condemned already , " - that God had " thoughts of peace , and not of evil " towards men , - that these thoughts were to be exercised in such a manner , as not to " destroy the law , " and that the medium or expedient for doing this , was the sacrifice of his only Son as an atonement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings of the Son of God were substituted in the room of the execution of the penalty threatened to the offender . The atonement in the death of Christ is not a literal endming of the identical penalty due to the sinner , but it is a provision or an expedient introduced instead of the literal infliction of the penalty ; it is the substitution of another course of suffering which will answer the same purposes in the divine administrations as the literal execution of the penalty on the offender himself would accomplish . Had Darius found any person willing to be thrown into the lions ' den instead of Daniel , and literally to bear the penalty threatened , this could never have been deemed an atonement to the laws of the Medes and the Persians . These laws had never contemplated that the offender should have the option of bearing the penalty , either in person or by his substitute . It would have been a much more likely atonement to the laws , if one of the presidents of the provinces , one high in the esteem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , and one much interested in Daniel , had consented , either to lose his right hand on a public scaffold , or to fight with a lion in an amphitheatre , for the sake of honourably saving Daniel . Atonement is not an expedient contrary to law , but above law . It is introduced into an administra- r ' tion , not to execute the letter of the law , but to preserve ' * the spirit and the truth " of the constitution . The death of Christ is an atonement for sin , it is a public expression of God 's regard for his law ; and it is an honourable ground for showing clemency to transgressors . That the atonement is a doctrine of the word of God , is evident from the fact that it suggests itself to every unprejudiced reader of the New Testament , - that in the churches which used the original text only it was never deemed a heresy , and that one end of the modem opponents of it in constructing an " Improved Version of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbending language of the scriptures speak of Christ as an atoning Mediator , " whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins past through the forbearance of God , to declare at this time his righteousness , that he might be just , AND the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus . ' ' Rom. iii . 25 . If this representation of the death of Christ be correct and scriptural , it must be evident that the /z/ atonement of the Son of God did not consist in suffering literally the identical penalty , or the identical amount of penalty due to a cei-tain number of offenders for a certain number of offences . The atonement of Christ is represented by men sometimes , as if he would have had to suffer more , had there been more to be saved ; or less , had there been fewer to be saved . Sometimes also another aspect is given to the atonement , as if God saved a number of offenders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their substitute . Here , let us pause . Let us bethink ourselves , and seriously consider - " Is this the atonement of the scriptures ? " Hds invests with the meanest calculating mercenariness a moral transaction of the utmost grandeur in the universe . By supposing the literal infliction of the threatened punishment on the substitute , it exalts the condemned suppliant into a presumptuous claimant : it excludes grace from the dispensation of pardon , and , in fact , annuls the idea of an atonement . By maintaining the certain salvation of so many persons , in consideration of so much suffering endured for them , and for them only , it prescribes dimensions to the mercy that " loved the world ; " it makes the salvation of some offenders utterly impossible ; and it destroys the sincerity of that universal call which summons all men to " receive the atonement . " This commercial atonement accumulates the obligations of the elect to the Son , at the expense of /q/ their obligations to the Father ; for he has granted no boon without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " sorer punishment " which shall befal the rejecters and despisers of salvation . By its absurdity , it furnishes the most plausible apology for Socinianism , or any other system of opposition to the doctrine of an atonement : and by its boldness it unbridles all the licentiousness of Antinomianism . The character and aspect of such a notion of atonement show that it is not the atonement of the scriptures . It is a suspicious circumstance in any system of theology , when it is so promulgated as to excite objections and controversies which were not raised by the ministry of the apostles . We can clearly ascertain the theological doctrines of the apostles , partly from their direct assertions , and partly from their replies to the objections proposed by their adversaries . If the apostles shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God , and if this whole coimsel was delivered unto us , when the inspired code of theology was completed , we have no safe ground to expect the revelation of any new doctrine of Christianity . When the announcing of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apostles have already replied , we may safely conclude that such a statement of the doctrine is apostolical . But if we , by any of our theological statements excite objections which the apostles did /z/ not excite , we have good grounds not only for being very jealous of such a doctrine , but for a total and immediate renunciation of it . The doctrines of the apostles did excite controversies about predestination to life , the sovereignty of divine influences , the accountableness of a sinner to the moral law , the reality of the atonement , &c.; but there is not the remotest allusion to any controversies having been raised concerning the extent of the atonement . Some of the Jews , indeed , at one time had doubts about the universal calling of the Gentiles ; but those doubts arose from their views of the Mosaic covenant , and not from considerations relative to the intrinsic aspect and design of the atonement . The apostles declare , in language the most distinct and unequivocal , that the death of Christ was a ransom for all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he tasted death for every man , and that God , consequently , was in him reconciling the world unto himself . Yea , they openly declared that persons who denied or renounced the Lord who had bought them would , notwithstanding , meet with a damnation that slumbered not . Yet this universal aspect of the atonement is never supposed to have shocked the minds , or clashed with the doctrines , of the primitive churches . In all the apostolical writings , there is no hint given that the churches had any narrow views of the design of the death of Christ ; and no reply is given to any objection which /q/ might imply a misapprehension of such an unshackled , unqualified , and unlimited testimony concerning the extent of the atonement . That the apostles represented Christ to have died " for the church , " " for his people , " &c.; does not in the least weaken this position ; for what is true of the whole of mankind , must be true of a part ; and such a language expresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aspect , and adaptation of it . It is , then , evident that the advocates of a limited atonement , and the inspired apostles , do not publish their message in the same style . Do the advocates of a limited atonement ever cheerfiilly and fearlessly declare , that " Christ died for all ? " and that his death is " a propitiation for the sins of the whole world ? " Do they not hesitate to use such unmeasured phraseology ? Do they not call sinners to repentance , rather on the ground that perhaps they are elected , than on the firm and broad basis of a " ransom for all ? " The apostles , on the contrary , understood their commission to be general and indiscriminate for " every creatinre : " so they received it from Him , who laid the foundation of such an extensive ministration , by " tasting death for every man . " Accordingly , they proceeded on their commission to preach the gospel to " all the world . " They did not square their message by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines of /z/ Procrustean creeds . They employed a dialect that would traverse the length and breadth of the world . They did not tremble for such an unreserved exhibition of the ark and the mercy-seat . They could not bring themselves to stint the remedy prepared and intended to restore a dying world ; nor could they cramp the bow lighted up in the storm that threatened all mankind . To avoid some of the absurdities of a commercial atonement , its advocates say , that it was sufficient for all . This then is conceding the point , that the particularity of the atonement consists , not in its nature and aspect , but in its application . The phrase " sufficient for all , " should be well weighed . If the atonement be " sufficient for all , " sufficient for what is it ? It was , no doubt , sufficient to show that the throne and government of God were quite guiltless in the intrusion of sin , and that sin is a wrong , and an evil of tremendous malignity . But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every man , provided such a salvation would take place ? Is the atonement sufficient to demonstrate to all the offenders of the world the evil of their revolt , and the inexcusableness of persisting in it ? Is the atonement sufficient to show , that if any sinner perished , he perished not through any deficiency in the provision made for his salvation ? In a word , is the atonement sufficient to justify a free , a full , and a sincere offer of cordial acceptance to every applicant at the throne of merey ? If the /q/ atonement be not sufficient for these purposes , in what senses can it at all be sufficient for men , and for all men ? And if it be actually sufficient for these purposes , let it be preached as such ; let it be fearlessly exhibited in its true character . /z/ If a peasant offend or injure a peasant , a plebeian umpire might settle the difference between them . If he offend a magistrate in the exercise of his office , the plebeian umpire will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daysman of a higher grade . If he offend the king , by treason or rebellion , the one and the other of these umpires would be inadequate to interpose for him : some person high in rank , or official dignity , would alone be thought suitable and competent to such an undertaking . Should it be proposed to a government that a prisoner , convicted of a high offence , should be set at liberty , at the instance and intercession of another ; that is , for the sake of another person , it is natural to suppose that among all the members and friends of the government there would be a general enquiry - who and what was that person ? The following circumstances would require a very satisfactory explanation : What is his rank in the state ? What is the nature of his connexion with the offender ? /q/ What is his character in the estimation of the government ? What measure will he substitute instead of the offender 's punishment ? Why does he interfere ? How does the king regard such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state is of consequence in such a transaction , because such alone would be competent to treat with the king . With such only could the king treat on such a sub*-ject without lowering his dignity . The interference of such a personage would draw public attention to the magnitude of the offence . If the personage were nearly related to the king , and obliged to sustain some great inconvenience , humiliation , or hardship by his interference , it would show that the king did not dispense his pardons , except on good , wise , and worthy grounds . In such a transaction regard must also be had to the kind of connexion or relationship in which the intercessor stands to the offender . There would be no propriety in dispensing pardon at the instance of a stranger , utterly unconnected , either by neighbourhood , office , or kindred with the offender . There is , however , a congruity in showing favour , ceteris paribusy at the instance of a person in some way related to the peculiar circumstances of the offender , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county , the Magistrate for the district , the Minister of the parish , the Colonel of a regiment , &c.; The interference of such a person shows /z/ that he is interested in the welfare of the district where the offence was committed . It draws the attention of that particular district to the heinousness of the crime . His respectability is a pledge that just authority and the public good will not be injured by granting pardon ; and it secures honour , love , and esteem to the interposer , as the means of conveying the pardon ; and through him , reverence and attachment to the government that granted it . He who would interpose in such an affair must be a person possessing great private worth , and weight of character in the estimation of the government . It would lower and sully the dignity of any government to treat with one who had been a sharer in the crime , or who thought slightly of it . In treating with a person of worth and character , the government would show that the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conniving at it , - that it did not regard the offence as a trifle , - that it was not reluctant to administer mercy , when practicable with honour and safety , - that its pardon was so dispensed as not to afford the slightest encouragement to the crime , - and that the liberation of the offender came entirely from the sovereign prerogative of the throne , though through the intercession or for the sake of another . In this way the offender could not boast of his case as deserving pardon ; nor could his compeers in guilt boast of his release as a triumph over righteousness . In such a dispensation of pardon , it is not enough /q/ that the character of the government appear honourable , but the interests of it must also be safe . We may therefore suppose one of the friends of the government to rise and say , " It is well known that a law without a penalty is only an advice , a mere recommendation ; and annexing a penalty without executing it when required , makes government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cancelled , what provision will the offender 's friend substitute instead of it , that will secure the ends of good government . For though the letter of the law be not executed , yet the spirit of it ought to be presented , that mercy may not clash with public justice . " Another friend might rise and say , - It should be remembered that the illustrious person who interferes in this affair , is a friend to the government , as well as a friend to the offenders ; and withal , is no friend to the offence . He is high in rank and in official dignity , and his character is unblemished . He has suffered much pain and anguish for the offenders ; and , in this undertaking , has borne great fatigue and expense , as well as the hazard of his good name . He now pledges that his private worth in his own district , his rank in the state , his nearness to his sovereign , and his high office , will guarantee that no injury shall accrue to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that the spirit of the law might be preserved without adhering to the letter of it : I beg also to suggest , that the nearer the provision of satisfaction or atone- /z/ ment comes to the letter of the law , without being the literal infliction of the penalty , the more full and glorious might such an atonement appear . I am therefore instructed to say that , on this principle , as the offenders are condemned for public execution , the illustrious personage who has interposed in their behalf , will , on a given day , take their place on the scaffold , lay his head on the block , and appear again in court as the medium of conveying pardon to them . " Upon this information , all considerate persons saw that such an expedient would fully answer the ends of government , viz. , to check offences and promote the public good : and these ends would be more secured by the humiliation and sufferings of such a personage than by the infliction of the penalty on all the offenders . There would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viz. , whether his undertaking were perfectly volimtary , and whether in his humiliation he were altogether free and unconstrained . If he were not free and voluntary , such an undertaking would be unjust , unreasonable , unbecoming , and unacceptable to the government . Hence would arise the question , " How did the king , as the public head of the commonwealth , regard such an undertaking ? " If such a spectacle were made without his approbation and appointment , it would be no expression of the king 's abhorrence of the offence ; it would in nowise strengthen the claims of righteous authority ; it would be no satisfaction /q/ to the goveniment , as it neither kept the letter nor preserved the spirit of the law ; and it would secure no honour or esteem to the intercessor , as his undertaking was selfwilled , neither appointed nor approved by any competent authority . But should the king express himself well pleased in such an undertaking of such a personage , and declare himself willing to pardon any offender who would ask forgiveness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted degradation would present all the elements of an atonement to the public justice of the government . Let us now apply the supposed topics of the above enquiry to the person of the Son of God , the declared mediator between an offended sovereign and sinful man . /z/ The personal dignity of Christ . What saith the scripture concerning his rank in the state , his gradation in the scale of being , the grandeur of his person ? The language of the scriptures concerning the person of Christ is never reserved , cautious , qualified , or ambiguous : it is fi*ee , open , certain , high-toned , and exulting . It never formally proves the divinity of Christ , as it never formally proves the existence of God . It ascribes unhesitatingly to Christ the same perfections , the same titles and names , the same works , and the same worship as are ascribed to the /z/ Father . If these particulars be left out of the induction of proofs for the divinity of the Father , it will be impossible to prove the Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father , they must , by fair sequence , prove the divinity of the Son . And if they do not prove the divinity of the Son , they do not prove the deity of the Father . There is nothing in the testimony of the scripture to encourage the morbid caution and jealousy that would begrudge the honours of the Son , lest they should infringe on the honours of the Father . There is no such mean jealousy implied in any transaction between the Father and the Son , in any description given of heaven , in the design and tendency of the gospel dispensation , or in the graces of the Christian character . When the Lord Jesus Christ was at the lowest point of his humiliation , the identity of his Father 's honour with his own is most clearly recognised , John xii . 28 ; xiii . 31 , 32 ; xvii. 1 , &c.; In heaven the same honour and power and glory are ascribed to the Lamb as to Him that sitteth upon the throne . In the dispensation of the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest , " is secured by all its provisions . The faith , and the hope , and the love of Christians honour the grace , the mercy , and the whole paternal character of God , while they triumph in Christ , and boast and glory in his cross . In the memorials which we have of the lives and doctrines and feelings of eminent saints who excelled in the love of God , we find no dread of displeasing /q/ the Father by giving due honours to the Son ; no fear of idolatry by calling , like Stephen , on the name of Jesus ; nor any checking of their religious affections , saying , " hitherto shall ye go and no farther . " No : they felt as free and unconstrained as the heaven they breathed . They saw that the mediatorial constitution was so arranged as to secure " many crowns " to the Mediator , without unsettling or dimming a single gem in the crown of the Father . They never used the cold , sophistical , and unsavory language of the modem opposers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment to the Son : that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . And he that honoureth not the Son , honoureth not the Father which hath sent him . " John v. 22 , 23 . The divinity of the person of the Son of God is indispensably necessary to the worth , the sufficiency , and efficacy of the atonement . The grandeur of his person preserved unsullied the public honour of God in treating with a daysman for sinners . It not only vindicated the character of the high party proposing reconciliation , but it magnified that character in the whole of the transaction . He is one high enough in rank and personal worth to draw public attention to this amazing expedient of the divine government . This- was his meaning when he said , " And I , if I be lifted up , will draw all men ' to myself ; " that is , " I will draw the at- /z/ tention and the gaze of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an exalted person gave a greater expression of God 's abhorrence of sin than any other measure of his administrations . God set him FORTH , an atonement , to declare his righteousness - to make a deep and lasting impression , on all intelligences , of the divine displeasure against disobedience . If Christ were a mere man , like Moses , or David , or Jeremiah , or John the Baptist , whose humiliation was no condescension , and whose obedience and sufferings were mere duty , it is impossible that his sufferings and death could have been a public expression or declaration of righteousness in forgiving sin . What would be thought of a governor summoning public attention to the equity of his government , by " cutting a dog 's neck , " or " offering swine 's blood ? " There would be no dignity in the medium of expressing either the justice of his law , or the majesty of his clemency . But in the divine administration , the sufferings of a person of such dignity and worth as the Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , both in his abhorrence of sin , and in his exercise of clemency . The dignity of his person is calculated to secure the esteem due firom offenders to him as the Mediator . If pardon be dispensed in such a manner as is not calculated to secure honour and esteem for the person who is the medium of conveying it , and through /q/ him , for the throne which originated it , the pardon will be prejudicial to the public good . It is therefore wise to grant pardon through some person whose rank and character are calculated to secure honour and respect . The Father thought so in the appointment of his Son as Mediator , and said , " They will reverence my son . " Had the Son been a mere man , we would have esteemed him something as we esteem the writers of the scriptures , or the ministers of the gospel , and others who have been the means of conveying to us the knowledge of the truth . But is this the esteem which the apostles expressed towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that which the scriptures demd from us towards Christ ? Is such an esteem in anjrwise akin to " honouring the Son even as we honour the Father ? " Even a greater esteem than such is desened and warranted by the disinterestedness of his condescension , by the amiableness of his mission , and by the magnitude of the blessings which he has procured . But , the divinity of his person tends to secure an esteem that will count all things but loss for his excellency , that will exult in him with joy unspeakable and full of glory , that will cast every crown at his feet , that will love him as " all in all . " It is this alone that can fully justify the awful and tremendous anathema denounced against those who do not love him . Above all , the Godhead of the Son unites in one person and in one administration the honours of the c /z/ Mediator with those of the Governor , and blends the interests of the Saviour with those of the Lawgiver . He does not exalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation in a maimer calculated to beget low sentiments of his legislative character . These considerations fully justify the deductions of scripture , that the value and efficacy of the death of Christ as an atonement , arise from the grandeur and dignity of his person . It is the blood of Jesus Christ , HIS SON , that cleanseth from all sin . It is He , " who being the brightness of his Father 's glory and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , that by himself purged our sins . " It is because " God spared not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , that he will also give unto us all things . " /z/ The personal relationship of Christ to mankind . We have already seen that there is a propriety in dispensing pardon to offenders at the instance of a person in some way related to them , either by neighbourhood , office , or kindred . The scriptures represent the author of the great atonement for sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is related to men by office having " power over all flesh , " by kindred being " made of a woman , " and by neighbourhoody having " tabernacled /q/ among them , full of grace and truth . ' ' It became him for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , to offer reconciliation , and to bring many sons to glory , by such a personage . " For both he that expiatesy and they who are expiated are all of one ; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren . Forasmuch then as the children were partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself likewise took part of the same , that through death , he might destroy him that had the power of death , that is , the devil : and deliver them , who through fear of death , were all their lifetime subject to bondage . For verily he took not on him the nature of angels , but he took on him the seed of Abraham . Wherefore in all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to Gxd , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people . " Heb. ii . 11 , /z/ Let this energetic and beautiful passage be applied to any good man , to any deliverer , to any prophet , to any apostle , to any martyr ; or let it be read irrespective of the doctrine of atonement ; and the whole becomes pointless , vague , and flimsy . The atoning priesthood of the Saviour , on the contrary , gives it body and consistency , weight and edge . The expedient of an atonement was introduced into the administration of God 's moral government to " declare " the righteousness , or the public justice of God in forgiving offenders . It was therefore neces- c 2 /z/ sary that the atonement be " shown forth , " that is , that it be effected and published in the province where the offence was committed . An atonement effected solely by the divine nature , or by an angelic being , could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tangible to mankind ; consequently the author of atonement took upon him the nature of the offenders , " before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among them . " An atonement thus visibly wrought in the nature and in the province of the offenders , was calculated to produce salutary impressions on them . It would humble the offenders to have , in the moral government of which they were a province , such a decided demonstration of firm justice . It would gain their confidence , that the divine government had been devising means for the honourable exercise of mercy in their district . And it would endear to them the friendly Mediator " who though he was rich , yet for their sake became poor , that they through his poverty might be made rich . " The nature of things , and the order of society , also , seem to show the propriety , that an atonement should be as much like the infliction of the threatened punishment , as could , under the direction of infinite wisdom , be consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literal penalty . Hence , the illustrious Mediator assumed a nature that could sustain visible sufferings , and endure a public death , even the accursed death of the cross . /q/ By such an arrangement the whole government has been honoured in the nature if not in the persons of the offenders . " If one died for all , then did the all rfe . " To pardon an offender for the sAke of the relationship which a friend of ours sustains towards him , and especially to pardon at the itistance of that friend , is a fact in common life every day . A child disobeys his father , and , through the intercession of his mother in his behalf , is forgiven . We receive a wrong at a neighbour 's hand , but at-the interposition of a mutual friend , we look it over . Such a circumstance often occurs also in the administration of civil government , when it is deemed honourable and safe ; as when the life of a condemned criminal is spared through the petitions of the respectable inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any one on account of his connexion with an honourable and worthy family . It was something of this kind that we see in David showing kindness to Mephibosheth for the sake of Jonathan his father , 2 Sam . ix . 1 - 8 . David as a king felt that there was no impropriety , danger , or dishonour , in restoring Mephibosheth to all his inheritance in such a way as this . By doing it for Jonathan 's sake , it showed that he had a high regard for Jonathan , that he considered nothing in the house of Saul as forming a claim on his clemency ; and , consequently , no friends of that house could think that the king was relaxing his government , and that they might safely rebel- /z/ Thus God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself - but it is for Christ 's sake . For Christ 's sake , he is willing to forgive the greatest sin , to accept the vilest sinner , and to confer the greatest favour . In thus acting for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are excluded , and the divine government is safe and honourable . /z/ The personal character of Christ ; or what is called His active Righteousness . Miere relationship to the offender is not a sufficient ground for a safe dispensation of pardon : the person who intercedes must have also a worth and weight of character in the estimation of the government . When Amyntas interceded with the Athenian senate for the life of his brother Eschylus , he pleaded , by lifting up the stmnp of his arm , the honours which he had achieved for the government at the battle of Salamis . The senate , at the instance of a person of such character and worth , granted the pardon . It was on this principle that Abraham interceded for the sparing of Sodom and Gomorrah . His plea was the moral worth of fifty righteous souls : and the efficacy of the plea is distinctly recognized by the Angel Jehovah . Paul also interceded with Hiilemon for Onesimus , by pleading his own character in the estimation of Philemon , as " being such a one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner of Jesus Christ . " This is the principle on which the Lord Jesus Christ makes intercession for transgressors , by representing to the moral governor his own infinite worth as an honourable ground for sparing them . It is as the just , that he died for the unjust . It is as the riohteous , that he is now an advocate with the Father . Hence we learn the design* and the plan of what is called the active obedience of Christ , in the plan of the atonement . The atonement did not consist in the death of Christ simply as death , or as the death of a person so related to the ofienders , but it consisted in being 8tu:h a death of such a person . The Lord Christ would not have been such a person in his sufferings and death , had not the obedience of his life preceded his agonies . The obedience of his life gave him a mediatorial character in the estimation of the divine government , so that it is an honour to the moral law to honour him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meritorious , that were we to consider him in his moral character alone , irrespectively of his divinity , it would have been no wonder , but rather , the expectation and the delight of all intelligences , if the divine government in all its authorities had interposed in the justice-hall of Calvary to vindicate and to honour such a character ; to give him the " life " promised in the law that he had honoured , and to confer upon him the recompense of the just . But to the eternal astonishment of aU the worlds of God , /z/ on that spot , he stood the just for the unjust ; in their stead ; and voluntarily suffering deathy not as the ixAiciedi penalty of the law - because , for a person of his character the law had no penalty - but he voluntarily suffered death as an agreed arrangement , and as a received " commandmenf* from his Father . The divine government has been more honoured by the obedience of such a person than it has been dishonoured by the disobedience of the offenders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , because that he himself was not worthy of death . He did not die because the law required it , for the law could not require a just person to die . He died because he had received a commandment to die from his Father - that for the sake of the dying of a person who did not deserve to die , he might pardon those who had deserved death . In such an arrangement no subject will think lightly of the divine government , when mercy is exercised only for the sake , and in the name of one who has done so much to honour the law ; but every one must , in obedience and homage , fall down before the Lamb of atonement , saying , " Thou art worthy to take the book , for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood . " section IV . The personal substitution of Christ . A mediator interposing for offenders puts himself in their place , and , as we have seen , proposes to /q/ substitute some expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interposition for Onesimus . On the same principle the Lord Jesus Christ has mediated for sinners . The sin of man is a public injury to the divine commonwealth ; and for such a public injury the law has provided a public punishment . Before this public punishment can be honourably suspended , some public expedient must be substituted , that ' ' ill answer the same ends . Why ? The very reasons which required the original penalty to be annexed as a sanction to the law , require , in case of its suspension , that what is substituted for it should secure its ends . It is not the letter of the penalty that is essential to good government , but the influence and the ends of the penalty . What Zaleucus substituted for the infliction of the total blindness due to his son , was honourable to his government as a king , and to his character as a father , and was likewise full of grace to the offender . The principle of substitution is recognized , owned , and acted upon , by every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution to " the offence of the cross " that makes men stumble at it . Every victim that has ever bled on a sacrificial altar , every ti'ouble and expense which it has cost a father to relieve and forgive an offending son , every instance of kindness shown to one for the sake of another , every instance of giving and taking hostages among nations , every honourable exercise of a government 's c 5 /z/ clemency towards offenders at the intercession of worthy characters , recognizes the principle of substitution . The persons who deny the substitution of the atonement of Christ , nevertheless recognise the principle of it , by asserting that the repentance of the sinner is a sufficient reason for suspending his punishment ; or , in other words , they assert that the repentance of the sinner is a satisfaction to the divine government , supplying to it an honourable ground for his acquittal ; and as such , to be substituted instead of his punishment . The theology of this assertion is unscriptural and bad ; but its testimony to the necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct and irrefragable . Our opponents then believe in substitution , but not in the substitution of Christ . They are for substituting the sufferings of a sinner in repentance : we are for substituting the sufferings of Christ . They believe the tears of repentance speak well enough for pardon : we believe " the blood of sprinkling speaketh better . " What measure , then , does the scripture reveal as the great expedient substituted in moral government , instead of the punishment due to offending mankind ? This is its testimony ; All have sinned , and become short of the glory of God ; being justified freely by his grace , through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus , whom God hath set forth to be the propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare /q/ his righteousnes for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God : to declare I say at this time his righteousness , that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus . " The Son of man came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us . " " Him that knew no sin , he hath made sin for us , that we might be made the righteousness of God in Mm . " Rom iii . 23 - 26 . John xx . 28 . Gal . iii . 13. 2 Cor . V. 21 . The substitution of Christ was twofold , - a substitution of his person instead of the offenders ; and a substitution of his sufferings instead of their punishment . By this substitution is meant a voluntary engagement to undergo for the ends of divine government , degradation , trouble , reproach , and sufferings , that the penalty threatened by the law may not be executed on the offenders . Such a substitution implies no transfer of moral character , no commutation of delinquency and responsibility ; the nature of things makes such a transfer and commutation impossible . This substitution of suffering , idso , excludes the idea of a literal infliction upon the substitute of the identical penalty due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the substitution of Christ is a measure introduced by God as the public organ of Moral government , on public groimds , and for public ends , and consequently did /z/ not need to admit of the infliction of the literal punishment . Had Pythias actually died for Damon , Pythias would have endured the identical penalty due to Damon . But except in the principle of substitution , this case is not analagous to the substitution of Christ for sinners . The case of Damon and Pythias was one of mere private friendship , and not at all of public principle ; consequently it is not a case in point to illustrate the atonement of Christ ! Pythias did not substitute himself for Damon from any love to the government of Dionysius , nor from a wish to express his abhorrence of the offence of Damon . Had Pythias died , Damon would have loved and honoured his friend , but he never would have honoured the government ; for he woiQd claim his release as a matter of justice , and never beg it as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king in utter contempt . The king did not admit of the substitution of Pythias from love to Damon , but from dee of revenge and thirst for blood ; that if the offender himself did not suffer , he would have the sufferings of his nearest and dearest friend . Such assuredly , is not the substitution of Christ instead of sinners . For though the Scriptures represent the death of Christ to be fully and literally " in the room and instead " of others , as that of Pythias would have been , yet they never connect it with private feelings of attachment , but always with the public principle of government . The substitu- /z/ tion of Christ is more like the substitution of the person and sufferings of Zaleucus instead of the total blindness of his son , which at once manifested his high regard for his law and government , his abhorrence of the offence , his love and mercy towards the offender ; while it also showed how vain it was in any subject to expect to offend with impunity . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blameworthiness ; the innocent was innocent still , the offender was offender still . Zaleucus was treated as if he had been the offender - but the character of his adulterous son was never his character . No one ever thought of calling him the adulterer ; much less the greatest adulterer in the world . No : he knew no offence , though he was treated as if he had been an offender . In this case the literal penalty was not executed upon the substitute . The letter of Zaleucus 's law threatened total blindness , and this blindness is threatened only to " the soul that sinned ; " yet in the substitution and sufferings of the father were found a sufficient satisfaction and atonement* to the law without a literal infliction of the penalty . The substituted sufferings of the father preserved the spirit of the threatening , and were as much like it as was deemed suitable without being identical with it . It supplied safe grounds to the government for dispensing pardon . The substitute made a sufficient atonement to the law without suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atonement of Christ did /z/ not consist in bearing the identical punishment threatened to the sinner . The letter of the law never could have reached the person of Christ with its penalty ; for he had personally and in his representative character kept the whole law , and consequently was honourably entitled to the life which the law promised . Nor could the letter of the law have met him as the substitute in the offender 's room ; for such a substitute was beside and above the letter of the law . Except in the mere article of dying - of separation between soul and body , there was scarcely any thing in the sufferings of Christ the same with the original penalty threatened in the law . In the sufferings of Christ there was no pang of remorse , no consciousness of demerit , no moral and eternal death , no execretion of the authority that inflicted the pains . On the contrary , there was in him a consciousness that he was just , and that the law did not curse him , and an assurance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will , and doing his pleasure . The hypothesis of a literal infliction of the penalty on the person of Christ destroys the benevolence and weakens the authority of the divine government . It supposes that the divine government would not admit of any diminution of misery , or any accession of happiness in the universe . It must have every iota and tittle of the misery incurred , whether by the person of the offender himself , or by his substitute . /q/ It supposes that the penalty can not with justice be executed again on the offender himself , after it has been inflicted and exhausted on his substitute . Such views make the offender secure , presumptuous , and licentious . The substitutionary atonement of Christ does not abrogate a single claim of the law upon any sinner , until that sinner believes in Christ , and walk not according to the flesh , but according to the spirit. * ' /z/ The personal voluntariness of Christ . To render a substitution valid , honourable , and efficacious , there must be free and perfect voluntariness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an index to the whole operations and bearings of the mediatorial system ; to point it out as a system adapted to reasonable , free , and voluntary intelligences . It was , in fact , to be a specimen of the voluntariness of the whole economy . " Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might have it again . No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This command have I received of my Father , " John x. 17 , 18 . Man was free and voluntary in the offence . God was free and voluntary in providing an atonements The Father was free and voluntary in accepting the /z/ satisfaction , and the Spirit is free in applying salvation to sinners , dividing to every one according as he will . The sinner is free in rejecting or receiving the atonement ; and the divine government is free and voluntary in forgiving the sinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obedience and holiness ; his admission to heaven is entirely of free grace and unconstrained good-will ; and all the employments and exercises of heaven are free and voluntary . Free , uninfluenced voluntariness is stamped on the whole transaction , and is exercised by all the parties concerned . This voluntary principle was conspicuous in the whole life and character of the Lord Jesus Christ . Though he was rich , yet for our sakes he became poor . He was led as a lamb to the slaughter . His whole undertaking was an act of free choice , of perfect voluntariness : without constraint , without reluctance . When he disappeared from among the Jews , who sought to kill him , it was only because " His hour " was not yet come . When the right period arrived , he said , " Father , the hour is come ; " I am ready ; ready to go to Calvary , ready to be sacrificed on an accursed altar , ready to make an atonement for the sin of man . When this " hour " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prayed , " Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine be done . " Yet , this circumstance betrayed no reluctance to his work . Aversion from /q/ sufferings is an affection essential to every living creature . Such an affection is in itself innocent and sinless ; without it , man would not be the subject of hope or fear , and , consequently not a fit subject of moral government . Had the blessed Mediator been without such aversion to pain , he would not have appeared really and truly a man ; nor would he have appeared so great a sufferer . He loved his Father ; and in proportion as he loved his Father , he would be averse to any effects of his displeasure . His love to his Father , his innocent aversion from suffering , the nice susceptibilities of his holy frame , put his obedience to the fullest trial ; yet , as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he opened not his mouth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . " This voluntariness originated in himself . He emptied himself and made himself of no reputation No one took his life from him , but he laid it down of himself . He said , " Lo , I come to do thy will . " He had in himself the absolute right of self-disposal . No creature in the universe can possess this right ; for his a/q/ , all that he is , and all that he has , is otmng to the law . He , then , who could say of his life , " 1 have power to lay it down , and power to take it up again , " must be above law , above a creature - he must be God . This absolute right , and this unconstrained voluntariness of self-disposal , were essential to the lawftdness of his undertaking , and to the acceptance of his work , as Mediator . Though substitution is often above law , it must /z/ never be against law . An involuntary substitution would be a measure void of all justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just and gracious . The law of the land does not constrain any man to become a surety ; but if any one voluntarily become a surety for an insolvent , the law is not unjust in allowing him to " smart for it . " The law does not constrain any man to undertake great trouble and expense , and to part with a great portion of his estate to deliver a thoughtless and profligate friend or relation ; but if he voluntarily do so , the law is perfectly just in letting him bear such a loss , though he never personally deserved it . The law will not force any man to enter into recognizances for the good behaviour of another person ; yet if he voluntarily enter on such an engagement , and his friend break the peace , no one thinks the law unjust in making the bail suffer the loss . When Judah voluntarily substituted himself instead of Benjamin , and when Zaleucus substituted his sufferings for the punishment due to his son ; no one thinks of charging such transactions with injustice and wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , but it is jaundiced prejudice , that sees any colour of injustice in the voluntary substitution of Jesus Christ for sinfrd man . It must be something wrong , something that sees not as God seeeth , that can detect injustice in the very measure which God himself , with all authority , " sets forth TO DECLARE his righteousucss . " If God declares the /q/ substitution of the atonement of Christ to be a demonstration of his righteousness - and any set of men declare it to be an evidence of injusticCf we can not be at a loss whose declaration to receive as truth . An involimtary substitution would , indeed , have been unjust , unreasonable , and inadmissible ; therefore much of the acceptableness of the work of Christ is , in connexion with the dignity of his person , ascribed to the grace , the love , and the voluntariness which he so freely displayed in the whole undertaking . We are enriched through his poverty , because it was from mere graccj that he , though he was rich , for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour . That Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners was a step cordially approved of by God , and is worthy of all acceptation among mankind . " Him hath God the Father sealed " to be a Mediator ; and his great atonement he has appointed to be the only medium of communication between the offenders and the throne . " Neither is there salvation in any other ; for there is none other name imder heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved . " /z/ The personal sufferings of Christ . We have now seen in the substitution of the Lord Jesus Christ all the elements essential to the reaUty /z/ and sufficiency of an atonement to a government , viz. dignity of person , relationship to the offender , worth of character , voluntary substitution , and appointment by the authority of the government . In this enumeration of the essential elements of atonement , I have not inserted the article of intensity of suffering , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not consider it indispensably necessary . The reasons for it will be found in this section . The reality of the atonement has , in this discussion , been tried by the connexion of its great elements with the person of Christ ; let us now try the question of the extent of the atonement by the same test . It is self-evident that not one of these grat elements of atonement could possibly be more or less than it is ; from which we argue , that neither could the atonement itself be possibly more or less than it is . The atonement of Christ is generally represented in the writings of men , and generally believed to consist in an actual suffering of the penalty due to the offenders for whom he suffered . They who take this view of the atonement argue thus , Some offenders will eventually endure the penalty of the law themselves , as some of them already endure it now in misery . It would be unjust to inflict the penalty on the offender and on the surety ; therefore the surety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer it themselves . /q/ This hrpothesis measures the atonement by the number of the persons to be saved . This measurement is just as reasonable as measuring a king 's prerogative to pardon by the number of culprits whom he has reprieved ; or measuring the power of the sun to give light by the number of eyes that actually see it ; or the efficacy of a medicine by the number of patients actually cured by it . Many of the advocates of this view of atonement argue farther than this , and their argument arises naturally from their premises . Jesus Christ , say they , suffered the identical punishment or penalty due to the elect ; this penalty is always justly proportioned to the greatness of the offence . Consequently had the elect been more or less in number , or had their individual and aggregate sins been more or less in amount of number and guilt , their surety would have had to suffer more or less for them . This hypothesis measures the atonement not only by the number of the elect , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . It adjusts the dimensions of the atonement to a nice mathematical point , and poises its infinite weight of glory even to the small dust of a balance . I need not say that the band which stretches such lines , and holds such scales must be a bold one . Such a calculation represents the Son of God as giving so much sufferings for value received in the souls given to him ; and represents the Father as dispensing so many favours and blessings , for value received in /z/ obedience and sufferings . This is the commercial atonement - the commercial redemption which degrades the Gospel , and fetters its ministers ; which sums up the worth of a stupendous moral transaction by arithmetic , and , with its span , limits what is infinite . They who take this view of the atonement call it , indeed , infinite ; but infinite it can not be in the sense of unmeasurable or unlimited . The number of the elect is certainly limited , and accordingly the sufferings of the blessed Redeemer might have been more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinted that I do not consider an infinite intensity of suffering essential to the sufficiency of the atonement . My hand trembles lest I should write a single word or syllable that would convey a low idea of the greatness of Christ 's sufferings . The sufferings of Christ were indeed infinite , not simply in intensity of agony , but , as they were the sufferings of a person of infinite dignity and worth . Probably , the sufferings of some martyrs may have exceeded his , as far as the mere infliction of pain is concerned . Even the sufferings of the damned spirits are not infinite , except in duration . In reading the accounts of the sufferings of Christ we can not avoid the supposition that they might have been greater , or they might have been less , without affecting the reality or the sufficiency of the atonement . There might have been more or fewer thorns in his crown ; the scourges might have been more or fewer in number , /q/ or administered with more or less energy , without adding to the sufficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atonement is to answer the same ends in the administration of government as the punishment of the offender . The end of a government in awarding punishment is not simply to give pain to the offender , but , by giving a demonstration of the government 's abhorrence of the crime , to deter others from committing it . This is precisely the design of an atonement . As the infliction of pain is not indispensably necessary to the design of punishment , neither is it necessary to the design of the atonement . The scriptures never ascribe the efficacy of an atonement to intensity of sufferings . In the Jewish sacrifices there is a recognition of a proportion between the costliness of the sacrifice , and the rank of the offender , as the sin of one priest required the same atonement as the sins of all the people . In such recognition there is no trace of any proportion between the magnitude of the offence , and the degree of the victim 's sufferings ; or between the intensity of the sufferings and the sufficiency and extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , in a given year , having no children , would present their lamb for a sacrifice ; and it bled and died . Annually for ten or twenty years , they offered a " lamb for the family : " but in that time the number of sinners , and the number of sins in the family /z/ had greatly increased , possibly in aggravation as well as in number ; yet the lamb of atonement was not put into greater torture than in the first year . Take another case . The people of Israel , in a given year , might be greater in population , and might have committed nationally some greater enormities than at any previous time ; yet on the great day of atonement for the whole congregation , the sacrificial victim was not to die a more excruciating death than on former occasions . When scripture and analogy are opposed to such a principle of proportion , we can have no solid grounds for applying it to the death of Christ , or for measuring the extent of his atonement by the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the degrees of the sufferings of Christ , are the only things connected with the atonement that we can suppose to be capable of being greater or less , more or fewer . And these , we have seen , are not indispensably necessary either to the reality or the sufficiency of the atonement . We can not suppose that the atonement would have been less real and extensive had the articles of the crown of thorns and the scourges been left out of the list of his sufferings , nor that the atonement would have been more extensive and efficacious had his body while hanging in agony been pierced with a thousand speai 's . The sufficiency and the extensive aspect of the atonement would be the same even if not one soul were saved , and the greatness of his merit is no more /q/ to be measured by the number of the saved , than the demerit of Adam 's sin is by the number of mankind . All the elements essential to an atonement are utterly incapable of increase or diminution . Let us think : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of person than he actually had ? Could he have been more or less nearly related to the offender , that is , more or less incarnate , than he really was ? Could his moral virorth and active obedience to the law have been more or less perfect than it was ? Could the voluntariness of his substitution have been increased or diminished ? Could his mediation have been instituted with more or less authority and approbation than it was ? These elements are , even in thought , incapable of being more or less . They are infinite , unlimited , unmeasurable . They are immutable , and are as unaffected by the number of the objects which they benefit , as the light of the sun is by the multitude of objects which it unfolds . Not only all the elements , but all the effects of the atonement , with the mere exception of the number of the saved , are likewise incapable of variableness , increase , or diminution . Let us think again ; could the divine perfections have been more or less vindicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin have been more or less powerfully demonstrated than it was ? Could God 's determination to defend his law have been more or less proved than it was ? That is , would a less atonement /z/ have done these things sufficiently : or would a greater atonement have done them efficiently ? I trow not . The honours conferred on the person of the Redeemer are among the effects of the atonement . These also , with the exception of the number of the saved , are incapable of being more or less than they are . The Son of God could not have been more or less suitable and able to be an advocate and a judge than he is . To say , the greater the number there will be in heaven , the more honour there would be to the Saviour , is true ; but it is true only by giving another meaning to the word honour . The honour of the Saviour is the same and unalterable , but this sentiment only means that , in the supposed case , there would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is an honour already due , and already rising from his atonement , even if such a number were not there to ascribe it . Daily accessions to the church and to heaven do not give honour to the atonement , they only Oivn and ascribe to it the dignity and the work which they have already foimd in it . The gradations of gracious reward and heavenly glory among the saints made perfect are never traced to the capableness of the atonement being more or less ; but to the personal exercise of moral agency in faithful services for God . It is he that soweth sparingly that shall reap also sparingly , and it is he which soweth bountifully that shall reap also bountifully. /q/ It is not because more glory was purchased for one and less for the other . Such considerations persuade me that the atonement would not have been greater or less had the agonies of Christ been more or less ; and , therefore , that the sufficiency and extent of the atonement do not at all depend upon the degree or intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not destroy the propriety and necessity of the sufferings of Christ . It might be asked , if the value and the sufficiency of the atonement arise from the dignity , worth , and voluntariness of the person of Christ , and not from the degrees of his sufferings , then , what was the necessity of his suffering to such a degree as he did suffer , and where is the propriety of the scriptures so constantly referring us to his cross and sufferings ? It should be remembered that the atonement is not a measure of law , but of prerogative and grace . Had the atonement been a measure of law , it would have been under the direction of pure equity ; but as it IS a measure of grace , it is , like all such measures , under the direction of infinite wisdom . This infinite wisdom arranged the time and period in which the atonement was to be effected ; and , no doubt , the same wisdom ordered and regulated the degree of sufferings and humiliation which were to be endured in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had infinite wisdom seen fit , the time of atonement might have been otherwise ; nor is there any absurdity or impiety in supposing d2 /z/ also , that the degree of humiliation and suffering might have been otherwise . We can not tell all the reasons of the divine government for annexing such a penalty to the law , or for executing such a punishment on offenders . But we axe not afraid to assert , that the humiliation of the Son of God to assume , on account of sin the nature of man and the form of a servant , was , even without personal sufferings , an event of such unfathomable degradation , as to appear more calculated to secure those ends of government , than the degradation of , the whole human race under the penalty to all eternity . Therefore , when we stand on the shore of the great atonement , and pose ourselves with questions , and weary ourselves with guesses , as to why he was wounded for our transgressions , and why he was bruised for our iniquities , infinite wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , * and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings . " The perfection of infinite wisdom demands our implicit confidence , and gives us an assurance that if the sufferings of the blessed Mediator might , for all the ends of atonement , have been of less intensity , they would have been so arranged . We think , however , that right reason and analogy point out to us a propriety and a congruity in an atonement being as much like the threatened punishment as might be consistent with the nature of a satisfaction . /q/ To answer the same ends as a penalty , the atonement must be somewhat like it . All rational intelligences are capable of hope and fear , of praise and blame , and consequently , of pleasure and pain . An aversion to blame and pain is inherent in every moral agent ; and so is the desire of praise and pleasure . It is to these affections that the whole administration of moral government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as its promises and ihreatenings would be mere nullities . The threatenings of the law can not be safely suspended by any expedient or atonement , unless the atonement be calculated to impress our hopes and fears as powerfidly as the original penalty itself . This , according to our habits of conception , is most effectually done by the exhibi tion of sufferings ; as by addressing itself forcibly to our aversion firom pain , it is adapted to deter us from offending . As offenders were to be deliyered/rom sufferings , it was arranged by infinite wisdom , that they should be delivered through the sufferings of another , in order to impress them with a sense of the evil of their transgression , of the benevolence of the divine government , and of their obligation to the Mediator . Sufferings were , therefore , introduced into the atonement , because they supplied the greatest number of motives to deter from sin , afforded the greatest amount of reasons for returning to allegiance , gave the soundest grounds of assurance of a cordial recep- /z/ tion and pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations on the offenders . One of the ends of the divine government in annexing a penal sanction to the law , was to deter us from sin , by addressing our hopes and fears ; and , therefore , it threatened sufferings to the sinner . If the atonement that justifies the suspension of the threatening , answers this end of the government more effectually than the orial penalty , . then , the atonement is of a greater value to the government than the penalty itself . The history of salvation shows that the atonement is of greater value than the original penalty , because it contains in its arrangement a greater number of motives to deter from sin , and to attach the subjects to the government . It is invested with this kind of value by the introduction of amazing sufferings . I say , this kind of value ; because I do not consider this value essential to the atonement as it works upwards towards the divine perfections , but I consider it as auxiliary to the atonement , as it works downwardly towards the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God were not intended , nor were they calculated to affect the character of a single attribute in God ; but they are intended , and eminently adapted to affect the disposition and the character of the sinner . Hence arose the necessity and suitableness of perfecting the atonement by sufferings . The sufferings of one so illustrious in rank and worth , of one so full of love /q/ to the offender , of one so much abhorring sin , of one so much honouring the law - and such sufferings - are more adapted to deter men from sin , than the tidings , or even the sight of the sufferings and torments of all the fallen beings of the universe . /z/ The whole character of God concerned in the Atonement , The divine perfections are those properties , attributes , and dispositions of the divine nature which form the character of God , and are made manifest in his works , and in his conduct towards the universe . We ascertain the properties and qualities of a king 's mind by the institutions and laws established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kingdom which might appear incompatible with this declared and well-known character , every subject would be concerned to know , how far the king himself was concerned in that event , and by what measures he could vindicate and maintain his character notwithstanding such an event . Let us suppose a case . In the history of the empire it is recorded that vast many of the inhabitants of one of the provinces revolted , and that the king immediately condemned them to perpetual bonds and punishment . Some time afterwards , the inhabitants /q/ of another province renounced their allegiance to his throne ; but , instead of being like the others summarily punished , a flag of truce is sent to their province , and a message of reconciliation addressed to the rebellious offenders . When such a measure would become known , it would involve the character of the king in great mystery , if not in contradiction . The revolters who had been summarily punished would say , " The king has changed his mind . There is no such wrong , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and we have been harshly and cruelly treated . " The subjects that continued in their loyalty would say , " This is mysterious . Here is the same law broken as in the former revolt in the other province ; yet the same punishment does not follow . Perhaps the king sees now that such a law required too much , and that the infliction of its penalty is too severe . Peradventure , probablyy the penalty shall never again be executed in any case . " The indulged offenders would say , " This very message implies that the king himself sees that we had some grounds for our rebellion , that it was unwise to make such a strict law for us , and that the punishment is greater than our insurrection deserves . And as this message comes altogether imsought , we may now be sure , that the king has determined never to inflict such a severe and disproportionate punishment again . " In such circumstances the character of the king would appear , even to some of his friends , as clouded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become the subjects to consider that they might not know all the state of the case , that they do not know all the arcana imperii of the administration . And their confidence in the king should not be weakened when they hear that he has appointed a day when he will fully and amply vindicate his character and government . More especially would we expect their confidence in the king to be strengthened when it was proclaimed to them from the throne , that he was about to introduce speedily into his administration a measure that would efiectually maintain , vindicate , and explain , his whole character as connected with the events that had puzzled them . Such a measure would show that the king was concerned for his character among his subjects , and that he wished the validity of such a measure to be tried , more by its bearings on the royal character , than by its influence on the respited ofienders . Such an expedient , we have seen , was introduced by Zaleucus into the government of the Locrians . And such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the administration of his moral government ; and this measure is the atonement of his own Son . The intrusion of sin into the universe , and the discrepancy in the divine administration towards fallen angels and fallen men , were calculated to obscure the character of God . His justice appeared fickle and capricious ; his forbearance and clemency /q/ seemed unaccountable and unreasonable . Therefore the atonement was introduced , to declare his RIGHTEOUSNESS for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God - that he might be just , and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus . " Hence the atonement is a measure inseparably connected with the whole of the divine character , and involves the honour of every attribute in God . It is a safe ground for the public exercise or display of every divine perfection and it is an honourable medium for expressing the glory of every attribute . As the relation of the atonement to the divine perfections has been , we think , much misunderstood and misrepresented , our examination of such an aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scriptural. /z/ Wrong views of the relation between the Atonement and the Divine Perfections , I. In the holy scriptures the atonement is never represented as calling into exercise any divine perfection which it does not suppose to be in exercise before . By exercise I do not mean expression . Probably grae to the unworthy , and mercy to the miserable , would never have been expressed but for the atonement . Nevertheless , the atonement supposes that grace and mercy were previously in exercise , sug- /z/ gesting and providing such a measure for the honourable deliverance of the unworthy and ' the miserable . In the case of Daniel , the mercy of Darius was in exercise , though it was not expressed . The satisfaction which Zaleucus provided in the case of his offending son , was not the means of calling his mercy into exercise , but the medium of publicly expressing it . The moral governor of the universe was as much disposed and inclined to grace and mercy without an atonement as with it , provided they could be expressed with honour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grace and mercy are , as well as justice and truth , attributes essential to the nature and character of God . Hence the scriptures represent the atonement as the means of expressing , not the cause of exciting , the exercise of any divine perfection . When the atonement is represented by men as exciting in God an inclination to be merciful , and as producing a disposition to save , it is , in other words , adding a new perfection to God , of which the absurdity and the blasphemy are equal . God gave his Son to be an atonement because he had loved the world : and redemption is through the blood of his Son , according to the riches of his grace . II . The atonement is never represented in the scriptures as changing or modifying the nature of any divine attribute . In the theology of popular declamation , and in /q/ some of our hymns and spiritual songs , God is often exhibited as maintaining inexorably every jot of the utmost claims of strict justice , as unflinching in his anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fury against the sinner , and then , by mercy 's exhibiZofTe atonement , he is calmed , assuaged , pacified , and ready to forgive . This is the kind of theology that is always embodied in the dialogues or colloquies which writers frequently introduce between justice , mercy , &c.; &c.,; about the salvation of man . It is true that the inspired writers often speak of the indignation , the wrath , the anger , and the fury of Jehovah against his foes ; and of his being reconciled towards an ofiender , and of his being propitiated through ' the atonement . Such a figurative , and metaphorical language as employed by these holy men of God when speaking of him is bold , elegant , and suitable . But a literal construction of them would not only ofiend against every good canon of Biblical interpretation , but would lead to every species of absurdity . These anthropopatheia of the scriptures , these figurative expressions concerning wrath , indignation , reconciliation , &c.,; refer to the aspect of iJbe divine dispensations , and to their effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections and dispositions of the divine nature . When the aspect and effects of the divine dispensations alter , the change is not in the infinite and eternal mind , but in the state and relations of the offenders /z/ towards the divine government The cloudy pillar had an aspect towards the Egyptians very different from that which it had towards the Israelites . A change in the aspect of it would have been produced , not by a change in the pillar , but by a change in the relations of the two different nations . When a change is produced in the aspect of the divine administrations ; that is , when God is said to be propitiated or reconciled through the atonement ; it is not meant that the atonement made him propitious , or rendered him favourable and kind : but it is meant that the atonement was the ground on which he declared himself propitious , and the medium through which he expressed himself gracious . The actual change is in the state of the sinner . The atonement places the sinner on a ground where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should , however , be never forgotten that until the sinner himself personally avail himself of the atonement , and plead it in his own behalf ; that until his moral relations be changed , God will not express himself propitiated towards him . God was , indeed , reconcileable and propitious to the three friends of Job , yet he would not express himself propitious , and declare himself reconciled , until the three friends had offered their sacrifices . Then , after a change in them , there was a change in the aspect of the divine dispensations towards them . God was still unchanged , and therefore they were not consumed . Their sacrifices produced no change in /q/ him but they were expressive of a change in their moral relations towards him . Just so is the act of a sinner pleading the atonement of Christ in his personal behalf expressive of a change in his state and moral relations towards God . III . The word of God never represents the atonement as restraining or preventing the free exercise and expressions of any divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human systems of theology represent the atonement as an effectual barrier raised against the operations of infinite justice . Our books and our discourses abound with such statements as the following : - that the Lord Jesus Christ endured or paid to infinite justice the utmost farthing of its demands against a certain number of offenders ; - that he endured the identical amount of the punishment due for their sins ; - that it is a grievous wrong to exact the same punishment once of the surety , and again of the offenders : and that , consequently , justice can now lay nothing to their charge , can never proceed against them in judgment , and that they are within the enclosures of the atonement , whe justice can not reach them . Thus , the atonement is frequently represented as the city of refuge , and infinite justice as the avenger of blood , thirsting for the death of the sinner . It is not a likely way to promote reverential piety , to represent infinite justice as an infinitely dreadful and unlovely attribute ; nor can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not /z/ only in direct opposition to divine justice , but , also in manifest superiority and triumph over it . This species of atonement would entirely subvert all moral government . The language of the scriptural atonement is , that the blood of Christ redeemed us to God , not from God . The claims of infinite justice are as honourable as unabated , and as unimpaired ttnth an atonement , as without it . Eternal righteousness has not resigned a single demand , nor relaxed a single bond , nor withdrawn a single threatening . Every iota and tittle of the law is as much in force and honour after the atonement as before it ; with it , as tenthout it . Atonement has no ground enclosed out of the domains of justice . No sinner pleading the atonement before the throne of God shall be precepted , unless he also distinctly acknowledge and own that the claims of justice on him are right and true . Under this practical acknowledgment every good man is to live as one that must give an account to infinite righteousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operations of justice towards them are free and unshackled , notwithstanding the splendid atonement once offered for them . We have now brought under notice three representations of the atonement in connexion with the divine attributes , which we deem incorrect and unscriptural . The atonement that is exhibited as exciting , changing , or restraining the exercise of /q/ any perfection in God , is not the atonement of the scriptures . It ought to be remarked that these three representations of the atonement originate in the conception that the atonement is of the natiure of a commercial transaction , the payment of a debt , or the literal endurance of a threatened punishment . A commcial atonement is the npiaroy pevdoc of every error connected with unscriptural views of redemption . This is the only principle that can maintain that God is , by the atonement , induced to be merciful , just as a creditor is induced to release his debtor upon the full payment of his debts . This is the only principle that can aver that the atonement effects a modification or change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a judge would be disposed to remit a criminal 's punishment , after his severity had spent itself in the unmitigated lashes inflicted on the criminal 's friend . This is the only principle that can assert that the atonement restrains and checks the operations of infinite justice , just as a creditor can not again imprison a debtor for a debt once discharged - or as a tyrant can not claim a captive for whom he has received a ransom price . And I must add , this is the principle , that unnerves our ministerial addresses , that jaundices our view of Christian doctrines , that drives its thousands to apostacy , and lulls its millions into a false and fatal security . Since the atonement does not produce the effects /z/ and modifications above mentioned , it may be asked , what is the relation which the atonement sustains towards the divine perfections ? The reply is , that the atonement does not affect or modify the character of any of the perfections of God ; but it is a medium capable of giving full expression to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vindication of all the divine attributes . /z/ The Divine Perfections honoured by the Atonement , In the evangelical history of the sufferings of the Son of God , we often meet with the remark , that in them or by them " God glorified his name . " The name of God is the entire character of all his perfections . It is the purpose of this section to show how this has been fully honoured in the atonement* In the first place , - The atonement shows that no divine perfection was implicated in the intrusion of sin into the universe . The revolters against the divine government are loath to ascribe their disaffection entirely to themselves ; and many have roundly asserted that the origin of evil is in God himself . Reflections have been cast upon infinite wisdom for contriving a moral system capable of evil , upon infinite power for permitting the entrance of sin , upon infinite rectitude for suffering the continuance of sin , and upon infinite benevolence for preserving a system in which evil is /q/ SO prevalent . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrusion of sin , neither by secret decree , by arbitrary withdrawment of influences , nor by any deficiency in government . The atonement demonstrates that God has done every thing to oppose sin which could be done in a moral government The language of God in the atonement is , What could I have done more unto my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? " Bylhe publication of the moral law , by the sanction of rewards and punishments , by the execution of judgments , by solemn oracles through prophets , and by - sacrificial institutions , God has borne a constant and unvarying testimony against sin . The whole of this testimony is most amply corroborated by the atonement ; for it magnifies the law , enforces the legal sanctions , justifies all judicial inflictions , confirms divine revelations , and verifies all sacrificial types and shadows . The atonement itself is the greatest and the clearest proof of God 's abhorrence of sin , and of his determination to oppose and to punish it . In the atonement God has condemned sin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the suspicion of being implicated in it . God could never have been accessory to an evil which he has been at such cost and expense to oppose and remove . It vindicates infinite wisdom by showing that it introduced into the system nothing calculated to produce evil , but every thing to prevent it . It vin- /z/ dicates infinite power by showing that omnipotence never was , and never could be made , the rule or the measure of the divine conduct in a moral government . It vindicates infinite rectitude by showing that it had provided abundant means and inducements to prevent sin , that it sincerely prohibited every sin , that it is determined to punish every sin , and that it has expressed its detestation and condemnation of it inhe highest Personage in the universe . It vindicates infinite benevolence by showing that sin is the exception , and not the rule in the universe ; that a compensative measure had been introduced into the divine government which would bring an accession of good to the universe , and that all the divine perfections are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than they would have been in the prevention of the moral disorder . In the second place , - The atonement shows that no divine perfection was unconcerned about the honoiu of moral government The instantaneous punishment of fallen angels had given a demonstration that the honours of moral government stood high in the divine estimation ; but the forbearance towards man was calculated to excite a suspicion whether they were so now , or not . A suspension of the penalty or punishment due to sinful man , was calculated to awaken in holy angels , and in wicked spirits , a thought that probably , even JUSTICE itself , which had been erst so prompt and vigorous in punishment , had now become somewhat /q/ lax , hesitating , and indifferent , towards the interests of moral government . There is also , I think , a general impression on the minds of unrenewed men , that LOVE , GRACE , and mercy , are some perfections in God that always are kindly disposed towards an unfortunate criminal , always side with him , always plead for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honourably , indeed , if means can be found to make it so , but honourably or not , these perfections always feel very tenderly towards the criminal . Now , it is evident , that if moral government is to be carried on , both these impressions must be removed . These impressions would not be removed by the actual liberation of fallen angels , nor by the eventual punishment of all the human race . Hence , then , arises the necessity of some wise expedient , and the expedient is the atonement of the Son of God . And the atonement removes these impressions . The atonement defends mercy from the charge of indifference to moral government , by showing that mercy would not express itself , nor deal out a favour , nor deign a smile to the offender , until it had given a public expression of its abhorrence of his sin , and had seen every claim of the government honoured . It defends justice from the charge of indifference to the government , by showing that the ends of justice are as effectually answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threatened penty , and that it has not abated one claim upon the sinner. /z/ The atonement is introduced and shown forth for the very intent and piupose of declaring infinite justice , that God might be just , and the justifier of him that believeth . God was just without an atonement , and would have been gloriously just in the punishment of our entire race ; but then , he would not have been a justifier of believers . The atonement is shown forth that he might be a justifier and the just , that he might be just in justifying . In the atonement mercy and justice imite to magnify the law , and to make divine moral government honourable . In the third place , - Tlie atonement shows that no divine perfection has been injured or wronged by the substitution of a Mediator between the government and the offenders . The attributes which are supposed to have been apparently slurred by the introduction of a compensative scheme into the divine administration , are truthy justice and grace . We have stated that the sufferings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infliction of the identical penalty threatened , but by being substituted and accepted in the room of the penalty due to the offender . These pages assert that Jesus Christ in his death did not suffer the identical punishment which the law had threatened against the sinner . This statement is met by an argument employed in behalf of the honour of eternal truth . It is said , " Death was threatened in the penalty , and /q/ eternal and immutable veracity requires that the substitute should suffer the identical death threatened to the transgressor , just as Pythias would have suffered for Damon . ' * This is the strongest argument in favour of the position that Christ suffered the literal penalty of the law . In this argument it is overlooked or forgotten , that eternal and immutable veracity requiresHhat the sinner only should die , and not a substitute . The threatening is , " the soul that sinnethy it shall die . " Therefore , should a substitute even suffer the identical death , truth is still very fax from being literally fulfilled . If eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , under the direction of perfect wisdom , dispense with the identical sufferings ? I think it may ; and that it has done so : and in vindication of the honour of divine verity , I submit the following considerations : - The truth of any proposition or declaration consists more in the spirit than in the letter of it . Truth in a promise and truth in a threatening are different , especially in measures of government . Truth in a promise obliges the promiser to perform his word , or else to be regarded as unfaithful and false . But truth in a threatening does not , in the administration of discipline or government , actually oblige to literal execution ; it only makes the - punishment to be due and admissible . A threatened penalty does not deprive the lawgiver of his sovereign and supra-legal power to dispense with it , if he can /z/ secure the ends of it by any other measure . And if the spirit of the threatening be preserved , the truth of it is not violated by its not being executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose his life , the spirit of the sentence is , that his life shall be no longer continued among good subjects , to wrong and injure them . Should this sentence be commuted to transportation for life , the letter of the sentence is not fulfilled , but every one will see that its spirit is preserved . This supra-legal prerogative of suspending punishment God has exercised in many instances , as in the sparing of Nineveh , and , I believe , in the sparing of our first parents . The identical penalty of the Eden constitution was not literally executed either on man or on Christ . It was not executed on man for then there would have been no human race . The first pair would have been destroyed , and mankind would never have come into being . It was not executed on Christ , He did no sin ; he violated no constitution , and yet he died . Surely no law or constitution under which he was , could legally visit him with a penalty . If it be said that he suffered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much requires that the penalty should be inflicted on the literal sinner as that it should be inflicted at all . Nevertheless eternal and immutable truth gathers its fairest and fullest honours from the atonement of Christ . The atonement answers all the ends of government as effectually as they would have been answered by the punishment of the offenders . /q/ Though the letter of the penalty be not executed yet " the spirit and the truth " of it are preserved ; and not only preserved , but they are more transcendantly demonstrated and honoured by the atonement than by literal inflictions upon all the millions of the human race . Infinite justice has also been deemed dishonoured in the substitution of a Mediator by the supposition that it punished the innocent instead of the guilty . It seems to me that it is thoughtless and wrong to say that God has in any-wise punished the substitute . It were better to say that God allowed sufferings to be inflicted on him . Indeed I deem it incorrect to say that justice has punished an innocent being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the punishment of the wicked . The character of justice is as much obscured by the sufferings of the innocent with the wicked , as by the sufferings of the innocent for the wicked . The history of the divine government presents an immoveable array of facts , mustered from the general deluge , the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , earthquakes , war , famine , and pestilence , in which the innocent have suffered with the guilty . Yet in every case we can not gainsay that " the judge of the whole earth has done right . " Before any persons renounce the doctrine of the atonement , or that Christ died /or transgressors , let them account for his sufferings with transgressors . Or , indeed , let them find a reason for his suffering at all . /z/ Without entangling the death of Christ with the difficulties of having been with sinners or for sinners , let any one single out his death as a simple fact in the divine administration , and account for it on the principles of justice . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept the law in all points : and yet he suffered pain , reproach , and death . Where is the justice of this ? - Will it be said that he died to prove the truth of his doctrine ? Then we would ask . Does the justice of God deprive a holy and innocent being of life to prove and confirm the veracity of God ? Such awful sufferings are rather calculated to disprove the truth of his doctrine by exhibiting him as a disowned impostor , ' smitten of God and inflicted . " If infinite justice can admit of the death of an innocent being to prove the veracity of God in any doctrine , there is nothing to prevent it from admitting the same measure to express his hatred of sin , and his willingness to save . It is sometimes said that Christ died for an example to men . This does not vindicate or explain the justice of his death . Christ did not justly deserve to be made such an example of ; to see the innocent suffer like the most flagitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the death of an innocent person can never teach the guilty not to fear the evil of death . The difficulties about the justice of the death of Christ are not removed by saying that he died for our benefit and advantage . Is this a proceeding of justice towai'ds Christ ? Does justice by such a measure treat Christ , /q/ an innocent person , according to his due ? . Does not this inclose the whole doctrine of imputed worth and righteousness , as some are benefited for the sake of another ? Examine the death of Christ as you will ; try it by any test ; it is utterly inexplicable except on the principle of its being a substituted expedient in moral government . Let it be considered that the Lord Jesus Christ is always in the scriptures signally marked out for sufferings . All the prophecies of the Jewish church pointed to these sufferings , all the doctrines and administrations of the gospel refer to them ; and , I might say , all the counsels of eternity looked forward to them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . What , then , can be the meaning of sufferings that centre in themselves all interests from everlasting to everlasting ? What principle can explain them ? The divine oracles , simple and dignified , respond , " Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation , through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness in the forgiveness of sin . " So say the oracles that speak from heaven , but not so say some men professing themselves wise . These men charge these very propitiatory sufferings with injustice and tvrong . Strange ! that God should ever think of declaring his righteousness , by a measure that was in itself unrighteous and wrong . Surely the judgment of men , in this case , is not according to truth . The scriptures explicitly assert , e2 /z/ that the atonement was a medium for God to declare his righteousness . But for God , by an unjust expedient , to declare his righteousness with a slur upon it , would be to expose it to contempt and desecration . The supposition that justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the atonement , and from wrong conceptions of the nature of divine justice . It is rarely considered and defined what is the justice to which the atonement relates . By divine justice is generally meant that perfection in God which gives to every being his due , and deals with every being according to his character . This is called distributive justice . Now upon the showing of either the friends or th foes of atonement , I ask was this justice at all declared in the sufferings of Christ ? Our opponents themselves being judges . Were the sufferings of Christ due to him ? Did the justice of God treat Christ according to the deservings of his character ? Take it for granted that the sufferings of Christ were only a testimony to the truth of his doctrine , or an example of obedience to the divine will , and that thus , his sufferings were for the benefit of sinners : and then try to answer these questions . Were such an example and testimony , in justice , due to sinners ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did infinite justice in conferring such favours on them , treat them according to their character f It is impossible to explain either the nature or the /q/ consequences of the death of Christ on the principles of distributive justice , as in it , neither Christ nor the sinner is treated according to what is due to his respective character . The justice that was declared and honoured in the atonement , is public justice . As public justice is rather a principle in the administration of a government , than an attribute of the divine essence , I shall reserve the full consideration of it to the chapter on the atonement in its relation to moral government . I will just observe , that when we say that Christ has satisfied justice , or that justice was satisfied in the atonement , our meaning is , that the wise and just ends of government were completely secured by the atonement , that through it the lawgiver 's prerogative to pardon was exercised with safety to the public good , and that " grace reigned through righteousness . " Sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clouded by the atonement . It is said , if the good that comes to the sinner , comes through an atonement , then it is not free and gratuitous . This argument has been fairly met and answered a thousand times , yet quick or dead , it is constantly used , as if its friends thought that a bad argument was as indestructible and immortal as a good one . It ought to be enough to remark now , that this argument is in direct opposition to the express declaration of scripture . The writers of the New Testament uniformly and /z/ explicitly represent the mediatorial undertaking of Jesus Christ as the highest proof , and the most powerful expression of sovereign grace and infinite love . Their language is ; - God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son . " " Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins . " " God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace . " Is it not strange that God should show forth to public admiration , and ' commend " in the atonement a perfection which men declare to be utterly destroyed by it ? It is impossible for us to avoid the conclusion that the abettors of this argument , and the writers of the New Testament , differ " wide as the poles , " in their views of the grace of God , and of the sufferings of Christ . The apostles represent the atonement or propitiation as " commending " the grace of God , and as " declaring " the righteousness of God . The abettors of this argument " declare " the atonement to be utterly subversive of all grace and righteousness . The question which of the parties is right , must be settled by the evidences of the inspiration of the New Testament . Our opponents will allow us to recommend them to consider whether their views are likely to be accurate and sound , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Christ and his apostles saw . /q/ The argument which we have been combating is not at all available , except on the principle of the atonement being a commercial transaction , a quid pro quo . If sin be represented as properly and literally a debt , and not a moral offence ; and if the atonement be set forth as a literal payment of that debt , and not a moral transaction supplying to the government honourable grounds for pardoning a criminal ; then , I think that grace does not appear in the discharge of the debtor . The creditor received what was due to him , and release is now justly due to the debtor . The release of such a debtor is no favour . n is called a debt only in figurative language . No one will say that our sins are otving or due to God . The real nature of sin is an abstraction or withdrawment of what is due a transgression of the law , a moral and a public offence against God as the Governor of the universe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribe for exciting divine love , but as a medium for exercising it ; not as a motive to induce God to be gracious , but as the means for expressing himself gracious ; not as a commercial payment making release due , but as an honourable ground for making pardon admissible and safe . Take the following illustrations of the possibility of favours bein perfectly gratuitous and free , though conferred on valuable considerations and honourable grounds . Whn the Athenian senate granted pardon /z/ to iEschylus for the sake of his brother Amyntas , the pardon was unbribed , and entirely of favour and grace . When Philemon received Onesimus for the sake of Paul , his reception back to favour was all of grace . When David showed favour to Mephibosheth for the sake of Jonathan , the favour was entirely of grace . And when God forgives sinners " for Christ 's sake , " it is to the praise of the glory of his grace . The loss of Amyntas 's arm at Salamis , the labours of Paul , and the kindness of Jonathan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safe and honourable expression of it . David wanted nothing as a motive to induce him to spare Absalom , but he did want something as an expedient through which he could spare him with lionour to his throne and government . If a medium had been found , as in the instances of schylus , Onesimus , and Mephibosheth , the expression of David 's love would not have been due to Absalom ; for the medium of expressing it would not at all destroy the grace and freeness of it . This argument from the freeness of divine grace is never used by its friends , except to oppose the atonement . It is not that they care for the honours of free and sovereign grace . They do not consider , that their use of the argument is as much opposed to the doctrine of repentance , as it is to the hypothesis of a commercial atonement . None of them preach pardon without repentance ; and even those of them who preach universal restoration make it /q/ honourable only after an intervening punishment . If divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to act without safe grounds , without a just reason , without an honourable medium , then , why not do away wiih punishment altogether ? Why not renounce the doctrine of repentance , as well as that of the atonement ? The hardened sinner no more approves of free pardon through repentance , than the self-righteous relishes a free pardon through an atonement The apostles preached the atonement , and repentance , as if never suspecting that they infringed on the honours of sovereign grace . I apprehend , then , that what I have here dignified with the name of an " argument " of our opponents , deserves no better name than that of a sophism . To plead that a boon can not be free and gratuitous if granted upon honourable grounds only , goes to destroy and subvert moral government entirely . For a governor to treat the injured and the injurious subject alike - is to destroy the difference between right and wrong , virtue and vice . Rectoral love is ks much exercised and honoured in punishing the injurious , as in protecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consist in private love towards man , but in good-will towards the universe . It is as much concerned for the public good as for individual happiness . In the atonement God appears LOVE , love to sinners , and love to law and justice . The love of God is not love expressed by a weak and an unreasonable fondness , nor lpv exer- /z/ cised by arbitrary power ; it is rectoral love , expressed , indeed , freely and gratuitously , but expressed honourably and safely . Even in the days of Job it was clearly understood , that an atonement did not destroy the freeness of divine love , or the sovereignty of divine grace . Grod was freely disposed to pardon Job 's friends before they offered their sacrifice , and their pardon was freely granted and conveyed through their sacrifice . The deliverance of a sick man from the borders of the grave is ascribed to free grace expressed on honourable grounds . " He will be gracious unto him , and will say . Deliver him from going down to the pit , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion is warrantable , that in the atonement infinite love is freely exercised and transcendently honoured . In the fourth place , - The atonement shows that there is no perfection in God opposed to the wellbeing of the sinner . This wellbeing is not dme to the sinner ; and of himself , he will never reclaim it , for every sin is moral suicide . But neither the loss , nor the irretrievableness of it , is to be ascribed to God . The scriptures sometimes describe God as angry daily with the wicked , and as whetting his sword against him . This figurative mode of expression is used to teach us the certainty , that to retrieve our wellbeing in sin is as hopeless , as if dM that is in God 's nature were opposed to us . Taking their position on such inspired testimony , some theological /q/ writers have proceeded so incautiously , as to give an idea of a kind of clashing among the perfections of God , with regard to the wellbeing of a sinner . They speak of love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinner ; but holiness , justice , and truth , as sternly opposed to him . The provision of atonement as an honourable medium of salvation to the chief of sinners , is a demonstration that God was on the side of " good , " that his thoughts were thoughts of peace , and not of evil ; and that in these thoughts there was no clashing pf perfections , no jarring of inclinations and dispositions . Mercy was never opposed to the exercise of justice and truth . Justice and truth have never opposed the exercise of mercy . Whatever didne perfections can be exercised in a moral government , only find a suitable and honourable medium , and they can all be exercised freely and gloriously . The design of the atonement is to bring sinners to love and esteem every thing that is in God , and to honour every divine attribute , that he may honour justice , even as he honours mercy . The theology that represents mercy as the darling attribute of God , and his justice as the sinner 's foe , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Infinite holiness is opposed to man 's sin , without being opposed to his wellbeing #@# and infinite justice treats him as a criminal , not to hinder his individual hap- /z/ piness so much , as to protect the wellbeing of the universe . God in the atonement shows that every perfection is darling to him . He has devised a way to exercise them all in the name and for the sake of the dearest object to him in the universe , his only begotten Son . The sinner who looks to the atonement , sees and feels that there is no perfection in God opposed to his welfare . The author of sin is alone the author of misery . Even in hell , no sinner will ever feel that his misery is owing to some divine attribute having been opposed to his happiness . He will never condemn God , though he may wickedly blaspheme him . He will never suspect that he perished because that infinite love had not been sufl &ciently; expansive , that infinite wisdom had not contrived a plan sufficient in extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite justice had not been sufficiently provided for to admit of his pardon , that infinite mercy had not been sufficiently free , or because that the law had not been sufficiently magnified . No ; He will feel that he is his own destroyer , that every attribute in God had provided for his welfare , that not a single perfection had given one smile of encouragement to his sin and rebellion , and that no divine attribute had thrown or left in the way any obstacle to his reconciliation . " This is the condemnation , " - not an angry attribute or a frowning perfection , but " that light is come into the world , and men love dark- k /q/ ness rather than light . " The whole gospel of God says , " Fury is not in me . " It is not a few attributes , but the whole Godhead ; it is God , " all in all , " that is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself , with out imputing to them their transgressions . In the fifth place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations in moral government , all the divine perfections will be honoured and glorified . The atonement does not secure that all its designs shall be infallibly accomplished . Such an arrangement would have been inconsistent with the nature of moral government , which is a government oifree agents , and exercised not by force , but by the exhibition of inducements . The measure of atonement , like every other measure in a moral administration , designed and adapted for the use of free agents in a state of probation , must be supposed to be susceptible of failure . The measure in Eden failed to keep our fiist parents in innocency . The measure on Sinai failed to preserve the Israelites from idolatry . And the atonement may fail to prevent some from neglecting so great a salvation , and from denying the Lord that bought them . Nevertheless , the issue , the upshot of the whole will exhibit every divine perfection in untarnished lustre and glory . The atonement is , like its own ministry , " unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In /z/ the perdition of the wicked , eternal veracity will be glorified by the literal infliction of the threatened penalty upon the offenders themselves , who had despised and refused the benefits of the substituted atonement of the Son of God . Infinite rectitvde will be glorified , as distributive justice , by rewarding every offender according to his character ; and as public justice , by making their punishment a memento and example to the universe . Even goodness , grace , mercy , and love , will be honourably and gloriously vindicated in the impression produced by the atonement upon all intelligences , and principalities , and powers , in heavenly places , that such a punishment was abundantly deserved and merited ; and also by the self-condemnations of the despisers themselves , as those who had voluntarily rejected the counsel of God , against themselves . In the salvation of believers every perfection will be honoured gloriously . At the close of the administration of the atonement , the Mediator will appear " to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly to the universe , he would be neither glorified nor admired in the effects of the atonement on the redeemed , if any attribute of God were tarnished or dishonoured in their salvation . Infinite benevolence will be glorified in the accession of happiness to the universe ; wisdom , in the success of Ae stupendous expedient ; mercy , in the bliss and number of the saved ; truth , in the fulfilment of all /q/ engagements and promises ; holiness , in the triumphs over sin ; justice , in the secured ends of law and government ; and love , in the established harmonj of all intelligences in the universe . /z/ The extent of the Atonement illustrated by its relation to the Divine Attributes . It has been shown that in the atonement as a Compensative measure , substituted instead of the punishment of offenders , and supplying honoiirable grounds for offering pardon , the honours of all the attributes are carefully consulted , perfectly vindi ? cated , and gloriously displayed . On the contrary , in an atonement which is commercial in its character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to clash in their interests , and to be displayed without harmony . If the atonement be a transaction of commutative or commercial justice , that is , if the atonement con sists in the substitute suffering the identical penalty due to a limited number of offenders , and in suffering it for that number only , to the exclusion of all the lost , such an atonement mars the character of every attribute in God . A commercial and limited atonement dishonours the infinite veracity of God . By such an arrangement veracity appears violated , unfulfilled , and comj ) romised . It is not honoured in the execution of /z/ the threatening . It threatened only " the soul that sinneih ; " and yet it was a substitute who never sinned that died ; and even a literal execution upon a substitute can not be a measure of inunutable verity . Divine verity is also dishonoured in the apparent , if not manifest J insincerity of divine invitations , and of the offers of the gospel to sinners . If the atonement was not designedly offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offered to all . If the gospel offers be true , they are true , not for ought the sinner or the preacher knows , but they are true according to the simple and real verity of the case between God and the sinner . If the general offers of the gospel be false , if they are not simple , sincere , and unsophisticated verities y " then is our preaching vain , and our faith is also vain , " for truth is fallen in the street , its crown in the dust , and its pure robes sullied . An atonement of a commercial and limited character exhibits infinite mercy as inadequate , restrained , and exclusive . It brings forward a provision that is not sufficient to meet all the exigency of the case . If Christ sustained the sufferings due to a limited number in proportion to the aggravation of their respective guilt , then , upon what principle can the suffering of a penalty due to a part of mankind , be sufficient for the whole ? Sufficient for what is it ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them was never endured by Christ ? If it be not sufficient for this , the conclusion can not be avoided , that it is sufficient for nothing as far as /q/ they axe concerned . In such an atonement the character of mercy does not appear with the bland , open , generous , free , and unbounded aspect , which it wears in the propitiation for the sins of the whole world . Infinite justice has its glory obscured by a commercial and limited atonement . Justice is honoured by it neither in the salvation of the beUever , nor in the punishment of the unbeliever . In the salvation of a sinner , neither Christ nor the sinner is treated according to what was due to personal character respectively . The perdition of the unbeliever throws a cloud around the honours of justice . Justice has provided " a sorer punishment " for the despisers of the blood of atonement , yet in real verity , on the showing of commercial redemption , that blood was to them an unappropriable thing ; it had not been shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the despisers of the atonement are punished more sorely , for not appropriating what did not verily belong to them , and what was never intended to benefit them . Infinite justice punishes them awfully and eternally for not having committed a sacrilege upon the sacred and exclusive inheritance and possession of the church . How different is this calculating and mercenary hypothesis from that expedient that God shows forth to declare his righteousness , with a character unrebukable , and with an honour unsullied . The hypothesis of a commercial and limited atone- /z/ ment destroys the glories of free and sovereign grace in dispensing pardon and salvation . Free grace does not appear in dispensing pardon upon this scheme . After the identical punishment due to the offenders has been endured by the substitute , the deliverance of the offenders is a matter of right , due and claimable on the principle of distributive justice . Hence some of the advocates of such an atonement represent pardon as a boon not to be supplicated , but to be sued out ' as a claim . And hence also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now stands on higher grounds than God , " as it would be unjust to refuse him salvation . The honours of infinite benevolence are disparaged by this commercial redemption . Sometimes it is said , that the atonement of Christ was sufficient for all , had it pleased God to have designed and intended it for all . This is a mere evasion , and supplies neither a proof , nor a vindication of divine and infinite love . Apply this principle to any other administration of God . Suppose God to have introduced into the material universe a principle , say gravitation , of sufficient force and fitness to preserve order among all the orbs of space . Yet , in some places of his dominions stars hurled against stars , and systems rushed against systems , spreading ruin every where . If we found it difficult to reconcile this crash of worlds with infinite benevolence , would it be enough to say , " the principle of gravitation was sufficient for all worlds , had it pleased God /q/ to have designed it for them all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other consideration , sufficient to ransom all the slaves in her colonies , and yet thousands of slaves were still languishing and dying in the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity , vvOuld it be a vindication of the benevolence of the government to say , " the ransom was sufficient to redeem all the slaves , had it been designed for them all ? " No ; designing for a few a ransom sufficient for ally would confer no honour upon benevolence . The wisdom of God shares in all the dishonour which a commercial and limited atonement casts on the other perfections of God . If the atonement consisted in sufferings sufficient for all , but designed for a limited number , such prodigality in agonies , sufferings , and blood , reflects no credit on the wisdom that planned it . Sometimes , the perdition of the wicked is advanced as an irrefragable evidence against the death of Christ bei an atonement for all ; as in the case of the lost , Christ must have died in vain . For Christ to die in vain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though I think this argument is raised from inattention to the nature of all measures of moral government , yet it comes with a very bad grace from the advocates of a limited atonement . If the atonement was sufficient for all , sufficient for the saved , and sufficient for the lost , what is become of the sufficiency for the latter part ? Even on their own showing , Christ has died partly in vain . The hypothesis supposes that out of /z/ the lavish expenditure of sufferings , and out of the infinite accumulation of merits , only a small amount is designed by God to be of any service to himself , or of use to any of his creatures . What becomes of more than was sufficient to save the elect ? It is , on their own showing , vain , A moral atonement that does not calculate the sufferings of Christ arithmetically , supposes that though it may not profit those who receive its grace in vain , yet it shall not be in vain as to the great ends of moral government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of offenders is not the chief end of an atonement , but the glory of God*s public character . The atonement does this , even if not one soul were saved . On the other hand a commercial atonement , measuring the amount of merits by the quantum of sufferings endured , or by the mass of blessings conveyed , squanders and throws away as useless , vast treasures of all-sufficient merit . It makes that part of the blood of the covenant an unholy thing , unconsecrated to any holy end , unappropriated to any good purpose . /z/ A WRITER upon the decrees of God is generally regarded as one " who meddleth with his Maker ; " and his enquiries , however cautiously conducted , are hushed with the aphorism , " secret things belong unto the Lord , things revealed belong to us and to our children for ever . " The citers of this text suppose that the divine purposes and decrees are among " the secret things , " and not among " the things revealed , " and therefore , do not belong " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that the divine purposes are not among the " things revealed ? " If they are not an enquiry into them is an impertinent intrusion upon the arcana of the Godhead . But if they can be proved to be among the " things revealed , " they " belong to us and to our children , " as moral means . It is indisputably " revealed , " that there are such things as divine purposes and decrees . In numerous instances it has been revealed what these purposes are . Even if the purposes themselves are not in the list of moral means , the revelation of their existence /z/ is undoubtedly so . In the pages of scripture the announcement or revelation of these purposes is always connected with their influence on practical religion . That the practical tendency of such a developement of the divine decrees is beneficial , may be illustrated by the following case : - A general haranguing his army just before a battle , gives them a solemn assurance , that it is decreed for them to have the victory . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivity , acts upon them as a moral inducement to put forth the most determined and vigorous exertion of their agency . If a coward abuse this announcement to slink from effort ; if the enemy abuse it , to charge it with presumption ; such an abuse would not , in real life , be regarded as a fair argument against its practical influence . The actual tendency of the announcement is to produce manly effort . This instance illustrates the holy tendency of the scriptural exhibitions of the didne decrees , as a moral inducement to persuade men to obedience , and to perseverance in grace . /z/ The Atonement the Foundation of the Divine Purposes . The holy scriptures represent the atonement of Christ as the foundation of all the arrangements , counsels , and purposes of God . The system of the universe contemplated by the eternal mind , was a system intellectual and : taccountable ; a system susceptible /q/ of the intrusion of sin ; a system , nevertheless , not to be given up to the ravages of evil , but to be restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be altogether conveyed over to the hands of a Mediator , who should , by a compensative administration , estabUsh eternal order and hoUness . The moral system of the universe could not , after the intrusion of sin , answer the end of its creation , without being restored or repaired . This restoration j therefore , forms one of its characteristics , and seems as essential to it , as its intellectual and accountable elements . No way of restoring or repairing it has been revealed , except that by a Mediator . As its restoration alone secures the end of its creation , and as this could only be accomplished by a Mediator , mediation is essential to the system . The whole arrangement forms one mediatorial constitution . The system of the universe was not even contemplated irrespective of a Mediator . The principles of mediation pervade the whole of it , entering into its creation and sustenance , government and restoration , and into its eternal deliverance and glorification . The entire arrangement of aU the affairs of the universe is to be regarded as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the atonement of the Son of God . By saying that mediation is essential to the system , I mean that it is on account of the atonement , as the ground of a compensative administration , that God carries on the affairs of his government The whole of the ma- /z/ nifold wisdom of God , exercised in the universe , is regulated entirely " according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord Eph. iii . 9 , 10 , 11 . To ask what would have become of the moral universe , had no atonement been appointed , is just as rational as to ask , what would have become of the material universe , had the principle of gravitation not been appointed . All the proceedings in the moral universe take for granted a mediatorial constitution , just as those in the physical creation suppose gravitation . In the scriptures the Lord Jesus Christ is often represented as " the elect , " " the chosen of God , " " the only begotten , the first-born of many brethren . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him , " and for his sake . The whole universe is described as under his sway : for he , as " the head of all principalities and powers , ascended far above all heavens , that he might fill all things . " It is one of the most prominent articles in the doctrines of the apostle Paul , that the atonement of Christ is the foundation of all the divine counsels , &c.,; that the whole system of the moral universe is one entire mediatorial constitution . " We know that the miiverse all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose . For , whom he did foreknow , ho also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstBORN /q/ among many brethren .

Eph. i. 3 - 10. /z/ These beautiful passages exhibit the mediation of /z/ Clirist as the centre of all the counsels and all the works of God - the sun around which all the divine purposes and all the divine operations move . The apostle John likewise represents all the divine purposes as being administered in the name and by the authority of Jesus Christ . In the fifth chapter of the Apocalypse , the divine purposes and counsels concerning the universe , are considered as a book sealed with seven seals , the contents of which were to be developed and administered by one in the midst of the throne , who was a Lamb as it had been slain . The giving of the book to the Lamb represents the committing of the whole of the divine measures and counsels to the Son of God . The Lamb who takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very source and centre of all authority and favour in the universe . In that centre of the universe he is " a Lamb as it had been slain , " a Lamb of atonement , the centre of the administration of all moral measures , to which all the plans , and all the decrees , and all the works , and all the ways of God have constant reference . /z/ Tlie Atonement an Expression of the Divine Counsels , The atonement is , itself , one of the counsels af God , and should be considered as a specimen of all his counsels ; an index to their course , and a sample of their character . /q/ I. The atonement is a public expression of the benevolence of the divine decrees . In the atonement of his Son the eternal and blessed God unbosoms his purposes , and says , " Furyis not in me ; " " I know the thoughts which I have thought concerning you , thoughts of peace and not of eviV Nothing can be so revolting to humanity , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposes the great God , Father , Son , and Holy Spirit , from eternity brooding over a scheme or counsel of eml against the creature . The counsel of God , ordered in all things and sure , is a counsel of peace , and not of evil . The evil is not in the counsel ; " For God , willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath , that in two things by which it is impossible for God to lie , we might have strong consolation . Where , then , do men find despair ? Where do they find perdition ? Certainly not in the counsel of God ; for in this there is nothing but " strong consolation . " God has no counsel against the salvation of any sinner . Let some one point out to us where that counsel is revealed . Let some sinner be mentioned who has perished in consequence of such a counsel . The whole counsel of God is for good , and for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ways , and the unrighteous man his thoughts , and let him turn unto the Lord , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly par- /z/ don . " Is it possible that God may have any secret counsel opposed to this public declaration ? He has no decree against his promises . He has no purpose that contradicts his oath . I believe not . He can not deny himself . If nothing else will prove that the decrees of God are not thoughts of evil , let the condescension of Bethlehem - let the death of Calvary , prove it : believe it for the Very works ' sake . The Son of God was delivered to death " by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God . " And how did this counsel run ? Take a specimen . " God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth on him might not perish , but have everlasting life . " Does the cross , then , express any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bears an inscription written with the blood of atonement , and addressed to men of all languages , " Him that cometh unto me , I will in nowise cast out . " As the atonement itself is a measure of pure benevolence , it is , as such , a specimen of all the counsels of God . Hear what the author of the atonement says , " This is the condemnation , " - not that there is a settled decree of reprobation gone forth , - but , " that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light . " Hence , it is charged against the Pharisees as a heinous crime , that they " rejected the counsel of God against themselves , " to their own ruin . This /q/ charge alleges that every thing in the counsel itself is for the benefit of the sinner , and nothing against him ; that all the benefits of the counsel are freely and sincerely offered to the acceptance of the sinner ; that the sinner voluntarily , but most perversely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a rejection makes the sinner and the sinner alone , the author of his own ruin The purpose , design , and tendency of the atonement , is , " not to condemn the world , but that the world through him might be savedy The supposition that there are , notwithstanding , some decrees secretly opposed to this avowed design of the atonement , is unreasonable , improbable , and impossible . II . The atonement may be considered , farther , as an expression of the non-interference of the divine decrees with the liberty of moral agents . The whole work of the atonement , from the incarnation of Christ to his ascension , was accomplished without interfering with the free agency of any one being . Its operation in moral government , and its application to man by the Holy Spirit , are carried on without infringing at all on human liberty . And as is the character of the atonement itself , so is the character of the counsel concerning it . No advocate of liberty can wish for a freer range for the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Son of God was engaged in the work of making an atonement ; and yet in the whole transaction the counsel of God stands , and /z/ free agency is perfectly unconstrained . " For of a truth , against the holy child Jesus , whom God had anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , were gathered together for to do whatsoever the hand and the counsel of God had determined before to be done . " We may puzzle ourselves , and puzzle others , by asking with Nicodemus , " How can these things be ? " But it should be considered , that the demonstration of such problems is not given to scholars on our form , that our work is to search the sciiptures " whether these things are so , " and to act accordingly . In these scriptures we discover , that the divine decrees did not interfere with the freedom of any person concerned in the murdering and crucifying of Christ . This non-interference with free agency , the atonement maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel exhibits the atonement , as an open medium of reconciliation with God , and as a motive to deter from sin , and persuade to holy obedience . The benefits of the atonement are freely oflered to the unconstrained acceptance of every one who hears the gospel . Any acceptance of it that is not free and unconstrained , is not pleasing to God , nor available to the benefit of man . In accepting it , and choosing it , as a motive to holiness , and as a medium of pardon , the believer is free and imconstrained ; and in rejecting it as the means of salvation , every sinner acts according to his own free and uninfluenced choice . /q/ When the Holy Spirit opens the heart to attend to the claims and influence of the atonement , there is no more violence offered to the freedom of the will , than there was in Christ showing his wounds to Thomas to make him " not faithless but believing . " The atonement effects no change whatever in the laws of liberty . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrain the sinner to accept of pardon . As this " counsel of God ' * can be administered without infringing on free agency , it is a sample that all the purposes of God may be so too . All the works of God are the products of his mind and counsel , and are , therefore , all of the same nature and tendency . The works of God do not contradict his thoughts , nor do his thoughts contradict his works . His works are always the open and sincere expression of his thoughts and purposes , and as the atonement is one of his chief works , it is an expression and a specimen of the benevolence of all his decrees , and of their non-interference with the laws of free agency . /z/ The Atonement a Vindication of the Divine Purposes . In the history of moral dispensations the divine purposes have been liable to many charges , as having been accessary to the intrusion of sin , as throwing an air of insincerity on divine warnings and invitations , as being arbitrarj in determining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal perdition of unbelievers . As God works all things in his government according to the counsel of his own will , it was necessary for the ends of government , that the character of the divine counsels should , not only be explained and illustrated , but be clearly and publicly vindicated . First . The atonement of Christ vindicates the divine decrees , from having been accessary to the intrusion of sin . Jesus Christ is not a minister of sin , and his atonement is not an apology for sin . There is nothing in the measure of atonement that is designed or calculated to favour sin , or to extenuate its enormity , but every thing to oppose , to destroy , and to prevent it . The atonement is a demonstration to the universe , that there never was in the eternal mind a decree accessary to evil , for every thing in its provisions is purposed , and designed , and fitted to suppress all sin . God , indeed , foresaw that evil would intrude into the universe , and he made provisions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiltless of it . To vindicate his decrees from the suspicion of any share in evil , he has , at an infinite expense , shown how repugnant sin was to their order and character , by publicly condemning it in the person of his own Son . Evil is not the product of mind . Sin is not the result of design and arrangement . Suppose I were to say that the annihilation of the world would be /q/ an ax ; t of omnipotence ; I should be speaking what is absurd ; for I should make Almighty power to act - for what i to do nothing . It is highly inconsistent to suppose omnipotence in effort or at work to produce - nothing . And it is as inconsistent , though we may not perceive the incongruity so distinctly , to suppose evil to be the product of mind , and purpose , and decree in God . God does nothing but good . To purpose not to do good is to purpose to do NO-thing , and a purpose to do NO-thing is surely no purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse of good is not the product of design , evil is not the result of arrangement. * Paley has observed that in the bodily frame of man there is nothing intended or designed to produce pain . Whatever , therefore of pain may be in the human frame , it is not the result of design or purpose . That which is true of the frame of one man , is true of the frame of every man in the world ; yes , it is true of the frame of the entire universe . In the whole vast , multifarious , and boundless system , there is not one principle , not one movement arranged , designed , and intended to produce evil . Suppose an objector , viewing an emaciated man " in sore pain upon his bed , " to say , " This pain is not accidental , there must be some cause for it , there * See this ably demonstrated in Dr. Williamss Essay on Equity and Sovereignty : especially in the Preface , and Notes and Illustrations . - Ed. 1809. l06 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of man , contrived , purposed , and secretly introduced to give pain , which argues the want of benevolence in the author of his frame . " We would reply , " No , you are wrong . If you knew well the constitution of man , you would know that there is nothing introduced that is calculated to give pain , there is no sinew , nor muscle , neither gland nor duct , that is calculated and designed to produce disease But if your knowledge of the frame of man does not convince you of the benevolence of its author , look at the provision of medicinal virtue which he has plentifully stored in vegetables and in minerals , and in the air and the water around us , and see that all his designs and purposes are - to produce health , and to prevent disease . " If the same objector , viewing the shattered moral constitution of the universe , were to say , " This evil was foreseen , and might have been prevented ; its existence , therefore , argues the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its author , " We would again reply , " No , you are wrong . If you knew thoroughly the constitution of the universe , you would know that there is in it no law , no motive , no power , no influence , that is calculated or intended to produce evil . But if your knowledge of the arranged constitution of the universe does not convince you of the benevolence of its Maker , and justify to you the ways of God to man , examine the /q/ splendid compensative provision which he has made in the atonement of his own son , a measure of pure benevolence and immixed good . " If we are not to judge of an agent 's designs and purposes from the adaptation of his means , the fitness of his actions , and the tendency of his measures , there must be an end to all reasoning , the agent must be either without contrivance , or without sincerity . In the measures of a wise agent , the benevolent tendency of the means is a proof , and a vindication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The atonement is a measure of pure benevolence , " set forth " as a vindication of the pure benevolence of the purposes and decrees of God , and of their being guiltless of the origin and ravages of sin . Secondly . The atonement vindicates the divine purposes from the suspicions of throwing an air of insincerity on the invitations of the gospel . The invitations of the gospel are open , universal , and obligatory ; but men constantly abuse them , or neglect them , by indefinable guesses at the nature and the order of the divine decrees . Their sophism generally nms in this way : God has predetermined to whom he will impart gracious influences to bring them to accept his offers : and since he has not predestinated to do this for all , he can not sincerely will that all should comply ith his invitations . This sophism is grounded upon two suppositions. /z/ which are unsound and shallow . It supposes that a disposition to obey is indispensably necessary to the accountableness of a sinner , and essential to his power of obeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws which some of the subjects had not the disposition to obey : or , as if no king could make any laws against smuggling , but such as smugglers felt disposed to obey . This view of the case is subversive of all government , as it insinuates that it would be a sufficient apology for disobeying the law or command , if the smuggler said , he could not obey it , for he felt no inclination or disposition to submit to it , and therefore it is unjust to make him accountable for it . The above sophism has another glaring error . It supposes that the rule of the subject 's homage is not the published enactment of the government , but the private mind , and secret purposes of the king , which , by the bye , is supposed to be at variance with his published and avowed declaration . This stultifies all legislation and all accountableness . Whatever purposes and counsels are unrevealed , they are not among the moral means to be employed by us , and as far as they are unpublished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The decrees published to us in the gospel are not the rule of conduct to the heathen , until they are published to them ; but the moment they axe published , a great and eternal change is made in the measure of their accountableness , and in the rule of their conduct . /q/ We shall not be judged according to what we deem to be the secret mind of God , but according to what he has promulgated as his declared will . In all the concerns of life and business , men never pose themselves about the decrees of eternity . They never consult the eternal decrees to know what trade to pursue , in what town to set up , what physician to call in , what medicine to take , &c.; In all such transactions men reason and calculate on the general character , aspect , adaptation , bearing , and tendency of things , and they regard such arrangements as pretty clearly denoting to them the mind and the pui-pose of their Maker and providential Governor . In aU their speculations and transactions they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow in the cloud " vindicates the purposes of God from any suspicion of hostility to their " seed time and harvest Let us be as wise in our generation ; and in our spiritual transactions believe , that the atonement of Clirist vindicates all the decrees of God from any aspect opposed to the published declaration , " Him that cometh I will in no wise cast out . " The purposes or decrees of God are revealed and published in the naturCj tendency and meaning of the things which he commands , or offers , or prohibits . To suppose any design or purpose opposite to these is to suppose the most horrible monstrosity in the universe , - God conti-adicting himself . It is true that in numerous instances the event is /z/ very different from the design and purpose declared . In a moral government , during an economy of probation , in which millions of free agents are at work , such a difference and such a failure are to be expected . This assertion may sound startling , but try to evade it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the moral government of free agents in a state of trial , must be susceptible of failures . It is a FACT that such failures have taken place ; and to attempt to wrest or alter this fact , is to try to change the universe . The will of God is publicly revealed for public ends , and it is impossible to show what private ends he can have , that are opposed to his public avowals . The universe is a public commonwealth . Of this commonwealth God is the public head , and chief member . In administering its affairs he does every thing in his official capacity and public character , as the Goverfior of it . All the measures proposed and executed in it are for the public good of the whole commonwealth . In its government every wrong and every sin is treated , not as a private offence , but as a public injury , to be publicly noticed , whether in punishment or in pardon . As the public and official organ of this moral commonwealth , God has annoimced his purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These form his public will : public , not in opposition to secret , but in opposition to private or unofficial . I call this public will , as I call the great PURPOSES OF GOD . Ill principle on which divine moral government is administered public justice ; as consulting the public good of the commonwealth , as well as the private interests of individuals . The atonement of Christ is a public vindication of this public will from any suspicion of insincerity . In the atonement all the promises , invitations and offers , are yea and amen in Chiist , to the glory of the divine character and purposes . The nature of God , as the God of truth in real works and words of verity - the accurate adaptation of the provision to the case of the sinner - the actual experience of every applicant at the door of mercy - the perpetuation of gracious offers and invitations in the world , after so many forfeitures - the pressing earnestness with which men are invited and courted to accept them - the aggravated and sorer punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and character of the Mediator , who reveals and confirms all these by his death ; all these are " things in which it is impossible for God to lie , " and which impress upon all his proposals and overtures the image and superscription of verily undissembling sincerity . To suppose that the atonement is only a semblance of benevolence and love , put forth to impose on mankind , to mock the applicant , or to tantalize the enquiring penitent , is " to trample under foot the blood of the everlasting covenant . " In the atonement there is provision purposely intended for all , and all /z/ are sincerely invited to partake of it freely . The allsufficiency of the atonement is the foundation laid for the universal invitations of the gospel . An a/q/-sufficiency , not intended for all who are invited to partake of it , is such an awful imposture that I grudge the ink that mentions it in connexion with " the gospel of TRUTH . " If the atonement do not prove the faithftdness and sincerity of God , where shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very surmise of God 's using a mental reservation in the atonement of his own Son ? and in the offers and invitations and assurances of his grace ? Was the blessed Saviour himself insincere in his laborious toil , his bloody sweat or ignominious death ? No , he was full of grace and truth . If the character of God for sincerity , and the character of a theological system for consistency , come in competition , which must give way ? In a well-ordered mind there can not be a moment 's hesitation . Let us rather renounce our theological systems , or confess our ignorance of the whole of the case , than suspect for a moment any mental reservation , insincerity , and dissimulation , either in the divine invitations , or in the divine purposes and counsels . In the atonement God has given a public testimony of his truth and sincerity ; and " he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true ; and let God be true , though all human theologians were liars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the charge of capricious arbitrariness and partiality in the determination to impart sovereign and gracious influences . The Bible asks the question , " Who maketh thee to differ ? " On the answer to this question hang all the controversies in polemical theology . The Bible itself answers this question . " Unto you it is given j in the behalf of Christ , to believe on him . " " God worketh in you to will and to do of his good pleasure . " " God giveth the increase . " That the difference in the spiritual conditions of men , and the change in men 's hearts , is produced by divine influences , is asserted by the whole scripture , and is recognized in every one 's prayers , though not in every one 's creed . It ought not to escape notice , that it is only in the transaction of saving a sinner , that men dare ask God , " Why doest thou this ? " God has not " seen it good " to give a detailed account of this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a warning voice , " Who art thou , O man , that repliest against God ? " Nevertheless , he has introduced into his government , the measure of atonement to be an interpretation of his purposes , and a vindication of his coimsels against suspicions of unjust speciality or um'easonable sovereignty . The exercise of a sovereign speciality in the application of the atonement is indisputable . No hypothesis that admits the death of Christ to be an atonement , can deny this . There are in its applica- /z/ tion three instances of speciality which are signal , broad , and evident . There is a speciality in its application to mankind to the exclusion of fallen angels . There is a speciality in its application to believers to the exclusion of its rejecters . There is a third speciality , in the application of its benefits more largely to some believers than others , in proportion to their works and labours for Christ . I shall not enter now on a consideration of these subjects , as it will be more in place when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the work of the Spirit . Here we have three well defined , indisputable instances of sovereign speciality in the application of the benefits of the death of Christ : What shall we do with them How shall we evade them ? They are not capricious , for they are the uniform laws observed in the application of the atonement . Shall we say that they axe unjust , and that God has exercised a prerogative , in dispensing his favours , to which he had no right ? Try it . Did you ever think that for God to take mercy on man , was really a wrong to the devils ? Was converting Saul of Tarsus an evil in itself , and a wrong to all the Pharisees ? Is conferring gracious honours boimtifully upon those who have sown bountifully , a wrong to those who have sown sparingly ? Again , I say , here they are , three prominent , stubborn , immoveable , and imperishable facts of speciality : what will you do with them ? Betake yourself to the feet of Jesus Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight . " If there be no evil , injury , or wrong in the actuaj , practical , and tangible exercise of this speciality , there can be no evil , injury , or wrong , in purposing and determining thus to exercise it . It may , perhaps , be surmised by some , that the determination to apply the atonement with this speciality was partial and capricious . Let us briefly consider the state of the case between God and man . God has a claim to the whole existence and to the entii'e service of man . Man , by sinning , revolts from these claims . Though man refuses these claims , God still maintains and defends them . God , as moral governor , is not bound to give to a revolting subject a disposition to own his claims . The punishment of a revolter is due to the governor , for the ends of good government . The punishment due may be suspended , provided the ends of government be not thereby weakened ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will answer the same ends as the punishment of the criminal . Such a measure we have asserted the atonement of Christ to be - a measure devised and instituted by God himself . Here let us pause , and think - Can the moral governor justly arrange and determine , that this compensative measure shall not be altogether in vain - that it shall not entirely fail of the purposes for which it was introduced ? What being or person /z/ will God wrong or injure by such a determination ? Which of his attributes would be clouded by it ? Would a greater good be secured , and more certainly secured , without such a determination ? Would there have been less danger of the perdition of souls ? Would men have been more sure , of being saved ? Would Christ have been more sure of his rewards , had such a determination been excluded from the divine counsels ? These are questions not to be blinked . You must allow that in saving man , God either acts according to a plan and determination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish to offer one suggestion more , before I dismiss this momentous subject . I feel perfectly assured that God 's determination to exercise his prerogative to prevent the utter failure of the atonement , was consistent with his justice , mercy , and wisdom ; but I wish to suggest , whether the stupendous dignity and worth of the atonement , do not supply honourable grounds for determining that such a glorious measure should not entirely fail of its great ends . The various dispensations of probation are various experiments in moral government , in which God submits his own plans and ways to the acceptance , and for the use of free agents . If any object to the word " experiment " I beg to refer them for the meaning of it to the parable of the barren fig-tree , and to that of the husbandman sending his servants , and afterwards his son to the vineyard . These dispensations or experiments axe capable of failure . /q/ The Eden experiment failed - and the Sinai experiment failed . Such susceptibility of failure has been shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . As an infallible remedy will fail to cure a person who refuse to take it , so may the atonement fail to profit a man that seeks justification by works . But there is in the atonement a dignity , a worth , and a merit , to deserve in the estimation of God that it shall not entirely fail , but have a glorious accomplishment . Its worth is sufficient to justify a determination in the counsels of God , that he will sovereignly interfere to dispose many of the revolters to return to their allegiance ; and also sufficient to exculpate such a determination from the charge of partiality or capriciousness . Fourthly . The atonement of Christ is a vindication of the divine piuposes from the suspicion of having been the cause , or the occasion , of the perdition of the rejecters of the gospel . Every one will allow , that the advocates of sovereign predestination have used very incautious language upon this subject , partly to exalt the freedom of divine grace , and partly to impress the unbeliever with the certainty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made a most abundant use , and , it is to be observed , that generally the doctrine of predestination is attacked , as it has been represented by the most incautious writers . Many writers have written against the divine decrees as represented by Toplady , /z/ Hawker , Vaughan of Leicester , &c.,; but none against President Edwards , Dr. Edward Williams , Andrew Fuller , &c.; Indeed , I might say that there is scarcely one author who has written against predestination to life : all the attacks have been directed against a decree of reprobation , which , as a human and unscriptural doctrine , has been found more easily assailable . The divine purposes have been sometimes represented as the cause of a sinner 's perdition . Such representations may have been made to demonstrate to the sinner the infallible certainty of his condemnation , under the impression that making his destruction to be a subject of inexorable decree , he would see the impossibility of escaping it . As it is a general impression that an event to be certain must be decreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the charge of metaphysical prolixity , to show that an event may be certain without being decreed . The difference between truth and falsehood , right and wrong , is certain , without being decreed ; for no decree can possibly make it otherwise . Things are not right merely because God does them , but He does them because they are right , and right irrespective of any decree to make them so . The whole is greater than its part : two straight lines can not inclose a space : one and two will not make four : if two mountains are created , there must be a valley between them . No decree can make these things otherwise . If God produce a creature , /q/ that creature must be inferior to the Creator . This can not be the result of a decree , for no decree can alter it ; and none will say that God can decree to create a being equal to himself . The dependence of the creature , then , on the Creator , is an event certain , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated , whether voluntarily or involuntarily , from its supporter , the result will be ruin . This ruin , whether physical or moral , can not be the result of a decree , for no decree can make a creature to be independent of its creator . Let us now apply these clear principles . By sin man falls voluntarily from his dependence on the Creator , consequently moral ruin is perfectly certain dthout being ascribed to the divine decrees . This moral ruin is another word for all the miseries of sin . The evils of sin are not contrivances of God , for they would have been the same had we never heard of the divine decrees . Let us suppose a case . A man , by lies and falsehoods , brings himself into trammels and difficulties exceedingly detiimental and injurious to his personal interests . He is not to blame divine providence and the divine decrees that such are the natural consequences of falsehood , for no decree can make them otherwise . Divine decrees may interfere to prevent the consequences from taking place , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise from lying . And surely such a sovereign prevention in any given /z/ case , is not the cause or the occasion why the natural consequences of lying , actually take place in other instances . The liar himself is alone to be blamed . This reasoning is applicable to every other sin as well as to lying . If there be one doctrine in the scripture more clear than another , it is that the destruction of the wellbeing of man is entirely of himself , irrespective of any decree . After all , the friends and the opponents of predestination agree , that nothing worse shall befal any sinner , than /z/ These metaphysical principles are fully borne out by tangible facts which take place now in the present administration of moral government . Within our own observation , there have been persons on whom the wisest and the best means of improvement have been used in vain . These persons fully knovn their duty and their master 's will , yet habitually live in sin . They have been on the bed of sickness , and nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed for respite , and vowed that on the restoration of health they would lead very different lives i they have recovered , and have been more hardened and reckless in sin than ever . These things have occurred to them again and again : and now all say that they seem as if given up of God to the hardness of their on hearts . This is , alas ! a very common case . But when such language is used concerning such a sinner , is there any impression /q/ that such a giving up is unrighteous ? Does any one think that such a hardened character is the result of any divine decree ? No : every candid and holy mind may indeed view such a character as a case for his pity , but also for blame and reprehension . This case is not solitary . It is the case of every sinner that has ever perished . It is the case of every instance of reprobation , a reprobation not the result of divine decrees , but the natural result of a character hardened in wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deeds were evil . " As a vindication of this character of the divine purposes , the atonement is ** set forth . " There is no reprobation in the atonement . The atonement in its design and in its aspect , in its testimony and in its influence , has no reprobation in it . It is a propitiation for the sins of the whole world ; it is a testimony of love " to the world , " and consists in a " death for every man . " The blood that speaketh better things , never speaks reprobation . It speaks salvation in every syllable . It speaks and pleads for pardon in every case , and on every application . There are indeed some cases which are not pleaded by the blood of Christ , but there is not a single case reprobated by it . The cases not pleaded by him are those which sinners refuse to entrust him with ; the Intercessor himself rejects none . Every drop of the blood of atonement says , " Reprobation is not in me . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , /z/ JTie Extent of the Atonement explained by the character of the Divine Purposes . The advocates of a limited atonement have always appealed to the divine purposes as the impregnable defences of particular salvation . The real state of the question , I deem to be this - Did the Father will , and did the Son design , that the atonement should be a medium of salvation to all men , or to a select chosen number only ? The question is not to be decided by the events but by the nature of a " design " in a moral government . Thus were we to enquire whether God designed that the moral law published on Sinai should preserve all the Jews , in his service and worship - no one would answer and decide the question by the events without reflecting imfavourably on the sincerity of the divine character . We may justly say that a thing is designed to produce and secure any end , when it is fitted and adapted to it , though eventually it may fail of it . The arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently designed , to keep him from falling . The event indeed was otherwise , but the purpose was sincere and real . So the atonement of Christ is adapted , and therefore designed , to save man from sin , though the event in numerous instances may be otherwise . Some will not come unto him that /q/ they might have life , they will not have him to rule over /them , they neglect their great salvation , and tread under foot the blood wherewith they were atoned , and deny and reject the Lord that bought them . Commercial views of the atonement of Christ engender sentiments about the divine decrees unfavourable to the character of divine veracity . If the atonement consist in the literal suffering of the real penalty due to a certain number of offenders , it is evident that the identical penalty due to the others has not been suffered , and consequently that there is no provision whatever made and designed for their salvation . This commercial atonement gives the sinner no alternative . The penalty must be suffered before he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , he must suffer it himself ; and if he suffer it himself he will not survive it , he will be lost - and lost because the quantmn of his punishment was not enumerated in the amount of penalties allotted for atonement . Yet he is condemned and punished for not availing himself of the sufferings of Christ as the means of his salvation , whereas , according to the true verity of the case , these jsufferings were never provided or intended , or designed to be at aU available for him : it was never decreed that Christ should profit him . If the divine purposes run thus , the universal aspect of the atonement is an imposing semblance ; the urgent general call of the gospel is serious trifling ; and the con- g2 /z/ demnation for unbelief - for not believing what waisP really not trae , - for rejecting what he verily was never welcome to , - such a condemnation is an enormity , for which all the languages of the globe have no epithet . The friends of a particular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Son 's redemption , are of the same extent , or relate to the same individual persons , to all such , and to none else : so that all the chosen people are redeemed , and all the redeemed are the chosen to salvation . They also plead that there is not in the scriptures the least intimation that Christ 's redemption either exceeds or falls short of the Father 's election , in one single instance or individual person . The fallacy of this argument is in the word " redemption . " This word has various meanings . Redemption means , either the ransom price , or the price of redemption - or it means , the act of paying down that price ; - or else , by metonymy , it means the effect of such a payment , meaning the state produced by such a ransoming . This . effect in the case of a sinner is , a state of forgiveness , acceptance with God , and admission to heaven . In the above argument the effect of pa3ring the ransom price is confounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " redemption " means the effect , the final result of paying the price . This final result of the atonement will not derange any of the plans of God , as to his determination to /q/ exercise sovereign speciality in the application of the atonement . Our question is , was the act of paying the ransom price by Christ designed to be aTailable to all , so " that the world through him might be saved , " or only designed for a certain chosen number . We say fearlessly , that the Jinal results of the atonement will only be realized by those who receive Christ , and to whom it has been given to believe in him ; but the act of making that atonement , and the offer of - the benefits of the atonement , ore designed and purposed to be a medium of salvation to all men , without excluding one individual . If the word " redemption " be taken in the sense of " actual salvation , " then Christ 's redemption neither exceeds , nor falls short of , the Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of paying down the ransom price , or a valuable and honourable consideration , as a medium for delivering sinners , then Christ 's redemption and the Father 's election are not commensurate and of equal extent , taking " the Father 's election " as meaning the will of God revealed in the final results of the atonement . It is supposed , even by our Saviour himself , that the result will not be commensurate with the gracious design of God , and with the large aspect of the atonement . God loved the world , and gave his Son , that the world through him might be saved - but it is only whosoever believeth in him , it is he only that will answer the design , and share in the result of the atonement The atonement is a measure of /z/ government , not of private love and friendship , but of a public commonwealth . In such a public measure , the public will of the Father , as moral governor , and the public design and intent of Christ , as mediator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved , therefore Christ gave himself a ransom for all . From the divine purposes , the advocates of a limited atonement argue , that since Christ foreknew the results of the atonement , and since he foreknew who would believe in him , why should he die and lavish his blood for those who , he knew , would not believe in him . This argument is founded on three things , which are wrong , and inconsistent with moral government . It is supposed , first , that foreknowledge is the rule of Christs conduct and actions ; secondly , that to save believers was the chief end of his sufferings ; and , thirdly , that his death consisted in suffering the identical punishment due to sinners ; for it supposes , that he would not knowingly suffer the punishment of those , who , he knew , should suffer the punishment themselves . If the question be repeated , WTiy did he suffer for those , whom he knew to be sure to prove unbelievers ? The reply is , he suffered to vindicate the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to show how inexcusable they would be in their own destruction . But why should this foreknowledge be confined to th atonement pf Christ oply ? The Lord Jesu9 /q/ Christ knew that his own would receive him not , yet he came to them . He knew that the Jews would reject the overtures of his ministry , yet he said , and he said it with tears of regret , that he would oft have gathered them . He knew that many would neglect his great salvation , yet he gave himself a propitiation for the sins of the whole world . I might remark , in passing , that he would not have foreknown that any would disbelieve in him , without foreknowing that they would have the offer , the warrant , and the opportunity to believe in him , and that the ground of such an offer and warrant was his own death for them . Another argument from the character of the divine decrees to maintain particular atonement is , tliat a general atonement throws an air of uncertainty around the plans and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul of Christ . It must be remembered that we are concerned in the divine decrees , only as they are administered within the circle of moral government : and that beyond that line they are " secret things , " unrevealed , and belong to God only . Within this boundary , it should not be evaded nor blinked , that the divine plans are susceptible of failures . When God by Isaiah remonstrates with the Jewish church , and asks , " What could I have done more ? " it is implied that all the measures which had been used , had failed of their ends . It is implied in the sentiments /z/ of Jesus Christ himself , when he supposes his Father to say , " They will reverence my Son , " though after all he was slain and murdered . It therefore a morbid squeamishness that makes us afraid to avow what are daily matters of fact . This failure has taken place in creation - it as made " very good , " but now is groaning and travailing together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God has determined the bounds of men 's habitation , that they might seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him ; but they are all gone astray , every one in his own way . It takes place in the atonement ; Christ died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live to themselves , but unto him who died for them - but many deny the Lord that bought them , and renounce his reign over them . It is sometimes vaimtingly asked , " Where does the scripture speak of Christ 's death , and the ends of it , in terms of uncertainty ; or represent him as coming Short of his aim and intention in dying for sinners ? " In Heb. iv . 1 , the apostle warns some who might seem to come short of the rest for the people of God . God has no rest to offer to any sinner but through the death of Christ . To fall short of it is a possible case , and no one can fall short of a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest could not have been provided but through the death of Christ . It is a supposable case that an uncharitable Christian may " destroy him for whom Christ died , " and cause a " weak brother /q/ to perish , for whom Christ died ; " - that men may deny the Lord that bought them , and bring destruction upon themselves . I may here be interrogated , " How do you reconcile the liableness to failure in the divine measures , with the certainty that God 's counsel shall stand , and that he will do his pleasure ? " I state at once most frankly and distinctly , that I do not know how to reconcile them . I believe it is not my duty to show how to reconcile them . It is enough for me that they are not only reconcileable , but actually reconciled . I , therefore , have nothing to reconcile God has reconciled them , and worked them out in harmony . A chemist is not expected to show how two virulent poisons , such as chlorine and sodium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of mankind . To such a demand , his reply would be , God fias done it in common salt . Philosophers did not require Newton to demonstrate how two antagonist forces , the centripetal and the centrifugal , could exist in the same body at the same time . He knew that as a philosopher his work was to demonstrate theocf , not the mode ; for God himself had reconciled these different forces , and by them , had produced a system of order and beauty . The theologian ought not to be expected to show flow God 's firmness in government , and man 's abuse of firee-agency , can be reconciled . All the facts of the Bible prove that God has reconciled them , g5 // and that he works both principles so as to make the opposition and wrath of man to praise him . Even if such an argument were not valid , a belief in particular atonement does not at all remove the difficulty . A limited atonement may seem to tally with the certainty of the actual and final results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against such indisputable verities , as the universal aspect of the atonement , the sincere invitations of the gospel , and the sorer punishment of unbelievers . This difficulty can not be avoided by escaping to any other creed . It presses on the Heathen and the Mahometan , upon the Jew and the Christian . Philosophers , metaphysicians , and theologians , have endeavoured with Herculean labours , to push this subject up to light and distinctness ; but after all , like the stone of Sisyphus , it rolls back to its own awful mystery and dread profundity . There never was a creed on the face of the earth , and there exists not a creed , that accoimts for the difficulty . Yes , there is oncy but it is a creed so severely simple , so unsophisticated with metaphysical reasonings , and so unamalgamating with theological systems , that few deign to take it up ; it is the creed of Jesus Christ , " Even so . Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight , " - the creed that " judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings , /z/ By " all the works of Grod " I understand , all the productions of God , called the works of his hands , and which the Psalmist calls " all the places of his dominions , ' and which the New Testament calls " heavenly places , " that is , the whole universe , with all its intelligences and orders , ranks and dignities . The New Testament reveals very clearly that the great atonement of the Son of God is related to other worlds in the divine empire , as well as to our world . It is , therefore , necessary to a full and enlarged consideration of the extent of the atonement , to examine and survey it in this aspect and relation . I feel happy to be able to introduce my sentiments upon the aspect of the atonement on the universe in the following passage , of great beauty and sublimity , from Lord Bacon . " I believe that God is so holy , pure , and jealous , that it is impossible for him to be pleased in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that neither angels , man , nor world would stand , or can stand , one moment in his eye , without his beholding the same in the face of A MEDIATOR . And therefore I believe that before /z/ him , with whom all things are present , the Lamb of God was slain before all worlds ; but that out of his eternal and infinite goodness and love , purposing to become a Creator , and to communicate to his creatures , he ordained in his eternal counsel , that one person of the Godhead should be united to one nature , and to one particular of his creatures , so that in the person of the Mediator , the true ladder may be fixed , whereby God might descend to his creatures , and his creatures might ascend to God ; so that God by the reconcilement of the Mediator turning his coimtenance towards his creatures ( though not in equal light and degree ) made way unto the dispensation of his most holy and sacred will ; whereby some of his creatures might stand and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others might fall and not be restored to their estate , but yet remain in being , though under wrath and corruption : all with respect TO THE Mediator , which is the great mystery and PERFECT CENTRE OF ALL God 's WAYS with his creatures , and to which all his other works and WONDERS do but serve and refer . " * /z/ The Constitution of the Universe Mediatorial . The whole universe is represented in the word of God , as a beautiful and glorious system , adjusted &#9830; Bacon 's Works , voJ. iv . p. 413. /q/ around the mediation of Jesus Christ , in which he should be felt as the central orb , to attract all its portions into union and harmony , and to maintain all its dependencies in beauty and order . God by his gospel has made known to us " the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure , which he hath purposed in himself , that in the dispensation of the fulness of times , he might gather together in one all things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on earth , even in him , " Eph. i. 9 , 10 . To apply this language to the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles only , is to render the passage turgid and inane . As if designedly to guard against such an interpretation of his meaning , the apostle in his letter to the Colossians , written at the same time as that to the Ephesians , distinctly enumerates the intelligences of the universe* as intended by " the all things gathered together in Christ . " " By him ( the Mediator ) were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones or dominions , or principalities or powers ; all things were created by him and for him ; and he is before all things , and hy him all things consist . And he is the head of the body , the church , the beginning , the first-born from the dead , that in all things he might have pre-eminence . For it pleased the Father that in him should all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile ( or to harmonize ) all things unto himself , whether they /z/ be fliings in earth or things in heaven . " Col. i. /z/ It is impossible I think , to read these passages without a vivid impression of the wide and expanded views , which the apostle had of the atonement , as sustaining a high and intimate relation to all the length and the breadth , the height and the depth of the universe of God . It is this relation of the atonement to the universe that gives life and glory to the prophet Malachi 's enraptured view of " the Sim of Righteousness . " The more I consider this vision of the last seer of Israel , the more I am entranced with his splendid emblem of the high dignity , and of the diffusive influence of the Lord from heaven . This symbol , though the most noble and brilliant which the creation could supply , can but very dimly image forth the grandeur and beauty of " the Sun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is viewed , not merely as a luminary suspended in the heavens , but as the centre of a system of worlds , and the source of light and heat , of motion and harmony to them all . By the light of revealed theology , also , we are taught to view the great atoning Mediator , not only as a " light to lighten the Gentiles , " but as the centre of an immense moral system , composed of all existences , constitutions , and dispensations , shedding his beams to bless dependent worlds , and bathing the whole in the effulgence of his loveliness and glory . /q/ This imagery of Malachi teaches us that God contemplated a beautiful and immense system of good dispensations , called here a system of Righteousness : that in the midst of this system of Righteousness as the central orb , he placed the Lord Jesus Christ ; and that the revolutions of this system have a most benign and " healing " aspect on the interests of our world . A further enlargement on this topic will not be deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapter on the purposes of God , I have explained in what manner I regard the constitution of the universe as partaking of a mediatorial arrangement . Consecutiveness of plan , seemed to me to require a distinct , though a brief , notice of this subject here . Only one more illustration will be introduced to explain the connexion that exists between the atonement and the universe . The apostle Paul speaks of the universe as a commonwealth , or family receiving its designation , constitution , and happiness from the Lord Jesus Christ , who is felt and owned every where as the head of power and of influence . " Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named . " This public commonwealth or family consists of " an innumerable company of angels , the general assembly and church of the first-born , which are written in heaven ; God the Judge of all ; the spirits of just men made perfect ; Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant " - all in intimate connexion with " the /z/ blood that speaketh better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii . 15- Heb. xii . 22 - 24. /z/ The Atonement a subject of interest and henejit to the intelligences of the Universe , The scriptures represent the intelligences of the universe as having been informed of the atonement , as having been witnesses and spectators of the whole amazing transaction . They take a high interest in its administration , and are greatly benefited by its provisions . The blessed God regards the expedient of the atonement as so fit a medium for giving a full display of the divine glories , that he reveals it to be the ground for creating the universe . He " created all things by Jesus Christ , to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known , by means of the church , the manifold wisdom of God , according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord , " Eph. iii . 9 - 11 . The whole immense progress of the Mediator 's career , from the throne to the manger , and from the manger to the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators of his public entrance into heaven after finishing his atoning work : and they were witnesses of his splendid triumph over spiritual wickedness in high places , when ' ' having spoiled /q/ principalities and powers , he made a shmv of them openly , triumphing over them " in his cross and atonement . These intelligences are now daily made acquainted vnih all the instances of conversion from sin to holiness among the sinners of our world . And they are infoimed of the progressive improvement which believers make in Christian character , and of the maturity of the Christian graces which has ripened them for " Abraham 's bosom . " The apostle Pet says , that angels generally ( not the angels ) , meaning all heavenly intelligences , take a high interest , complacency and delight in these subjects . He enumerates the salvation of man , the enquiries of the prophets , the sovereign grace of God , the work of the Spirit , the sufferings and glory of Christ , and the preaching of the gospel , as the " things which angels desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intense energy and keen relish , with which they enquire into the doctrine of the atonement , and its relations . " Likewise there &joy; in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth . " As intelligent , holy , and benevolent beings , the atonement in all its designs and influences must be a source of pleasure to them . As intelligent beings they take an interest in the atonement , from the circumstance that it is a measure in which the Father of wisdom and mind is " well pleased , " and over which he " joys with singing . " It is a subject , in grandeur laS ITS RELATION TO ALL and immensity , suited to the keen penetration , and the large comprehension of their glorious minds . The atonement as the ground and medium of an immense accession of good to the universe , can not fail to interest and delight their minds , as amiable and benevolent beings . Neither of these aspects of the atonement , however , would be desirable to their minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are holy themselves , they rejoice in the atoniement on account of the demonstration which it gives of the evil of sin ; on account of its public expression of the beauty of divine holiness ; on account of its vicarious virtue to expiate and sanctify guilty and sinful men ; and on account of its practical tendency to deter accountable beings from sin , and to melt the hard heart to repentance . This difiuses " joy in their presence , " because that by repentance , through the atonement , the sinner is coming back into order and harmony with the universe ; that his repentance is reasonable , and due to the divine government ; that by this process he is introduced into the circle of happiness and fellowship with God ; and that eventually , he is to join them for ever as an associate in glory , and sharer in their joy . If there be such " joy " among these intelligences now in their enquiries into this stupendous measure ; if they are so delighted and entranced with its present unfoldings , developements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of its splendid consummation . The apostle John represents /q/ them , as in that auspicious period , thrilling the vast universe with their rapturous songs . " And I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne , and the beasts and the elders ; and the ilumber of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands , sa3dng with a loud voice . Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing . And every creature which is in heaven , and on earth , and under the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I saying . Blessing , and honour , and glory , and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever . And the four beasts said , Amen . " . Rev. V. 11 - 14 . The information which is communicated to the intelligences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , and the church , is intended to affect themselves , and to have a practical influence upon them as subjects of the divine government . Their great minds are capable of enlargement by exercise , of advancement in knowledge , and of growth in their love and admiration of the character of God . - Their study of the atonement is calculated to strengthen their confidence in the righteousness and benevolence of the divine government , and to give them a clear insight into the heinous enormity of revolt and transgression . When they see the tremendous evil of sin , set forth /z/ in the sufferings of the Mediator , they perceive the justice of the eternal destruction for sin of their former compeers in glory , and feel high gratitude to sovereign grace for their own preservation in bUss . In their contemplation of what the mediatorial President has done for the universe , they feel themselves united more nearly and dearly to the system of which He is the centre and the glory ; and they feel prompt and unshrinking to imdertake any service , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information which they receive from the atonement , they become more aware and sensible of the value and worth of their own dignity and glory . Gabriel never knew the worth of his harp and crown , till he saw at what immense cost , the lost harp and crown of a sinner were ransomed among the scenes of Gethsemane and Calvary . The Intelligences of other worlds are positively benefited by sharing in the blessings of the atonement He that descended , is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things . ' ' In this passage the blessed Kedeemer may be considered either as taking his place , as the central Sun , in the midst of a vast system of heavenly places , to every part of which he diffused light and he.at ; or as , in his ascending progression , passing on his way to his throne , worlds upon worlds , and systems upon Systems , strown amid " all ' heavens , " scattering his blessings all around , and sanctifying and baptizing every world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he " fill all things in all heavens " but with the blessings of his mediatorial grace ? It is to this the apostle refers when he speaks of " spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ . " This proves that the inhabitants of " heavenly places , " the intelligences who occupy all the celestial orbs of the universe , actually have " spiritual blessings , " and that these " spiritual blessings " ate enjoyed " in " and through Christ . It is not to be supposed that these intelligences are benefited in the atonement , as it is a ransom for redemption for sin , for they never needed a deliverance : but they are benefited by it , as it is the medium of all divine communications . God has no medium , no way of blessing any being , in any world , but the mediation of Christ ; and the whole circle of his mediation is around his atonement . The benefits which they have derived through the provision of atonement are such as are fitted to their uatiu-e , rank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Maker who has made an approach to them in a created nature . They have a more enlarged acquaintance with the character of God in the various evolutions , in the full and free exercise , and , in the beautiful and glorious harmony , of all the divine perfections . The application of their energies , and the employment of their ministry have been chiefly directed to the execution of the messages of mercy and grace . As social and bene- /z/ volent beings they must regard it as a benefit to be having accessions of ransomed and holy companionSy who will partake with them in the honours of the " heavenly places , " and who will unite with them in the services and praises of God and of the Lamb for ever and ever . /z/ Christ the President of the Universe on the ground of his Atonement . The scriptures speak of Jesus Christ as being the president of all the ranks and grades of being in the universe . " God has set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places y far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but in that which is to come ; and hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church , which is the fulness of him that filleth all in aU . " We have such an High Priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens " a minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched , and not man . " Heb. viii . 2 . Dr John Owen has laboured much to show that the sanctuary and the true tabernacle " here , mean the human nature of the Son of God : but the whole context , and the train of argument , make it evident that the apostle is speaking of the pUice into which Jesus has entered , that is , " into /q/ the heavenly places , " or " heaven itself . " In the " heavenly places , " Christ sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * - the official organ , " qvi publicis officiis prBesty ' * - the president over all the employments , offices , and services of all the heavenly intelligences . It is not , I conceive , the philosophy of Newton only , that teaches us the doctrine of plurality of worlds ; the illustrious President of the universe himself has said , " In my Father 's house are many mansions . " The " Father 's house " is the vast temple of the universe , and the " many mansions , " are the innumerable stars , and suns , and systems which compose its apartments . These stars are not mansions of untenanted glory , nor provinces of luxuriant wastes in the divine empire . They are " heavenly places in which are thrones , and principalities , and powers , and dominions , to which the manifested wisdom of God is made known by the church . This scriptural enumeration of ranks and dignities , is not a series of high-sounding and pompous titles without meaning and without verity . It is a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . In our speck of world we see every speck of matter teeming with life , activity , and employment . The microscope has its Hades of living existences , as well as the telescope . It is therefore unnatural , unreasonable , and unscriptural to regard " all heavens " as Ernesti , and Dr. Pye Smith , + Professor Moses Stuart . /z/ solitudes of majesty , or deserts of beauty . On the supposition that all these gradations and orders of intelligences are in active employments , and in useful service , it enlarges our conceptions of the official dignity and glory of Jesus Christ , to see him " wear the crown as Lord of all , " the " head of all principality and power , " in all things having the pre-eminence , as President over all . The state of the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven is , indeed , one of transcendent glory and power , but it is also a state of office , of mediatorial care and authority , and of plenipotentiary administration over the entire universe . He directs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . It is he who gives to every one his work , and allots to every one his sphere of employment . " In his name " every knee bows , of things in heaven and things in earth . He has a name " above " every name in heavenly authority and influence . It is by him that all things consist , whether they be principalities , or powers , or thrones , or dominions . What keeps all these provinces , with their innumerable intelligences , in order , at their proper work , without clashing , and without anarchy ? It is mediatorial power ; it is the influence of the atonement . It is " by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven . " All these services are rendered acceptable to God by the merits of the Mediator . Christ is as a Lamb slain in the midst of the throne ; and all the services /q/ that come to the throne have a reference to the Lamb of atonement that is in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ser'ices of all the subjects of the empire publicly to his heavenly Father . In his oflScial character Christ is the Receiver General of all the revenues of God 's immense empire , and as the mediatorial President he presents them to God . He entered heaven , not to receive glory only , but to do temple-work . It is his work , as the public officer of the moral commonwealth , to present to God all the revenue of service and glory received from all the provinces , and gathered together under his mediatorial inspection . In this office and work , he is the representative of the universe , but more especially of the church , transacting publicly all its affairs with God . As the official President , it is his temple-work to recompense all these services by his sovereign grace . He has ascended far above all heavens , that he might fill all things , and bring all worlds into the light and the " joy of the Lord . " In the day when the mediatorial administration of things shall come to its splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be marshalled from their heavenly places , and gathered before him , as the great President ; they shall receive their crowns from the hand that was nailed to the cross ; and in love and homage , they will cast their diadems at his feet , and ascribe all their magnificent rewards to his sovereign bounty and love . /z/ This mediatorial presidency of Christ shows the connexion of his atonement with all the works of God . His atonement is the ground of his government over the universe . The mediatorial glory of Christ is an official glory that followed his sufferings . His crown is linked to his cross . He became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross ; wherefore God highly exalted him to the Universal Presidency . Christ is not head over all things irrespectively of his atonement , any more than he can be Head of the church irrespectively of it . The Son of God has no mediatorial power in heaven or earth , but what arises from his atonement , and is connected with it . The atonement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other worlds , as is evident by the conveyance of the blessings of other worlds to ours . Our world , by sin , had attempted to snap the connexion between it and the centre and source of all blessing , but mediatorial influences have preserved it . Now God blesses our world with the spiritual blessings of the heavenly places , and he blesses us and them , only " in Christ . " The atonement is the ground and medium of the ministry of angels in 5ur world . As revolters we had every thing to dread from the employment of their agency , as subjects of high and unbending loyalty to the offended king . In the mediation of Christ they and we are become the subjects of the same presidency ; they are the friends of man , and ministering spirits /q/ to the saints . They defend us from our spiritual adversaries , and execute the " charge " given to them concerning us through life . They rejoice in our accession to the church of Christ , and assembly of the first-born ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanctified spirits safe home to glory . The actual admission of men into the " heavenly places , " shows that the atonement is connected with " all heavens . " It shows that the keys which open the door to them are in benevolent hands . Many myriads of sinners have already passed thither from the land of great tribulation - but they all arrived safely , only " through the blood of the Lamb . " Heaven would not have been open and accessible to sinners , had not Christ himself publicly entered it in his official character , and solemnly set it apart , to be the home of believers , by the influences of his own atonement . " By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us ; " and all the heavenly things themselves were purified , consecrated , and set apart , by his better sacrifice , so as to be accessible and approachable , and heritable by sinners of our world . /z/ The Extent of the Atonement illustrated hy its Relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in its design , and aspect , particular in its blessings and influences , and commercial in its principles , paying quid pro h2 /z/ quOj it seems to me impossible to account for the relation , which the scriptures declare to exist , between the atonement and all the works of God . A particular atonement supposes that Jesus Christ suffered the punishment due to the elect , and to them only ; and that the blessings of the 3 , tonement shall be shared by them , and by them only . On this hypothesis the good which angels have received is left entirely unaccounted for , except , perhaps , it be thought a mere sovereign largess : and the good which the wicked enjoy in this world is accounted for , partly as " uncovenanted mercies " scattered among them , and partly as a bonus granted to them for the sake of the church . If God can give some mercies uncovenanted , why not give every mercy ? " Uncovenanted , " means , irrespective of the promises connected with the atonement . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must not Cain have known that all the good which he enjoyed was connected with the promise of the Seed of the woman ? If God could honoiu-ably give any mercy without the covenanted atonement , he might give every mercy . The conclusion is unassailable , that if God could give any and every mercy irrespective of atonement , the death of Christ was unnecessary . When it is said that the wicked receive blessings for the sake of the church , the phraseology does not mean that the church is the meritorious cause of those blessings , but it is meant that these blessings are conferred upon others , /q/ for the purpose- of benefiting the church . The question , " how the ungodly come by these blessings ? " is left untouched by such a phrase . The blessings of the atonement can not reach where its relations do not extend ; and in whatever place , and in whatever world we find the blessings of the atonement , our conclusion is soimd , that the designs and the influences of the death of Christ reached there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less liberally scattered every where in our world - yea , we find these blessings among principalities and provinces in " heavenly places . " The supposition that these blessings reached the heavenly places by accident , or at random without any design or intent , is unreasonable , and unscriptural . Wherever , in the physical universe , we detect the influences of gravitation , we never suspect that those influences came there by some arbitrariness imaccountable , or by some endowment unintended . We never suspect this , simply , because we have no preconceived physical system to render the suspicion necessary . In discussing the atonement , then , we are not a &aid; of embracing a favourite maxim of the advocates of limited redemption , that the death of Christ and its benefits are of the same extent . We find these benefits of the death of the Son of God in " all places of his dominions , " and we can not be wrong in believing , that they were intended to be so . I. A limited atonement for a certain chosen num- /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our rebellious world , unaccounted for . It may account for the angels being ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation ; but the whole history of God* s works shows , that the ministry of angels has had a benevolent influence upon many who have not proved heirs of salvation . The argument of our Saviour about little children supposes that all of them have a share in the good services of angels . No one will say , either that the holy angels would give their services to such children , or that such children could become interested in such high advantages , irrespectively of the mediation and atonement of Christ . This ministry of angels has not been confined to mankind in their childhood ; it has followed them when grown up , and even when living in sin . As instances of this benevolent ministry towards mankind as sinners , I might mention the case of Hagar and her son , the case of Balaam , the case of the angel who led the contumacious Israelites through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the case of the angel who descended to the pool of Bethesda* to trouble the waters for the healing of the bodily disorders of men . The ministry of angels for the benefit of man is in every case an effect of the mediation and atonement The critical disputes about the text of this narrative do not at all affect the probability of the benevolent aspect of the ministry of angels towards sinners . /z/ of Christ , for angels and principalities are made subject to his authority . They go at his bidding in every employment . If Christ had purchased their ministry for a certain number only , how have these intelligences of distant worlds taken such interests in aU the children of our world ? Is this an uncovenanted employment ? and do even they do works of supererogation ? Will these holy beings squander upon others a ministry so dearly purchased only for some ? II . An atonement limited in its aspect and design , is opposed to the report which the intelligences of other worlds have given to us of their views of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds . " And the angel said unto them , Fear not ; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people : for unto you is bom this day in the city of David , a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord . " " And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God , and saying , Glory to God in the highest , on earth peace , good will towards men ? ' ' When Peter remarked that angels desire to look into the administrations of the atonement , it should be remembered that these intelligences had been enquiring into this subject for above four thousand years . Now let it be considered , that these high and noble existences are possessed of powers remarkable for comprehension and accuracy ; that they applied those powers to a given subject for so many ages ; that they studied this subject in all the information /z/ and light of knowledge in heaven : that their application to this subject did not consist in intellectual speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time for furthering the great arrangements of this subject ; and that on their visit to the shepherds , they were commissioned to give a correct announcement of this provision of mercy . These intelligences to consider this scheme of mercy as embracing the " earth , " " men , " and " all people . " The tidings of the angel are not " good " to all people , imless Christ the Lord be a Saviour unto all people . The good tidings that Christ the Lord was a Saviour unto all people , could not be " a great joy " unto them , imless he were so , truly and sincerely , the expression of " good-will towards men . " If these well-informed spirits after four thousand years ' application of their great minds to this subject , and actual employment in some of its plans , had understood the atonement to be a measure limited to a certain number , they would not have announced it in such universal terms , and with such an unlimited aspect . When the angel said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be to all people , he understood it to " he " so in the piurpose of God , and the design of the atonement . " This view of the angel 's sentiments on the extent of the provision of mercy , is not at all destroyed by the testimony given to Mary , that she should call her son " Jesus , because he should save his people from /q/ their sins . " It is utterly incapable of proof that the angel meant by " his people , " the objects of sovereign speciality and election , " His people " in this passage mean , the people of the Jews , who were , particularly even at this time , the people of his fold : to them he came - but his own peaplel received him not . This sense of the phrase is fully justified by Luke , i. 68 , 77. ; vii . 16 . Supposing , however , that the angel intended by " his people " the objects of gracious speciality , this passage would not decide against the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would refer to the actual results only of the atonement , and not at all to its general design and tendency . III . Limited views of the atonement are not compatible with the nature of the joy which angels have in the conversion of sinners . As the conversion of sinners is a pleasure and a joy to them , the inference is fair , that the unconverted state of sinners , is a matter that is displeasing and grievous to them , as much as any thing can be displeasing , and grievous to glorious and happy minds . The argument which the apostle Paul employs with the Corinthians in behalf of purity and propriety in worship , is the supposition that an improper spirit and behaviour is displeasing to the angels who commune with their assemblies . The sinner who grieves the Holy Spirit , may be well supposed to grieve holy angels . If however these great and holy intelligences see or know that the h5 /z/ atonement of Christ was only designed for a certain number , which , as they become converted , actually supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what principle can the unconverted state of the others be a grief to them ? Their grief can not arise from the exclusion of these unconverted , from the proposals and offers of the atonement - much less from any impious apprehensions that these offers to sinners were not sincere . It must be left to the advocates of limited atonement to account for this supposed grief of angels upon any other principle than that of their regarding the sinner as acting a perverse , undutiful , and wicked part , in rejecting the clear and open overtures of the atonement . These angels can not regard the rejection of the atonement , and of the gospel offers , wrong and wicked in the sinner , if the atonement was never designed for him , and if the offers made to him were not really meant and intended for his adoption . IV . An atonement limited to a certain number is inconsistent with the argument , which is founded on the " desire of angels to look into these things , " to press upon sinners the indispensable duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heinous guilt of neglecting it . Hear Dr. Dwight 's statement. * " Were the gospel as untrue as infidels assert , they would be no gainers . If it should be true , what will become of them . What must be the feelings of an infidel on a * Dwight 's Sermons , vol. ii . p. 440. /q/ dying bed , if he is then in possession of sober thought , and solemnly remembers his contempt for the Saviour , and his rejection of the offers of life ? With what emotions must he enter eternity ? " This argument is sound and sober : and it agrees well with Dr. Dwight 's view of the death of Christ . On the principles of a limited and partial atonement , this argument can not fee pressed , on any sinner who may be supposed to be out of the pale of salvation . It is utterly unworthy of the gospel to recommend to such an excluded sinner , the examination of the atonement , as a man of taste , and to tell him that the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good intellectual exercise for him , and would materially improve the benevolence of his character . Yet the advocates of exclusive salvation can not consistently recommend such a sinner to enquire Dto the claims of the atonement of Christ in any other way . V. A limited atonement is inconsistent with the exhortations and encouragements , which the scriptures give to sinners universally , to direct their attention and pursuit to the happiness and glory of the heavenly places . Sinners of all sorts are directed and recommended to lay up for themselves treasures in heaven , to seek , and to set their affections upon , the things that are above , where Christ sitteth at the right had of the Father . Now all the blessings and the good things in heaven are purified , consecrated , and /z/ set apart by the " better sacrifice of Christ . " If they are , therefore , purified and selected for a certain nmnber , how can the minister of the gospel invite all men to seek what was never intended for them ? There is not a blessing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * that is not hallowed and puri- * I can not deny myself the pleasure of introducing here a passage from * ' Bishop Porteus* Sermons ; " its pertinency and eloquence will apologize for its length . It is , I believe , generally taken for granted , that it was for the human race alone that Christ suffered and died ; and we are then asked , with an air of triumph , whether it is conceivable , or in any degree credible , that the eternal Son of God should submit to so much indignity , and so much misery for the fallen , the wicked , the wretched inhabitants of this small globe of earth , which is as a grain of sand to a mountain ; a mere speck in the universe when compared with that immensity of worlds and system of worlds , which the sagacity of a great modern astronomer has discovered in the boundless regions of space . * ' But on what ground is it concluded that the benefits of Christ 's death extend no further than to ourselves ? As well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmament merely to illuminate and warm this earth that we inhabit . To the vulgar and illiterate this actually appears to be the case . But philosophy teaches us better things : it enlarges our contracted views of the divine beneficence , and brings us acquainted with other planets , and dther worlds , which share with us the cheering influence , and the vivifying warmth of that glorious luminary . Is it not then a fair analogy to conclude that the great spiritual light of the world , the fountain of life and health , and joy to the soul , does not scatter his blessings over the creation with a more sparing hand ? And that the Sun of righteousness rises with healing in its wings to other orders of beings besides ourfied /q/ by the blood of atonement . It is , therefore , impossible to direct sinners to seek any heavenly selves Nor does this conclusion rest on analogy alone .

' * From intimations such as these , it is highly probable , that in the great work of redemption , as well as of creation , there is a vast stupendous plan of wisdom , of which we can not at present so much as conceive the whole compass and extent ; and if we could assist and improve the mental , as we can the corporal sight ; if we could magnify and bring nearer to us , by the help of instruments , the great component parts of the spiritual , as we do the vast bodies of the material world , there can be no doubt , that the resemblance and analogy would hold between them in this , as it does in many other well-known instances ; and that a scene of wonders would burst in upon us from the one , at least equal , if not superior , to those which the united powers of astronomy and optics disclose to us in the other . * ' If this train of reasoning be just , ( and who is there that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not so ? ) if the redemption wrought by Christ extends to other worlds , perhaps many others besides our own ; if its virtues penetrate into heaven itself : if it gather together **all things " in Christ , who will then say that the dignity of the Agent was disproportioned to magnitude of the work ? And that it was not a scene sufficiently splendid for the Son of God himself to appear upon , and to display the riches of his love , not only to the race of man , but to many other orders of intelligent beings ? Upon the whole , it is certainly unpardonable in such a creature as man , to judge the system of our redemption , from that very small part of it which he now sees , to reason , as if we were the only persons concerned in it ; and on that ground to raise cavils and objections . " - Bp . Porteus ' Sermons , vol , ii . ser. 3. /z/ favour , but what is under the influence of the atonement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that Jesus Christ is there : but this argument would be of no force , if the sinner could not avail himself of Christ 's intercession . k /z/ The Elements of Moral Government , Divine moral govemment is that control which the blessed God exercises over the minds of accountable beings by reasoning with them , that is , by exhibiting motives and inducements addressed to their hopes and fears . God governs every thing according to its nature . He manages the sea , and regulates the planets by physical force , and the various tribes of animals , by the laws of instinct . Every one knows that the waves of the sea , the revolutions of the planets , and the migrations of birds , are not to be regulated by reasoning with them . But man can be governed and controlled by reasoning with him ; and his conduct can be regulated by exhibiting to him sufficient motives and inducement . We keep our oxen to the plough by physical force , but we keep the ploughman at his work by moral govemment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be /z/ SO . He is not chained , nor bound , nor yoked , but acts freely . Physical force can never become an element of moral government . In proportion as force enters it , it ceases to be a moral government . The more freedom there is in a government , the more purely moral is it . Such a freedom is not the freedom of licentiousness and anarchy , for these encroach always on the freedom and liberty of some of the subjects . It is by reasoning , and presenting motives , that we govern our own minds and influence the minds of other men : and it is by the same means that God governs us . If minds become so debased and obstinate as to refuse or to dislike such a control in a community , then coercion will be employed to subdue them . The slaves at the galleys are governed by coercion , and criminals are drawn to the place of execution by force ; but this in a just and wise government , only befalls those who have voluntarily rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable being , and , as such , is a member of the great moral commonwealth of the universe . That commonwealth supplies him with a law as the rule of his conduct towards the whole universe . This law surrounds him with rich and copious exhibitions of reasons , motives , and allurements , to lead him to the formation of a good character , and to the choice of a wise course of conduct . It forces him to nothing , but leaves him /q/ perfectly free . In this government man , as a reasonable being , is free from every thing except from the moral obligation to do good , and from accountableness to his Ruler if he do wrong . Law must indispensably have the sanctions of rewards and penalties . Without these a law would be a mere advice , a recommendation only , and of no authority . The penalties of the moral law are sufferings and pains . In this enquiry it is no work of ours ' to account for the reasons why sufferings were annexed as penalties to the moral law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destruction are , in the physical laws , the penalties for falling down a precipice , &c.; We can only say , that such is the moral constitution of which we are members ; and such , do providence , conscience , and the scriptures , declare it to be . By doing wrong , or sinning , man becomes liable to this penalty . Nothing else but sin will bring us into contact with sufferings as the penalty of the law . No perfection of God , no decree of God , no measure or work of God , no malice of enemies - in short , nothing in the whole universe will bring us within the reach of the punishments of the law , but sin . The sufferings of a sinner , of one who transgresses the law , are right and good for the ends of the government of which we are members . The penalty is inflicted , not for the sake of putting the delinquent to pain only , , nor of gratifying the private revenge of a ruler , but to secure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These ends are to prevent others from transgressing ; by giving a decided and clear demonstration of the dignity of the law , and a tangible proof of the evil of crime . If a member , then , break the rule of the great moral constitution , it is right that he should suffer , that the evil of his suffering might restrain the evil of transgressing . As far as sufferings answer these public ends , they are right and useful ; but when they fall short of these ends , or in severity of infliction go beyond these ends , then , they are only natural evils added to moral ones , without removing them . It is due to the character of the governor , as the public organ of a commonwealth , and due to the welfare of the government , that the penalty should be executed on the offender . It is right and good that the man who injures you should feel an inconvenience , a pain , a suffering for it , - not to gratify your spleen and revenge , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve of the penalty when it is executed on others for iniuring you ; if you disapprove of it , when inflicted upon yourself for injuring others , it is because you are selfish , and feel no concern for the public good . Sinners have transgressed the law , have wronged God , have spoiled his works , and have injured his liege subjects , therefore , for the public good , they deserve to suffer as transgressors. /q/ /z/ The Penalties of Moral Government ad/ministered on the Principle of Public Justice . Obedience is the first thing which man as a member of government owes to Go 'd . If man gives not obedience to the law , then punishment is due from him for the ends of good government . In the classical writers of Greece and Rome , the suppliciurrC or punishment is always represented as being given or paid by the offender , and as what was due from him to the government . And this language expresses the reality of the case of an offender in moral government . The promotion of the public good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not promote it in this way , then it is due from him to promote it by sustaining the penalty of the law . The question now occurs , " Upon what principle shall this penalty be administered ? " Private individuals will answer this according to their oti feelings and interests . Some will say , " Let power be employed to inflict a severe chastisement and intense sufferings for the crime . " Others wiU say , " Let mercy be exercised to administer the penalty gentiy and sparingly . " Neither of these principles alone will administer the penalty safely and honourably for the ends of government . All honest subjects will say , " Let justice administer it , whatever be the conse- /z/ consequences . " All may assent to this , but the difficulty of administering the penalty is not removed . Another question occurs , " Upon what modification or principle of justice would you execute the penalty ? " Justice takes many modifications . There is commutative justice , which gives to another an equivalent for value received . Divine moral government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is perfectly inconsistent with an administration on moral principles , to deal out a mathematical measurement of punishment for an arithmetical amount of injury and wrong . For though the punishment of the sinner will be no greater than deserved , yet aU his sufferings and pains will never be an equivalent , in commercial or commutative justice , for the honour and the homage of which God has been wronged . Commercial or commutative justice can not be exercised here , for the government is a moral one . No moral quality or action can be recompensed with a commercial payment . It were absurd to suppose a father , a husband , or a master , governing his family on the commercial principle of paying so much , in money or goods , for so much love and obedience . The execution of the penalty on the principle of distributive justice , is inconsistent with the present administration of moral government , as it is a state of probation and trial . Such an execution would render our present state not a state of trial . If every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his character , men would no longer be in a state of probation , to try whether they would swear and keep the sabbath or not . If men would be always seeing the immediate and summary consequences of sin , they would not be proved any longer as to what was in their heart , whether they would keep His commandments or no . They would be walking by dght and not by faith . The exercise of what is called vindictive justice in the administration of the law , ill accords with the present connexion between God and man . There is so much goodness , and mercy , and clemency , and bounty , in our present circumstances , as to assure us that God has thoughts of peace and not of evil concerning us . Even the evils and the inflictions of the present state are not vindictive , but are evidently under the control and direction of a benevolent principle . If the divine justice be regarded as commutative , or distributive , or vindictive , we must suppose that the execution of the penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably be inflicted . Besides , in such a necessary execution , there is also implied a necessary and inflexible adherence to the stiict letter and form of the law , so that the Public Ruler can not inflict less punishment than was threatened , nor confer more favour than was promised , without violating the constitution . Then , we must recur to our former question - " Upon what principle shall this penalty of the law be administered. ? " I answer , upon the principle of /z/ Public justice is that justice which a government exercises , to preserve the public good , and the public honour of the whole community . In human governments the chief magistrate has a power of suspending penalties , and of dispensing favours , provided he does not exercise such a prerogative to the detriment of the public good . Public justice is related to civil good , as distributive justice is related to personal good . If the penalty be executed , public justice provides that it shall be executed only for the public ends of government , and not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice provides that the suspension or remission shall not be detrimental to the public good ; . it provides that the ends of government shall be as fully secured by the suspension as by the execution . On the principle of distributive justice , Junius Brutus delivered his two offending sons to the lictors , and said , " Execute the law upon them . " On the principle of public justice , Zaleucus spared his offending son from blindness , by consenting to suffer the loss of an eye himself . The ends of good government were as effectually secured by the public justice of Zaleucus , as by the distributive justice of Brutus . The tendency in either administration to produce salutary impressions on the subjects , is decidedly in favour of that of public justice. * &#9830; The author may be allowed here to announce that he has been for some years employed on a work which he intends at , some future opportunity to bring to the press , /q/ /z/ The suspension of the Penalty on honourable grounds consistent with Public Justice , If the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , act beside the letter of the law , yet he can not be said to be unjust , while his measures subserve the general design of the law , and answer to the spirit of the constitution . Suppose one of a gang of robbers to turn king 's evidence . Distributive justice would require that the penalty of death be inflicted upon him as " particeps criminis ' * and the letter of the law would demand his execution . In such a case the chief magistrate thinks that he will promote the ends of justice , and secure the public good , better by suspending the merited punishment , than by inflicting it ; and no honest subject in the kingdom will think him guilty of injustice . In civil governments , we are every day presented with instances of the suspension of punishment , when it can be done without injury to the public good . A thief is condemned to sufier the punishment of death , but this punishment is suspended , and transportation for life is substituted instead of it . In either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should no longer wrong honest subjects . The providential goremment which God exercises over the affairs of this world , shows that threatenings can be honourably suspended when the ends of good government can be secured by it . The case of Nineveh is in point . The end of divine government , in the threatenings denoimced by Jonah was the reformation of the people . This end was secured without an infliction of the penalty , consequently , no one but Jonah has ever thought the suspension or remission of the punishment wrong . That it is a possible case that a punishment may be suspended , when the ends of government can be otherwise secured , is evident from the whole history of the forbearance and long-suffering of God . The threatened inflictions are long delayed , many serious warnings are given of the approach of judgments - when judgments come , they are not inflicted so severely as was threatened ; and their execution takes place gradually , as if God were reluctant to inflict them , and as if he were waiting every moment for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the ends of government , is much greater in the estimation of God , than to execute a threatening ; and that his denunciations can be honourably withdrawn , when their public ends are secured . It has pleased God to give us a specimen of his moral government over the universe in the theocracy which he exercised over the Israelites . In the annals /q/ of the theocracy , suspensions and remissions of threatened punishments are facts of very frequent occurrence . Indeed the whole of this divine polity was a system of suspensions , foimded upon the substitution of sacrifices , as public expedients and honourable grounds for the non-infliction of threatenings and penalties . Since God in this peculiar polity has clearly shown that he can on honourable grounds suspend a threatened judgment , without being deemed unjust , he has exhibited to us the exercise of a principle , which is capable of indefinite application to the whole sway of his moral government , and which has actually left well-defined and indelible traces of its operation in the administration of divine providence . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suspending a threatening , there is one fact y that in the history of sinners is boldly prominent , and is presenting itself at every turn : it is the fact that the original penalty threatened to our first parents has been actually suspended . Had it been literally executed , there would have been no human race now existing . The penalty threatened to Adam was , " in the day thou eatest thereof , dying thou shalt die . " Adam did eat of the forbidden tree ; he was spared , he did not die , his penalty was suspended , his punishment was remitted . Was such a suspension just ? On what principle can it be justified ? It was suspended on the principle of public justice , which made honourable provisions , that the /z/ spirit of the divine constitution should be presented without adhering to the letter of it . /z/ TIte Death of Christ an honourable ground for remitting Punishment , I. The atonement of Christ is a distinct and public recogtion of the truth and justice of the sinner 's liableness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , in Col. ii . 14 , represents the influence of the death of Christ as paying a debt or cancelling a bond . The chirograph , or bond , means the power of the law to condemn a sinner , that is , our obligation and liableness to suffer the penalty threatenied by the law for sins . The sinner owes to the public government the suffering of the punishment . It is this due , this obligation , this liableness , that is represented by the chirograph . The first part of an honourable payment of a debt , whether commercial or civil is , freely owning the justice of the claim , and the reality of the obligation . The whole of the undertaking of Christ proceeds upon this recognition , that what the law requires is holy , just , and good . By blotting out the handwriting and cancelling the bond , he did not mean to imply that its claims were false , or that its demands were unjust . On the contrary , he nailed the chirograph to the cross , as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , or the atonement by his death , supposes the charge against the sinner to be true , and his liableness to the punishment to be just and right . He came to seek and to save that which is - to call , not the righteous , but sinner s " children of wrath , " " condemned already . " If the atonement did not regard sinners as antecedently bound over by sin to suffer the penalty of the law , Christ would not have died to redeem them from under the condemnation of the law . This public testimony to the dueness of the punishment , honours the divine government in maintaining and enforcing its claims on the sinner , and marks sin as an inexcuseable wrong , and of unextenuated guilt . n . The prodsion of an atonement shows the great concern of the moral Governor for the ends of justice to be secured in his administrations . God is rich in mercy , plenteous in redemption , and ready to forgive ; nevertheless he is concerned for the honour of his justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves order in his government , and is concerned to prevent disorder . His hatred of disorder and wrong , is commensurate with his love of himself , and with his concern for the public good of the universe . In defending his own rights , the whole of his public character and revealed glory is concerned . He needs no motive to feel compassion and mercy towards sinners , but a safe medium is necessary for the honourable expression of that mercy towards them . i2 /z/ Sin is a public injury to God and to the universe . It is not in the nature of mercy , nor does it become its character , to forgive such a public wrong without an expression of its abhorrence of the crime . Such a mercy would be weak indulgence , a fond and a blind passion . Every one sees that a family governed on such a principle would soon become the pest of a commonwealth . And so would a company of servants or an army of soldiers . Even family discipline requires that when you forgive a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offence . The most powerful expression of mercy 's abhorrence of sin , and of its concern for the ends of public justice , has been given in the substitution of the Son of God . A father , for instance , will not be afraid of relaxing the bonds of good discipline in forgiving a child , en a mother in tears and anguish is the expression of an abhorrence of the child 's offence . God has consulted the ends of public justice in the exercise of his mercy , and has set forth the death of his Son as the honourable ground on which he is just in justifying him that believes . God spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , as a clear demonstration of his great concern for his justice , and as a public expression at what a dear rate he forgives the sin which his righteous soul abominates . Such a provision for securing the ends of justice , honours the divine government . It shows that the /q/ reins of just authority axe not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral Governor thinks highly of justice . No friend of the Mediator can slight the law and the government , and no one who slights and disregards the law will ever be deemed a friend of the Mediator . III . In the atonement the suffering of death by Jesus Christ was substituted , by the blessed God , instead of the suffering of the punishment that was due to the sinner . Jesus Christ suffered for us , the justybr the unjust . He was made a curse for us - and a sinofferingybr us . When it is said that Christ suffered for us , it is not meant that he suffered the sufferings due to us in law , but that his sufferings were endured as substituted instead of our sufferings . An atonement goes on the supposition that the identical sufferings threatened against man are suspended , and other sufferings substituted instead of them . This exchange , or commutation of sufferings , in the expedient for redemption was intimated in the first promise made to Adam . Man by transgression had become liable to the literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sufferings he was to be delivered by the Seed of the woman . This deliverance was to be effected , not by power , but by a price of substituted sufferings , designated the " bruising of the heel " * a very different kind of suffering from that which was threatened to Adam . This view of the vicarious and substitutionary /z/ character of the sufferings of Christ will give some definiteness and force to the phrase , " Christ has paid our debts . " Though this phrase is not scriptural it is not to be ti'eated contemptuously , as it is constantly used with much sweetness and unction by many Christians , and has been sanctified by long usage in our sermons , and in our spiritual songs . " What are the debts which Jesus Christ has paid for us ? " Some answer the question by saying that Jesus Christ obeyed the law for us ; gave , in our stead , and in our name , that obedience which we owed to the law , so that the law can not now demand perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our stead by Jesus Christ . Let it be duly considered - Did Jesus Christ pay our debts in this sense ? Did he obey the law that we might not obey it ? Did he do what the law required , that we might be discharged from our duty ? Did he love God and love his neighbour , in our stead , so that we are delivered from the obligation to do so ? I am sure , I wrong my reader by supposing for a moment that he does not perceive , at once , that in this sense , Christ has paid no debts for us . Paying for us the duty which we owed to the law , would be redeeming us from God , and not to God , and would be an axe at the root of all moral government . No class of rebels would ever be restored to their allegiance by a high officer so obeying the law in their stead , as to discharge them from all fealty and homage . /z/ It is , therefore , evident , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , not the debt of duty but the debt of penalty . The handwriting , or chirograph which he cancelled was not the bond of obligation to duty and service , but the bond of liable-r ness to punishment and sufferings . It will be enquired , " How did Jesus Christ pay our debt of penalty ? " This question is frequently answered , by saying , that Jesus Christ suffered the identical punishment to which we were exposed in law . This sentiment is embodied in a phrase not at all uncommon , that " Jesus Christ suffered the hell of his people . " I shall refer a fuller discussion of the commutation of sufferings to the chapter on the atonement in its connexion with sin . I shall , now , only remark farther , that the atonement of Christ cancelled the obligation to punishment , not by paying the idem in the duty , nor by suffering the idem in the penalty , but by substituting his own sufferings instead of the sufferings due to the sinner . IV . The sufferings of the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinner . An offender is publicly punished by a wise government not for the sake of putting him personally to pain and torture , but for the sake of deterring others from committing crimes and offences . An English judge once remarked to a criminal before him " You are condemned to be transported not /z/ because you have stolen these goods , but that goods may not be stolen . " The ends of government in the punishment of offenders are - to show the goodness and benevolence of the law - to demonstrate the impartial justice of the governor - to exhibit the evil consequences of breaking the law , and to impress offenders with the hopelessness of escaping the punishment due to crime . You may be doubting the benevolence of a law that takes away a man 's life . But suppose your house robbed , or your child murdered , you would account that law really benevolent tJiat would kindly throw around you the shield of her sympathy , and would rid the country of such robbers and murderers . It is true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benevolent , but every honest man would admire and welcome it . Sinners generally judge of the laws of God , as criminals judge of the laws of their country . Public punishments tend to show that the law is good , and that it watches kindly over the interests of the poorest subject . By public punishment the magistrate shows that his justice is impartial and fair . He is above private motives ; his concern is for the public good . The insulted rights of the lowest subject shall be vindicated by him : and the rank or powei* of an illustrious offender shall not thwart the measures of righteousness . The effect will be , that all will stand in awe of the majesty of unsullied justice . /q/ The spectators of a public punishment are likely to be impressed with the evil of the crime . They perceive that they who know the interest of the nation best , regard the deed of the culprit as injurious and wrong . They feel that if every one did as the culprit did , there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of the culprit some families have suffered severely , and that , if he had been spared , many more would have suffered . They would see that such a mode of life , however easy and pleasant for the moment , is sure , eventually , to end in sorrow , infamy , and ruin ; and that such an ignominious end of such a character , will be approved and praised by all honest men every where . The other end of government , in executing punishment , is to convince all offenders , of the hopelessness of escaping the law . The criminal may long hide himself , but eventually he will be apprehended , and caught in the firm grasp of the law . Neither his obscurity nor his rank , neither his entreaties nor his bribes , can shelter him fi-om the execration of the law and the constitution . The impressions of this , every spectator , and every hearer of the execution , will carry with him to his home , and to his retirement . If a man transgress a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be punished . Why Lest others have a bad opinion of the law , and transgress it too . But suppose that this end of the law can be secured i5 /z/ without punishing the transgressor ; suppose that a measure shall be devised by the governor , which shall save the criminal , and yet keep men from having a bad opinion of the law . Why , in such a case , all would approve of it both on the score of justice , - and on the score of benevolence . For public justice only requires that men should be kept from having such a bad opinion of the law , as to break it . If this can be done without inflicting what , in distributive justice , is due to the criminal , public justice is satisfied , because its ends are fully answered. * In the moral government of- God , the death of the Lord Jesus Christ does this . It secures all the ends of the law , as if the sinner himself had been punished . This view of the atonement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " Christ was the end of the law for righteousness ; " that is , that the very end which would have been secured by the punishment of the sinner himself , has been amply and fully secured by the death of Christ . It is on this account that the death of Christ is represented in scripture as an atonement , a satisfaction , or an equivalent , for suspending the literal execution of the penalty on the transgressor . There are two sorts of equivalents , one belonging to commercial transactions , and the other to moral /q/ and civil affairs . A commercial equivalent is an exchange of one kind of property for another , as between a buyer and seller , and which particularly defines the kind and the quantity to be thus exchanged . A moral or civil equivalent does not regard kind or quantity , but secures the same ends , and produces the same effects , as the other moral or civil measure instead of which it is substituted . Why in the social circle do you accept- of an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your displeasure ? It is because you think such sorrow will answer the same ends as the infliction of your displeasure . Why was the death of Zimri and Cozbi , by the zeal of Phineas , accepted by God as an atonement , instead of inflicting the threatened death on all the Israelites who had joined Baalpeor ? It was because it answered the same ends for preventing idolatry , as if all the idolaters had died . Why were the sufferings of Jesus on the cross substituted , instead of inflicting the curse of the law on man It was because that , in the estimation of the moral Governor of the universe , these sufferings of his Son would answer the same " end of the law , " as would have been secured by the destruction of the transgressors themselves . The death of Christ secures this end . It magnifies the law , and makes it honourable in the sight of the universe , as holy , just , and good , both in its commands and in its threatenings . It is a demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not exer- /z/ cise even his mercy , without an expedient to honour his justice , though at the cost of the sufferings of his illustrious Son . It is a testimony to the evil of sin - that it is regarded by God as an evil , that it has actually inflicted evils on many , and is likely to inflict more ; that it tends to misery , infamy , and death . It demonstrates the impossibility of escaping the law ; for if God spared not his own Son as the substitute , " how can we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ? " Thus the death of Christ tends to deter men from breaking the law , and answers the ends of punishment . . The sufferings of Christ not only secure the same ends of government as the death of the sinnef , but they answer them more fully and abundantly . They better express the benevolence of the character of God ; they better show the evil of sin ; they supply better motives for holiness ; and they bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only prevent miseries that might have come , but they suspend those which were really due . The sufferings of a Personage of such grandeur and worth , are calculated to make on the universe deeper impressions of the rectitude of God 's government , and of God 's displeasure against sin , than a literal infliction of the penalty on sinful and degraded creatures . Yea , they answer other and higher ends than the prevention of sin . The sufferings of millions of sinners could never have been made a ground and medium for exercising mercy ; could never bring any sinner that was under /q/ the penalty into repentance ; and never could save other sinners . The sufferings of Christ can do these things , and do them gloriously . Thus did the blood of Christ speak better things than the blood of Abel . There are two stupendous facts in the administra* tion of moral government which prove that the death of Christ answers all these ends . The first is , that though God declares sin to be an infinite wrong to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his sin . The reason of this is , that he has set forth his own Son as the propitiation for this . The second is , that God will not treat any man as a sinner , if he will believe that the death of his Son was a propitiation for sin . The reason is , that in Christ he is reconciling the world imto himself without imputing their transgressions unto them . V. The death of Christ provides that pardon shall be dispensed to the offenders in such a manner , as shall fully sustain the interests of moral government . Pardon is proclaimed through an atonement which by its very provision supposes that the honour and authority of the law , are not weakened . If God had had no regard for the honour of his law and government , he would not have provided an equivalent . He was just , independently of the atonement , but he provided an atonement that he might be just m justifying sinful men . The sinner is forgiven on his repentance , which /z/ reflects a disgrace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposition and the power to forgive , independently of the state and feelings of the sinner , but the sinner 's discharge from his liableness to the penalty of the law is not passed , as a judicial act , until he repents of his transgression . As God has given an expression of his abhorrence of sin in proclaiming pardon , so has he ordained , for the ends of government , that the sinner also should give an expression of his abhorrence of it . This the sinner does by his repentance . When one comes forth from the ranks of the revolters , and returns to his allegiance , it is as far as his influence and example go , a reflection both on the revolt , and on the revolters . A repenting sinner blames both himself and others for rebellion against God , and thus promotes the interest of the divine government . Forgiveness is offered freely and sincerely to all the offenders , which preserves the divine government from the charge either of capricious partiality , or of arbitrary severity . God calls upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimation to all men every where , that there is for them forgiveness with God . He exhibits his pardons as in every way suitable and adequate to the case of the greatest offender , for he is plenteous in mercy and able to save to the uttermost . He publicly promises free pardon to every penitent sinner , and sincerely offers it to every sinner , with a solemn declaration , that " him that cometh he will in no wise cast out . " /q/ Hence no offender can despise the government for partiality , or blame it for undeserved severity . The pardon of the gospel comes from sovereign grace and unmerited favour , and this excludes all boasting , claim , and presumption . Notwithstanding the reconcileableness of God , and notwithstanding the atonement of Christ , yet no sinner can claim pardon . Some persons , indeed , have represented pardon as due from God to the elect ; and have said , that it would.be unjust in God not to pardon them . There is nothing in the holy scriptures , there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bold and impious sentiment . Try it yourself . Did you ever feel in prayer that you could claim the blessings you asked ? Does a happy soul feel so on his entrance to heaven ? Does Gabriel feel that he has a claim even to his own crown ? No : it is all of sovereign grace . The offender accepts the pardon by believing it , that is , by faith . The whole of this arrangement excludes presumption and self-gratulation . The reprieve is not the prisoner 's own , until he accept it ; he accepts it merely by believing it . Would any prisoner think that he deserved the reprieve because he believed it ? Would he demand his pardon as a claimant , or would he beg it as a suppliant ? Would he presume on the king 's favour and live in rebellion ? No , the king has freely , of his own prerogative forgiven him , but it is in a way , " that he might be feared " and served . The dispensation of pardon still perpetuates and /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks all inclinations to licentiousness . God pardons , not that he might be trifled with , but that he might he/eared , Man when pardoned is not taken out of a state of probation and trial . He is still accountable to law , he is still liable to break that law , he is taught to pray daily for pardon , he is chastened and aflflicted for his sin , and he will have to appear at the reckoning of the judgment day . By such an arrangement the honours of the divine gdvemment are safe . The exhibition of pardon has in itself a tendency to affect the heart , and to restore a rebel to his allegiance . There is forgiveness with God , not that he might be dreaded , but that he might be esteemed , revered , and served . There is no tendency in the dispensation of wrath to make the sinner relent and return ; it hardens more and more . Sinners who have been beaten with many stripes become harder and harder . Satan , Cain , and Judas , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . It is mercy that conquers the heart , and wins the rebel from his revolt . It is mercy that restores man to his allegiance , that God may be served . Wherever this is prominent in the ministry of the gospel , thither do guilty criminals flock , as doves to their windows . After all , it is not mercy to rebellion , but mercy to rebels ; therefore , there is nothing in forgiveness to connive at revolt , though it smile on the sinner. /q/ /z/ A limited Atonement inconsistent with the principles of Moral Government , By a limited atonement , I understand , an atonement that consists in suffering the limited amount of punishment due in law to a certain number of offenders , the benefits of which are limited to that number , and to that number only . Such an atonement is at variance with the declared principles of divine moral Government . It is at variance with the accountableness of sinners to the law , in their present state of probation ; and it is inconsistent with the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A limited atonement is established on the principle that the penalty threatened by the law must , of indispensable necessity , be executed , executed literally and fully , or otherwise the justice of the divine government would be weakened and dishonoured . It supposes further , that if the punishment of the law be not executed on the offender , it must be executed on the substitute . Then it proceeds to argue , - some offenders are through grace delivered from the punishment , therefore their punishment must have been inflicted on their substitute . And again , - some sinners will for ever suffer the punishment of the law in hell , but it would be unjust to inflict the punishment again upon them , if Christ , as /z/ a substitute , endured it for them ; and therefore the punishment of these sinners was never sustained by Jesus Christ in his atonement . Sometimes the necessity of the sufferings of Christ as an atonement , is made to arise from the inexorableness of mndiciive justice ; and then , vindictive justice is represented as impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sufferings of the Mediator . Nothing less would propitiate it . Our ears and our hearts have been pained a thousand times , by representations of the blessed God as if revelling in the agonies of the cross , and in the blood of his own Son . When * it pleased the Lord to bruise him , " it was not for the undivine gratification of inflicting pangs and tortures of intense pain ; but " it pleased the Lord " to deliver him up a sacrifice for our offences , to substitute his sufferings instead of ours , an expedient for honouring the law and saving man . God still held his Son in imdiminished love , and had infinite pleasure in his vicarious undertaking , and had , in all the mysterious sufferings of the cross , sincere good-will towards the salvation of man . If we suppose the compensative scheme of atonement to consist not in a substitution of person only , but also in a substitution of sufferings , the atonement ceases to be a satisfaction to vindictive justice , but it will appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy the ends of public justice . Upon the principle of distributive justice , it is /q/ impossible to account for the atonement of Christ and for the salvation of man . Some divines constantly affirm , that divine justice required the death of Jesus Christ as a substitute , and that the death of Christ satisfied divine justice . Is this , indeed , true ? To ascertain this , think , What is justice ? Justice is giving to every one his due , or treating every one according to his character . Now , let us ponder it ; " Was this justice satisfied in the death of Christ ? " Justice is satisfied when it gives to every one his due , or treats every one according to his character . But , were the sufferings of an ignominious death really due to Christ ? Did he DESERVE the treatment . which he received ? Is the salvation which sinners receive through his death really due to them ? In short , is either Christ , or the sinner , treated in this transaction according to character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme , not through the coloured medium of a theological system , will see that Christ received sufferings which he never deserved , and that the sinner receives blessings which were never due to his character . Divine justice treats neither party according to character : " the JusV who " did this , " and deserved to " live , " dies ; and " the soul that sinned , " and deserved to die , lives ; both cases being contrary to the principle of distributive justice . The remark is probably ready , that , " this is a peculiar exercise of justice , as * the just ' is substi- /z/ tuted for the unjust , ' that the unjust might be saved for his sake . " Very well . Such a measure will be deemed and admired by all as an expedient of transcendent benevolence and clemency ; but the original question still presses on us ; " How h justice satisfied in it , when neither party has what is due to his character ? " In this critical difficulty , reason and revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substitution is not distributive justice , either to Christ or to the sinner , yet it is a measure of entire justice towards the interests of the community under divine moral government , because the ends of justice are as fully secured by the substitution , as if the offender himself had suffered . It is therefore evident that the justice which admitted of substitution is not what is called distributive justice . It is public justice . The exercise of jowi/ec ? justice is suitable ' to the relations existing between God and man , because it is free , benevolent , and honourable . Public justice is voluntary and optional . The standing order of the divine government is not that God must be just in executing punishment , but that he might be just in showing clemency . It makes the infliction of the penalty not indispensable , but admissible , and it makes the suspension of the penalty admissible too , if the ends of its infliction can be otherwise honourably secured . It is benevolent . It shows that God is on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , /q/ and to all his empire . " Therefore will the Lord wait , that he may be gracious ; and therefore will he be exalted , that he may have mercy upon you ; FOR the Lord is a God of judgment. ' * Public justice is honourable . By its exercise God humbles himself without being dishonoured ; and man is condemned without being injured , and he is saved without reproach . God himself regards its exercise for a pleasure , a joy , and a glory . It is as a just God and a Saviour , that he rests in his love , and joys over the universe with singing . The hypothesis of a limited atonement is founded upon commercial views of the justice of God . It supposes that justice was administered to Christ as a substitute upon commutative principles . The hypothesis stands thus : A certain number of souls was given to Christ to be saved - a certain amount of punishment was due to them for so many sins - Christ suffered that amoimt for them , and for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , and to them only . The supposition of God acting on the principle of commutative or commercial justice , taking and receiving a quid pro quoy completely perverts and destroys the moral dignity of the atonement , and its influence as a medium of saving man with honour to the divine government . It makes God to exact pimctually from Christ the identical punishment threatened to the sinner , as none other could have been due , to be inflicted . It makes God to proportion /z/ the sufferings of his Son to the number of sms imputed to him , as it would have been unjust to have inflicted more or less than the proportion really due . It represents the Father of mercies as doling out favours in proportion to the number and degree of his Son 's sufferings , giving neither more nor less to any man than the purchased quantum . It represents the elect as claiming salvation as what is justly due to them from God , for value which he has received from their substitute , as it would be unjust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some men as utterly impossible , because their debt has never been paid . It exhibits the great and blessed God as mercenary in his gifts , imwilling to yield a single boon but for value received in the sufferings of his Son - sufferings which are represented as inducing ( not to say bribing ) Him to be propitious and mercifiil . All these limitations of the atonement are to be traced to commercial views of divine justice ; and surely such troubled and unwholesome streams should make us seriously doubt the purity of their source . I will now introduce a few citations from two of our most masterly divines , partly to supply specimens of what I mean by commercial views of the divine administrations : partly to show that such commercial views naturally produce the doctrine of limited atonement ; and partly to indicate how much those commercial views have coloured a great portion of systematic theology .. The number of citations of /q/ this character , either from these two authors themselves , or from other theological vmters might be indefinitely increased - but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a great master in the Israel of his day , whose works are marked by deep research , independent thinking , and evangelical suavity . The extracts will be from his " Discourse of Christ the Mediator , " foimd in the third volume of his works in folio . Ed. 1692 . Inb. i. chap . 5 , Dr. Goodwin introduces the sinner as proposing to God for his pardon , " rivers of oil , the first-bom of his body , &c."; but all being too low , the Doctor remarks , " There is no propoiiion . God would never have turned away so fair a chapmany if his justice could afford so cheap a commutation . " In b. i. chap . 7 , he says of Christ , " He must pay God in the same coyn we should , and therefore , must make his soul an offering for sin - and if he be made sin , he must be made a curse ; and which is more than all this , God himself must be the Executioner and his own Son the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make it satisfactory.

Then he observes - a strange gift it was , which he must yet pay . for , and must cost more than they were worth ; and yet he takes them as a gift and favour from his /z/ Father . " " So as Mediator ( and though a Mediator ) he saves not a man , but whom his Father gave him , nor puts a 7iame in more than was in his Father 's BILL . You may observe how careful he was in his account and how punctual in it . John xvii. 12 .

" In the next chapter he says , that " Christ laid down a price worth all the grace and glory we shall have . " The next author is Dr. John Owen , the Lebanon of English theology . The great extent of his learning , his accurate sagacity in searching the workings of the heart , and the prominence which he has given to the person of Christ , have recommended his works to such acceptance and circulation , as to give their own hue and character to much of the theology of his country .

" I have quoted enough . An atonement of such a commercial character is made to appear a measure of niggard calculation , and dribbling mercenariness .

See also p. 339 , 34. /z/ All Providence centering in the Atonement , I HAVE already considered the atonement in its relation to all works of God , considered as the productions of his wisdom , power , and goodness , and as the abodes of intelligent beings , and theatres of divine dispensations . In that chapter , no immediate regard was had to the administrations of providence in this world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atonement in all its bearings and influence , we shall now proceed to consider it in its relation to the providence which God exercises over our world . Providence is that wise oversight and holy care which the blessed God exercises over all beings , so as to preserve , direct , and order all their agences for the good of his whole empire , and for the display of his own glory . It is the divine disposal and administration of all the works , and of all the events of time . Time is always shifting its scenes , and , in every change , is producing fresh characters , and sue /q/ works . Every moment of time is tlironged with agents , and crowded with events . All things , and all beings are at work , and are at work for God , under his cognizance , management , and control . All are working out some amazing plan of which the operations of every individual is an underplot , and of which , the progress and the upshot shall be according to the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The foundation of providence is the existence of God . If there be no God , there can be no providence . Providence without the oversight of infinite intelligence is a fortuitous concourse of events , a series of plots without a meaning . Heathen historians , bolli ancient and modem , would be puzzled to answer the questicms. - What can be the meaning of their histories ? For what purposes have all these events come to pass ? What is to be the final upshot of all the movements and changes in dynasties and empires ? History without a providence is an idle tale , a cipher without an integer , a number of unconnected linksf but no chain . Divine providence , on the contrary , gives unity , worth , energy , and weight to all the events of history , by connecting each and all with the infinite superintending mind of God . As heathen philosophers rob history of its importance and glory , by separating it from the providence of God ; so , many Christian divines rob providence of much of its beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ . k2 /z/ It has long been the fashion in theology to consider the divine government , as consisting of three kingdoms or pro'inces , called the kingdom of nature , the kingdom of providence , and the kingdom of grace . The same fashion has represented the kingdom of grace alone , as connected wiHi the atonement of Jesus Christ ; supposing the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of providence to sustain no relationship to his mediation . 1 believe such distributions of the divine empire to be human , unscriptural , and , therefore , untenable . The advancement of natural philosophy has banished from the science of chemistry , the old orthodox principles of " the four elements , " and it is now full time that the progress of scriptural theology should have abolished the human arrangements of the three divine kingdoms . If , however , these arrangements only mean that nature , providence , and grace are imperia in imperio - wheels within a wheel , - works and events of va ? rious diameters thrown around one centre , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such distribution and such language would be admissible . It is making either of these provinces independent of the central throne , that makes such a division inadmissible and blameable . To separate nature and providence from the mediation of Christ , is to put asunder what God has united . What is nature but the original constitution of all things ? What is the origiual constitution of all things , but the state in which they were created /q/ by Christ , and for Christ ? And this is mediation . What is providence ? Is it not Christ upholding all things , and governing all things ? Is it not all things consisting and holding together in Christ ? Providence , then , alienated from the mediatorial administration of Christ , is not the providence of the scripture . And nature separated from the work of Christ is not the " course of nature , " mentioned in the scripture as a theatre for the scenes of redemption , and as an apparatus of means for the good of them that love God . Nature , providence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , - the cogs , and revolutions of each , catching and influencing those of the others , and all put in motion by the blood of the great atonement . God does not one thing as the God of nature , another thing as the God of providence , and a third as the God of grace . Such language is just as proper as that he does one thing as the God of vegetation , another as the God of geology , and a third as the God of astronomy ; or one thing as the God of the earth , another as the God of the moon , and another thing as the God of the Sim . He is of one mind , and his system is one . Any one of his dispensations , like a stone thrown into a lake , produces , according to its weight and importance , circles which tell on other portions of his works , and in other places of his dominion . The atonement of Christ is an event to which all providence refers , " The hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours were made . It was the hour to which all preceding providences looked forward , and to which all subsequent providences look backward . It was in the fulness of time , at a crisis which providence had matured , that Christ offered the atonement of his death . In this atonement , as the centre of power and influence , Christ stands , amid the numerous revolutions of providence , the same yesterday , to-day , and for ever . /z/ The mediatorial administration of Providence founded on the Atonement . I. The sacred scriptures regard the atonement of Christ as the ground and reason for committing the administrations of providence into his hands . Let us hear what Jesus Christ himself says , " All power is given to me in heaven and earth . " Matt. xxviii. 19 . In this passage Christ regards himself as the President of the entire universe . He declares his power to be universal . He has authority over heaven , to employ all its intelligences in his service , and to dispose of all its happiness and honours according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the earth , over all beings and things , over aU times , works , and events , - and especially over the probation and the destinies of man . This language does more than merely assert the universal domination of the Redeemer , it gives also an intimation of the harmonious administration of this /q/ immense power . The power exercised in heaven is not opposed to the interests of the eaxth ; and the authority employed on earth is subservient to the great interests of heaven . It is by the influence of the atonement that the will of God will be done on earth as it is in heaven . The whole language of the New Testament is an echo of this regal proclamation of the Lord Jesus Christ . The Mediator is " King of kings , and Lord of lords . " He is " Lord of all . " " He has power over all flesh . " He has " the keys of Hades and the grave , " and is * Lord both of the dead and the living . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " the Lord of glory . " " Every judgment is committed unto him . " Indeed " all things are delivered unto him of the Father , who has constituted him the heir of all things , who has put all things under his feet , and who has issued a public edict from his throne , " that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , of things in earth , and things under the eaxth . " Another class of passages distinctly asserts that the person of the Mediator is invested with this authority and dominion on account , and in consequence of his atonement . Take Phil . ii . 8 - 10 as a nucleus for the others . " Being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross . Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name - that every tongue should /z/ confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire was one design of his sacrifice . " For , for this end Christ died that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living . " It was after that he offered one sacrifice for sins , that he for ever sat down at the right hand of God . The apostle Peter represents Christ as " gone into heaven , and on the right hand of God ; angels , authorities , and powers , being made subject unto him . " 1 Peter iii . 22 . He entered heaven in his priestly oflfice , and in his atoning character , as the high priest entered the holy of holies ; and on this official entrance into heaven , he took public possession of all power and authority . It was not now that the grant of universal dominion was made to him ; nor was it now that he commenced his mediatorial government ; but it was now that he was publicly inaugurated into the administration of divine providence . Though in virtue of the original and eternal grant of the Father , Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it was not till after his ascension in his atoning office , that he assumed the public exercise of his mediatorial authority over jrovidence . Probably the new aspect which the administration of providence assumed about this time towards the Gentiles was designed to be a proof of this , as it seemed reserved to honour the coronation , and to adorn the triumphs of the Mediator . And the copious effusion of gracious influences at this time seemed to give a new character /q/ to the dispensations of providence , as royal largesses scattered among the people to grace the auspicious entrance of Christ upon the public exercise of his mediatorial power , as the official Organ of moral government . II . Without an atonement there would have been no providence exercised among mankind . If there be no relationship between the atonement of Christ and the providence of God , it is impossible to account for the continuation of mankind on the face of the earth . Suppose for a moment that the arrangements of the constitution with Adam in Eden had been carried out into literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat of the forbidden fruit , " dying they were to die . " They did eat . And had this constitution been executed to the letter , they would immediately have died and perished ; and , consequently , would have had no posterity . If the threatening had been executed literally , there would have been no human race . They , however , sinned , and became liable to the literal infliction of the threatened punishment , but the infliction of the literal penalty was suspended , and they lived . How did this come to pass ? It was by the introduction of a new dispensation , a dispensation that was sparing , restorative , and saving . The ground of this new dispensation was the Seed of the woman 's bruising the serpent 's head , and obtaining , by his sufferings and conflicts , a mastery over the world , and over all evils . /z/ From the moment that the threatened penalty was suspended by the introduction of another constitution , Adam and Eve lived under a new dispensation , and under this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new dispensation the whole posterity of Adam has been introduced into the world . This has been long and strenuously disputed , but on no solid and scriptural grounds . I would just ask , if the penal sanctions of Eden had been literally inflicted on our first parents , how was it possible for them to have a race of offsprings ? If the human race is bom under the Eden constitution , or as it is called , the covenant of works , where is the Eden test of probation ? on whom has its literal threatenings ever been executed ? who has ever died in the day that he first sinned ? The case of mankind , I conceive , stands thus . In the wise and harmonious exercise of divine prerogative and public justice , the original penalty or curse threatened against Adam was suspended . I do not consider the sentence pronounced on our first parents after the fall , to be the same with the curse that was threatened to them before their fall . The sentence is daily executed , but the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground of the atonement of Christ as an equivalent , that is , as an expedient that was substituted instead of it , and that would answef the same public ends as it . By such a substitution another dispensation was introduced , and by the introduction /q/ of another dispensation , our first parents and their posterity were allowed to live . The human race , then , owes its very existence , with all the blessings and advantages of that existence , to the mediation and the atonement of Jesus Christ . For without a regard to the atonement , it is impossible to view the suspension of a punishment which had been solemnly threatened , to be either honourable or safe to the divine government . If God can with honour to his government remit any punishment irrespective of the atonement , he might remit all - which would make the atonement of Christ altogether vain . III . If the dispensations of providence be separated from the influence of the atonement , no principle remains to accoimt for the harmonious administration of judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atonement of Christ , and the state , and the circumstances , and the prospects of man , present a labyrinth for which we have no clue . If man be what he was first made , and what he ought to be , in the service and in the favour of his Maker and Owner , how will you account for his misery and degradation ? If man be abhorred , and spumed , and cursed of his maker and lawgiver , how will you accoimt for his mercies , for his probation , for the call on him to repentance , and for the numerous answers which God has given to his prayers ? Man is evidently under a mixed administration . /z/ He himself is regarded in the mixed character of a condemned sinner , and a probationary candidateGod governs him in the mixed character of a sovereign Lord , and just Judge . Scripture and observation prove that these things are really so . The difficulty is to find some ground or medium in which prerogative and law , or mercy and judgment , shall harmonize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ . This medium is not necessary to the eaistence of mercy and justice in God , nor , perhaps , to a separate exercise of them . God has these attributes and perfections irrespectively of the mediatorial constitution , and they harmonize in his nature with perfect loveliness , for in him can be no clashing attributes or contradictory principles . A medium is necessary only to harmonize their exercise in a mixed administration of moral government . The atonement of the death of Christ is a suitable medium for this . It supposes man to be a sinner , and yet a candidate in probation . It supposes God to be a sovereign Benefactor , and yet a righteous Governor . It exhibits God in the fulness of his character , a righteous legislator who published a good law ; a gracious Lord who , exercises his sovereign prerogative in infinite wisdom ; and a just governor , who , in dispensing pardon and favour , consults the dignity and the honour of his government . The very provision of an atoning expedient supposes all this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of the other , but it shows forth each and all in unsullied purity , in well-adjusted harmony , and in greater lustre and splendour than any measure in the universe . It enables God honourably to condescend to show favours without sinking his character or his government . The same atonement in its aspect upon the sinner , contemplates him in his mixed character , under condemnation , and yet in probation . The provision of an atonement tells the sinner that the moral legislator thought the quarrel between him and the offender of such an importance , as to call in the interposition of a third party , and that third party a person of great dignity and worth . It tells him that the very friend who interposed for him regards the law which the sinner violated as holy , just , and good . By exhibiting the sufferings of this illustrious Interposer , as substituted instead of the punishment due to the offender , the atonement brings a greater amount of motive , to deter sinners from transgression , than the tempter can bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the atonement of his Son , that he reckons any of his perfections honoured and glorified by being exercised for the sake of it , and on account of it . He is willing to confer any boon and any favour , however great , to any offender , however unworthy , if he will ask it in the name and for the sake of his dear Son . In this mixed administration of the divine government , man 's transgression will account for his /z/ miseries , God 's goodness will account for his mercies , and the atonement of Christ will account for the honourable exhibition of favour to him as a condemned offender. /z/ The administration of Providence subservient to the ends of the Atonement . If all the movements in the physical universe are put in subserviency to gravitation , it is valid to argue that gravitation is connected with all the arrangements of matter . By a similar train of reasoning we can prove a connexion between the atonement of Christ and all the arrangements of providence . The fact of such a connexion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the whole aspect of the dispensations of providence . a . The whole design and aspect of the atonement , is " good will to men ; " and to this , the whole administration of providence is subservient . The entire character and history of providence are summed up in one inspired sentence : " all things work together for good . " " All things " in the universe are at " work . " All things are at work " together , " in order and harmony . The product of the harmonious co-operation of all things is " good . " This aggregate of good produced in the universe forms the portion and inheritance of " them who love God . " The workings together of good agents produce an immense accumulation of good ; and even /q/ the workings of bad agents are overruled for good . Indeed all the evils in the universe arise from agents not working their proper work ; but even this is made subservient to the production of good upon the whole . It is a fact which should form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole machinery of providence , there is not a single wheel made and intended to produce evil . Every wheel , and every revolution of every wheel , is intended , placed , and fitted to produce good , and to produce nothing but good . It is true , indeed , that the results of providential revolutions may and will be for evil to some ; nevertheless , the reason of this is not in the movements of providence , but in the character and attitude of sinners themselves . The workings of any piece of machinery may be good and productive of good , but if a drunken or a heedless man throw himself within its cogs , the fault of the result can not be ascribed to the working of the machinery . Picture to yourself a thief at his wicked work , skulking in darkness , and grasping his booty . Will he remain long on the scene of wrong to enjoy his prey ? No . See how all the stars of heaven move in their courses - see , how the great globe itself rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun travels in the greatness of his strength . All these stupendous movements are positively good , and produce good . They are for evil to the spoiler ; simply because he is a spoiler , and at a wrong work ; they are for good to /z/ every honest man , who is at his proper work . Every friend of sin is like a besotted man entangled in the meshes of a good machinery , whose revolutions will eventually crush and destroy him . He is out of his place . The author of the machinery never intended him to be there , and therefore the blame of the evil consequences is not to be ascribed to him . An evil doer is like a thief and a robber , whose pursuits are not in harmony with the " course of nature , " and therefore the course of nature , and the revolutions of providence are against him . History and experience testify that in the present mixed administrations of providence , mercy and judgment , like ingredients in a medicine , or like a thunderstorm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear an aspect of benevolence and kindness towards man . Judgments are never sent without warnings , which are like the voice of mercy crying before the trumpet of judgment . Judgments keep up a constant memorial of the rectitude of the governor , and a testimony to his concern for the public welfare in showing that he is as much determined to defend good laws , as he was disposed to make them . These judicial interpositions restrain men from great evils , and really prove blessings to many families , and to many neighbourhoods by removing a root of bitterness , and an evil example from among them . Even the severest infliction of judgments leave more criminals behind than they sweep away , that the others may have a season for repentance. /q/ Judgments come very gradually , and when they do come , God never stirs up all his wratli , and he never afflicts with the " greatness of his power . " If even the judgments executed in the administrations of providence have such an aspect of benevolence and " good- will to man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence with open hand lavishes on the children of men ? In the dispensations of providence , mercy and truth have met together , righteousness and peace have embraced each other . It is the atonement of Jesus Christ that gives to divine providence this character and aspect . The atoning Mediator is , in priority of arrangement , the first in the series of the blessings of infinite providence , the first bubbling in the well-spring of the stream of favours , the first stone in the building of mercy . It pleased the Father to make him the magazine of all fulness of blessings , and it is out of his fulness that we all have received . It is because God spared not his own Son , but delivered him for us all , that he will with him freely give us all things . All blessings and mercies are dispensed in his name , by his authority , and on his account . It is only so far as our mercies are employed in harmony with the mediatorial work of Christ , that they prove real blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ruin . All good things , and sure mercies , axe contained in the New Testament of Christ . No blessing has ever come /z/ to man , but what is contained in the Testament , and the Testament with all its blessings and mercies , is sealed with the blood of the atonement . The Lord Jesus Christ is constituted the sovereign of providence . In this character he sits on the right hand of God , and dispenses his favours . Blessings are dispensed by him , not by his divine authority , but by his mediatorial power ; and his mediatorial power is , alpha and omega , founded in the atonement of his death . b . The subserviency of providence to the designs of the atonement , becomes more evident when we * In unison with these sentiments , are the views of the heavenly Flavbl. ' * Christ is the channel of grace and mercy ; through him are all the decursus et recur sus gratiarum all the streams of mercy that flow from God to us , and all the returns of praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercies which providence conveys to us , is by his own blood : for not only spiritual and eternal mercies , but even all our temporal ones , are the acquisition of his blood . Look , as sin forfeited all , so Christ restored all those mercies again to us by his death . Sin had so shut up the womb of mercy , that , had not Christ made an atonement by his death , it could never have brought forth one mercy to all eternity for us . It is with Him that God freely gives us all things , * ' * So that whatever good we receive from the hand of providence , we must put it on the score of Christ 's blood ; and when we receive it we must say , it is the price of blood : it is a mercy rising out of the death of Christ : it cost him dear , though it came to me freely. ** ' * These sweet mercies that are born of providence every day , are the fruits of the travail of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 460. 1820. /q/ consider that providential dispensations are administered with a special reference to the interests of the church of Christ . The Lord Jesus Christ is himself " the heir of all things , " and all his people are " joint heirs with him . " God has placed the Mediator in the throne of dominion at his own right hand in the heavenly places , and has put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church . Therefore , the apostle says elsewhere , * All things are yours , whether Paul , or ApoUos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come , all are yours , and ye are Christ 's , and Christ is God 's . " Our blessed Saviour in his intercessory prayer in the garden refers to this bearing of his mediatorial government generally , on the interests of the church especially . " Thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast given him . " This passage , while it shows that the mediatorial dominion of Christ is of wid diameter than his church , proves that the exercise of all his mediatorial authority and sway , is subservient to the interests of his people . The entire history of divine providence is an evidence of this special subserviency . The early history of the Jewish church shows how much the civil politics and the external condition of the nations of the earth were subservient to its protection and establishment . When the /z/ church has been in circumstances difficult , painful , and critical , providence in an unthought-of manner interposed to supply suitable means and proper instruments of deliverance - as in Egypt and Babylon , at the introduction of Christianity , and at the Reformation . The plots , and designs , and machinations of men and of nations , laid down with malicious craftiness , and nerved with wealth and power , have been , by a mediatorial providence , suddenly frustrated and destroyed . The dispositions of coimcils and states have been as rivers of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chastened , or overruled for the furtherance of the church of Christ . Some instances of particular providences in the lives and labours of individual members of the church supply the most decisive and interesting specimens of the manner in which the administration of the world is subordinate to the benefit of the church . c . One marked design of the atonement of Christ is to magnify the law , and make it honourable . To this high design all the dispensations of providence are subservient . This is the end aimed at in the inflictions of Judgments on individual men and on communities , in the institution of sacrificial rites which have prevailed among all nations , in the miraculous revelations of the divine mind and will to prophets and other messengers , in the prompt and suitable answers that have been given to prayer , in the promulgation and ministrations of the gospel in the /q/ world , in the holy lives of renewed men , in the eternal punishment of incorrigible rebels , and in the glorious rewards of the heavenly state . These considerations warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christ as Mediator , and " given " to his administration to subserve the ends of his government , and secure the purposes of his atonement . /z/ The administration of the Atonement analagous to the administration of Providence , Paley observes , in his Natural Theology , that in all our widest and farthest researches into the productions of Creation , " we never get amongst such original , or totally different , modes of existence , as to indicate , that we are come into the province of a different Creator , or under the direction of a different will . " Well had it been for the Christian church had such a thought suggested itself to our theological enquirers and polemical writers . It would have saved much controversy , heresy , persecution , and bloodshed . The analogy between providence and moral government Butler has established in a position unassailed and unassailable . Many of the controversies which have agitated and unsettled the Christian church , have been conducted on the supposition , that in the works of redemption we come , so to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord of Providence /z/ and the Maker of the world . Human systems of theology seem to take this datum for their basis- but holy writ , sound reason , and daily experience show that mankind are members of one immense system , pervaded by the same mind , regulated by the same will , and administered on the same general principles . My present design is only to illustrate the analogy between the administration of the atonement and the dispensation of providence . I. The providence of God has a universal aspect . His tender mercies are over all his works . He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust . Such is the God of providence , and such also is the God of redemption . He has loved the world . He gave his Son to be a propitiation for the sins of the whole world . He willeih not that any should perish , but come to the knowledge of the truth , and he commands all men every where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will apply some cramping and abridging process to the phrases about redemption , try the same experiment on providence , and the result will show that you serve a system , and not receive the truth . On the universal aspect of providence you have no system to serve , but on redemption you have to cut and square these unmeasured expressions to ready-made creeds . Think not in your hearts that the God , who openeth his hand and satisfieth the desire of every living thing , is different from the God who spared not his own Son , but delivered /q/ him up for us all . Say not that the God who has provided so bountifully for our bodily and temporal wants , has been niggard and scanty in his supply for the soul that is to live for ever . II . The measures of providence are liable to failure . A medicine may fail , notwithstanding the virtue which providence has given it . The crop of the husbandman may fail , notwithstanding the provision that seed time and harvest time shall continue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure of providence , is unaccountable when God declares his own government of the Jews , under the theocracy to have failed of its ends . " In vain have I smitten them , they have refused to receive correction , " Jer. ii . 30 . The word of God distinctly and expressly recognizes the same liableness to failure in the great measure of atonement . . Are you sure that it is not attachment to system , rather than attachment to the truth , that makes you hesitate to avow this ? The scriptiures openly state that the atonement may become of none effect in some cases , as m Gal . v. 2 , 5 . The apostle Paul was afraid of the Galatians , lest he had bestowed upon them labour in vain , L e , lest the ministry of the atonement should fail of its ends . The same apostle pleads with the Corinthians in earnest entreaty , that they would not receive the grace of God in vain , which he must have supposed to be a possible case . The prophet Isaiali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have laboured /z/ in vain , and spent my strength for nought . " In perfect harmony with this prediction are the very words of the Redeemer himself . " How oft would I have gathered thy children , as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not ? " As I have here only to notice the analogy between the atonement and providence , no candid reader will suppose that this language implies an utter failure - it merely implies susceptibility of failure . The failure in either case does not dishonour God , the blame of it is entirely with the sinner - and the possibility of the case is quite consistent with the laws of trial in a free and moral government . The character of any measures of divine providence is to be tried by the fitness and adaptation , and design of such measm*es , and not at all by their final results . It is in this manner we always judge of an evil measure in the world . We judge of a dagger , a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We judge of deceit , cunning , extortion and oppression by their tendency and aim . Thus should we judge of providence . No wise man judges of a medicine by the death of a patient , of wealth by a miser , of learning by pedantry , or of liberty by anarchy . The deluge was a fit measure to clear the earth of evil doers , but you will not judge so by the final result . The final result does not prove that the selection of the family of Abraham would preserve a people from idolatry and sin - nevertheless the measure itself was adapted and intended to do this . /q/ The miracles of Egypt and the wilderness were fitted and designed to bring the Isaraelites to obey God , and to trust him - but the result was otherwise . You do not judge of the ministry of Christ among the Jews , by its final result , but by its tendency and design . Why then will you judge of the atonement by its final results ? Why not judge of it by its adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out to be the same with the ultimate end for which it was instituted and adapted , then the final result is a good criterion to test the design and tendency of a measure . Oiur present state of trial and probation is adapted , calculated , and designed to work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory - but ihe final results in countless instances will prove otherwise . Will you say then , that this state was fitted and intended to prove thus disastrous ? You are not to judge of probation by what it may be , or shall be in given instances , but by what it is now , by what it is fitted and intended to effect . Nor are you to judge of tto atonement by what it may and shall be in some instances , " the savour of death unto death , " but by what it is now - and what it is calculated and designed to be , " the savoiur of life unto life " to all who will accept it . III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus becomes particular providencey by personal application only . So when a farmer takes into cultivation a piece of land from the common , on which no com has ever grown before , he applies to /z/ his own individual case the broad offer and promise of general providence , that wherever there shall be a seed time , there shall be a harvest time . This general providence becomes as suitable and as effectual to him , as if it were made and intended for him personally , and for him only . He never thinks of consulting the secret decrees of heaven , to know whether such a plot of ground was eternally predestined to bear a crop . The general promise is quite enough for him . Thus he acts in the thousand affairs of life , - say in taking medicine , he never waits to unravel the private manuscripts of heaven for information : he merely ascertains the general fitness , adaptation and tendency of the remedy , and applies it to his individual case . Why will not men act thus about the atonement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general and particular providence . No argiunent can be brought against a general atonement which will not fall with the same weight and edge upon a general Providence . There are0D difficulties connected with particular redemption , which do not adhere as closely to particular providence . It would be regarded as the drivelling of silliness to argue that if there be a particular providence , there can not be a general one . Of the same estimate is the reasoning , that if there be a particular redemption , the atonement can not be universal . As general providence becomes particular , only by personal application , so does general atonement become particular /q/ redemption . " Whosoever will , let him come , and take of the water of life freely ; " " and him that Cometh I will in no wise cast out . " The supposed fanner never suspected that he was not personally intended in the general promise of Providence . If his crop has not answered his expectations , he sees and feels that the failure was owing to the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was never promised , that if he ploughed the rock , or sowed the sea-shore , that he should have a harvest . And why should any sinner suspect that he is not personally interested in the atonement , and that the general atonement is not available to his particular and personal case ? There is not in the scriptures , even the most remote allusion to any class of sinners , for whom Christ did not die . In the whole history of salvation and of man , there is not on record a single instance of a personal application of the general dAjon &aiGni; failing of success . No personal applicant at the door of the atonement has ever perished . ChrisLjbas never said to any suppliant , - " I never meant you individually . " If any sinner who knows the atonement perishes , even in his destruction he sees , that his perdition is not through a deficiency in the atonement , for the atonement had never promised or provided , if he sowed to the flesh that from the flesh he should reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposed farmer quibbling about the divine decrees , and saying that they were never designed to be farmers , and that they did not /z/ think providence would bless them in such an undertaMng , you would conclude that at heart they had no liking for the work . It is , I believe , universally trae that no sinner quibbles about the secret designs of the atonement , but when he has no liking to the personal application of it , to condemn himself and to justify the divine government . When Paul 's fellow-passengers laid hold on the " boards and broken pieces of the ship , " they had no time to quibble about secret decrees , they made the provisions of general providence available to their particular cases , and they all succeeded . Let every sinner go , and do likewise . IV . The Providence of God treats men as moral and free agents . Providence will do for a man nothing that he can do for himself Providence will give seed to the sower , but it vdll not sow it nor reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vessel with gales , but it vidll not steer at the helm . Providence makes no arrangement to encourage the idleness or inactivity of man , but all its provisions require and demand the full exercise of his agency . God promised to feed the Israelites in the wilderness with manna , but they were to gather and prepare it for food . Providence gives us our " daily bread , " but not in baked loaves falling from the sky . Providence supplies us with raiment , but not in garments ready made , descending upon us without any agency of our own . Providence has made bread to be the staff of life , but here it meets /q/ US as free agents , for if we do not exercise our own agency to partake of it , it will avail us nothing . The administration of the atonement meets man in the same manner , as a free agent . It does nothing for him that he can do It presents to his eyes , " Him whom he has pierced , " but he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and a living way to the Father , " but he himself must walk it . It supplies him with a sovereign and sufficient remedy , " but he himself must " receive " it . If he refuse the balm of Gilead , it will not heal him . If he neglect this great salvation , it will not save him . If he will not have this man to rule over him , he will not be delivered from the kingdom of darkness . As providence deals with free agents , so does the atonement . Take these statements about the atonement simply and candidly as they are presented to you , and you will admit , you must admit , that they are the real facts of the case . Will you venture to wrest them because they run not parallel with the lines of yoiur theological system ? These arrangements about the atonement are no more dishonourable to the character of God , than are the similar measures about the providence of God . Whatever may be the failures of providence during the economy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to the everlasting glory of God , and that all his perfections and purposes will appear guiltless of those failures . So will the administration of the atonement of Christ be unto God a sweet savour , even in them that pe /z/ rish . Though his death prove of none eflTect to those who were bent on being justified by the law , and to them who would not obey him , yet the illustrious Redeemer shall not fail of the travail of his soul . It should be remembered that the mere salvation of sinful men was not the only thing for which the soul of Christ travailed . He travailed for the glory of /z/ God , for the honour of the law , for the condemnation of sin , for the free overtures of the gospel , for the gracious acceptance of sinners , for the inexcusableness of wilfiil rejecters , and for the righteousness of tiiieir sorer punishment . Of all this travail he shall see . And while he is glorified in his saints and admired in them that believe , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his salvation , for the language of all intelligences will be " Amen , just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints . " These remarks show that the moral Governor who directs the administration of the atonement , is not a Ruler different from him who regulates the dispensations of providence . In proceeding from one to another , we make no transition into the works and principles of a different God . We have already considered that the whole system of the universe was of a mediatorial character , and that , had it not been for the substituted sufferings of the Seed of the woman , there would have been no providence exercised towards the human race , for they would never have come into being . The dispensations of providence . /q/ therefore , must take their character from the medium through which they are administered ; and this medium is the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ Providence began with the atonement - it continued to be administered through the atonement - and it will for ever close with the closing dispensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the other . A season will come when there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin , when the merits of the atonement will be no longer available to our world , when the time of probation for receiving the benefits of the atonement will close , and then will providence close for ever . Then , " Let him that is holy be holy still , and him that is filthy be filthy still . ' * From the whole of this train of observations , the inference is inevitable that God exercises no providence in this world with which the atonement has not a close and constant relation , and that they are both administered upon the same principles of moral government /z/ A l imit ed Atonement inconsistent with the adminis- &#9830; tration of Providence . I. An atonement designed for a limited niunber only , is inconsistent with the general claim which Jesus Christ makes to govern and regulate the duties , the affections , the homage , and the destinies of every man on the face of the earth /z/ The Lord Jesus Christ claims the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth for his possession . This passage is sometimes interpreted as meaning that the inheritance which Christ claims consists only of his elect people among the heathen . If so , the rest of the heathen , who remain unconverted , are not rebels against Christ . Against what can they be said to have rebelled ? Is it against his claims to them ? No ; according to this limited hypothesis ; for he does not claim them personally , but only the elect who lived among them . In such a case their non-submission to his rule and government is no sin to be laid to their charge , for the mediatorial king is supposed to lay no claim to them . Can it be a crime in any of the heathen not to submit to a claim which has never been made on them ? When the mediatorial judge will say , " Slay those enemies that would not have me to rule over them , ** might they not silently murmur or retort , " would not ? " Was it ever offered to us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay claims to our homage and obedience ? " Suppose that these foes themselves dared not mutter such a retort , would not thoughts and hints of this kind suggest thenlvesi ' oly intelligences , who actually knew the truth and verity of the case ? I should like to hear an abettor of limited atonement remonstrate and reason with a class of rebels who said , " We will not have this man to rule over us . " His theological system would require him to say , " You tvill not have him ? Stop ; - are /z/ you sure you could have had him ? Did he ever aJsk you to have him ? Since you have rejected him it is a proof that he never sincerely intended you to take him , or else he would have made you to have him before now . " After such an address let him try to impress on their minds their accountableness to this mediatorial Ruler , the inexcusableness of their destruction , the guilt of their rejection of Christ , and the justice of their sentence according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not claim the homage and the service of every man , every man is not bound to take him for a King , and to yield obedience to him . No advocate of a limited atonement has ever seen a man to whom he could not say , on scriptural grounds , that he was boimd to receive Christ as his Lord . The Lord Jesus Christ has made laws for every man on the globe , laws that bind every man to repent , and to believe the gospel , and to accept salvation for his sake . If every man on the earth has not yet heard of these laws , the fault is in them who were commissioned to publish them , and not in Him who enacted them . These laws were meant and intended for world , " and they were to be preached to " every creature . " There is no limitation in the commission , or in the aspect and design of the laws . With what grace , or on what principles could the Lord Jesus Christ make laws to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he laid no claims to that homage ? We would think it unac- l5 /z/ countable for a king to send edicts and messages to a province where in reality he had no power and authority . Christ lays to the services of the sinner no claim which is not founded on the blood of redemption . The sinner would never have had his existence had it not been for the mediatorial interposition of * ' the Seed of the woman : " to that Mediator , therefore , he owes every thing : and it is on the ground of that mediation that Christ claims every thing that he is , and every thing that he has . The authority which Christ has by his mediation over every man is analogous to the authority which God by his providence has over every man . God 's providential power over every man is founded in every man 's relation to God . It is founded upon the immutable fact that God is the Creator and the Supporter of every individual . God had not authority over Jonathan , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the Creator of Jonathan himself . He had not power over Judas because that he was a benefactor to Peter , but because he was a benefactor to Judas himself . Of the same character is the mediatorial power of Christ over sinners . He had not power over Saul of Tarsus because he died for Stephen , but becdbse he died for Saul . He had not authority to " gather " the inhabitants of Jerusalem under his mediatorial wings because he died for his disciples , but because he made atonement for these very citizens . His intercession for his murderers was not founded on his death /q/ for his friends , but on his death for these identical murderers . These must be self-evident verities . On this subject , there is an argimient of this kind frequently used : If Christ has authority over all , by an atonement for all , how comes it to pass that all are not saved ? I can only say , that there is no difficulty in this question which does not bear as hard upon the providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The long-suffering of God is as much , in tendency and design , " for salvation , " as is the atonement . Let us form the query , by substituting the one word for the other , thus . If God 's long-suffering towards all , be designed for the salvation of all , how comes it to pass that all are not saved ? How will you parry it ? The fact is that both providential authority and mediatorial authority are exercised over free agents in a state of probation , and therefore liable to be rejected and renounced . The rejection of providential government does not invalidate the claims of God founded upon his relations to man as his Maker and Owner , nor does the rejection of the mediatorial sway of Christ , foimded on his relations to the sinner as his Mediator and Saviour destroy his claims to homage and love . You do not limit " the goodness of God " to the boundaries of the mere number that it actually " leads to repentance , " you know it is infinitely larger than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " long-suffering of God " that it is not really successful " for salvation " to every sin- /z/ ner to whom it is exhibited . TJhese things you yourself hold as indisputable , and you do well . Then , why judgest thou thy brother , and why settest thou at nought thy brother , because that , on your own principles he thinks the atonement of Christ , like " the goodness of God , " may be of wider extent than the number of sinners that actually repent ; or like " the long-suffering of God , " that it is not less glorious , because it does not actually save those who neglect and reject its benefits ? I am aware that the proposition , that the universal power of Christ is founded on his universal atonement , is combated by the statement that , on this showing , Christ has died for the beasts of the field , and for devils , over whom he certainly has authority . As brutes and devils are not under moral government ruled by hopes and fears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quibble appears so irrelevant and sophistical as not to deserve a serious reply . II . A limited atonement is inconsistent with the bountiful favours and mercies which Providence confers on all men universally . If God has conferred any favours on offenders independently of the atonement of the Mediator , it is difficult , if not impossible to say , why He could not confer all favours without it . If so , there was no necessity for the atonement . This sentiment leads straight-forwardly to Socinianism . We have already considered all providential favours as founded in the mediatorial atonement and administered on account /q/ of it . To evade this doctrine it is asserted that the ungodly obtain their mercies and favours , only for the sake of the elect , or through the church . Then , whenever an ungodly man asks a blessing on his food , he should ask it " for the elect 's sake , " not for Christ 's sake - and he should return thanks to God in the church 's name , but not in the name of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as would place at their disposal , the entire worthiness and merits of the church , though it would be difficult to persuade any church to believe that it has all this worthiness in it . An atonement limited by the commercial principle of paying so much suffering for so many blessings , would be a measure of sheer absurdity . According to this commercial scheme , Christ has suffered as much as the sins of each of the elect deserved , and has purchased for them blessings in proportion to the sufferings endured for them , and these blessings he demands for them by his intercession . Then the reason why some Christians are so poor is , that the Lord Jesus Christ did not actually purchase more blessings for them . This also accounts for the low amount of their Christian graces and religious comforts : as Christ demands all that he has purchased for them , the amount communicated is small because the amount purchased is small . Here is no encouragement to grow in grace , unless we believe that more grace is purchased for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on this scheme enjoys /z/ as much usefulness and success as has been purchased for hun , and no more . No other doctrine could provide so soft a cushion for those who are at ease in Zion . Let us follow this commercial principle a little farther . The greater sinner an elect person is , the greater sufferings did Jesus Christ endure for him . The more Christ suffered , the more blessings did he deserve . Christ will by his intercession demand that every elect person shall have his due share in the purchased blessing . The result is , that the greater the sinner is , the greater is the amount of merit in his behalf , and the greater will be his share in the benefits of the atonement : and the more a man sins , the more will God confer blessings on him through his Son . More has been suffered , and consequently more has been merited for the sinner of sixty years , than for the sinner of six years , consequently the sinner of sixty wiU be entitled to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an arrangement is that the less a man sinned , the less has Jesus Christ merited and purchased for him : and the fewer his sins , the fewer will be the blessings purchased for his inheritance . Such an atonement is utterly inconsistent with the whole of the manner , in which God has conferred , and has promised to confer , the mercies of his providence . III . Limitation of the atonement to a certain number is at variance with the broad principles , on which Christ carries on his intercession in heaven . /q/ I consider the intercession of Christ to consist in the four following articles . It consists in his public and official appearance before God as the mediatorial representative of man , and the President of the universe ; - in his administration of all the providence of God , publicly and officially , on the ground of his atonement ; - in his publicly and officially presenting to God all the services , and all the prayers , entrusted to him for presentation ; - and in an official and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services and prayers may be graciously received and accepted . In the first two articles the intercession of Christ is unbounded and interminable - of the same length and breadth , and height and depth , as the divine empire . In the last two articles the intercession of Christ is limited only by the limited services and prayers entrusted to him for presentation . He can not possibly express a will or desire that services and prayers be received which are never offered . It would be ridiculous to argue that the power of presentation in a Receiver-general of the revenue is limited by the amount which he actually presents - that the liberty of a representative in the senate to present petitions is limited by the number actually presented - and that the ability of an advocate to plead is limited by the number of clients who actually employ him . Yet this is the kind of argument that has been employed to limit the intercession of Christ And after throwing a boundary around /z/ the intercession of Christ , th abettors of a limited atonement have thought themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no limitation given to the intercession of Christ , except the limitation which men give to it by their limited services and limited prayers . The intercession of Christ is capable of the same extent as his atonement . This very commensurateness is the ground of the apostle John 's argument ; " If any MAN sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous , and he is the propitiation for our sins , and not for ours only , but for the sins of the whole world . The propitiation for the sins of the whole world is the ground of intercession for any man that sins , and any man that sins is said to " have " this advocate , as one to whom he can have access . The Lord Jesus Christ has taught his people to make intercession on lai'ge principles for " all men . " They have no grounds for intercession , but those on which Christ intercedes . He would not encourage them to make intercession of wider dimensions than his own . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the blood that speaketh better things did not second their plea : and it can not speak for all men , if it was not shed for all men . The various specimens which Jesus Christ has given of his intercession , declare it to be opi , broad , and unlimited , in its character and aspect . In the xvii. chapter of John he makes intercession distinctly /q/ for his ministers and for his church . When Christ says , " I pray for them , I pray not for the world , " it is evident that by " them ' ' he means his apostles , for he mentions one of " Am " as being Judas , who was a son of perdition . He prays not for ministers only , but for ' * all who shall believe through their word . " What is the design which Christ has in view in praying for ministers and believers ? Hear his own language . He prays and intercedes - that the world may believe that thou hast sent me . " He prays that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel - and whosoever " believes " shall be saved . The intercession of Christ then is a benefit and an advantage which is accessible to the world , and in which the world is interested .

Had Christ in Gethsemane a will different fi " om the " will " with which he wept over Jerusalem , and said . How oft " would I " have gathered thee ? Is there any incongruity between his intercession in the garden , and his intercession on the cross ? There he prayed for all his enemies - " Father forgive them , for they know not what they do .

We find in the scripture the truths of theology , as , in nature , we find the truths of botany , mineralogy , or zoology , dsely strewn in copious and lovely variety .

If Christianity had not been comprehended in this doctrine , the apostle , who shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God , could not have determined to know nothing else in his ministry . The whole of the Christian system appears to be presupposed by it ; included in it , or to arise from it : if , therefore , I write any thing , it will be on this principle .

Christ himself says , " To this end was I bom , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness imto the truth . " ** The truths is the pure verity and the simple reality of the case , as the state of things exist between God and man . Upon this case every truth bears , and with every such truth the atonement of Christ is connected : - the whole of his undertaking bears witness imto it . I. All the truths contained in the prophecies of the scriptures are related to the atonement of Christ . It was prophesied that this world should , in a given time , be favoured with the appearance of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seed of the woman , the Shiloh , the Prophet , the Wonderftd , the Mighty God , the Everlasting Father , the Lord our Righteousness , the Desire of all nations , the Messenger of the covenant . " The atoning Mediator claimed to himself the honour of being this very personage , to whom all the prophets bore witness . Prophecy had revealed that this personage was to make his appearadce in the character of the Deliverer of man . As the Seed of the woman , he was to bruise the head of the serpent that had enslaved and ruined man . He was to be for a sanctuary , and to come , " bringing salvation . " The Lord Christ was /z/ bom a Saviour , and he came to seek and to save that which was lost . God sent his Son to the world , not to condemn the world , but that the world through him might be saved . He is the Personage whom the prophets meant , for there is no salvation in any other , nor any other name among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made imder the law , that he might redeem them who were under the law . The deliverance which , it was prophesied this personage was to effect , was a deliverance from sin . It was prophesied that he should make an end of sin , that is , to open a way for the just God to deal with a sinner as if he had not sinned ; sin , being as it were , blotted out of the account . He was to effect this deliverance as a priest on his throne , and as a priest after the order of Melchizedek . The Lord Christ took upon him the name Jesus because he TYOuld deliver his people from their sins . He appeared as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world . He has redeemed us from the curse of the law . The Jews misunderstood this class of prophecies , and interpreted them as signifying deliverance from civil thraldom , and from political evils . Whereas , he himself declares that he came to call sinners ; and his gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in Christ Jesus . It was predicted that this personage should effect this deliverance from sin , not by power , but by his own . substitutionary and vicarious sufferings . He was to be a man of sorrows , and acquainted with /q/ grief . He was to bear our griefs , and to carry our sorrows ; to be wounded for our transgressions , and bruised for our iniquities . He was to make his soul an offering for sin , and to be numbered among transgressors . He was to be cut off , but not for himself . The meaning of these and the like passages , is that this illustrious Person was to endure the sufferings with which the Father put him to grief , in the stead of our suffering the punishment due to us for our sins . This claiss of passages is referred to in the New Testament as being accomplished in the death and the atonement of Jesus Christ . He gave his life a vicarious ransom for many . He was made a sin offering for us . He died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse that the curse of the law might not be inflicted on men . Hence it was prophesied that this deliverance from sin should be on account and for the sake of his sufferings . We were to have peace , through his suffering our chastisement , and by his stripes we were to be healed . To us guilty sinners who had no worthiness , he was to be the Lord our righteousness . It was on account of his intercession that gifts were to be given to men , even to the rebellious . The mediation of Christ fills up these prophecies . It is for Christ 's sake that God forgives sin ; it is by faith in the name of Christ that pardon is received by the sinner . It is the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses from all sin ; and every saved man is found 240 ITS reijltion to the not in his own righteousness , but in the righteousness of Jesus Christ only .

We find in the writings of a man of any depth of understanding , such relation and connexion of the parts of any entire work - such order and continuity of the thoughts - such consequence and concatenation of arguments - in a word , such unity of the whole , which , at the same time that it gives perspicuity to every part , when its relation to the whole is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases impossible , to discover the sense of any single period , taken at a venture from the first place where the book may chance to open , without any general apprehension of the subject , or of the scope of the particular argument to which the sentence may belong .

The doctrine , or the testimony concerning the mediation of Christ is the very spirit and life of prophecy , without which prophecy would be a body without a soul . The atonement of Christ is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can command a view of the whole panorama of prophecy . All unfulfilled prophecy , as well as the already accomplished predictions , have their sum and substance in the character and the work of Jesus Christ . To deny the atonement is , to take away the life-blood of prophecy . The Biblical critics who reject the atonement , like the Jews who rejected the Messiahship of Christ , make the whole apparatus of their learning , to bear against the prophecies which predict a suffering Saviour , and a Vicarious Sufferer . This , fact shows that the doctrine of the atonement is the heart of Christianity . A Socinian divine puts the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah to critical torture , with the same unmercifulness and spleen as a Jewish Rabbi would put it . They both agree , like Herod and Pilate , to do away with the claims of Christ , to sap the foundation of Christianity , to throw away the blood of atonement as an unholy thing . The New Testament regards the whole system of prophecy as having its scope and meaning , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person and the atonement of Jesus Christ . " The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . " To him gave all the prophets witness . Paul witnessed , both to small /z/ and great , saying no other things than those , which the prophets and Moses did say should come , that Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles . The apostle Peter describes salvation as being according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the spirit , and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ f and then says " of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you ; searching what , or what manner of time , the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand , the sufferings of Christ aitd the glory that should follow . " Here , then , we meet with a complete system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet pointing to One remarkable Personage of the highest majesty and excellency . These prophecies treat of his person , his name , his character , his work , his life , his death , and his glory ; each of them consistent with the others , and one casting light on all the rest . They all meet together and have their full accomplishment in One Person , and in no one else , - but in him most fully and clearly . Though they were delivered in various generations , they have but one object in view ; and other events are hinted at only as they are connected with that object , and that object is the work of Christ . He is the true Seed of the woman , the true Prophet , the /q/ true Redeemer , the true Immanuel , the true Sun of Righteousness . II . All the truths contained in the ceremonial institutions and sacrificial types are connected with the atonement of Christ . It is confessedly true that many of the early Christian fathers , as well as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have discovered similitudes , drawn parallels , pursued analogies , and pressed out truths that were never designed by such symbols . But such extravagant deductions of imdisciplined imaginations supply no fair and valid arguments against a scriptural , sober , and judicious application of the typical character of the Jewish institutions and ceremonies. * The sacred scriptures indisputably assert that there is a designed coincidence and an intended connexion between the religious institutions of the Jews and the essential doctrines of Christianity . Indeed , I might argrte , that of so much importance in the system of divine truth , is the symbolical character of the Israelitish ceremonies , that the Holy Spirit has given one entire book - the epistle to the Hebrews , - not only to give a distinct recognition of that principle as designed by God to prefigure the realities of the gospel - but also to mark out and explain the relation and agree- * Among the best works on this subject are Mather 's ' Figures and Types of the Old Testament , ' 4to . Ed. , London , 1705 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the University of Cambridge , in 1825 . ' London , 1S26 , 8vo. m2 /z/ ment between that principle , and the events and the doctrines of the mediation of Christ . Hence the Jewish institutions are called , a shadow of good things to come , but the body the substance is of Christ . " Col. ii . 16 , 17 . The gifts and sacrifices of the priest " serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle . Heb. viii . 5 . This tabernacle and the vessels of the ministry are called " the patterns of things in the heavens " and " the figures of the true Heb. ix . 23 , 24 . The entire constitution of the Levitical law is described as " having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things . " Heb . X. 1 . The body , the substance , the filling up , the meaning and truth , of all these ceremonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him only . Extraordinary and illustrious characters were types of his person . Holy offices were shadows of his work and undertaking . The Jewish polity was an outline of his kingdom . The distinguished privileges of the theocracy were figures of his glorious rewards , the vicarious and expiatory sacrifices were representations of his glorious atonement . Various classes of types were employed to shadow forth the great truths of our salvation . Some types shadowed that man was a sinner ; - others , that he had forfeited his life ; others , that another life was substituted and accepted instead of it ; - and others shadowed that this substi- /z/ tution should take place in the Messiah , who according to Isaiah would " make his soul an offering for sin , " and be " led as a Lamb to the slaughter . " Exod . XX . 7 . Lev . vi . 3 , 4. xvii. 11. xxiv. 16 . Deut. xxii. 26 . The Jewish institutions taught the Israelites no truth which the gospel has not attached to the atonement of Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jesus . " The very truths that were obscure in the ceremonial types are now made clear and defined by the gospel . And the truths which appeared defective and imperfect in the Jewish ritual , now , in the light of the Christian atonement , stand out in prominent relief , and with a fulness of meaning which they never had before . The sacred scriptures regard all symbolical truths as meeting in the atonement of Christ . This is evident from the facts , that sacrificial names and appellations are given to Christ ; that Jewish sacrifices are represented as shadows of the satisfaction of Christ ; that the value which was but nominal in them , is described as intrinsic in the sacrifice of Christ ; that the efficacy which was but ceremonial in them , is declared to be real and actual in the atonement of Christ ; that the sacrifice of Christ is pointed out as the last that should be offered for sin ; and from the fact that animal victims ceased to be sacrificed , after the Great Propitiation had been publicly offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . /z/ He was the true sacrifice , the true priest , the true altar , the true temple , and the true Saviour . III . All the doctrinal truths of divine revelation are connected with the atonement . All doctrinal truth is the mind of God , the expression of his thoughts ; and all his thoughts have a reference to the atonement . The Person of Christ is the centre of every truth , and the Mediation of Christ is the circumference of every truth . In him all truths live , move , and have their being . The atonement magnifies and honours every truth implied in the reality of the exercise of a moral government in the world . It supposes and distinctly recognizes the verity and the reality of the sinfulness and ruin of mankind . It is itself a proof and a specimen of the truth of the introduction into the divine government of a compensative scheme for the purpose of restoring sinful man . It exhibits the honest sincerity of the divine invitation addressed to sinners in the clear light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most splendid evidence of the truth and certainty of the promises of the gospel , and gives the most solemn assurances of the reality of spiritual blessings . Thus there is no class of truths which may not be either proved or explained by the principles of the atonement . And there is no class of truths which does not lose weight and eflSicacy by being severed from the person of Christ . Every truth separated /q/ from Christ , like a branch lopped from the living tree , loses its freshness and beauty , and languishes and dies . The providence of God has given us melancholy instances of the corruption and unwholesomeness to which any truth tends when apart from Christ . See the high and noble truths of the Old Testament - truths which elevated the minds of Abraham and Moses , which ravished the heart of David , and which timed Isaiah 's harp to the high pitch of even gospel times - look at them , in every age of the Jews , from the time of Malachi to the present day - look at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turgid puerilities of modem Judaism , and you will perceive how much they have lost of sanctity , dignity , and energy ; and how void , and powerless , and lifeless they have become . " How is the fine gold become dim ? " How will you account for this painful circumstance in the history of divine truth ? One awful fact explains the whole . The Jews have alienated these glorious truths from the vital connexion with the sacrificial atonement of Messiah , " the Christ of God . " Look again at the great and mighty truths of the New Testament . See them in their healthiness , vigour , and beauty , in the ministrations of the apostles , in the religious affections of the primitive churches , in the masculine energies of the Reformation , and in the glow and power of modem Revivals . Then look at them in the ice-bound realms of Socinian theology , and how wan , and cold , and dead , /z/ and putrid axe they ! If they glow , - it is not with the charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth of controversial heat . If they move , it is not with the vigorous stirrings of an internal vitality , but with the galvanic convulsions of a fitful elocution . If they preserve their form and fashion , it is because a cold and indurating philosophy has embalmed them . They are the same truths , but they have been separated and banished from Christ , whose person is the Sun of Revelation , and whose atonement is the Heaven of Truth . The Lord Jesus Christ is represented in the scriptures as the Magazine and Repository of all truth , in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . There is not a truth pertaining to God and man , to eternity and time , but is connected with him . To the enquiry of the church and of the world , " What is truth ? " the Mediator replies , " I am THE TRUTH . " The truth is in Jesus as it is in no one else . In no one else is the truth perfect , complete , and full . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else is every truth : every truth in its due proportions ; every truth in all its power and bearings ; every truth , in full harmony with every other truth . In Christ is , the truth , the truth completely , and the truth exclusively . Tlie truth as it is in Jesus is sincere without falsehood , genuine without counterfeit , steady without perfidy , real without fiction , exact without error . In him it is right without any wrong , honest without fraud , perfect without mutilation . /q/ It is this connexion of every truth with the mediation of Christ , that makes real Christianity to be not afraid of the progress of any class of truths . Sometimes in the infancy of any given Science , plausible theories are advanced as having a tone of contradiction to Scriptural verities , but the discipline of a mature philosophy never fails to show that the contradiction is not real . Truth in man , is partial , sectarian , and jealous ; but Truth in the Christian system is full , universal and free ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the mighty ocean dreads the digging up of new wells , or the Sun the new discoveries of Optics . IV . The atonement is inseparably connected with all practical truth . The atonement is the centre of duties , as well as of doctrines . This is clearly proved and illustrated in the Apostolic epistles . The New Testament writers , after laying down the " doctrine of the cross , " &#9632; erect a peerless structure of holy duties , and practical truths . They exhibit the atonement as establishing every duty required in the moral law ; and they preach the moral law as establishing every duty required in the Gospel . The atonement " destroys " no moral command . It " makes void " no moral duty . The gospel of the atonement brings a new class of duties to bear on the sinner , as , believing in Christ , repenting for sin , &c.; These are duties which the moral law , as such , never could ask of any man . But now , since the provisions of the divine govem- /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered all the ends of the law , the law unites with the gospel in making them obligatory upon every sinner who hears them . Some declared foes , and some false Mends of the atonement have represented it as destroying all practical truth and duty . The atonement on the contrary distinctly recognizes all the practical truths of the moral law as still binding on all - shows the reasonableness of the demands of those practical truths , - and enforces them with an accumulated amount of arguments and motives . The gospel connects every practical truth with the atonement of Jesus Christ . Observe how the apostles teach the most plain and common duties of life ; such as the duties of husbiemds and wives , the duties of parents and children , the duties of masters and servants , of kings and subjects , &c.; To enforce these duties , they do not go for argiunents to the law of nature , to the claims of relationship , or to political economy ; nor do they confine themselves to the moral law . No , they go at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love their wives because Christ loved his church , and servants are to obey their masters that they may adorn the doctrine of God their Savioui* in all things . They teach that these practical truths are to be performed by the assistance of the grace of Christ ; that the practice of such truths is to be the effect of faith in Christ ; that these duties are to be done in /q/ the name of Christ ; that they are acceptable to God only through the merits of Christ ; and that they will be rewarded by Jesus Christ himself . Jn duties as well as in doctrineiS , the apostles knew nothing but Christ , and him crucified . It was the Cross of Christ that gave the name and the designation to their system - it was " the preaching of the cross . " The opponents of practical truth they called , " the enemies of the cross of Christ ; " and the renunciation of holy duties , they regarded as making " the cross of Christ of none effect . " If these hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of connexion between the entire circle of truth , - whether in predictions and types , or in doctrines and duties , - and the great atonement of Christ , their end will be answered . /z/ A limited Atonement inconsistent with the whole System of Divine Truth . I. An atonement limited to a certain number of sinners is inconsistent with the truths revealed in the prophecies of the Old Testament . Scriptural prophecy supplies us with the best specimens of the theological principles of the church of God under the patriarchal and Jewish dispensations . It should be borne in mind , that the prophets promulgated their principles and sentiments , " as they were moved by the Holy Ghost ; " and that , consequently , their doctrine was " the mind of the Spirit . " These holy /z/ men of God seem sometimes not to have understood at once the fulness , the extent , and the majesty of the stupendous doctrines which they announced . They therefore investigated , " enquired , and searched diligently what the Spirit of Christ , which was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow . " Such a * diligent search , ' conducted under such auspices would be likely to terminate in a correct knowledge of the truth of the case . These doctrines of prophecy , Jesus Christ himself opened and expounded as teaching that he ought to suffer , and enter into his glory . These are the very doctrines which the apostles preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; and it is into these doctrines that the angels desire to look . These doctrines , therefore , deserve to be regarded by us , in this enquiry , as legitimate sources of information on the theological creeds of the Jewish prophets . The true doctrines of the prophets teach that the benefits of the death of Christ were of universal extent . It was prophesied that in the Seed of Abraham , that is , in Christ , all the nations of the earth should be blessed . Gen. xx . 18 . Gal . iii . 16 . The meaning of this is , that Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unto all the nations of mankind . In harmony with this are the very numerous prophecies which relate to the call of the Gentiles . Isaiah predicted that God gave his Son to be a Salvation unto the end of the earth , Isa. xlix . /q/ 6 . Joel prophesied that the influences of the Spirit should be " poured upon all flesh , " Joel ii . 28 , 29 . The aspect of the whole of the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah , - an epitome of the divinity of the prophets - is unlimited and universal . The word " all " has often been most uncandidly and dishonourably tortured and wrested , to mean a generality of kinds and degrees , and not a universality of the mass of the human race . Prophecy , how ever , supplies us with one text at least , that has bid stubborn defiance to all theological tortures . It is Isa. liii. 6 , " ALL we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way , and the Lord hath laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the advocates of particular atonement have challenged their opponents to present one single text in which the word " a/q/ " means indisputably every individual of the human race . Here it is . The word " all " in the last part of the sentence means the " all " mentioned in the first part ; and both mean the " every one , " in the middle portion of the verse . If you apply to the word " all " in the first sentence , the torturous criticisms which are generally employed on the word " all " in the last sentence , you ofiend equally against sound interpretation , theological fairness , and logical deduction . Let us now see how these doctrinal prophecies were understood by the apostles who preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven . Peter , after " enquiring " into the testimony of Moses and " all /z/ the prophets from Samuel , and those that follow after , " uses these remarkable words ; " Ye are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * and in thy seed , shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed . Unto you first , God having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities , ' " Acts iii . 25 , 26 . A preacher who did not view the mediation of Christ in all its amplitude and extent would have used a language much more cautious and measured . He again says , " of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons , but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him . The word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ , ( He is Lord of all ) - to him gave all the prophets witness , that through his name whosoever believeth in him , shall receive remission of sins , " Acts xl 34 , 35 , 36 , 43 . Paul preached to Jews and Gentiles every where " that they should repent and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yet he says , that he had learnt this universal call from the doctrines of the prophets . " Having therefore obtained help of God , I continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come , " Acts xxvi. 20 , 22 , Many more passages of this kind might be cited , but these are sufficient to show that , in the judgment /q/ of the apostles , the doctrines of the prophets taught a universality of design in the Mediatorial undertaking of the Messiah . It was a leading object of the apostles ' ministry to prove , against the sectarian limitations of the Jewish expositors of their day , that the blessings announced in prophecy had a designed relation to all the nations of the earth . The prophecies that predict the final results which the atonement shall infallibly produce , do not weaken the others which describe its universal aspect . The same prophet that asserts that " the Son of God shall see his seed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , " takes up the language of blame , and remonstrates with the disobedient , " Who hath believed our report ? and to whom is the Lord revealed ? " The Spirit of prophecy plainly foretells that the mediation of Christ will not produce the same effects on all , that is , that it will not have its intended effects upon all to whom it shall be exhibited . It is foretold that Christ and his atonement will be " despised and rejected of men " - be a " stone of stumbling and a rock of offence , " and " the stone which the builders refused . " These disastrous effects are not the consequences of a limitation in the design of the atonement , but they result , from a deliberate and an obstinate noncompliance with the great purposes of the atonement . The men who reject Christ dislike the atonement . They stumble and are offended at the principles involved in it - the principles of the goodness of the /z/ law , the wickedness of sin , and salvation by grace , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hear the apostle Peter 's exposition of this prophecy . " A stone of stumbling and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient , whereunto also they were appointed , " 1 Pet . ii . 4 - 8 . God exhibits his Son as the foundation of salvation to men . In this character he is " disallowed of men , " - they will not submit to it , but are " disobedient " to the arrangement . As they will not comply and obey , they " stumble , " and fall , and perish , and that , according to the " appointed " order of the provision . Are we from this to infer that they were appointed to disobey and stumble ? What ? - that they were appointed to " disallow " Christ , and yet be blamed and punished for it ? The passage teaches no such thing . It is an " appointment " of the constitution of providence that whosoever will not eat food will die . Will any one argue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to eat food ? Such an inference would unsettle every wheel in providence . - It is an " appointment " of the dispensation of the atonement that whosoever will not receive this remedy , will die and perish . Is it therefore sane and logical to argue that there are human beings " appointed " not to take the remedy ? Not so did Peter understand it . He says that , " in preaching peace by Jesus Christ , God is no respecter of persons . " And again he says , ' * God hath showed me that I should not call /q/ any man common or unclean , " that is , God has taught me that in my ministry I should not deem any one man an outcast decretively excluded from the benefits of the atonement of the Gospel . From such premises the inference is fair , that an atonement limited to a certain number , is at variance with the truths in the prophetical doctrines concerning the extent of the Messiah 's mediation . 2 . A limited atonement is inconsistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and extent of the redemption of Christ . The divine ordinance of sacrifice , revealed to Adam and Eve , was as open and accessible to Cain , and as available for him , as it was in the case of Abel . God himself ajppealed to Cain 's personal knowledge of such an arrangement . " If thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted , " Gen. iv . 7 . Doing well , here means , doing like Abel , that is , offering a sacrifice for his sins , in obedience to the divine arrangement . In acting thus , he would do well and be accepted . Here was no sovereign limitation , no decretive exclusion . God acted upon the same general principle towards the antediluvians in the provision of an Ark for their safety . The aspect of this expedient was of a universal character . All were invited to come to the ark : and the rejecters are blamed for not seeking safety in it . The apostle in his epistle to the Hebrews says , that Noah 's ministry concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible /z/ to show how any could be condemned for not being saved in the ark , if the ark was never verily intended for them , and if they were never sincerely invited and pressed to come into it . The sacrifice which Noah , after the flood , offered to God , presents a distinct and a bold outline of many of the great principles of the true Atonement ; especially , of its universal extent . The sacrifice of Noah was offered to propitiate the favour of God towards the interests of a ruined world . Through God 's satisfaction in this sacrifice , ' he confers the grant of the whole world upon Noah , and promises blessings to all the unnumbered nations and generations of the entire world . The world since then has awfully abounded in sins and evils , but still God is distributing the treasures of his goodness with a bountiful hand . All this is to be traced to his infinite pleasure expressed through the " sweet savour " of Noah 's sacrifice . It was through this sacrifice that the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed-time and harvest , summer and winter , to the end of the world . Men may , indeed , neglect both " seed-time and harvest , " but they can not ascribe their conduct to any excluding or limiting decree . The apostle Paul seems to refer to this very sacrifice as an adumbration of the atonement of Jesus Christ , " who gave himself for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour , " Eph. v. 2 . It is through this true sacrifice that every blessing comes to our world . It is in /q/ Christ that God reconciles the world to himself without dealing with it according to its sins . It is on account of the mediatorial atonement that God gives to his Son the heathen for his inheritance , and the uttermosfparts of the earth for his possession . Take another prefiguration of the unlimited extent of the atonement of Christ in the provision of the Brazen Serpent . The sacred scriptures inform us of the designed extent , and of the actual result of this expedient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole ; and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten , when he looketh upon it , shall live . And Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it came to pass , that if a serpent had bitter any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass , Ac lived . " Num. xxi. 8 , 9 . The design of this expedient was not limited to those who " looked , " but it extended to all who were " bitten . " If any bitten did not " look , " they could not ascribe their death to an exclusiveness in the provision , but to fheir own conduct . The Lord Jesus Christ considered this provision as an apt illustration of the extent of his own atonement . " As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explains and confirms , by asserting in the 1 7th verse , " that the world through him might be saved . " This universality is further shadowed forth in the /z/ sacrifices appointed by the Jewish law , especially by the lamb of the daily offering , and by the sacrifice offered up at the yearly feast of expiation . Num. xxviii. 3 , 4 . Lev . xvi . 7 - 34 . It is in is in this character that John the Baptist describes Christ as " the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the worldy ' * plainly impljdng that there was the same relation between the atonement of Christ and all the inhabitants of the world , as there was between the lamb of the burnt off*ering and the whole of the Jewish nation . It is in reference to this that the apostle John in his Apocalyptic visions describes the atonement of Christ as a Lamb in the midst of the throne of God , " that is , connected with all the measures appointed by the throne , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great day of the annual expiation the atonement of the scape-goat was offered unto the Lord . This atonement had a universal influence upon all the interests of all the Jewish tribes . The provision runs thus : " And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat , and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel , and all their transgressions in all their sin - and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited . " And again , " The Priest shall make an atonement for the priests , and for all the people of the congregation : and this shall /q/ be an everlasting statute unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year . " These sacrifices of the Jews were related to ihem ally were designedly offered up for all , and were truly available to all . The atonement effected by them was unlimited in design and aspect . This ceremonial atonement did not consist in the sacrificial victim suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitutionary sufferings ; for the blasphemer was to be stoned to death , but the sacrifice for him was not to die by stoning . Lev . xxvi. 16 . V. 4 - 6 . Nor did the Jewish atonement consist in inflicting upon the victim a certain amount of torture and pain , in proportion to the number and enormity of the sins to be expiated . The instructions which Moses gave concerning these sacrifices are distinct , minute , and even punctilious ; but there is not a jot nor a tittle in them all to warrant an opinion held by some , that Christ would have had to suffer more , had there been more to be saved ; and less , had the number of the elect been less . Universal as was the bearing of these sacrifices , yet they were susceptible* of failure . They might fail of their design , not through a deficiency of extensiveness in them , but through the voluntary neglect or misimprovement of those for whom they were offered . The atonement offered on the great day of annual expiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of Israel . " Lev . xvi . 22 . This , the atonement would effectually ac- /z/ complish to all those who , according to the arrange* ments of that atonement , afflicted their souls , and did no maimer of work on that day . " ' If it was offered designedly for all the tribes , will it not infallibly secure all its ends to all the tribes ? No ; " For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in contrition in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people , * and that notwithstanding the atonement offered for him . Lev . xxiii. 27 . The Jews , when they saw these persons " cut off , " because they neglected the provisions of the atonement , never thought of arguing that the atonement was never designed for them . It seems to me , then , that all the leading principles of the Old Testament tjrpes and shadows , are opposed to the doctrine that limits the atonement of Christ to a certain amount of sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The opinion that the atonement was designed for a few only , is opposed to the entire system of doctrinal truths revealed in the scriptures . A full discussion of this proposition would require a volume , rather than a page or two ; my limits therefore will only allow me to supply a few hints of proof and elucidation . Were this opinion consistent with scriptural doctrine , it would be possible to express it in scriptural language . At least the spirit and the animus of the opinion would be found in scriptural statements , if not the letter and the form of it . Let any one find the " holy text " that will justify such language as the following : " Christ died for /q/ tiie elect , and the elect only . " He gave himself a ransom for the sheep only " Whom he predestinated , them he also purchased , and whom he purchased , them he also called . " No ; there is no rule in Biblical language that will account for such a dialect as this . Let any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not die for every man . Let some class of sinners be pointed out to us which the scriptures declare to be unatoned , and unredeemed , or unransomed . Let any abettor of a limited atonement search and try to embody his opinion in some express declaration of scriptures . /z/ sudet muUum , friistraque laboret . Ausus idem . As this opinion can not be expressed in scriptm'al language , as it can not be pronounced in " words which the Holy Ghost teacheth , " so likewise it can not be made to run parallel and to tally with scriptural doctrines . To give an enumeration of the doctrines opposed by this opinion , would be to furnish a catalogue of all the truths of revelation . All the doctrinal truths of the scriptures may be divided into two classes , viz. truths contained in the principles of divine moral government , and truths revealed in the promises of the gospel : and a limited atonement strikes against them all . Let a few examples suffice . By disputing the reality of the Moral Governor 's wish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his truth , and comply with his laws ; - by /z/ denying that all men axe bound , on the principles of individual accountableness , to accept of Jesus Christ as their Saviour , - by pleading that the elect , whose debts are supposed to have been paid , be saved , as the moral law can never reach them again ; and by asserting that a vast number of souls shall be sorely punished for not doing what they had no power to do , and for not accepting what was verily never intended for them - this opinion militates against every truth in the principles of moral government . It clashes equally with all the truths revealed in the gospel . The gospel declares that by the " true ' * grace of God , Christ tasted death for every man ; but by the false grace of this pretended theology , Christ tasted death only for some . The scriptural gospel addresses a message to every creature to believe in Christ , to every man every where to repent , but the invitation addressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and select . It sometimes , indeed , feigns to take up the terms of a general call into ' its dialect , but its general call is founded not upon the truth of the fact that Christ is a propitiation for all , but , upon a peradventure that perhaps there may be some among the hearers whom God may call . It impeaches the gospel of insincerity , and gives a character of uncertainty to all its offers . It exhibits the grace of God as ostentatiously giving a free and gerous invitation to all men , to come and share in the feast of its provisions , while according to the real truth of the case , it sincerely intends that only a few should /q/ partake . Many a trembling sinner , living under the public ministrations of this theology has thought that , perhaps ke was meant in the gracious invitation , that possibly he might venture to hope that Christ would receive him . Now , in the scriptural doctrine , Christ says " Whosoever will , let him come , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the business of the abettors of this other doctrine is , to declare that this cheering assurance is not to be received in the latitude and extent expressed . The opinion of a limited atonement is unnecessary either to the support or to the elucidation of any scriptural doctrine . Many , I conceive , have taken up this opinion from an apprehension that it is essentially necessary to the truth of such doctrines as the sovereignty of divine grace , the limited intercession of Christ , and the certainty that the Son of God shall not lose his reward . But this opinion is utterly unnecessary to the maintenance of these doctrines . The doctrine of gracious sovereignty is clearly asserted in the scriptures , and daily acted upon in the affairs of providence , and the government of the world . Take , for instance , the doctrine of predestination to life . This doctrine derives no support from the opinion that Christ died only for the elect . No one example can be given of the holy scriptures expressing any thing like the sentiment that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ might die for them , and for them alone . Yet the doctrine of sovereign elec- /z/ tion is not at all weaJsened by the absence of such aa assertion . It is true that Christ died that he anight redeem us from all iniquity , and in order to purify unto himself a peculiar people . This expresses only one end , and one result of the atonement . Even this text does not so much as hint that Christ redeemed any because they were a peculiar people . It should also be remembered that the apostle gives this very text as an illustration of the grace that bringeth salvation unto all men . Tit. ii . 14 - 11 . As an instance how easily things are taken for granted , I might mention that thousands have taken the opinion of a limited atonement to be one of the doctrines of Calvinism . But Calvinism it is not . At least it is not the Calvinism of Calvin 's Institutes , nor , I believe of Calvin 's Expositions . I have consulted the Institutes for the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one passage that asserted any such doctrine as that Christ died for the elect only , or that he did not die for the reprobates . We might now then reverse the advice of Horsley and say , " Let those who boast in the name of Calvin know what Calvinism is . " Again by the same process of easy assumption it has been received as a settled point that the doctrine of the universality of the death of Christ is rank PelagiANiSM . Bishop Davenant , on the contrary , has shown in his Dissertation* on t6e Extent of the &#9830; The Dissertatio de Morte Christi has lately been ably translated into English by the Rev. Josiah Allport , and /q/ Death of Christ , that so far from this being a doctrine peculiar to Pelagius , it was the dolctrine of all the Fathers before the rise of Pelagianism , and the doctrine of even Augustine himself , the masterly champion of predestination against Pelagius . Well then , without enumerating the writers of the New Testament , and a goodly company of other names renowned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ablest and the most strenuous advocates of divine sovereignty , thought the doctrine of predestination safe and invulnerable , without the abutment of particular atonement . A limited atonement is as unnecessary to the doctrine of sovereign influences , as it is to the doctrine of predestination . The scriptures never ascribe the sovereignty of divine influences to a predestinated limitation in the provisions of the atonement . It is never assigned as a reason for the communication of divine influences to any person , that that person was one of the number for whom Christ died . The absence of divine influences from nations and individuals is never accounted for on the ground that Christ had not died for them . Our friends themselves believe that there are instances of the withdrawment of gracious influences from chiurches and appended to his translation of * Bp . Davenant 's Exposition of the Eiistle to the Colossians . ' Davenant on the Death of Christ , ' deserves a diligent perusal from every student of the doctrine of atonement . It abounds in sound criticism , and powerful reasoning . n2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will they say that divine influences stopped at the boundary which limited the atonement ? that they stopped because the merits of the death of Christ stopped ? that the current of divine influence could proceed no longer , as hitherto the channel of the atonement went , and no further ? Will they say that the influences of the spirit were withdrawn from the churches of Asia minor , because there were no more people there for whom Christ died ? No . The scriptures never teach that divine communicationg are confined or withdrawn , because the atonement is limited or bounded . And it is triumphantly proved by the history of the Christian church , that the most powerful defenders of the doctrine of divine influences have been found among those divines who were the most pertinacious advocates of universal atonement . The Umitation of the intercession of Christ is not owing to a limitation in his atonement . The scriptures nowhere say so . It is never hinted that the persons for whom Christ does not intercede , are persons for whom he did not die ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons for whom he died . The aspect of his intercession ' is as wide as the aspect of his atonement . He makes intercession for all believers , that through them the WORLD might know that God sent him ; and for the world to know Jesus Christ whom God hath sent , is life everlasting . The ability of Christ to intercede for all is limited , in the same manner as Gods ability /q/ to answer the prayers of all . The atonement limits neither of them . They are limited on other principles . God has never undertaken to answer prayers and requests which are never addressed to him , an Christ has never undertaken to plead causes which have never been committed to him . Nothing can be more unlimited than this declaration : ' If any man sin , we have an advocate - who is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world . Neither is this opinion necessary to prove the certainty that Christ shall not lose his reward . A limited atonement can never prove it . The proofs of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , the counsel , and the faithfulness of God . There are many circumstances in this hypothesis which render it too weak to support the glorious doctrine raised on it . 1 . It supposes that the reward of Christ consists principally , if not entirely , in a numerical salvation of souls ; whereas there are other elements in his reward , e. . , the glory of the divine perfections , the vindication of the eternal law , his infinite joy in all this , &c.; &c.; 2 . It takes for granted that the atonement has no ends answered in the destruction of those who reject it , whereas it is a sweet savour unto God even in them that perish , 3 . It supposes that Christ is sure of his reward only on commercial principles , that as he has paid so much suffering for so many souls , God must in commutative justice recompense him in return quid pro quOy " * which entirely destroys the morality of the /z/ atonement . Christ is never said to be sure of some because he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth , when they say , " Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood ; " but this does not imply , nor is there any other text that implies that those who are not in heaven , are not there , because Christ had not redeemed them with his blood . This train of reasoning convinces my mind that the hypothesis of particular atonement , is a body foreign to the system of divine doctrines , as revealed in the scriptures . IV . It remains for me to show , that a limited atonement is inconsistent with the system of practical truth as revealed in the scriptures . The scriptjires sum up all practical truth in loving God with all the heart , and loving our neighbour as ourselves . No theological system has ever yet said , in express words , that it is not the duty of all men to love God with all the heart . But let any one take his position within the magic circle of this limited hypothesis , and let him try to inculcate the duty of love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he use ? What motives can he exhibit ? He may amuse them with the metaphysical prolusion that men should love God on account of what He is ; but he will never teach them the New Testament language , " We love Him becatise He first loved us . " Or from his position let him try to preach , that men ought to love their neighbours as themselves , and to /q/ do unto others as they would that others should do unto them . In the whole history of theologians , no one has ever yet been found who would have admired particular redemption , had he believed himself to be one of the excluded reprobates . There are , however , many duties required of all men towards Christ , which could only arise from the fact , that Jesus Christ had died for them . I will present a few as samples . " Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved . " This is addressed to every man who hears the gospel . One man will not be saved by believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter did not call on the sinners of Jerusalem to believe , on the ground , that for ought they knew Christ had died for them : but he assiures them , that if they believe , there is in Christ a salvation " provided for them , " God now commandeth all men , every where , to repent . " Does the scripture any where show that God requires a repentance that has no connexion with the atonement of his Son ? There is no motive for any sinner to repent , unless there be an atonement for him . Yet God commands every man , every where , to repent . The repentance of any man will not be available except through an atonement for that man ; therefore , a call from God to every man , must be founded on an atonement for every man , in propria persond , Peter teaches Simon Magus , " Pray God , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven /z/ thee ** Prayer goes to the throne of grace , - but God has no throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Simon Magus to do with the throne of grace and prayer , if Christ did not die for him ? Woiild he not have been a thief and a robber to go and draw on provisions which had never been intended for him ? Yet the doctrine of the apostle teaches him to pray for pardon - though God can grant no pardon , and hear no prayer , but through the death of his Son . Paul inculcates the duty of love to Christ at the peril of being Anathema Maranatha , in case of neglecting it . My duty to love God arises , not from the fact that he made my neighbour , but from the fact that He made me . And my duty to love Christ arises , not from the fact that he died for my neighbour , but from the fact that he diedybr me . Now , the apostle uses the terms of a general message - " if any man loves not the Lord Jesus Christ . " If any man , and every man , is to love Christ at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Redeemer , and Saviour ; for the gospel would never pronounce any sinner accursed for not loving Christ as his Redeemer , if the fact were , that Christ never had redeemed that sinner . The same apostle , in 1 Tim . ii . 1 - 6 , teaches that supplications , prayers , and intercessions , should be made for all men . Why ? Because God wills that all men should be saved ; and , because Christ gave himself a ransom for all . We can not pray for
