txt IT is nearly four centuries since the art of Engraving was discovered , and a steady improvement may be discerned from that time up to the present day . The nineteenth century is rich in the productions of this beautiful branch of the fine arts . From every civilized land volumes are annually poured forth , illustrated and adorned in a manner which does indeed make antiquity appear rude . Men of genius are devoting themselves to the practice of the art , and do not disdain to perpetuate and spread over the world , by the burine , the inspired design which their pencil has traced . The noble works of the great masters are now no longer the exclusive property of a single spot , or a few individuals . They are given to the world , literally published for the benefit of society , and sent abroad into every land , to delight the taste and to inspire the genius of all nations . The art of engraving is not , indeed , to be ranked on a level with that of painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or event to be represented , the grouping of the figures , the imagination of forms and countenances , all that belongs to creative power , is displayed in the original design . But still there is left a work for the engraver , demanding a high order of talent . How laborious , delicate , and minute is his labor ; how fine , how almost imperceptible , are the millions of strokes , to which the finest hair seems coarse how infinite the gradation from the deep and dark shadows to the delicate touch , on which the ink is to be laid so sparingly that the black shall literally appear white ! And yet how bold and decided must his touch be ; life , and even a glow of fire , all the varied expressions of the " human face divine , " all the spirit that can light up the most gorgeous painting , must be transmitted through the graver . And more than this . The engraver is often called upon to improve upon his copy ; to give , perhaps , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roundness , grace , and fire of life ; to supply strength and boldness , to give dignity and sentiment , to inspire the quaintness of ancient art with the grace of a better period , and at the same time to preserve the Gothic and sublime simplicity of the original . In addition to this , in most of the copies which engravers are called upon to make , they are obliged to diminish very greatly the size of the piece . And , in doing this , they must not only give a much greater degree of delicacy to the work , and devote much more time to minute detail , but they must carefully preserve the original proportions of the piece . Finally , the engraver must , merely by the management of his lines , convey , in some degree at least , the idea of color . For engraving seems , in this respect , to be the point of meeting between painting and sculpture . It does not exclude the idea of color , like statuary , which consults form alone . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet it must convey the notion of different hues , because otherwise no small portion of its purposes would be unfulfilled . The variety of subjects is much greater for engraving than for sculpture . It is intended to represent familiar and domestic scenes . It is not confined to austere and dignified representations . It enters into every sphere of life , every occupation , from the splendid dramas of the palace and the gorgeous array of the church , to the interior of the hovel , the ale-house , and the stable . To exclude the idea of color from such representations would destroy the effect . Yet this can be conveyed in engravings only by implication or suggestion ; by so managing the width and direction of the lines , that we suppose one color to be represented in one place , another in another place , and so on . This power of the art is remarkably displayed in engravings of landscapes , in which the various hues of nature may be readily suggested to the imagination . All the varieties of foliage , even blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , the gleam of the parting sun upon the waters , even the gorgeous drapery of the sunset sky , may be pictured by this charming art . In speaking of the power of engraving , we must not omit to notice its beautiful adaptation to imitate that most difficult branch of painting , the representation of flesh-color . Here engraving seems to achieve its highest triumph . Every // variety of the appearance of flesh , the beautiful smoothness and delicacy of youth , the rough and wrinkled look of age , the hard and weather-worn visage of the seaman , the bright glow of childhood , and the softness of infancy , may be all conveyed by the engraver with scarcely less distinctness than in the finished painting . Another very important and difficult office of the art is to convey , in the copies from paintings , a correct idea of the style of each great master ; for the capacities of the art undoubtedly are sufficient for this purpose . In effecting this important object , it is obvious , that the engraver must be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate the outline and the shading , to preserve on a smaller scale the just proportions of the original , to convey a notion of the coloring , to give the same expression to countenances , and the same finish to all the detail . A higher order of talent is required in the engraver . He must he able to comprehend and appreciate the genius of the master , whose work is before him . He must understand the feelings which inspired him at the moment when he was pouring out his soul upon the canvass . He must know the enthusiasm that stirred him up , the profound sentiment that filled his heart , the devotion , piety , and ardor , with which he applied himself to the work . He must catch a spark of that heavenly ilame , which burned in the soul of the great artist , and kindled into life the portraiture upon his canvass . In this way alone can he give to his work that nameless and ethereal charm , which , more than any thing else , distinguishes the works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of engraving ; an art , which we consider perfect in its kind , that is , accomplishing all the objects which it professes to undertake , as completely as any of the fine arts . The editor of Horace Walpole 's " Catalogue of Engravers * remarks , that " want of coloring is the capital deficience of prints . " But we think he is entirely mistaken in this respect . Engravings , as we have endeavoured to show , do possess the property of coloring hy suggestion , and this is one of the distinguishing beauties of the art . To color a fine engraving , which is fully finished with all the depth and variety of shading , seems to us little less barbarous than to paint a fine statue . Though wood engraving is very different from copperplate , it seems worth while to notice it in treating of this subject , // as it has recently become an object of considerable attention , and has undergone great improvement . Wood engraving is much like printing , the figures being raised from the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is exactly opposite to engraving on copper or steel , and it was in use a considerable time before the process of taking impressions from copper plates was discovered . It has been asserted , that a series of drawings , representing the exploits of Alexander , were designed and executed in wood by Alessandro Cunio and his twin sister , in the latter part of the thirteenth century . But this bas been disputed . It is certain , however , that the art was practised a few years later , as there is a print from a wood-cut in the possession of Earl Spencer , representing St. Christopher , and bearing the date of 1423 . The discovery of the art of engraving on metal , for the purpose of making impressions on paper , is generally ascribed to Finiguerra , a goldsmith of Florence . He excelled in an art , then much practised in Florence , called niello . It was the custom with jewellers , in those times , to engrave the outlines of Scripture subjects upon the vessels which they made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they filled the lines with a black substance com* posed of a mixture of lead and silver , in solution with borax and sulphur ; and impressions were taken from this in clay or sulphur . The black substance used was called niello ; and hence the name of the art . The same process was also used when pieces of armour , household plate , and other articles were engraved for the purpose of being inlaid with metals , wood , or ivory . Painters were employed to make designs for this kind of engraving , and impressions were taken in clay or sulphur , both for the convenience of the artist as he proceeded in his work , and for distribution among his friends . It occurred to Finiguerra , that the impression might be made on paper instead of clay ; and he proceeded to make the experiment , wetting the paper and applying it gently with a roller . Impressions are still preserved in some of the nuseums of Italy , taken upon paper , and easily recognised by the inscriptions being reversed ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1803 , a print entitled " The first impression from an engraving by Maso // Finiguerra in 1452 . " Some Italian writers , with considerable show of reason , place the epoch of Finiguerra ' s invention as early as 1440 , or a short time before . German writers claim the honor of the invention for a citizen of Antwerp , Martin Schoengaur , asserting that he practised the art before Finiguerra . It seems probable , that it appeared nearly simultaneously in both countries . The earliest distinguished engravers after the discovery of the art , however , were Italians . It does not appear , that Finiguerra pursued his invention any further than to take impressions on paper instead of clay . A contemporary , of the same profession and city , Baccio Baldini , improved upon the invention by engraving on plates for the express purpose of taking impressions . He was greatly assisted by a distinguished painter , Antonio Pollajuolo , who furnished him with designs for his engravings , and also by another artist , Sandro Botticelli , who made a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of Dante , published in 1488 , and supposed to be the first book ever embellished with copperplate engravings ; though this notion has been proved false by a German writer . The works of Baldini attracted the attention of a Roman engraver , Andrea iViantegna , who had already become distinguished as one of the most successful of the niellatori . This artist not only assisted Baldini with original designs , but also turned his own efforts to the promotion of the newlydiscovered art , in which he soon became a proficient . Roscoe says of him , that his prints display considerable power of invention and expression of character , even bordering upon grace and elegance . The drawing is generally correct , and sometimes exhibits great freedom and spirit . His engravings are distinguished by the shadows being formed by diagonal lines , not crossed as in more recent prints . In our notice of the early days of the art , we must not omit mentioning Albert Durer , one of the earliest Dutch engravers . Some knowledge of the art seems to have been previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some German writers , as we have seen , to have invented it , and who was certainly a contemporary of Finiguerra . The works of Martin , and his disciple Wolgemuth , inspired the genius of Albert Durer , who did much for the improvement of the art , excelling equally on copper and on // wood . Among his most famous works are portraits of the Emperor Maximilian ; of Albert , Elector of Mentz ; of Philip Melancthon ; a full length of Erasmus , who is represented standing at a desk , writing ; a head of Ulric Vambuler , of the size of life ; and a portrait of himself . He also executed a series of engravings on wood , thirty-six in number , representing scenes from the life of our Saviour . We have mentioned these prints , because they exercised an important influence on the career of a young Italian , who was now successfully cultivating the same art , and who was destined to carry it to a much higher degree of excellence . Marc-Antonio Rairnondi was born at Bologna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was early distinguished for his works in niello , but seems to have made no attempts at regular engraving until his attention was directed to it by accident . Having taken a journey to Venice , he saw for sale the set of prints , by Albert iDurer , representing the life of our Saviour . These prints were held in high estimation , and sold at a very great price ; but the young artist was so much tempted by them , that he could not refrain from the purchase , though it completely exhausted his funds . In order to repair his fortunes , he immediately began to make copies of Durer 's pieces , which he executed with so much success in copper , that he was able to sell them in Venice , as originals by Durer . The latter , as Vasari tells the story , in his " Lives of Painters , " on hearing of the fraud , immediately repaired to Venice , and complained to the Senate of the injury ; but obtained no other satisfaction , than a decree forbidding Marc-Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durer . From Venice , Marc-Antonio went to Rome , where he had the good fortune to become acquainted with Raphael , who was then residing there . Having made an engraving from Raphael 's Lucretia , he caused it to be shown to the artist , who immediately perceived the great advantage which he should enjoy by means of this invention , in having his works spread over the world ; and from this time Antonio found his chief occupation in copying the works of this great master , receiving from him many useful hints and directions , so that the art was greatly improved by his labors . His reputation was soon established throughout Italy , and his school was resorted to by numerous disciples ; among whom were Marco da Ravenna , Agostino Veneziano , and Giulio Bonasone , who // were almost as accomplished and successful as their teacher , and did much to improve the taste of Europe . The art was thus firmly established in Italy and in Holland . The first kind which was practised was the line engraving , as would naturally be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is worthy of note , that , although many other ways have been adopted for cutting the copper , the earliest method is still used for the most costly and elaborate works . A short account of the different modes of engraving may not be uninteresting to our readers . rI*l*e principal instruments , used for line engraving , are the graver , the scraper , the burnisher , and the steel point . The graver is a piece of hardened steel , four or five inches long , having four sides , and varying from three sixteenths to one sixteenth of an inch in thickness , the sides forming a right or acute angle according as the lines are to be cut bold or delicate , and is cut off obliquely at the end to give a sharp point at one of the corners . The handle is of wood , or cork , shaped somewhat like the handle of a common screw-driver , but much shorter . The scraper is a long , triangular piece of steel , regularly diminishing from the handle to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an oilstone , and are used for removing the burr , or roughness occasioned by cutting the plate with the graver , and also for erasing erroneous lines . The third instrument is the burnisher , which is a hard , round , and highly polished piece of steel , used for rubbing out any little dots or scratches which occur in the copper . The steel point , set in a wooden handle , is also used for etching , and for some of the delicate work , technically called dry-pointing , which the graver could not so well be made to perform . The present usual process for line engraving is as follows . The plate , being properly prepared , the work is commenced by what is called etching , which is thus performed . The p ! ate is covered with a thin ground or varnish , composed of asphaltum , gum mastic , and virgin wax . If an outline in pencil is to be transferred to the plate , the pencil outline is laid carefully upon a clean paper , and thoroughly sponged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of paper for a few moments . The outline is then again sponged in a similar manner ; and this is repeated until the paper becomes completely saturated with water . It is then laid upon the plate // on which the ground is , and rolled through a plate press ; and an inverted pencil outline is thus produced upon the plate . If the drawing is traced , it is done either with a pencil upon transparent paper , and then transferred as above , or upon tracing-paper with the point ; vrhich tracing-paper , after tracing , is ruhbed with red chalk , then laid upon the plate , and the tracing lightly gone over with the point ; thus producing upon the plate an inverted outline in red chalk . Different kinds of tracing-paper are used for these different processes . The outlines , and such parts as require freedom and irregularity of line , and the main lines of the dark drapery , &amp;c. , are then marked through the ground , care being taken that every line shall penetrate to the copper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border of wax , closely fitted , and a dilution of the best spirits of aqua fortis and water is poured over the whole . The acid of course reaches the metal wherever lines have been drawn through the wax , and the bubbles of air produced by the chemical action , together with the saturated portions of the metal , are brushed away with a feather . For biting steel several other kinds of acid arc used ; for very soft steel , powdered corrosive sublimate and alum , dissolved in water ; for hard steel , nitric acid diluted , the plate , before the acid is applied , being washed with a decoction of nut-gall . When the action of the acid has been continued long enough , the liquid is poured off , and the operator examines his work carefully . If he finds that the desired effect has been produced in the lines drawn , he fills them up , or , in the technical language , they are stopped out . The biting , or action of the acid , is then continued for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . When the work is completed , the varnish is cleaned off , the plate washed with oil of turpentine , and any deficiencies are remedied with the graver . The plate is then finished with the graver and the dry-point , and by rebiting , which last is done by laying a ground upon the surface of the plate , so as that it shall not penetrate the lines , and then biting as before , or washing on the acid where any part is wished darker . From this description , it may be seen how much of the beauty of the work depends upon the skill of the artist in using the graver . Indeed , this instrument seems to possess scarcely less power than the pencil or the chisel . Within its compass are contained // all that art can convey of delicacy , grace , beauty , and power . This practice of etching must have been very early adopted , as it is extremely probable that acid was used by the manufacturers of swords and other warlike implements , in decorating blades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and its adaptation to this purpose would have been readily perceived . The merit of inventing etching was claimed by an Italian artist , Parmegiano ; but it is ascertained , that it was earlier practised by Albert Durer , from some prints by that artist , bearing the dates of 1518 and 1524 . For letter , map , and plan engraving , the process is as follows . The plate , being carefully prepared to receive the cutting , is warmed sufficiently to melt white xvax , with a thin coating of which it is then covered . The outline of the drawing is then traced upon paper with a black-lead pencil , and laid , the pencilled side downward , upon the wax , and the back gently rubbed with the burnisher ; by which process the drawing is transferred to the wax . The engraver is thus guided in making the outline of the design on the copper , which he does by means of the point above mentioned , penetrating through the wax , and marking distinctly on the plate , or by cutting directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then wiped off , and the plate finished with the graver and point . The plate must be laid upon a strong , steady table , and a sort of awning or shade of silk paper stretched on a frame be placed near the window , in such a manner as to prevent a glare of light from falling upon the copper . Whenever an erroneous line is made by the slipping of the graver , or other cause , it must be effaced by the burnisher , and the indentings which this leaves must then be levelled with the scraper , rubbed with charcoal and water , and lightly polished with the burnisher . The second kind of engraving , which is done by making dots in the copper instead of lines , is called stippling . The principal advantage of this style is , that delicate parts of the engraving may be done with less labor and in a shorter time . It will readily be seen , that , the greater the number of the dots , and the closer they are together , without being so near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more will the work resemble a crayon drawing . On account of this // resemblance , stippling is , in England , commonly called chalk engraving . It is often found united in the same piece with line engraving , being employed for the more delicate parts , while the drapery , and all the bolder portions of the work , are represented in lines . An instrument has been invented by which this kind of engraving may be more expeditiously accomplished . This is called a roulette . It is a toothed wheel attached to a handle ; and , being rolled over the copper , it makes a row of dots . The effect of this , however , is much inferior to the dotting made by the graver . Stippling is a very ancient invention , and is attributed to the Italians . It is known to have been used by Augustine of Venice , who , as we have already mentioned , was a pupil of Marc-Antonio ; and there is still preserved a print executed by this artist , representing an old man seated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flesh only , however , is done in dots . There is also another print of a single figure standing , holding a cup and looking upwards , by Giulio Campagnola , who engraved in the early part of the sixteenth century . The background is executed in round dots , apparently made with the needle or dry point , and the figure is outlined with a deep stroke and finished with dots , the hair and beard being executed in lines . The third style of engraving is the mezzotinto . The plate , being prepared , the process is commenced nearly in the same manner as for line engraving , the outline and bolder parts being etched . The plate is laid on a firm table , which has a flannel cloth upon it to prevent the copper from slipping . An instrument called a groundingtool , provided with teeth , is then applied to the plate , and rocked backwards and forwards in every direction over its surface , so as to cover it with fine indentations , care being taken not to allow the tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finished , the plate is found to be so engraved that an impression from it would present a uniformly black surface . The engraver now resorts to the scraper and burnisher , and presses down or rubs out the roughness of the copper , over that part of the surface where the figures are to appear , obliterating the ground for the lights and leaving it for the shades . Great care must be taken in this part of the operation , to make the gradations from shade to light extremely delicate , // as , otherwise , the effect of the piece would be much injured . While speaking of mezzotinto engraving , it seems worth while to correct a prevalent error . It is generally supposed , that an acid is employed to corrode the copper for this branch of art ; but this is not the case . Engraving , when acid is to be used , is called etching , a prdcess which we have already described . This mistake with regard to the use of acid in mezzotinto , may not improbably have grown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of engraving . The merit of first using it is attributed to Prince Rupert . Horace Walpole , in his " Catalogue of Engravers , " digested from the manuscript of Vertue , says , that , as Prince Rupert was going out one morning from his residence at Brussels , be observed a sentinel very busy with his fusil . On inquiring what he was doing , the man showed him , that the night dew had made some spots of rust on the piece , which he was trying to scrape and polish away . On examining it , the prince perceived something like a figure eaten into the barrel , with innumerable little holes close together like the chased work on gold and silver , part of which the man had already scraped away . It immediately occurred to him , that , by covering a plate with such little holes , so that it would give a black impression , and then scraping away part of them , the smooth portions of the plate would leave the paper white . He communicated this idea to Vaillant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments they contrived a steel roller with teeth , which could cut the plate in every direction ; and it was then easy to scrape away the roughness where the light was to fall . This account , however , seems to be incorrect ; for the Baron Heineken , in his " Id*e G*n*rale d'une Collection complette d'Estampes , " speaks of a print engraved in mezzotinto by Colonel de Siegen , an officer in the service of the Landgrave of Hesse . It is a portrait of Amelia Elizabeth , Princess Regent of Hesse-Cassel , which is inscribed in one corner , " L. de Siegen , inventor , fecit , 1643 . " Now it does not appear that Prince Rupert pretended to have made this discovery till nearly twenty years after the date of Siegen 's print ; for Evelyn mentions , in his Diary , under March 13th , 1661 , that Prince Rupert had just shown him the // new way of graving called mezzotinto . Heineken thinks that Rupert must have learned the art from Colonel de Siegen . Another mode of engraving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqua-tinta . The outlines of the picture are etched in the copper by the usual process . The ground is then removed , the plate carefully cleaned , and the aqua-tinta grain , as it is called , is applied . In the old method , this consisted of finely-powdered mastic , sifted carefully and equally over the plate , and then made to adhere by gently warming it . It will readily be seen , that , were the acid now applied , it would so act upon the copper between the innumerable fine grains , that an impression taken from the plate would be perfectly black . When the grains of mastic , therefore , have been made to adhere , the artist takes a hair pencil dipped in black varnish , and paints over the grain in those parts of the picture which are to be left entirely white . The acid is then applied , and after it has been suffered to act long enough it is poured off , and the next lightest shade stopped out ; again , the acid is applied for the deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several modifications of the process of aqua-tinta engraving , which we omit describing , as it would he difficult to make them intelligible to our readers . One , however , invented we believe by Mr. F. Tukes , of London , and now generally adopted , ought not to be passed by . It is far preferable to the method formerly in use , wearing longer , and giving a grain of much more elegant appearance . The resinous substance to be employed , which is mastic , resin , burgundy pitch , or a mixture of two or more of these ingredients , is dissolved in highly rectified alcohol ; and , the plate having been carefully cleaned , the solution is quickly poured over its surface , in such a manner , that the chilling of the varnish , which immediately takes place , may be perfectly equal over the whole . If this is well done , the rapid evaporation of the alcohol causes the resin which it has held in solution to shrink up , presenting a sort of vermiform appearance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of the acid . The object of the aquatinta is to imitate drawings made with India ink , bistre , sepia , &amp;c . It is well enough adapted for slight subjects generally , // and for large and coarse representations ; but it fails , where minute and accurate detail is required . We come , finally , to the art of engraving on steel , which has additional interest to Americans as the invention of one of their countrymen . Though there is reason to believe , that five or six of Albert iDurer 's prints , preserved in the British Museumn , were taken from steel plates , and though there is an engraving by J. T. Smith , in 1805 , of the ceiling of the Star Chamber in the " Topographical Illustrations of Westminster , " undoubtedly taken from a steel plate , the art nevertheless does not seem to have been appreciated or understood till several years afterwards . In the year 1818 , an inquiry was instituted , respecting the prevention of forgery , by the " Society for the Encouragement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered by the committee , that bank-notes , with ornamented borders , printed from steel plates , were actually in use in America ; and a specimen of engraving on soft steel , was presented to the Society by Mr. Charles Warren . Soon after this , Messrs . Perkins and Fairman removed to London , and formed a connexion with Mr. Heath , an eminent engraver , for printing notes and other designs from steel plates . The great principle in this branch of the art is , to engrave on soft steel and harden it afterwards ; and the superiority of this kind of engraving , over that on copper , consists in the greater number of impressions which may he taken from steel plates , and the superior delicacy of which they admit in the execution . In addition to this , Perkins has resorted to another method for increasing the number of impressions . The plate being engraved and hardened , the impression is transferred in a spring press to a cylinder of soft steel , by rolling the latter over the plate several times , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief to the cylinder , which is then hardened , and may be used to make the same impression on plates of soft steel , or copper , from which prints may then be taken . This process , however , is only used in the preparation of plates intended for bank-notes and calicoprinting . The ordinary engravii ) g upon steel , which has now almost entirely superseded that on copper , is executed upon plates nearly decarbonated . They do not require hardening , as they will give a sufficient number of impressions without it . // There is a species of engraving on copper called the medallic , which has been invented within the last twenty-five years , and is so beautiful a branch of the art that it merits a minute description . The object of this kind of engraving is , to give accurate representations of medals , coins , and bassorilievos of a small size ; and it is effected by applying a machine to the surface of the medal , which will trace a line on the copper corresponding exactly to the outline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pentegraph will be able to form an idea of this machine . It is so contrived , that , as it slides over the surface of the coin , every elevation or depression which produces a perpendicular motion in the machine , causes at the same time a horizontal movement at the other extremity , which traces the line on the copper . Every time the machine passes over the coin , a single line is traced on the copper ; and there is a delicately contrived screw , by which the machine may be pushed forward after each line is drawn , so as to make the next line as near to it as the operator chooses . The effect is to give an exact copy of the medal ; and the drawing appears so salient , that we can hardly convince ourselves , at first , that we are looking upon a flat surface . This beautiful machine will seem the more interesting to our readers , from the circumstance of its having been invented in this country . In the " Journal of the Franklin Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X. No. 3 , for September , 1832 , ) we find some account of the invention , in the following passage " In 1817 , by the use of a machine which had been invented in Philadelphia , Christian Gohrecht , die-sinker , produced upon copper an engraving from a medal having upon it the head of Alexander of Russia ; from this engraving impressions were taken and distributed . One of these impressions we have seen . " In 1819 , Asa Spencer ( now of the firm of Draper , Underwood &amp; Co. , bank-note engravers ) took with him to London a machine of the kind above alluded to , which was principally designed for straight and waved-line ruling . This machine was used in London during the year just mentioned , and the mode of ruling waved lines , and of copying medals , was then exhibited and explained by Mr. Spencer to several artists , " &amp;c. // In the above extract it will be observed , that we are not expressly informed who was the inventor ; nor do we fivid it stated anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been informed , by numerous artists in Philadelphia , that the contrivance of this ingenious and beautiful machine is undoubtedly to be ascribed to Mr. Spencer ; that the machine used by Mr. Gobrecht was constructed by him , and that , consequently , the invention and perfection of the apparatus are the result of his ingenuity . This branch of the art has received great attention both in England and France . Mr. Bate of London , took out a patent for a machine of this kind , in 1826 , and has distinguished himself by the beauty of his medallic engravings . In 1830 , a mechanician of Paris , Achille Collas , contrived a similar instrument , having taken the hint from a machine which was used for engraving watch-dials , cases , and snuffboxes , called the tour d guillocher . And in 1834 , a publication was commenced in Paris , under the title of " Tr&amp; sor de Numismatique et de Glyptique , " which has been published weekly ever since , each part containing four folio plates of medallic engraving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely mechanical part of engraving . A much more difficult subject remains for us in the consideration of this art in a more extended sense ; its various objects and capacities ; the results already produced by it , and the rules which may be deduced from the specimens already before the world for the aid of future artists . It must be remembered , that art exists previously to all rules . It springs up first in the inspired mind , is afterwards visibly displayed , then admired , studied , and commented on . While an art is still in a progressive state , it is obvious , that its nature can only be partially discussed . It may possibly be so far advanced as to indicate with certainty all that it is capable of being made ; but even then , the effect to he produced by this perfection can not be entirely comprehended . And , if the progress made is less than this , it would certainly be undertaking too much , were any one to attempt to give a satisfactory account of the whole extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with engraving . We certainly can not say , that this art is still in its infancy // for many of its most important objects seem to be accom1 ) lished , and the results produced are sufficient to place it among the most beautiful arts . But it is still in a state of progress . Every year witnesses improvement ; invention is continualy bringing something new to its aid . The power , flexihility , delicacy , and passion of the art seem to be yearly increased . While this is the case , we should be wrong in attempting to speak of it as we would of painting , sculpture , or any art which appears to have arrived at the fulness of perfection . The most that we can do , is , to examine what has already been effected ; to deduce rules from the art as it actually exists to examine its objects , and the extent to which they have been accomplished ; and to form a conjecture , from what has been already attained , of its capacity for still greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great classes ; those which are copies of the works of other artists , either paintings or designs in pencil , and those which are designed as well as executed hy the same individual . Between these two classes there are great and important distinctions . The copying of the paintings of great masters implies a distinct talent of a high order ; the power of comprehending and appreciating their style , and their various merits and defects , and of representing them by means of the graver . Copying from designs made for the engraver requires perhaps the least degree of talent . Yet even in this there is no small room for the exertion of ingenuity and taste . But in those works in which the same hand designs and sculptures , there may be merit of the highest order which the art admits ; as these prints bear only the impress of one mind , which is capable of invention as well as imitation ; which conveys its own fire , and gives its peculiar characteristics to the work . In treating of the first class into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the engraver does not here hold immediate converse with nature . His landscapes do not require him to have seen the country ; and he needs no models for his forms and his countenances . Perfection , or accordance with nature , is not the legitimate object of this branch of the art . His purpose is to convey to the plate the peculiar characteristics of the original ; even faults are not to be softened . It has been remarked by an ingenious writer , that engraving is the translation of painting ; because // the work of representing , by engraving , the ideas of genius which are expressed in the language of painting , is analogous to that of expressing in a foreign tongue the thoughts of a writer uttered in his own language ; and the change which the conceptions of a painter must undergo , in being transferred from the glowing canvass over which the brush has swept , to the dotted , lined , and colorless print , is similar to the modification which takes place in the ideas and figures of a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and genius of a foreign language . The analogy , however , is not complete , because painting is a universal language ; it needs no translation to make it understood ; and engraving does not render it more intelligible to any one . In one sense , that is , in the power of multiplication , engraving bears the same relation to painting , that printing does to the manuscript ; but here again the similitude fails , because the printer has nothing to do with copying the forms of the manuscripts ; he is guided by words and thoughts , but not by forms . Perhaps the best way of expressing the relation , which subsists between the two arts , would be to call the engraver the herald of the painter . In one solitary spot of the wide world stands the inspired work , the masterpiece of art , the legacy of genius to kindred spirits in after times . The hand that traced those magical lines has long been cold in death ; the eye that gleamed with inspiration on the work is closed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave it . This miracle of art , preserved perhaps in the inner sanctuary of some royal gallery , enshrined within its costly temple , and valued beyond price ,  --  more precious from the consideration that its beauty and glory are solitary , unrivalled , and never to be replaced if lost , - can be gazed on but by a few favored mortals . It is a holy oracle of art , and many who would consult it must go a long and weary pilgrimage before they can reach the shrine . But the voice of inspiration has gone forth , and there are prophets to catch the sounds , and herald them abroad over the wide world . To this high office the engraver is devoted , He is the herald of the painter . He speaks in language less gorgeous , less imposing , less powerful , than the great original ; and he only speaks more intelligibly , inasmuch as his language requires a smaller reach of intellect and taste to comprehend it . But it is his province to address the whole world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great truth ( for surely every masterpiece of art is such ) , and in every land is seen his name , proudly honored in being inscribed by the side of his great master 's , beneath his work . We have said , that the engraver , who is devoted to copying the works of painters , holds no converse with nature . The remark , however , was made without any intention of depreciating this branch of the art . On the contrary , we deem this one of the noblest objects which the engraver can pursue . It is not to be placed on a level with copying in painting , for it implies , we apprehend , the exertion of a higher order of talent , that of doing justice in one art to the works of masters in another . The engraver from paintings is in a high degree an originator . We should certainly assign to the translator , who clothes his work in the language of melodious and high-wrought poetry , and at the same time gives a faithful representation of the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher place than to him , who gives only a plain but literal version , in prose or in poetry , which bears no stamp of the translator 's own mind , and adds nothing to the literature of the language . For example , Coleridge 's translation of " XVallenstein , " while it gives a faithful representation of Schiller , is at the same time a beautiful English poem , a positive and precious addition to the literature of our language . Cowper 's translation of Homer is also a poem ; and a tolerably literal version ; but it introduces us to no acquaintance with the translator . We might read whole libraries of such poetry , and yet feel that we have gained no insight into his character . Now we should liken a well-executed engraving from a fine painting to a translation such as Coleridge 's ; while a mere copy in oils is more like the translation by Cowper , literal and exact , but bearing the impress of no mind but that of the original artist . Though the engraver from paintings does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wide enough to satisfy the demands of genius . He enters upon an ideal world , and holds converse with beings of more than earthly beauty . He is dwelling in the groves and bowers of Eden , or amidst the gorgeous scenery of a world gone by . His firmament is lighted up with hues that seem to be poured down from heaven , and his clouds are tinted with splendors which even the golden west can not vie with . His eyes are // blest with visions of loftier worlds , and forms surpassing human . Before him is spread out the sea " Of jasper , or of liquid pearl , whereon Who after came from earth , sailing arrived Wafted by angels , or flew o'er the lake Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds ; " and that wondrous stairway , " Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven , " - which the angels are traversing . The venerable forms of saints and martyrs , the celestial beauty of the Holy Mary , the grace , and dignity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to delight , elevate , and inspire . In choosing the peculiar style of engraving to be used in copying the works of the masters of painting , there is great room for the exercise of taste . For dignified historical pieces , we should have no hesitation in choosing line engraving ; for landscapes the mezzotinto may be used with good effect ; where extreme delicacy is required , stippling may be resorted to . But line engraving seems to us most worthy of the attention of the artist , as it possesses greater power and compass than the other modes . Lines seem to possess , in the highest degree , the capacity of expression , as is abundantly demonstrated by outline engravings ; and they certainly give a more accurate notion of pencil-drawing than stippling . Accordingly we find , that the greatest masters of the art have been in the habit of using this style in their choicest works . Morghen , we believe , always resorted to it , and it is the favorite style throughout Italy . Gmelin , a German artist of great eminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Claude Lorraine . Woollett always preferred it , and most of the eminent British artists of the present day resort to it . Of the fitness of line engraving to represent all the varieties of landscapes , there can be no doubt . One or two examples of very different kinds of landscapes will illustrate this position . We will endeavour to select from those which may be familiar to most of our readers . Let us suppose that the scene to be represented is of a wild , mountainous , and sublime character ; as , for instance , that beautiful engraving in Rogers 's " Italy , " by Smith , of the passage of Hannibal over the Alps . The lines , with the exception of a small portion of the foreground of the picture , // are mostly drawn perpendicularly , and , where the sbading is deepest , cross each other but little . There is an exquisite delicacy in the work , and yet a degree of simplicity which does justice to the sublimity of the scenery . The stern grandeur of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds , is admirably represented , by the very sparinguess with which the lines are drawn , and their extreme tenuity , as they fade into the white . The effect of long perpendicular lines , not deeply drawn , and fading in the misty distance , is very striking in such a scene . The same kind of engraving is equally well adapted to convey the idea of grandeur and sublimity in architecture ; as may be seen in the engraving by Goodall , in Rogers 's " Poems , " of the interior of a Gothic church , where the lines , being drawn in the manner we are describing , give an idea of vast height , and convey in a xvonderful manner the feeling universally inspired by this noble order of architecture . In proportion as the landscape becomes more complicated , and includes a greater variety of objects , such as forests , lakes , rivers , cataracts , houses , animals , and , above all , foliage and grass , the engraving becomes less simple and uniform . The lines are much shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are altogether more complicated and elaborate than in representing the bald , stern grandeur of mountainous scenery . For illustrations of our remarks , we need not look further than the beautiful books to which we have already referred . On the twelfth page of the " Poems** is a vignette , engraved by that admirable artist , Goodall , which , for lightness , delicacy , and grace , is not surpassed . It represents an English rural scene ; a rising ground , shaded by a rich tuft of trees and bushes ; a few gypsies at the foot of the hillock , their fire kindled underneath the emblematic cauldron , and their scanty wardrobe displayed on the line hard by . In the background is a windmill . Over this gentle scene the parting sun is pouring his mellow light , and his rays , reflected on the clouds , shoot out that long , fanhke splendor , which constitutes the most gorgeous sunset . The contrast between such a scene as this , and the rugged grandeur of the Alps is complete ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to represent it . The lines are short , delicate , and running in every possible direction , though not apparently crossing each other much . The sky is formed // with horizontal lines , which fade and are lost in the full light , where the sun 's rays extend upward . The mill , it will be observed , is represented by simple perpendicular lines . We have mentioned these two engravings as being specimens of strong contrast in landscapes . For all the different varieties of scenery , there must be corresponding modifications in the style of engraving resorted to . It may be suggested to us , that such remarks are superfluous ; that we are only laying down rules , that common sense and the smallest share of taste would readily dictate . But , even granting this to be true , we still deem the remarks of some value , as demonstrating the power and capacities of line engraving . A landscape may be done in mezzotinto , or it may be represented by aqua-tinta ; but we have given these two instances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an opposite character . These engravings , it will be noticed , are made from drawings , not from paintings . But the principle is just the same . The two landscapes illustrate this power of line engraving quite as well as if they had been taken from that fine piece of David 's , Napoleon at the foot of the Alps , or from one of Wilson 's rich compositions . The power of lines will be more fully comprehended , when we ascend to the higher branches of the art , that is , copies from historical paintings , and particularly the representations of countenances . It is a fact , which we presume none will dispute , that lines produce different effects upon us , accordingly as they are differently drawn . So universally , indeed , is this principle acknowledged , that by general consent the term line of beauty is agreed upon to express a particular motion of the pencil . Upon this single principle an extensive theory is founded , with regard to the art of linear engraving . Why it is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular curve is more agreeable than a straight or angular motion , why free and swelling lines afford more ease to the eye than abrupt or unvarying ones , we do not pretend to say . It is one of those questions , to which the only answer is , We are made so . It is the same with our other senses . No one can tell , for instance , why some combinations of sounds produce agreeable emotions , and others the contrary ; why some make us feel joyfid , and others sad . Neither can any one give a reason for the fact // that the perfume of the rose is more to our taste than that of the poppy or the onion ; or why sweet tastes please , and bitter disgust us . The same is the case with lines ; some please , others offend , the eye . And besides this distinction , we may observe , that , of those which are agreeable , some produce one kind of emotion , others another . Horizontal lines in drawing affect us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards affect us differently from those which bend in the opposite direction . It will easily be perceived from these remarks , that line engravings have , in some degree at least , the power of conveying the style of different painters . A skilful engraver would use , of course , different styles for different subjects . For one of Fuseli 's fiery compositions , for instance , his lines would not be the same as for a Holy Family by Raphael . Where the hand of any great artist is easily recognised by the peculiarities of his style , it is not very difficult to convey these peculiarities in the engraved copy . None who is familiar with the works of Raphael would find much difficulty in recognising his style in a good engraving , even without having seen the original of the identical piece . But the question occurs , whether a different kind of line is not to be used in copying from different artists , even supposing them to have been engaged on the same , or similar , subjects . Should not a difference be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raphael 's , and one by Titian ? We have no hesitation in asserting , that there should be ; if the Madonna of the one artist produces different emotions from that of the other , then different kinds of lines should he used in engraving them , corresponding to these various emotions . There is a delightful chapter in Mrs. Jameson 's " I ) iary of an Fnnuy*e , " upon the Madonnas of the various great masters of Italy , in which , with a fine discrimination , she traces the different emotions which these paintings express and excite , and compares the work with the individual traits of the author . Now we are of opinion , that , for all these , there should be corresponding differences in engravings from them . The pure and celestial countenances of the Virgins of Raphael , with their mild , pensive , twilight radiance , would not be well copied by the same class of lines that would be used for the full-orhed , passionate beauty of the Madonnas of Titian ; a Holy Family by Poussin would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Family by Andrea del Sarto. // This science of lines appears to be yet only in its infancy ; and , indeed , the whole amount of linear engraVing , from its first discovery up to the present time , is only a series of experiments which may serve as the beginning of the science . To all artists who have a real love and respect for their profession we earnestly recommend the subject ; for we are convinced that the careful study of it , with the proper objects , would lead to a more rapid improvement in the art of engraving than has ever yet been witnessed . The questions to be determined are , What lines are suited to express the different emotions ? What are the ditTerent styles to he used in correspondence with the style of the original paintings ? Can the style of each great master he made distinct in the engraving ? Can any variety or combination of lines convey a notion of the coloring of the various artists ? A careful examination of the different engravings , from the early days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens , would perhaps lead to a satisfactory answer to some or all of these questions . But , above all , were the study made by an artist with the graver in his hand , and the copper before him , to test by experiment the principles of the science as they would be developed , the result might prove of the highest benefit to the art . Outline engravings constitute a distinct , and , of late , an important department of the art . The principal works in this branch are the designs of Flaxman , engraved by others and those of the brothers Riepenhausen , and of lietzsch , engraved by themselves . The beautiful illustrations of Flaxman are probably known to most of our readers . They consist of drawings from the Iliad and Odyssey , from the Theogony of Hesiod , the Tragedies of IEschylus , and the Divine Comedy of Dante , besides a restoration of the shield of Achilles as described in the Iliad . The great merit of Flaxman consists in the power he displays of comprehending and expressing the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing , and an artist in the highest sense of the word , he seemed to have made his dwelling among by-gone men , and to have lived in scenes which have passed away for ever . He made himself , by years of study , perfectly familiar with all the forms of classic life ; and we would recommend his works to the young scholar as one of the most profitable as well as delightful forms tinder which Grecian antiquities may be studied . Many pages , and even chapters , of // Potter , might be found beautifully condensed and commented upon in any one of Flaxman 's drawings from the antique. * The works of the Riepenhausens , though inferior to Flaxman in extent and variety , display an equal acquaintance with the antique . Their principal effort is a restoration of the famous paintings of Polygnotus at Athens , from the description given of them by Pausanias . These engravings fill two large volumes , one containing scenes from the capture of rrroy , the other from the descent into the realm of Pluto . The works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the great English artist . Yet the latter undotihtedly evince a wider range of genius . In the illustrations of Dante , Flaxman has shown the power of combining the antique with the Gothic , in the same grand and striking manner in which this uniot* is displayed in some of the majestic architecture of Italy during the twelfih and thirteenth centuries . There is an analogy to be discovered hetween the semi-classic and semi-romantic poem of the great Tuscan bard , and the sublime cathedrals of Pisa , of Florence , and of Venice ; and Flaxman seems to have been inspired by the same blending of Gothic grandeur and awfulness with classic grace , in his illustrations of the Divine Comedy . The only work of the Riepenhausens besides the classic restoration , is , we believe , that exquisite fantasia , the life of Raphael , in outline engravings . We have no hesitation in placing Moritz Retzsch at the head of all outline engravers , both because we think that the romantic art , in which he excels , requires a higher reach of genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety and compass of powers than any artist whose works have ever come within our observation . We shall not attempt an analysis of his works in this place , both for want of room , having already prolonged our essay too much , and because the subject has been most worthily treated in a very interesting article in the London " Foreign Quarterly Re * Flaxman 's illustrations of the Iliad have , probably , been made familiar to many of our readers , by the beautiful edition of that poem , piepared a few years since by Professor Felton . Through the work are interspersed copies of Flaxman 's designs , as first engraved , executed in a style which does great credit to the American artist . He has succeeded in conveying the spirited and graceful touch of the original , and at the same time has overcome the difficulty of reducing the illustrations to the octavo size . These engravings have been published in a separate volume , and we recommend them to the attention of our readers . // view . " We shall content ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics . In the first place , then , no one can fail to he struck with the wide field which his pencil traverses . In his different illustrations , he seems to have represented almost every variety that human life affords , every passion , every emotion , every event which can most deeply affect the mind or heart . Were the task assigned us of selecting from all the works of Shakspeare , those which should illustrate , most satisfactorily , the wide compass of his powers , we should be disposed to make the choice , that Retzsch has done , of Macbeth , Hamlet , and Romeo and Juliet . It seems as if almost every scene that life , real or fancied , offers , could he found in these illustrations of Shakspeare ; the camp , the hattie-field , the banquet , the lonely closet , the burning hour of stolen love , the horrid cave where witches boil their hell-broth , and the dim phantoms of kings flitting in noiseless array , - the frowning castle and the torch-lit palace , - all that enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented with equal skill , power , and fidelity in these masterly drawings . Power and terror seem to he hut ministering attendants to this wonderful master . His delineations of the Prince of IDarkness , though of a different character from Milton 's awful picture , are scarcely inferior at times , in suhlimity , to the fallen Archangel of our great Epic . In that terrific sketch , " The Game of Life , " for instance , we discover in the iron frame and the thunder-hlasted visage of man 's great antagonist , the same heing , who in the " Paradise Lost " reviles and blasphemes the sun , and glares on the new creation with a feeling of hatred and malice deeper than hell itself . Less sublime , but perhaps even more terrific , are the night-ride of Faust and Jephistophiles on the demon steeds , the maddening interview with Margaret in the dungeon , and the scene in " Fridolin , " where the IEluntsrnan is thrust into the blazing furnace . But would we seek the opposite extreme to these hideous sights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That exquisite picture well known hy the title of " The German lovers , " seems to concentrate all of life that is peaceful , gentle , and boundlessly happy , when in truth , as the poet has it , " the eye sees heaven open and the heart revels in bliss . " Indeed nearly all the illustrations of the " Song of the Bell " are of a character very different from most of the works of Retzsch. // They have a pastoral simplicity , gentleness , and repose , to which we turn with pleasure and refreshment , after our souls have been harrowed up by the appalling scenes of his tragic representations . There is less of crime depicted in this than the other works , less of that awful machinery of Hell , which this artist has the power of blending so skilfully with his scenes of life , that we become superstitious as we gaze at them , and are ready to start like those who have heard ghoststories , fearing that the Great Enemy himself may be at the moment scowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of malice , upon our motions , or reading our thoughts . Not less remarkable is the talent with which Retzsch portrays incidents of the deepest pathos ; scenes which combine the air of repose with sorrow so deep and heart-rending , that we feel as if we were gazing on Tragedy herself . Of this character are the representations of Ophelia , when she appears in her wild array of weeds and flowers , of Margaret and Faust , where the latter offers her the potion , of Margaret sitting alone before the spinning-wheel , of the wedding at the friar 's cell in " Romeo and Juliet . " A little change , and these smothered passions blaze out with a volcano 's fury , and the deep moan of sorrow swells to the maddening cry of agony and despair . Such are the nightwalk of Lady Macbeth , the prayer of the king in " Hamlet , " and of Margaret before the image of the Virgin , the prison scene of Margaret and Faust , and the parting of Romeo and Juliet in the morning . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minuteness and fidelity in details , which are not less surprising . Nothing is omitted that can in any way contribute to the effect of a scene ; and , when we have received the general impression which any one of his representations produces , we may spend a long time in the study of the various parts of the picture , in which we shall not fail to discover many beautiful thoughts which greatly enhance the value of the work . There is a fertility and bountifulness in his conceptions , which remind us of the boundlessness of nature . For instance , in the Leipsic edition of the Illustrations of Hamlet , which lies before us , we find that , not content with the splendid array of scenery which he had created to adorn the thoughts of Shakspeare , he has added a picture for th ? title-page , or the outside cover , of such deep , calm , and sol // emn repose , that we look upon it after contemplating the heart-rending scenes of the tragedy , with the same emotion that a strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic tomb or monument , on which is resting the form of Hamlet , composed in the sleep of death . Above , appears the dim visage of the royal Phantom . In Gothic niches , and beneath the overhanging canopies , are seen as supporters , on one side the effigies of the king and queen , their eyes closed in eternal sleep , and a hideous demon extending his claws above them as if to claim them for his own . On the other side , in the same position , and sleeping too in death , are the forms of Polonius and Ophelia . But a cherub is overshadowing them with his wings , and seems to invoke blessings on their heads . On the base of the tomb are seen two swords piercing a heart , and the picture of Hamlet absorbed in prayer . The whole piece breathes an air of solemnity and repose . The thrilling scenes of the drama are over ; and the busy actors are sunk to rest . The diadem is now but worthless dross to him that wore it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery spirit of Laertes is quenched . The night-walk on the castle platform , the grave-yard philosophy , and the fierce duel , are but a tale that is told ; and Hamlet 's world-wearied soul , liberated from this mortal coil , has gone to seek that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns. * We had much more to say upon the subject of engraving . A treatise on this subject is incomplete , which does not give the reader information with regard to the best artists both of the present day and of an earlier period in the various countries of Europe . We had intended also to speak of the state of the art in this country , which would have led to some re * Since this article was prepared , we have obtained Retzsch 's fourth work on Shakspeare , comprising illustrations of King Lear . The power of the artist does not flag in this most difficult task . The scenes are of a more stirring and high-wrought character than prevails in most of his previous works ; and , while he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hy the great master , he has very skilfully avoided the exaggeration and ranting into which the subject would tend to lead bim . We have always thought that the painting of Lear by West , in the Boston Athenmum , is marked somewhat strongly with these faults , conveying the idea of stage effect . The scene of Lear recognising Cordelia is , perhaps , the most exquisite in this volume of illustrations . We are almost at a loss to descrihe the effect produced upon our feelings in contemplating these powerful delineations . Could the storm of agitated , sublime , and frightful dreams , with its occasional intervals of soothing vision , he embodied visibly , it seems as if such forms as these illustrations would be taken . // marks upon wood engraving . Upon this , we will , at present , only observe , that a very excellent essay upon wood engraving appeared in a late number of the " London and Westminster Review " ; particularly valuable by being illustrated by specimens . The American re-publishers have had the sagacity to print the essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing the tragedy of Hamlet , with the part of Hamlet left out by particular request.
