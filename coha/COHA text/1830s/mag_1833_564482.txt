txt ACCORDING to promise , we proceed in our remarks on the study of Greek and Latin . We can not concur in the opinion , that the study of the dead languages " forms the most effectual discipline of the mental faculties " - especially of " judgement and the reasoning powers . " On the con* trary , we are convinced that it does not . We do not perceive how it disciplines either " reason " or " judgement " at all . Nor do we think it does so . Some of the most thorough-hred Hellenists and Latinists we have seen were eminently defective in reason and judgement . Nor is this an uncommon occurrence . Observation has taught us to believe the reverse . We think it rare to find , in our colleges and elsewhere , that those young men , who judge most correctly , reason most conclusively , compose most elegantly , and debate most eloquently and powerfully , are most perfectly versed in the ancient languages . And if the study of Greek and Latin invigorates the " memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ideas of qualities , objects , events , or their relations . And the cultivation of a modern tongue will have the same effect . The reason of all this is obvious . The cultivation of Greek and Latin is but the study of words in one language , and their synonyms or representatives in another . It does not , therefore , and can not strengthen the memory for any thing but language ; and , we repeat . that that form of memory can be strengthened as well by the study of English and French , as of Greek and Latin . The chief source of error on this topic , is the belief that memory is a faculty of the mind ; and that we have but one kind of memory ; whereas it is but a function or mode of operation of a faculty . We have , therefore , as many sorts of memory , as the mind possesses of Intellectual faculties ; each faculty having its own . And Rs no one primitive faculty can form the ideas , which are the product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .. Memory is the power of recalling ideas which were once possessed . The cultivation of the memory belonging to one faculty of the mind , then , does hot strengthen the memory belonging to another , any more than the cultivation of hearing strengthens vision , or of smelling , touch . To illustrate this by examples . The mind possesses one faculty for number , which can perceive and remember nothing but number ; another for form or figure , which perceives and remembers nothing but figure ; another for size ; another for place ; another for color ; another for time ; and another fortune ; and each perceives and remembers only the class of ideas proper to itself . In cultivating any one of these faculties , therefore , by exercising it on the objects which especially suit it , its own memory is strengthened ; but no strength is added to the memory of any other faculty. * * We migbt thus enumerate all the intellectual faculties , and show that they are acted on and exercised only , each by objects or agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own class of ideas ; and tbat , therefore , the cultivation of one of them does not improve directly the // The mind possesses also a faculty for language , by the cultivation of which its memory is in like manner strengthened ; hut , as already mentioned , that is only memory for words . No new strength is added to the memory for any other class of ideas . Hence the well-known fact , that different individuals excel in different forms of memory . One remembers numbers with great tenacity , but forgets a tune , the moment the notes of it have escaped from his ear . Another never forgets a tune , after once hearing it , but can not remember numbers . A third forgets both the tune and the number of times he has heard it , but remembers the for of the instrument on which it was played . . A fourth forgets the tune , the number , and the figure of the instrument , but has an accurate recollection of the place where he heard the tune , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things , remembers the names of the tunes , the instrument , and the musician . The latter is well endowed with the faculty of language , by the cultivation of which , its own memory alone is improved-not , we repeat , the memory for any other class of ideas . As soon , therefore , shall a youth perfect himself in the dead languages , by studying arithmetic or mathematics , as strengthen his memory for numbers or quantity , by contracting an acquaintance with the ancient classics . Nor is it perceived in what way taste and fancy are more effectually exercised and improved by the study of ancient than of modern literature . We are even compelled to believe , that they are not so . Many functions of another . That it may receive strength and become dexterous in action , each one must be exercised in its osvn line . The faculties of tndividuality and Eventuality must be exercised on single objects and events , Comparison chiefly on the relations of analogy , and Causalitjr on : those of cause and effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Each one oftbem is exercised and etrehgthene d only by its own objects , and in itt own way . The proper education of each , therefore , is specific , and contributes nothing directly ts the education okf another . It isinthe education of : he moral faculties , that the teachers of youth are most deficient . They seem to think that they are improving their pupils in morality , when they are merely restraining them from vice . Nothing , howevclc , can be mere erroneous . The teachi:ngof morality is a*mutmh a positive process , as teaching to read and write . he moral faculties , we mean , must be actively exercised , each on its propec object . The faculty of benevolence is strength'cfied oniy by the work - tint benevolessee , and the c n templation of kind actions . The faculty of eooscientioosness is strengthened by contemplating and doing what is just and right . The faculty of veneration delights in doing homage to superior beings , nd derives from the practice its chief improvement . Ideality is exercised and-strengthened by beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the animal faculties the same may be affirmed . Combativeness is strengthened by a familiarity with d nger , Acquisitiveness by the pursuit of wealth , and Destructiveness by cruelty and the shedding of blood . We shall only add , that , so perfectly do the faculties of the mind harmonize with the works of creation , that each finds , abundantly , suitable objects for its own exercise , enjoyment , and increase in strength . Nor will instructers ever be competent to their duty , until they realize this troth , arId act in conformity to it . As relates to the cultivation of the moral faculties , no one will contend that that is highly promoted by the udy of Greek and Latin . It may , at least , be questioned , wh her it is promoted at all . Many have believed the reverse to be true . That some striking examples of morality , especially as respects certain virtues , are exhibited in the ancient classics , is not denied . But the scale of immorality gr etlypreponderates . The entire-scheme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licentiousness and crime . Jupiter , , at once the chief of gods and adulterers . Apollo , the gallant , gay Lothario of heaven and earth . Mart , a blo - thirsty , swaggering bully . Neptune , a blustering boaster , and a flagrant ravisher . Vulcan , a low-bred , deformed , illtongued ruffian . Bacelmus , a sot . Juno , a fierce , vindictive termagant . Minerva , a prude ; and most of the other female divinities no better han they owg-/st to tie . Of the demi-gods and heroes , not one exhibits an example to be followed . Even the " pions Allneas , the goddess-born , " was an ungrateful seducer , a lawless usurper , and an inexorable murderer . Nor did the characters of the philosophers of either Greece or Rome approach immaculacy . Pericles waging a bloody war , on actesuntof his mistress , Socrates at the feet of Aspasia , and CaIn accommodating a friend with his wife , are but sorry samples of morality for modern youth to imitate . Nor is this all . In Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other classical writers , are many odes , epistles , satires , and letters , too obscene for young men to read . In fine , if we would strengthen the moral faculties , and preserve their purity , we must exercise lb m in some other and better way than by the study of Greek and Latin . // modern works might be mentioned , which surpass any ancient ones now extant , in imagination and fancy . We know of no Greek or Roman authors equal , in these respects , to Shakspeare , Spencer , or Dante . Certainly none are superior . To come down to our own times , and compare moderns and ancients individually with each other , we think Byron superior in brilliancy to Pindar , and Moore to Anacreon . That they at least equal them , no one , we think , will deny . And , that the moderns referred to are richer in sentiment and thought , than the ancients , will not , we apprehend , be held doubtful . Nor are they inferior in taste , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more founded on or modeled after the works of any of the ancients , than the latter are after them . They are the productions of the peculiar geniuses of their authors , and resemble nothing but themselves . That it may be further illustrated and confirmed , we repeat a remark already made , that no faculty of the mind , but that of language , is especially disciplined by the study of Greek and Latin . Hence persons , who are deficient in that faculty , make but little progress in this study , however industrious they may be , and though their other faculties may be unusually strong and active . Many striking instances of this are on record ; and most persons must have seen some such themselves . Great as were their powers , in other respects , neither Newton nor Swift could acquire any standing in classical scholarship . The reason is plain . They were comparatively defective in the faculty of language . Mere boys , on the contrary , who are highly endowed with it , but whose reason and judgement are immature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As relates to that branch of attainment , the maturity of the higher faculties of the mind is of little avail . We once knew a child but six years old , who spoke four different languages ; and lads of ten frequently surpass youths of eighteen or twenty , in the ease and speed with which they become acquainted with Greek and Latin . Many persons , who acquire distinction as classical scholars , can never attain a name in science . Shall we be told , that it is not by learning to construe , parse , and scan the ancient languages , that the faculties of pupils are exercised and strengthened , but by studying their structure and philosophy ? We reply , that the number f persons , who study Greek and Latin thus thoroughly , is very small : ; and , were it otherwise , an equal degree of improvement might be derived from a suitable attention to the structure and philosophy of modern languages . rilhere are reasons , why the case can not be otherwise . The philosophy , by which we mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . A brief analysis of the subject will prove this . From their social character and love of information , mankind have an irrepressible desire to communicate to their fellows something respecting themselves , and to learn something respecting others ; and words are the chief means , by which these ends are obtained . Language , then , might be defined an invention for expressing , by articulate sounds , the feelings , operations , and states of the mind , the influences produced on it by the objects and events of the external world , and the relations of those objects and events to each other , as they appear to The mental eye . // In all nations , the faculties of the mind are the same , differing only in degree ; and the external world , with its leading objects and occurrences , and their relations , both to the mind and to each other , are also the same . Hence the feelings , operations , and states of the mind are , in kind , likewise identical . It follows , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of expressing these things are in like manner identical . A brief detail will illustrate this , as far as is requisite to our present purpose . The external world consists of substances or objects , with their qualities and relations , and the movements or changes , by which those qualities and relations are altered . The changes are called events . Out of this state of things arise the three principal parts of speech , which are necessarily the same in every language ; the noun substantive , being the name of objects or events ; the adjective , denoting their qualities ; and the verb , which expresses the chief relations and their changes . The latter part of speech expresses also simple existence . In every change of quality or relation produced , some object must act , and others be acted on . Hence arise two forms of the verb , the active and passive ; and two cases or conditions of the noun , the nominative and objective . When action is representcd as passing from one substance or thing to another , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that which sustains it is in the objective . By the passive form of the verb , action is expressed , as falling on some object or thing , without any necessary reference to the source from which it comes . The recipient of the action is then in the nominative or objective case , according to the mode of expression used . Nouns have also other cases or conditions , which are represented in some languages , by changes or inflections in the terminations of the nouns themselves , and , in others , by certain words accompanying them . Actions or events occur at different times , and under different circumstances and relations . These also the verb must express . Hence the different tenses , referring to periods past , present , and to come , and the different moods , denoting the manner and circumstances of the action . Both moods and tenses are formed , in some instances , by changes in the terminations of the verb , and , in others , by means of auxiliary verbs . Languages differ considerably in the precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and future events ; and no little of the perfection of the language depends on this . Another variety in forms of expression is rendered necessary by the different numbers of the things that act , and of those that are acted on . This end is attained by the singular , dual , and plural numbers of nouns and verbs . Concord and government between words are also essential attributes of language . The frequent repetition of nouns or the names of things , in discourse or writing , would be not only ungraceful , but inconvenient . Hence the formation of pronouns , or words serving as substitutes for nouns . Actions have qualities , as well as objects ; and it is necessary that they also be expressed in speech . This end is attained by the formation of adverbs . Between both objects and actions , there are certain minute relations and connexions , which can not be represented by verbs . This want is supplied by prepositions and conjunctions . There are instinctive exclamations , expressive of certain internal feelings ; as those of // joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this source have arisen the vocables called interjections . The last part of speech to be mentioned is the participle ; so called , because , in form and meaning , it partakes of both the verb and the noun , especially the noun adjective . By contributing to accuracy and completeness of expression , it is highly useful in speech . The qualities of objects and actions often differ in degree . To meet this want , the different degrees of comparison are instituted . Objects also differ in sex . Corresponding to this , nouns have different genders , which , in different languages , are marked in different ways . The impressions made directly and primitively on the mind , by the objects and events of the external world , excite ideas of simple perception . These are expressed by their appropriate nouns , as color , sound , form , size , resistance , place , storm , battle . So are the objects which produce them ; as grass , tree , horse , . man , mountain , trumpet , army , air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties , constitute the elements of knowledge . By working on them , through its reflecting faculties , which are of a higher order , and which operate , each according to its nature , the mind forms from them other ideas of a more complex , subtle , and abstract character . To represent these , corresponding nouns or names are invented , and make a part of language . Some of these are as follows : like unlike , likeness , unlikeness , difference , identity , whiteness , blackness , virtue , vice , right , wrong , cause , effect , and many others . The formation of abstract ideas being one of the highest operations of the mind , the existence of the abstract terms , by which they are expressed , gives evidence of a corresponding degree of perfection in speech . Hence rude and igno .. rant nations have but few abstractions . Inasmuch then as language not only presents a picture of the external world , as it appears to the mind , but gives also a representation of the various faculties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degree of their general discipline , and the extent of their opera .. tions , it follows , that its copiousness and perfection must correspond to the mental cultivation of the people who speak it . In plainer terms , the richer a people are in knowledge , the more numerous and abstract are their ideas , and the more copious , refined , and perfect is their language . While this influence is deducible from first principles , its truth is established by observation . Nor will it be denied , that the more perfect and copious a language is , the more invigorating and improving is the exercise , which the study of its structure and philosophy affords to the mind . Much of the mental discipline imparted by this exercise arises from the investigation of concord , government , and structure ; and they are common to every language . The correctness of the foregoing principles , generally , will not he controverted . Suppose , then , a comparison , in conformity to them , be instituted between the Greek or the Latin , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophical study ? Will the English be found inferior to the others ? No color of reason is perceived for thinking so ; but rather the reverse . Its fundamental principles are the same , its structure is as good , and its superior copiousness is striking . Nor is it inferior in force , correctness , variety , precision , or elegance of expression . If the faculties of pupils are at any // time more severely exercised , in studying Greek or Latin , than in studying English or French , it is because they are more puzzled to detect the meaning of the former than of the latter . But such puzzling is neither pleasant nor instructive . On the contrary , it fatigues the mind , without improving it , and often produces an aversion from learn .. ing . All things considered , we feel convinced , that no mental faculty is disoiplined and strengthened , by studying Greek and Latin , which may not be as profitably trained , and as highly invigorated , by the study of English and French , provided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite extent . The misfortune is , and we might add , the fault is , that in most colleges in the United States , where days are devoted to the cultivation of a knowledge of the ancient languages , kours are not given to the real study of our mother tongue . To read a few books , at times very loosely , and scarcely ever critically , and write a few formal exercises in English , is not the way to become versed , as every educated American ought to be , in the English language . It is not the way to study it , and gain a philosophical knowledge and a full command of it in writing and speaking . Yet , in most of our seats of learning , but little more is done to ripen English scholars . We are acquainted with no institution , whether academy , college , or university , where the pupils are thoroughly disciplined in English ,  --  none where they are called on to master it completely as a branch of philosophy , and reduce their knowledge of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know that no such institution exists in the United States ; and we believe that none such exists in Great-Britain . The result is often manifested by literary wants , peculiarly discreditable to our systems of instruction . We have seen many college graduates , who could translate Greek and Latin with considerable fluency , and even write and converse in them , whose knowledge of English literature was so radically defective , that they could not compose a decent letter . Their deficiency was striking even in the spelling of common words . We could name an individual , who has been a Professar in one college , and a President elect of three others , if not four , of whom this is true ! He is ignorant alike of the construction and orthography of his mother tongue ! And yet he is a Greek and Latin scholar ! On the contrary , many a boarding*school girl , who is a stranger to ancient literature , speaks and writes the English language with fluency arid correctness . Why * because she has been exercised in it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical command of it can ever be acquired ; and it can be thus acquired , without a knowledge of any other language : * It can not be denied , that , in one respect at least , the study of Greek and Latin has been injurious . It has prevented the actual and thorough study of English . The ground on which it has done this is obvious . Latin and Greek are the ancient and classical , and , Iherefore , reputedly the superior languages . A knowledge of them , therefore , is comparatively an object of high ambition . Hence they are stsrdicd . Not so with English . It is a modern , every-day language , a knowledge of which is neither an object of ambition , nor a point of honor or pride . II *nce , instead of being studied , it is simply reed . And , while the ancient languages are taught by men of t lepis and cultivation , in handsome and even magnificent emlifices , it is preteedcd to be taught in log cabins , by men who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We repeat , without fear of being put in the wrong , that this neglect of English , and the low estimation , in which the study of it is held by lime public , is to be attributed chiefly to the attachment of too mmach importance to an acquaintance with Greek and Latin . Trrme , this state of things is passing away ; and may it pass speedily ! The elm . oge , within the present century , is great , and all for the better . In most , we believe in . Ii the respectable seats of learning of our comantry , the cultivation of the English 1 nguage is improving . Still , however , it is every where much below what it ought to be , and what we trust it will be , by the middle of the // The writings of the ancients have long ceased to be a source of science . All their most valuable historical matter is alsotranslated into some of the living languages , especially intoEnglish . It . has been shown , moreover , that the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil a degree of exercise more improving than the thorough study of a modern tongue . Whatever advantages , then , may result from a knowledge of the ancient classics , belong to literature alone . Science , we say , disclaims them . Shall we be told , that an acquaintance with them prepares the mind better for the reception of science , general and professional , than any other sort of attainment ? The friends of this notion , long as it has prevailed , and almost universal as it is , ought not to be surprised , if , on being placed in the balance , it should be found wanting . But , before weighing it , we must examine one or two other arguments , urged by the Committee , in favor of the study of Greek and Latin . When speaking of the study of modern lailguages , they say " If the . languages and literature of Italy , France , and Spain , beyond what is merely superficial , is an object with the student , they should be acquired through the Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as experience affords the means of judging , that it is the most expeditious mode of acquiring a familiarity with the languages in question . " In the sentiment here advanced , we can not concur . Reason , observation , experience , and every other consideration bearing on it , unite in persuading us that it is unfounded . We acknowledge the close family alliance between Latin , Italian , French , and Spanish , the former being the parent tongue . But we know that , by the adoption arid steady pursuit of the proper course , a " familiarity " with the three last can be acquired , not only without the aid of the first , but in a period not longer , if so long , as that requisite to the attainment of a similar " familiarity " with the first alone . Latin , as usually studied , can not be mastered in less than three years . Few students can become really " familiar " with it even in that time . Yet , in the same period , a youth of common capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spanish , as to speak and write them with fluency and correctness . We say this can be done , because we know it has been done . Might we speak of our personal experience , we would say , that we knew something of Latin , when we stu.died the modern tongues ; yet we were insensible of any facilities derived from the attainment ; except as related to our knowledge of language in the abstract , and some experience and tact we had gained in learning it ; and that might have been acquired from the study of any languagewe mean tho study of it philosophically . Some of our fellow-students , who had no knowledge of Latin , and who were not accounted more apt than ourselves in learning languages , formed an acquaintance with French , Italian , and Spanish , very near as readily as we did , and seemed ; in a short time , to understand them as thoroughly . We becentury . We shall only add , that those , whose native tongue is English , should make it a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly , hilt to give to it the high standing , in the estimation of the world , to which it is entitled . And this can he done only hy making it a subject of serious study . That heing effected , English will he no longer astep-child in our arademies , colleges , and universities . The ancient languages will be no 1on*er pormitted to overshadow it , and triumph in its degradation . // lieve some of the best French and Italian teachers in the United States , prefer that their pupils should not have learned Latin . The female academies in our country furnish a strong argument in support of our Views on this suhject. rrheir pupils are strangers to Latin ; yet they learn French and Italian with more facility , and as much accuracy , as most of our youths at college . When about to advance the sentiment we are now considering , the Committee would have done well to have remembered the Law maxim , Quad probat nimis , probat nihil . They certainly attempted to prove too much in favor of classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of it is " the most e peditious mode of acquiring a familiarity with Italian , French , and Spanish " - thus alleging , if we understand their meaning , that a youth can attain a knowledge of Latin and French , Latin and Italian , or Latin and Spanish , in a shorter time than he can learn either of the three modern languages alone We shall only add , that scores of individuals might be named , who , without having ever looked into a Latin author , have acquired a knowledge of " the languages and literature of Italy , France , and Spain , " far " beyond what is merely supe'rftcial . " Can a foreigner ,  --  say a Frenchman or a German ,  --  attain , through a familiarity with Greek and Latin , a more thorough and commanding knowledge of English , thart an American or an Englishman can , without Greek and Latin , but completely disciplined in his native tongue ? An affirmative answer to this question would be alike inconsistent with reason and experience . Nor can an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect an acquaintance with French , as a Parisian can without it . One extract more , and we shall have done with the pamphlet . " We are the people , ( say the Committee ) the genius of whose government and institutions , more especially and imperiously than any other , demands that the field of classical learning be industriously and thoroughly explored and cultivated , and its rich productions gathered . The models of ancient literature , which are l ) ut into the hands of the young student , can hardly fail to imbue his mind with the principles of liberty ; to inspire the liveliest patriotism , and to excite to noble and generous action , and are therefore peculiarly adapted to the American youth . To appreciate justly the character of the ancients , the thorough study and accurate knowledge of their classics , in the language of the originals , is indispensable ; as the simplicity , energy , and striking peculiarities of these pristine exemplars of freedom , which are forcibly and beautifully displayed in their models of classical literature , are scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than are the warmth , animation , and intellectual illumination of the living , active , and intelligent being , in the sculptured imitation of the statuary. ** This is the most exceptionable paragraph we have quoted . It has much more of rant than reason in it . Some people will call it eloquent ; and its author perhaps intended to make it so . We call it declamatory , frothy , and erroneous ; while plainness , solidity , and truth are essential to eloquence . It is a tissue of assertion , unsupported by a tittle of proof . It is equally extravagant in language and sentiment . Whoever dreamed before of deriving from the writings of the ancients , either sparks to kindle , or breath to fan , the fires of freedom and patri // otism in modern bosoms ? As well might the fancy have been indulged of brightening and swelling the blaze of Moscow , by a farthing rush-light , when the conflagration was at its height . We venture to say , that for every single paragraph breathing a spirit of rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece and Rome , one thousand are contained in the works of British , American , and other modern writers . Nor , on this subject , did the moderns borrow from the ancients . The reason is plain . The latter had little or nothing to lend . The former , therefore , looked into themselves , and into the reason and nature of things , and found there the treasures they sought . And , as to patriotism , the uncultured Caledonians of old , and the Swiss peasants , at a later period , displayed as much of it , as ever the Greeks or Romans did . And so would the uncultured Irish now , were they in a condition to do so . Was it ancient literature that taught and emboldened the barons of England to extort from their monarch their Magna Charta ? No : such was their want of scholarship that they could scarcely read the instrument , when prepared . Some of them could not read at all . Yet that single charter contains more of the genuine principles of freedom and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could boast . Were the American patriots better versed in ancient literature than any other people , when they asserted and achieved their independence ? Many who bad never opened a Latin dictionary , and who were strangers to the Greek alphabet , acted distinguished parts on that occasion . Be the cause what it may , the An*lo-Saxons and their descendants have long understood , and understand at present , what salutary freedom is , much better than any other people . The Greeks and Romans might have derived useful lessons fmm them , on that subject . Nor is it true that a spirit of freedom and patriotism has prevailed in European countries , in proportion to the prevalence of classical knowledge . We do not say that the reverse of this is true ,  --  though facts somewhat favorable to such a position might be adduced ; but we do say , that it is a knowledge of nature , not of Greek and Latin , which teaches man his rights. * We shall only add , that , in the Mississippi Valley , where classical literature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pure and pervasive , and the love and knowledge of freedom as fervid and correct , as in any other portion of the globe-much more so than they ever were in Greece or Rome . Nor can we subscribe to the belief , however general , and however often and dogmatically asserted , that it is impossible to infuse into an English translation the spirit , force , and fire of an ancient Greek or Roman composition . Or , if an impossibility of the kind exist , it is because the original production is not fully comprehended and felt . And if the disciplined translator can not become thoroughly master of * There is a much greater am mt of classical learning in Germany , than in any other equal portion of the globe . Why then have not the Germans to ken a lead in the overthrow of despotism , the assertion of human right , and the establis ment of freedom ? Why , on the contrary , do they calmly tolerate the sway of one of the most despotic governments of Enrope ? The reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not by the classical tomes of the ancients , but by the hooks of the tooderns-more especially , however , by the book of oature . That chapter of the latter , which gives the true history and philosophy of man , his rights , privileges , and all his relations , contains a hundred-fold more of the spirit of freedom , than all the Greeks and Romans ever wrote . Let the Germans study that , with but half the attention they bestow on ancient literature , and the Austrian and Prussian sceptres will soon be shorn of much of their power . or shattered to pieces . // the original , is it probable that the common reader of Greek and Latin can ? If the better scholar fail , will the worse succeed ? These questions answer themselves . The English is as powerful and expressive a language , *s the Latin or Greek ; and , as heretofore mentioned , it is more copious than either . It is in vain to tell us , then , that when an Englishman or an American fully comprehends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of ancient literature , whether it be prose or verse , and is , at the same time , equal as a writer to the author of it  --  and practice will render him so-it is in vain , we say , to contend , that , under these ciruumstances , a translation may not be rendered equal to the original . If , owing to the peculiarities of different languages , some transient beauties be lost , others may be added , and neither the meaning nor the spirit of the ancient composition be marred . In proof of this , we offer Murphy 's translation of Tacitus , in which we venture to say there are but few , if any passages , where the Roman historian and biographer has suffered in the version . In some , we have thought him improved . Nor do we hesitate to add , that there is not one Greek scholar in a thousand , who , did pride permit him to acknowledge the truth , does not read to more advantage , and with a higher relish , Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true of the translation , by the same English author , of Ovid 's celebrated letter of Sappho to Phaon . In spirit , feeling , and force , the tran lator has surpassed his original . True ; he does not equal him in brevity of expression ; nor , for reasons connected with the two languages , is it possible to render an English translation as brief as a Latin original . But this is the only quality , in which it need be inferior , and it is of but little moment . We shall only add , that the more purely and elegantly one language is written , the more easily and literally can it be translated into another . Hence the great facility of turning the writings *f Voltaire into English . We are axvare of the prejudice arrayed against us , on this subject . But we are unmoved by it , and fearlessly state what we believe , in defiance of it . We therefore repeat , that an English scholar , who is an able and accomplished writer , can , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Greek or Latin composition , matter and spirit , into his mother tongue . And , unless the scholar , who reads it in the original , thus comprehends and feels it , he does not enjoy it , and is not benefited by it , as the Committee allege he is . What advantage does he derive from visions of beauty floating in his mind , which he is unable to express in his own tongue ? They neither enrich , strengthen , nor refine him , as a writer or a speaker . They are mere mental lumber , and therefore unavailable , if not prejudicial . But the truth is , that the whole matter is but a fancy . Whatever r* scholar clearly understands , no matter from what source it is derived- .. the study of Greek and Latin , or the study of nature-he can communicate clearly and forcibly , provided he is a forcible thinker , and has made himself master of his native language . In contending , then , that an individual can be delighted and benefited , by the beauties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unable to transfer those beauties , and use them in a living language , the Committee appear to us to have contradicted themselves . In such a case , there // is no delight or improvement , without actual possession of what delights and improves ; and , if possessed , the beauty can be translated , to delight and improve others. * To us , the opinion of the Committee seems equally unfounded when they assert , that , " to appreciate justly the character of the ancients , the thorough study and accurate knowledge of their classics , in the language of the originals , are indispensable . The mere knowledge of a language , and of the number , form , and powers of the letters in which it is written , ghre but a very limited acquaintance with those who speak it . It is the literature and the history of a people that disclose their character . And , as respects the ancients , access can now be had to these two sources of information , without a knowledge of their language . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter it contains , which has not been translated . And , indeed , not a few have been translated , that have no intrinsic value . To call them curious , is to give them their full meed of praise . There is enough written in English , or translated into it , to communicate to those , who will study it correctly , as intimate an acquaintance with the ancients , in every matter and relation worth knowing , as the most accomplished Hellenists and Latinists of the day have . To contend , then , that to gain a knowledge of the Greeks or Romirns , in their manners , persons , customs , civil and household economy , or any thing else of moment , we must study their languages , is a mistake . As well may it be said , that to attain a knowledge of the Russians or Laplanders , we must study their languages , instead of reading well-written histories of them . Some of the best-informed Grecian and Roman antiquarians we have seen , knew nothing of the dead languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English publications , original or translated . Shakspeare , though nnversed in the languages of the Greeks and Romans , had an intimate * It would be well for those , who believe in the incommunicable beauties and delights inherent in Greek and Latin composition , to endeavor to ascertain how much of those qualities are in the seatimeat , and how much in the souad . The sonorousness and euphony of Greek and Latin are much superior to those of English . Of this , every classical scholar must be sensible . Hence much of the delight derived from reading them , is the deiight of harmonious musical sound-especially when the sound is an " echo to the sense . " We say " harmonious cound ; " for such is generally the exquisite order and arrangement of the words , that , if they be altered , much of the beauty of the passage is marred , and an equal amount of the pleasure of reading it dissipated . This may he illustrated and proved by time following quotations " F oritus ctamasrque eirfmm clangsrqae tubarum " - an exquisitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the words be transposed into their natural order , " Cia srquevis-tem claagerqae tabassoa exsrit r , " and more than half the beauty is gone . " Stat asaipes , ac frceaa fersx spamaatia maadit . " " Ferax ssaipes stat , ac maadit umhatia free * " Iatsaa e poli et crebris micat i aibus cether . " " Poti iatsaeure et the , micat retina igaibus. ** Every one must perceive thatthe beauty of the two latter ho 5i5 equally destroyed , bychanging the artificial to the natural arrangement of their words . Of Greek and Latin composition generally the same is true . The only object of transposition in it , is herph'Ony and harmony , or the improvement of sound . In English cossspesitioo , much is already done , and more may bedone , in the same way . There is also a reason , why we fanty more beaMty io Greek tend Latin composition , than we really p ceive . We do not in general pesfectly usmderstaad it . A sort of shadowy dimness hangs over its meaning . And every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sublimity . This it does , by giving more play and wider scope to the eimhagination . The beauty of a omoonlight scene is much improved , by the fleecy rack , which flits across the heavens . Once more . Classical scholars are proud of their attainments . They , therefore , feel a selfish enjoymentin persuading themselves that they have access to rich fountains of pleasure , in their knowledge of Greek and Latin , from which the uninitiated are excluded . And it is a law of human nature , that men can so far realize their wishes , as to believe ultimately what they are anxious to believe . Such are some of the chief reasons , why it is contended , that the beauty and spirit of Greek and Latin composition are necessarily lost in a translation . // acquaintance with their characters , customs , manners , and literature . Yet , since his time , translations have been greatly multiplied and extended , and original works on those points written ; and hence the same amount of knowledge , which lie had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
