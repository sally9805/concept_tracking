txt Do those whose business confines them to cities properly appreciate the influence of rural objects ? Are not the tastes and characters of children in no inconsiderable degree affected by prospects habitually present to their sight ? Who , that was born in the country , has not his earliest recollections connected with the feelings of delight , with which he hailed the approach of spring , with its ten thousand cheering attendants ? and the aspect of nature blooming and smiling around him in the freshness of her spring-time and his-has it done hardly less to melt and mould his young heart , and to infuse generous and tender sentiments which have had a lasting influence upon his character , than did the unwearying and judicious kindness of the child 's earliest friend , his mother ? May not natural objects , in their vastness , simplicity , and beauty , be made a much more efficient instrument in education than is supposed ? We read books as much for the feelings which they produce , as the information which they impart , and the cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of the intellect , is of no less importance . But in the whole world of nature , among the infinitude of her more finished or stupendous works , there is nothing , which has not a tendency to call forth our better feelings , to purify and elevate the soul . When , therefore , from a partial intercourse with man , we find in ourselves a disposition to narrow the sphere of our sympathies , to become selfish or sordid in our views , may we not avert the danger , and be taught to look rightly upon the concerns of business , which necessarily occupy so much of the time , by occasionally going abroad , viewing the magnificent " handy-work " of the supreme Architect , and giving ourselves up entirely to the impulse of our emotions ? My native village is situated in the middle of a valley , which is hemmed in by mountains on all sides but one , and there hills rise above hills till the eye can reach no farther , so that the river which flows through it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The breadth of the valley is about sixteen miles ; the length , from the extreme points of visionenorth and south is perhaps thirty . Within these enclosures , firm enough and high enough for walls to Milton 's Paradise , I was confined seventeen years , having never had so much as a glimpse of the land beyond . With what feelings of wonder and delight did I first ascend the highest peak , and on one side gaze upon mountains an hundred miles distant , and on the other side view the ocean which lay like a dead mist at hardly a less distance in the eastern horizon , while shining lakes diversified the country in my more immediate neighborhood , and forests beyond forests , in the giddy depths below , lay like rich carpets to give yet greater variety to the prospect . I have this summer stood upon the same heights . Clouds , thick , dark and threatening gathered at my feet . From my lofty elevation I looked down upon the lightning , and heard the thunders , mustering their rage , roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hackneyed . Some things may be felt as if endowed with all the // charms of novelty ; but , the moment they are dressed in words , the spell is broken , and their power gone . I have often admired the tranquil majesty of the man who has risen above the stormy and tempestuous contests of life , and , with calm unconcern , looks down upon them , while his soul is fixed on higher objects , and refreshed by higher hopes ; but never , never did I understand his condition as I ought , till I stood above the clouds , and , while the storm below was raging with almost unprecedented fury , felt my brow cooled by the inspiring breezes that fanned the mountain tops , and my sight cheered by the pure , azure depths of heaven above me and around . The evening that I arrived at home-for so must I call this valleythe mountains on all sides were on fire . I ascended a small hill from which the view of the valley was perfect . Innumerable little flames were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , whose foliage in that , early spring-time , was not sufficiently dense to shut out the prospect , but , as the branches slightly waved in the air , gave a fugitive aspect to the distant fires . The little birds had not yet finished their evening song , which was occasionally broken in upon by the clear pipes of a numerous amphibious choir , and the whole atmosphere was scented with the balmy fragrance of the season . I could hardly believe that I was not surrounded by beings of another world . The wandering flames , the enchanting voices , the solitude and retirement of the place ;  --  and while I was musing the moon arose , and forcing her way through the crowded limbs of an aged tree , her full orb broken into many fragments of blazing fire , all changing forms and places with the motion of the branches , so contributed to the effect , that reason for a moment was silent , the illusion was complete ; and , with almost the enthusiasm of an ancient bard , I was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iun* Juncta*que Nymphs Gratin decentes Alterno terrain quatiunt pedes .

The bowels of the earth and recesses of the forest had not yet been explored by the keen eye of scepticism . The beds of rivers and their secret sources were untouched . Little was known . The causes of phenomena the most common were not yet ascertained . A deep mystery hung over all the works of creation , and imagination alone could dare to tell what beings , agents , and powers were hid beneath its ample veil . Their souls were alive to every new impulse . They did not borrow impressions from books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sur * Runs hic erunt puella , lEt puell fontium QAmreque sylvas , quaque lucos , tltureque iriontes incolunt Seos. // rounded by unknown objects , the nature , character , and design of which were not yet revealed ; and , with their limited experience , it was as natural and as rational to believe in Nymphs , and Fauns , and Dryads , as to believe that there were animals of different species from any yet discovered . They witnessed operations which necessarily implied the intervention of a different order of beings . What wonder then if they should infer that such there were ; and , unacquainted , as they were , with optical delusions , what wonder if , in the glimmering of moonlight , the obscurity of the forest , or the moving mirrors of pellucid streams , they should see the flitting forms of a more ethereal race , and that in time they should worship them as the guardians of their fountains , groves , and streams , as taking a kindly interest in the lot of man , and watching over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred to my mind . The last time I had visited it was on the evening before I left my native town . The tried friend of my childhood was with me . Our hearts beat high with early hopes , which in him were bright and strong , but in me " hardly knew themselves from fears . " We glanced at the past ; our thoughts and words dwelt upon the future . That meeting was our last . The next morning we departed ; - he , full of spirit and expectation , to the far west , the land of promise ; I for the east , with a sinking heart , without money , and almost without hope . I heard from him often . His buoyant spirits gradually sunk as he advanced . The world was less propitious than he had hoped . Each letter was more sombre than the preceding . After stopping at various places , sometimes with scattered friends , but oftener with strangers , he at length reached the great Father of waters , and went with the current to New-Orleans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; but , having partially recovered , he gave up his wandering schemes , and embarked for Boston . But he died on the voyage , the last wish that he expressed being , " that he might only have a cup of water from his father 's well . " The news almost broke his mother 's heart . She has not yet recovered from the stroke , and never will be what she was before . To me it was a severe blow ; for I had always hoped that we should go through life together ; lightening each other 's burdens and cheering each other 's hearts . But his memory survives , and that is perhaps better . I know not but the friends that I have lost-for they are many-are thesource of greater and purer happiness and improvement than those who remain . I hear their gentle voices kindly whispering in the gale , and , in silence and solitude , I feel that I am seen and guarded by their happy spirits . The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those shadowy recollections , Which , be they what they may , Are yet the fountain light of all our day . Last evening I met two of my old play-mates . They were giddy girls when I saw them last . Now , both are wives and mothers ; but not so happy , I fear , as they deserve to be . " Those were joyous times , " said one , as we were talking of our childish sports ; " we were happy then . " " To be sure , " said I , " and happy now , I trust . " // " Yes , " was the reply ; but an involuntary sigh too plainly told that all was not right . Yet her countenance was fresh , and her trouble was not of that kind which makes the heart sick , and knows no hope . But what shall I say of her I saw to-day ? - Anne S. the life of our school , the noisiest , wildest , and most enchanting girl of the village-always foremost in our frolics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in those days , with a depth of enthusiasm and strength of feeling that gained all our hearts . Seven years ago I saw her . She was full of health and lifethe same cheerflil , happy one that I had known at school . Her features were large , you could not say coarse . Her complexion was more roseate than you would choose in any one else-in her you would change nothing . Her air and countenance were of the most engaging sort ; for they bespoke a soul within . What a contrast to the poor shadow that I saw to-day . I called at her abode .. She desired to see me , and I was taken to her room . Grief and anxiety-what ravages had they made ! Before me was a pale , dejected , broken-hearted woman ; and this was all that remained of the ruddy , laughing girl , that I had once known . We talked of old times , of our school-day sports , of our noisy and ludicrous adventures , and she smiled at the recital ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , and could hardly forbear openly to execrate the man , who , with the name of husband , had brought her to that state . I had never seen him . He came a stranger to the place . His form was engaging ; his manners winning ; he gained the affections of the pure-hearted girl , and for a time they lived happily . He was a kind and generous man , but-intemperate . He lingered about for a season ; but , unable to bear the obloquy that was overwhelming him , he left his wife , and no message has returned to tell his fate . He was a kind husband . Well would it have been , as she often says , had he treated her with brutality ; for then her feelings would have been changed towards him . He was always kind , and , no doubt , left her that she might no longer be mortified by the sight of so degraded a being . Weak , foolish man ; he knew not the strength of woman s love ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse , every weakness . But enough . She is now beyond the reach of human aid . The gentle dews that come from heaven-they alone can raise the head of this tender drooping flower , and they can give it but a momentary life  --  a faint revival , ere its beauty and its fragrance have left this world forever . Thy lot here was hard , and I could weep for thee ; but that were unavailing . Say not that facts have created a world of feeling and suffering , that finds no likeness in this active , breathing world that we inhabit ; - say not that their pictures are too highly colored ; that they dream of excellence that has no being ; of sensibilities , that are fragile , evanescent , unsubstantial , as the gay visions that hover around a morning cloud ; of hopes too bright fer man ; of disappointments that go like iron to the soul , and crush its blooming hopes , and poison the deep and pure fountain of its affections . 0 , there are worlds brighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and affections stronger ; and there is suffering , too-there is weariness of spirit , desolation , wretchedness , indeed , when the sun that illumined the bright world of // youthful hopes is darkened , and long-cherished dreams of a happiness too vast for earth , are found to be but dreams-when the bruised reed , to which the young affections have clung with an undying ardor and devotion , has given way , and the heart , deceived in its fondest wishes , finds nothing but hollowness and emptiness for support . They who would have mankind a group of puppets , with a little outward show , hut no inward feeling-they , the worldly-wise , who complain of the false colors of fiction , and who will have it that there is no flesh in man 's obdurate heart-they are themselves the deceivers ; they draw a veil over the secret workings of the soul , and then would have us think that all is calm and quiet there . Yon miserly churl seems to have no thought or wish beyond his gains . I have known him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane-always apparently the same sordid , selfish , unfeeling wretch . But think you that it has cost him no effort thus to efface the image of his Maker-no pang to brand the mark of the beast thus deeply on his forehead ? And now has his conscience no solemn visitations from on high ? Do not his unsatisfied appetite for gain , his insatiate desires even in the height of prosperity , make him more than fear , make him tremble , lest - he has mistaken the whole design of his creation ? Do not his better feelings , which he has taken such pains to smother , sometimes rise with the strength of a stifled volcano , and make him shudder at their power ? He is anything rather than the calm , unfeeling creature that he seems . It is not so easy to sink the man in the brute . James R. is a native here . I have seen him several times this summer . Ask any of his acquaintances respecting his character , and the careless reply will be , " 0 , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an odd thing-as if he were not of the human family , and endowed with the most acute and excruciating sensibilities . A body with every sensitive nerve laid bare , and in the most malignant state of inflammation  --  the body of the man of Uz , with sore boils from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet , and that body constantly scraped with a rough and piercing potsherd ,  --  would be but a fair counterpart to this ma-n 's mind , with the manner in which he is treated . There is nothing remarkable in his history . No one but himself could tell whence came the arrows that have festered so deeply and so sorely in his mind . His father was our minister , and he the young* est son . No pains were taken with his education , and , at an early period , he was thrown loose upon the world , homeless , friendless , and pennyless . With great industry and economy , and no taste for society , he soon acquired property enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had no home ; and the few , who , at different times , have been thought his friends , have uniformly proved deceitful parasites . Hence a distrust of every one , joined to a most mortifying sense of his own littleness . He envies the dog that lies at his feet . No human being so low , or so miserable , that he would not gladly take his place . Yet he is only an odd thing . No one feels for him ; no one thinks of him as unhappy . " lIe has money enough ; his health is good ; he is not obliged to work . " When will the children // of men learn to sympathize with the diseases of the mind ? When will they learn to understand the ills of a broken , wounded spirit ? A few days since , in one of my strolls , I met a boy , who came running to me , and , with a half-comical , half-mysterious air , asked me to guess what he had found in the woods . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A queer crow 's nest . Why , there is a cellar dug right in the middle of the woods , not bigger than a potatoe hole , and Jim R. is going to build a house there . " And the boy laughed heartily ; - so ridiculous did it seem for any one , and above all for Jim R. to build a house so far from all inhabitants and roads . And the boy laughed heartily . Thus , thought I , this unhappy being is , from a want of sympathy on the part of his brethren , driven from the society of his fellows , and forced to take refuge with the beasts . A kind look , an affectionate word in season , might have changed his whole character , and made him a kind and a useful man . But now the wound is inflicted ; the disease has carried its ravages too far . No hand so gentle as to administer consolation or relief ; the kindest breath of affection would but increase the smart of his gangrened , festered spirit . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , more than half a mile from the abode of man , and in the midst of a gloomy pine forest . The house was finished . It consists of but a single room , with cracks in the roof , through which the stars of winter will be seen to shine and twinkle , as he lays upon his couch of straw . The struggles to which that cabin will bear witness , who can tell ? An immortal being resides there ,  --  a being , whose capacity for happiness or misery is almost infinite ; and could but the secrets of his heart be disclosed , could we only be made privy to the silent thoughts that agonize his wounded spirit , could we but know the extent and power of that anguish under which his soul writhes in the utterness of its desolation , the wheel of Ixion , and the vulture of Prometheus , chained as he was upon a desert coast , and the scorpions of the Eumenides , and whatever else of torment and wretchedness poets have embodied in ideal representations , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only an odd thing . But I have gone too far . Glaudite jam - rivos , pueri ; the meadows have drunk enough , and more than enough , of these dark and troubled waters . I have brought together incidents not connected in point of time , and characters which are every where to be found , in order to show that there is in the world more mental suffering than careless observers will allow-suffering arising from a strength , delicacy , and susceptibility of feeling , which have been too often regarded as the exclusive property of " the lunatic , the lover , and the poet . " The lover ,  --  who has not , at some period of his life , perhaps almost in childhood , ere the tender folds of the heart had been crusted over with secretions from the fetid , impure atmosphere of this thronged worldwho has not been a lover , and gazed upon the stars , and felt his bosom swell and his soul expand with hopes and wishes too vast for any other than an immortal spirit ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a delight and satisfaction at other times unknown ? The lunatic-why is he a lunatic ? Why does he " see more devils than vast hell can hold , " unless because the mind has been racked , and tortured , and deranged by its own painful // and tempestuous throes of agony ? Is not the delicate instrument of thought and feeling deranged , because it is so delicate ? Is it not often thrown from its balance , because it was so nicely adjusted ? Has not many and many a mind fallen a prey to the keenness of its own sensibilities ? Has not reason been driven from her throne , because the passions were too violent , or the affections too strong ; - because the heart was too pure and too susceptible for this world of mingled good and ill ? the poet-who is not at times a poet ? Whose eye so dull that it doth never " glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ? " Who exists with mind so contracted , that his imagination never soars above or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Lives there a man who is satisfied with what he sees , and hears , and does ; who is content to dwell here without searching into the mysteries of the past , or without casting an anxious look towards the mists and shadows of the future ; who builds no visionary castles ; who figures to himself no prospects of coming happiness ; who creates in fancy no pictures of the unseen spirits that flit around us , of those unknown fields that lie beyond , of the future world to which we are all hastening for our weal or wo ?

H.@@183068533.txt DEAR I- , IN a former letter , I made some remarks upon the choice of a profession . You may have thought them unnecessary , or , that I did not sufficiently incline to those ambitious vocations , whose excitements and glory are constantly blended with the day-dreams of youth . However that may be , I shall not hesitate to address you again on a similar and not less important subject . The period , at which a young man enters upon the choice , or the study of a profession , is usually that , in which most of the habits and principles of his future life are fixed . Heretofore , you have been under the care of careful guardians ; first those natural protectors , who guarded you , as a precious jewel ; next that other parent , who introduced you to the love of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is all before you , where to choose . " Counsel will be given , the standards of right and wrong will be held up to you , and the path of true glory pointed out ; but , whether you will abide by that course , and those standards , and seek that path to walk in ,  --  is for // you only to determine , and is among " the secrets of your soul . " This , then , is the period of right and wrong decisions . The errors of youth are proverbial ; but , what are the errors of youth ? You may think they are mere peccadilloes ; wrong , to be sure , but easily repented of and worked out . Not so ;  --  the errors of youth lie deeper than slight indulgences : They are mistakes in princziple , and , once tolerated , are hardly corrected , by the reformation and experience of many years . The stream of life is made up of a thousand rills , and those , which swell it and influence it most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be impatient , then , while I point out some of the mistakes of youth . 1 . One of the greatest and most fatal errors of young men is the want of fixed principles of action . " Unstable as water , thou shalt not excel , " was the declaration of the dying patriarch to one , who was yet his " first born and the excellence of his strength . " No matter , whether it concern religion or politics , your business or your pleasures , you must have some certain principle or standard of action , or be a mere float upon the water , at the mercy of wind and waves . It is the want of such fixed principle , which , in spite of genius , acquirements , standing , and advantages , has often destroyed the influence , and tarnished the fame of the greatest intellects , and made them mere ignesfatui ,  --  bright , but erring lights . History has many such exampIes ; but it is chiefly among the more obscure , and disappointed sons of ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions , whether at college or in the world , in whatever rank or profession , and tell me how many of the crowd of unsuccessful candidates for distinction , or of the uninfluential among those , who are distinguished , have ever had any fixed principles , either of morals or of business ? Then turn from these , to those who have arrived at the summits of power and usefulness , or are now advancing to them with steady steps ; and have they no steady purpose , no guiding principle , no criterion of action ? You will observe that I do not mean merely moral principle ,  - -  though that is of infinite consequence ; and I trust there are those around you , who will point you to its genuine source , and lead you to nourish and cultivate it , as a plant of undying root , of lofty branches , and perennial foliage . But , theft edprinciples , I here speak of , as a part of your profession , include much more . They may all , however , be founded on sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neglects his business , or hides his talents , can hardly be called an active though he may be a passive moralist . The principles , I now urge , are rather rules of study , rules of business , and rules of manners , than any particular code of morals ; for , the latter , I know , you m st have to a certain extent in our country , or be , at once , sunk to a level , at which nothing great , nothing pure , or good . or elevated , is ever found . 1 do not mean that you should set down , and write off a set of regulations in your note-book , for the guidance of your conduct , however useful that may be ; for , I well know how fallacious are all such determinations , and how often they are formed only to be broken . Oh ! if all those resolutions we have made for wiser and better conduct , were to rise , and join the crowd of violated laws , and murdered hours , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hold , however , that , // whenever an idea or a principle becomes imbued in the mind , or a sentiment of the heart , it will influence the character and conduct , even when not present in form and language . You may observe it every where in society . One , well acquainted with another , can trace his actions up to their secret springs , through all the ingenious sophistry , with which the intellect has covered them , and when the man hjmself is scarcely conscious of their existence . Now , it is this al3iding impression upon the mind of certain truths in thought and action , which I would have all young men possess . 2 . Another great mistake in the young men of this country is the multiplicity of their studies and employments ,  --  a frittering away of their mind and time . The world contains few admirable Grichtons ,  - -  few of those who can acquire and retain knowledge , upon all subjects , and exercise it equally well , at all times , and upon all occasions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of labor , is constantly taught and illustrated by the mechanic arts . Who would think of being , at once , his own shoemaker , tailor , and carpenter ? Yet would it not be quite as proper , as for a young man to attempt being , at once , lawyer , poet , statesman , musician , linguist , lecturer , and naturalist ? I am aware that much of this mixing up of pursuits , belongs rather to the youth and condition of our country , than to the errors of its inhabitants : Still much also belongs to the latter cause . There is no small disposition to play the charlatan among a people , who pride themselves upon their ready wit and vigorous enterprise , rather than upon any love for abstruse learning , or , deep science . Are there not enough of collateral studies in each profession to occupy the whole time of the student to master them , without taking in the whole circle of the arts and sciences ? And would not the young lawyer or physician be better rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his profession than by sharing it with many others ? Not that he should have no relaxation , or amusement of mind ; but let him seek them in the charms of social life , and the contemplation of nature ; in the graces of conversation , and the cultivation of every good disposition and every useful purpose . These will furnish occupation of mind and heart , in those hours when they seek relief from the urgency of business , or the abstraction of study . They will do more than that ; they will furnish a source of happiness , independent of time , chance , or mutation . But remember that steady perseverance in one pursuit , and towards one object , is essential to success . The human mind has been compared , not improperly , to a burningglass , whose rays are intense , in proportion as they are concentrated . The one burns only , when its light is converged at the focal point , and the other illuminates the world of science , only when it is directed to one object . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is too strong a love of popularity . The love of fame is said to be the master passion of great minds . This may be so , but popularity and fame are widely different . The former is the temporary admiration of men , however unenlightened ; the latter is the enduring tribute paid to greatness , by other nations , and distant generations . The first is the praise , bestowed upon some petty demagogue , who has his hour upon the stage , and is heard of no more ; the last is the reputa // tion of Cato , who , despising the clamors of the populace , yet lives on the records of time , and in the admiration of posterity . The&gt;ne is a falling light , generated in miasm , and fading into mist ; the other is a fixed star , permanent in the heavens , and gazed at*by men , from age to age , and from generation to generation . Popularity is , doubtless , an agreeable thing . It gratifies our vanity . It is easier to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greeted with the smiles of men , and their loud applause is most grateful music to the ears of ambition . But , popularity neither makes right , nor wrong ; neither coins money , nor gives a good conscience ; neither places you higher in the estimation of the wise , nor increases your stock of knowledge . But it does intoxicate the giddy head with a dream of vanity , and tempts its hopes with a vision of power ,  - -  insubstantial and unstable . Popularity is always fleeting , always capricious , always fickle . You have heard of the dangers of the fickle waves . The waves of the people are not less so , than the waves of the ocean . A wind corneth , you know not whence , and raiseth them into tumultuous violence ; then sinks again and leaves a calm , peaceful and safe ; how they rush against this shore* then against that ! now uncover the rock , and now bury it in the mountain billow ! : How frail the strength , how insecure the fate of the bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popularity , which you may seek , and not fear either its blandishments or its caprice . I can express it best by the famous saying of a great man ,  --  Lord Mansfield . " I wish popularity ; but it is that popularity which follows ; not that which is run after . It is that popularity , which , sooner or later , never fails to do justice to th' pursuit of noble ends by noble means . " Such is the praise so ardently desired by all great minds . But it is plain that such a fame rests upon a very different foundation from the temporary applause , which follows the demagogue , or the hero of the day . The latter is not unfrequently , however unconscious he may be of it , the mere Punch of the puppet show , a thing for the populace to applaud , wonder and laugh at , but which soon sinks into contempt and oblivion . Would you have a real , pure , enduring fame ? Then go to the sources of knowledge and virtue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to do good . With these faculties , go forth upon the great theatre of the world . Mingle with your fellow-men in the vocation to which you have been called , and whether your walk be that of literature or science , business or contest , your career will be both useful and brilliant ,  --  your name treasured in the hearts and memories of other generations . 4 . Another of the errors of youth is the indulgence of too sanguine views of life , and , consequently , too bitter disappointments . Perhaps this is not so much an error , as a characteristic of early manhood . Hope and pleasure wait upon the young . Their blood flows swiftly ; health is on the breeze ; their bark is gaily and richly freighted , and every sail is filled . It is not wonderful , that they can not see in the pure and quiet waters , reflectin* every image above , and not concealin* even the coral or the minnow beneath , a shadow of that dark cloud , which to many brings danger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that even the most sanguine youth ought // to have seen enough in the experience of others , and read enough in the book of knowledge , to know that the paths of this world are not always smooth ; nor are they always successfully traversed . Genius and even excellence itself are sometimes neglected , and often toils and trouble are unrewarded . It is true , this is an unusual case . But , how common is it , to see those , who , with good capacity arid opportunities , overrating their talents , or mistaking their profession , or misapplying their time , have expected that reward and applause , which the world thought undeserved , and would not grant ? Those , who are neglected from other causes , will generally be found to have some peculiar characteristics , as a morbid sensibility , or extreme hauteur , which repels the advances of favor and approbation . Against the indulgence of such feelings , and the existence of such manners , guard yourself as you would against poison and the plague . Your intimate friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot the slightest allowance for them . Beware of eccentricity without genius . Beware of holding men in contempt ; in the general , they do not deserve it ; and when they do , remember that the smallest insect has a sting ; and of all things living , human folly is the readiest to seek and inflict vengeance upon its real or supposed enemies . But , I was speaking of too sanguine anticipations . The worst evil of their indulgence is the disappointment in which they result . It is not unusual to see a young man enter upon his profession with high connections , brilliant education , and with a belief that he has but to announce himself , and business will flow from every quarter upon him ; that every contest will be a victory ; that popular favor will shine upon him ; and , in the long distance , he sees his country 's honors courting his acceptance . Now , as objects of ambition , these things are right enough ; but , the difficulty is , that few look at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attained . The aspirant sits in his office ,  --  studies , perhaps , for a time , and then learns to neglect those precious hours , in which he might have acquired an armory of weapons for the warfare of learning and eloquence ; be either scorns the multitude , or seeks their favor by those arts , which place him , at once , on the low level of demagogues and pettifoggers ; time rolls on , and the rush of business passes by his door ; he grows sour , and either laments the peculiarity of his misfortunes , or curses the obstinate malevolence of the vorld . If his desires and thoughts are vulgar , he seeks relief in pleasure and intemperance ; if he be of acute sensibility , and lofty pride , he indulges in a morbid cynicism , which soon turns every feeling of his soul into selfishness within , and bitterness towards the world .
