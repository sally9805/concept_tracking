txt THE flame of ' military ardor once kindled in my breast , I did not long rest satisfied with the subordinate station of a private soldier ; indeed , I was scarcely able to go through the manual excercise , before I began to aspire to the supreme command of the Applesbury Light Infantry . Happily for my desires , as Captain Doggett and Ensign Barnicoat were one day mowing in the meadows , the captain received a severe wound in the leg , from the ensign 's scythe , which threatened to make him a cripple for life , and obliged him to resign his commission . Here was a fine field open to my efforts . The captain of the company , by virtue of our wise and excellent militia laws , was to be chosen by the vote of the members ; and every private soldier ,  - -  myself among the rest ,  --  might lawfully aspire to that high honor . It was true that Tom Ileeltap , the shoemaker , and our first lieutenant , considered himself sure of the election , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unheard of : , to proceed in any other way than by regular promotions . But it so happened , that Mr. Heeltap , had rendered himself obnoxious to a certain portion of the company , by his behavior at a military ball the previous winter ; having been guilty of decided rudeness towards the wife of Ensign Barnicoat , a very pretty and high-spirited woman , who ruled her husband with a strong hand , and would give him no peace , night nor day , till something could be done to avenge her on the lieutenant . Ensign Barnicoat had a strong party in the company , composed of his own and his wife 's friends , who proposed , at first , to put him in captain over Heeltap 's head . But the ensign , being of a meek and quiet disposition , and more accustomed ,  --  by force of domestic discipline ,  --  to obey than to command , was reluctant to take upon himself such high responsibilities , and eagerly listened to me , when I proposed to join his party , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and the hereditary respect which wa* felt for me , as the only son and representative of Major Ben Burdock , gave me great advantages ; and , to allow the citizens of Applesbury all due credit , notwithstanding that old , and generally true saying , that a prophet has no honor in his own country ,  --  my fellow soldiers certainly began to have some glimpses , however obscure , of that great military genius with which nature had endowed me , and which I afterwards displayed ,  --  on many a muster field ,  --  so much to their honor and my own . The week previous to the election , I was busy enough . I took care to shake hands , at least once a day , with every member of the company , whether I supposed him my friend or not ; and every evening , at the bar-room of the village tavern , facetiously named the Applesbury Hotel , I delivered the most energetic and spirited discourses , on the great importance of maintaining the militia system , in its then highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hearers , that were it not for the Applesbury Light Infantry , and their unceasing exertions to preserve the public tranquility , the whole commonwealth , in ten days , would fall into a state of utter confusion . My learned disquisitions on tactics , with which I used to wind off the // evening , and criticisms on the manwuvring of the company at their last training , . ivon mightily on the hearts of my fellow-soldiers . I have even sometimes flattered myself that Marianne Fairservice did not omit to use some influence in my behalf ; at any rate , her father 's hired man gave me his vote ; and when the day of election caine , I found myself chosen commander by a majority of ten . No words can adequately express the exultation that swelled my heart , at this sudden and high promotion . Instead of marching along in the middle of a crowd , unnoticed , undistinguished , and unknown , to be thus brought out into public view ,  --  put forward at the head of the company , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys and girls in the town , the cynosure of all eyes  --  the " military chieftain " of Applesbury ,  --  ah ! you , . who have never drank of glory 's intoxicating draughts ! you , who have never felt the extatic throbbings which swell , with almost overpowering delight , the heart of a militia captain when he marches through the town the first time after his election ! - it is in. vain for your cold imaginations and placid souls to attempt to form the slightest idea of what I felt , on the occasion of my first promotion . As soon as the election was over , I hurried the company off to Sergeant Mulligrub 's grocery ,  --  cafled for two quarts of Santa Croix , and as much brandy , two water pails , and half a dozen pounds of sugar , and put the talents of the sergeant , who had the reputation of being the best mixer of grog in the whole country , into immediate requisition . In those days there were no temperance societies , and we all drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaked our thirst , than I addressed the company in the following speech-which I insert for the benefit of such of my readers , as may hope to be chosen captains of companies , assuring them that they can not possibly better it , but will do well to learn it by heart , and speak it verbatim on the day of their election . FELLOW SOLDIERS ! On an occasion like this , called by your votes , to the command of the Light Infantry , permit me to express ,  --  feebly , indeed , but in the best terms I can command ,  --  my profound gratitude for the honor you have done me , and my exalted sense of the duties and responsibilities of my station . The militia , gentlemen , is the bulwark of our country ; the sole and single rampart that repels the tempestuous waves of foreign invasion , and domestic insurrection , which , were they not daunted by the flaming brightness of your swords , and terrified at the fearful aspect of your array of bristling bayonets , held by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our wives and children , and sweep away every vestige of our free institutions . Gentlemen , I hope you are conscious , that strict discipline , and unhesitating obedience , are absolutely essential to military efficiency ; and , I most beg of you , gentlemen , however you are pleased to consider me , in the ordinary intercourse of life , your equal and boon companion , to recollect that the moment my epaulets are on , I am your commander , and you my soldiers . This , I know , is a tender point , and I will not insist further upon it at present . Gentlemen , there is some grog yet left in the pails ; let us drink once round to the Applesbury Light Infantry This speech was received with great applause , though that part of it which touched upon obedience , made some of the men cry Pshaw ! and others laugh outright . I took good care , however , to hear neither their pshaws , nor their laughter . The truth is , that if there be any defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which . indeed , I shall be the last person in the world to admit ,  --  it consists in the small degree of respect , which , by the customs of the militia , an officer can require , // or the men will yield . This , to be sure , is a matter of but little consequence to great military geniuses like inyself , to whom the citizen soldiers pay a sort of involuntary respect ; but I have often seen your common-place captains put to their wit 's end to make their men obey them . But this is a digression . The election took place in the month of August , and was soon followed by the company training , preliminary to the regimental review . It is not my intention to dwell upon this training , as I must hasten on to greater things . I will only say , therefore , that the day passed off without any considerable incident ; except , that as ill luck would have it , just before Mr. Fairservice 's door , the company was thrown into sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a drove of oxen . However , notwithstanding this accident , Miss Fairservice allowed , that Captain Doggett himself could not have mano*uvred the company better ; and , to tell the truth , it was nothing but my uncommon presence of mind , in ordering the company to " form parallel lines with a space between em , " and so letting the cattle pass through , that saved us from suffering some serious loss . The regimental muster was now approaching . The companies were ordered to assemble at Ragamuffin Plain , and it was currently reported that two or three regiments were to meet there , and that there was to be a great sham fight . I recollected , that , hitherto , my military reputation had not extended beyond the limits of Applesbury , and , considering that here was an opportunity of distinguishing myself in the face of the whole county , I resolved that it should not pass unimproved . I instilled some of my own ardor into my company , and every day drilled such of the men as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true art of loading and firing in double quick time . The eventful day caine ; and though Ragamuffin Plain was at least fifteen miles distant from Applesbury , my company was on the field by five o'clock in the morning . I pass by the review and other prelirninary matters , and hasten on to the sham fight . There were two regiments mustered together , and one was to be fitted against the other . Colonel Timothy Blazeaway , with the regiment under his command , was stationed near the top of Booby Hill , which slopes gradually down upon Ragamuffin Plain ; he was strongly entrenched behind a brush fence ; and Colonel Napthali Eatemall , to whose regiment I belonged , was to attack him , and drive him from his entrenchments ; for the colonels had cast lots for the honor of the victory , and the lucky lot had fallen to our regiment . The regiment was drawn up in two columns , and my company was placed at the head of the left column ; midway between the enemy and ourselves , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong battery occupied by the enemy ; but , as all their companies were necessary to fill their lines at the top of the hill , the battery was served by an imaginary battalion . It was impossible to attack Colonel Blazeaway , without first carrying this battery , and my company was detached for this purpose . My heart beat hard , at the thoughts of such dangerous service ; but , repressing all emotions of fear , I gave the order to trail arms , and pushed boldly forward at the head of my company . The imaginary VOL. ii . // battalion , that occupied the fancied battery , was supposed to keep up a most incessant and tremendous fire of grape and cannister ; but , undismayed and undaunted , I rushed on through the fire , and , after a desperate struggle , carried the battery at the point of the bayonet . Colonel Blazeaway immediately detached two companies of grenadiers to dislodge me , but , our regiment advancing , they were obliged to fall back without effecting their purpose . I now took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Colonel led us up within an hundred yards of the enemy , under a tremendous fire of artillery and small arms , and ordered the columns to deploy . The regiments stood firing at each other till they had spent all their cartridges , when the word was given to assault the enemy 's entrenchments . Having now become accustomed to the smell of powder , and my blood being heated , and my spirits raised , I rushed forward , sword in hand , followed by my company . We soon succeeded in making a breach in Farmer Cornstalk 's brush fence , and were rushing forward , in full pursuit of the enemy , when , too intent upon the battle , I ran against a scrub oak , and made a grievous rent in my regimental breeches . Though thus severely wounded , I was too full of fight to leave the field , and , binding up my leg with a red silk handkerchieg , I rallied my men , and continued the battle . The brush fence had , by this time , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous arrangement , Colonel Blazeaway and his troops were bound to take to their heels ; and so they all did , except Captain Smashem , the blacksmith , who commanded the Rantipole Sharpshooters , and whose place in the line was just opposite to mine . Enraged at the flight of his comrades , when I hinted to him that it was time for him to run , too , he set his arms akimbo , swore he would not budge a step , and challenged me and my company to a round of fisticuffs . Captain Smashem was a stout , brawny blacksmith , and I was but a stripling ; but , angry that he did not run away agreeably to contract , I accepted his challenge at once , threw down my sword , and stood on my defence . The men of both companies imitated our example . They threw aside their guns , and , squaring up to each other , began to turn the sham fight into earnest . I had a confused vision of hard knocks , and bloody noses , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk to the ground beneath the blows of Captain Smashem . When I came to my senses , I found myself in the colonel 's tent , with half the officers of the regiment standing about me . The surgeon was bathing my temples , and the chaplain ,  --  kind soul ! - was pinning together the fragments of my new uniform coat , which hung about my shoulders in most lamentable tatters . Every voice was loud in the praises of my invincible courage , and I was told that my men had done themselves the greatest honor , not one in ten having escaped without a black eye or a bloody nose . The Sharpshooters had been surrounded by the other companies and compelled to surrender at discretion . Captain Smashem was immediately put under arrest , and threatened with the double visitation of a Court Martial and an indictment for an assault and battery . For myselg-my eyes were so swollen that I could scarcely see , and my nose was pretty much beat to pieces . My new uniform was quite ruined , my feather spoiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 recollected that such is the fortune of war , and comforted myself with the thought of the glory I had acquired ; and this sham fight on Booby Hill , which some of my kind readers may think I had little cause to rejoice in , eventuated , as I will presently show , in my being chosen colonel of the regiment .
